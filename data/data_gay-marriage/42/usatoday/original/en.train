Gov. Matt Bevin hailed former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis for standing up for religious liberty when she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nBut now his lawyers say she should foot the bill for nearly $225,000 in legal fees incurred by couples who successfully sued her in 2015 for refusing to follow the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling establishing a right to gay marriage.\n\nIn a dispute over fees to be argued Thursday at the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, Bevin's outside counsel, Palmer G. Vance II, says Davis' local policy defied the unequivocal mandate issued by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe local policy also undermined the commonwealth of Kentucky's interest in upholding the rule of law, Vance wrote in a brief. As a result, the Commonwealth cannot bear liability for any attorneys' fees related to challenges to the legality of this local policy.\n\nRead more:Kim Davis tacked right on gay marriage, but the right didn't want her\n\nYou'll like:LGBT folks had few protections 20 years ago. How Louisville created a haven\n\nA federal district judge in 2017 held that the couples suing Davis for marriage licenses clearly prevailed and that the state of Kentucky must pay their fees and costs. Bevin appealed that ruling, seeking to shift the bill to the Rowan County Clerk's Office. Davis acted alone, without any state support, the governor's lawyers said.\n\nBevin once called Davis an inspiration ... to the children of America.\n\nIn a statement, his general counsel, Steve Pitt, said Bevin doesn't believe Davis acted unconstitutionally and continues to support her actions.\n\nPitt said outside counsel, hired by former Democrat Gov. Steve Beshear's administration, have taken no position on whether she acted unconstitutionally.\n\nStill, Pitt said: The federal court has held that she violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights and that the state must pay the ACLU legal fees incurred as a result. Our outside counsel have only argued, given the court's ruling, that if constitutional rights were violated, the taxpayers of Kentucky are not responsible to pay the ACLU's attorney fees.\n\nMore:Bevin says we're soft on kids. Let's freeze them and toughen them up\n\nWatch:Bevin made a remark about Kentucky school closings. Twitter responded\n\nDavis' lawyer, Roger Gannam, said in a brief that the state should bear the fees because marriage licensing is a quintessentially and exclusively state-level function in Kentucky.\n\nIn an email, Gannam said that the governor's office, as well as Davis and Rowan County, agree that the ACLU shouldn't be awarded any attorney fees; he said the disagreement is about who should have to pay them if the appeals court upholds the award. Davis individually is not on the hook for fees, he said.\n\nIn the governor's brief, filed in May, Vance said Davis had an independent and sworn duty to uphold the law as an elected county officer. If fees are awarded, they must be the responsibility of the Rowan County Clerk's Office, which should be deterred from engaging in conduct that violates civil rights – and leads to costly litigation.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court's same-sex marriage decision, Davis said she held religious objections to gay marriage and no longer would grant the marriage licenses in Rowan County. Her protest became international news when U.S. District Judge David Bunning jailed her for several days for contempt of court.\n\nUltimately, she agreed to a compromise allowing one of her deputies who had no objections to issuing a modified marriage license to anyone who wanted it. Later, the state legislature removed county clerks' names from Kentucky marriage licenses.\n\nDavis was defeated in November, losing to challenger Elwood Caudill.\n\nRelated:Kim Davis to enter Christian ministry after election loss, lawyer says\n\nSee also:Who is Elwood Caudill?

Jayme Deerwester\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDancing With the Stars fans may have been expecting Nancy Kerrigan to pick 1994 as her most memorable year during Monday's emotional show.\n\nAfter all, that was the year when the figure skater battled back from a knee injury (caused by someone acting on behalf of U.S. rival Tonya Harding) to win silver at the Lillehammer Olympics. But they were off by a year. Kerrigan chose to focus on the aftermath of those Olympics, specifically her struggles to grow a family with her husband and agent Jerry Solomon and the heartache that followed.\n\nIn a follow-up interview that aired Wednesday on Good Morning America, the two-time Olympian discussed the impact having six miscarriages in eight years had on her psyche and her relationship.\n\nIt's devastating and it's so hard on your marriage, she told ABC News' Abbie Boudreau. You think, 'What's wrong with me?'\n\nShe said she blamed herself, reasoning, People have babies every day. This is such a natural thing. Why would I keep losing a baby? What did I do (wrong)?\n\nKerrigan's journey into motherhood started easily enough. She became pregnant quickly after her September 1995 marriage to agent Jerry Solomon and gave birth to son Matthew the following year.\n\nIt's when the couple tried for a second child that the troubles began. Kerrigan, who'd always wanted three kids, got pregnant again and lost the baby.\n\nIt makes you feel like a failure, she tearfully told partner Artem Chigvintsev in her DWTS segment.\n\nAfter one pregnancy made it past the three-month mark, Kerrigan felt secure enough to inform son Matthew he'd be getting a little brother or sister.\n\nIt was crazy hard to tell him, Kerrigan told Boudreau, recalling breaking the bad news to him after she miscarried. He was so excited he was gonna have a brother or sister — and say that's not going to happen and try to explain to a little kid why.\n\nA decade later, Kerrigan and Solomon welcomed a second son, Brian via in vitro fertilization.\n\nWhen I finally had Brian it took a long time to name him, Kerrigan said. It was like being afraid to get attached, she added.\n\nShe eventually fulfilled her wish of having three kids when daughter Nicole was born in 2008.\n\nWe fought hard for this family, Kerrigan, now 47, said during her DWTS segment. I want to say to my kids through this dance, ''Never give up ... Keep trying.'

Nicole Winfield\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE — Pope Francis celebrated the first-ever airborne papal wedding Thursday, marrying two flight attendants from Chile's flagship airline at 36,000 feet during a flight from Santiago.\n\nBride Paula Podest, 39, and groom Carlos Ciuffardi, 41, said I do after telling Francis that they had been married in a civil service in 2010 but had been unable to follow up with a church ceremony because of the Feb. 27, 2010, earthquake that rocked Chile.\n\nFrancis then offered to marry the LATAM flight attendants aboard the Airbus 321 en route to the northern beach city of Iquique, and they readily agreed. The head of the airline served as the witness.\n\nHe told me it's historic, that there has never before been a pope who married someone aboard a plane, Ciuffardi told journalists aboard the flight.\n\nCiuffardi said the pope also told them: This is the sacrament that is missing in the world, the sacrament of marriage. May this motivate others to get the sacrament of marriage. I'll do it for this reason.\n\nPodest and Ciuffardi, who have two children, Rafaela, 6, and Isabela, 3, said they plan to take a mini-honeymoon and return to Santiago on Friday.\n\nFrancis is wrapping up his visit to Chile in Iquique, where he celebrated Mass for members of the city's growing immigrant community before heading to Peru.\n\nThe remarkable wedding transpired seemingly spontaneously, as is often the case with the ever-surprising Francis: The flight crew was gathering in the front of the plane for a photo with the pope when the couple told him they were married and he motioned for them to sit next to him.\n\nWe told him that we are husband and wife, that we have two daughters and that we would have loved to receive his blessing, Ciuffardi said. All of a sudden he asked us if we were married in the church, too.\n\nThe couple explained that their church's bell tower had fallen during the quake, forcing the cancellation of the service. One thing led to another, and they never followed up.\n\nHe liked us and he asked, 'Do you want me to marry you?' Ciuffardi recounted. He asked: 'Are you sure?' 'Yes, of course!' we said.\n\nA Vatican official hastily drew up an official, albeit handwritten marriage certificate, stating that the two had consented to the sacrament of marriage on Jan. 18 and that Francis had celebrated the marriage aboard the papal plane from Santiago to Iquique.\n\nA stunned Podest was nearly speechless during the remaining hour on the flight as she recounted the story to the 70 or so journalists who travel with the pope on his foreign trips.\n\nShe said Francis offered a bit of advice to the not-so-newlyweds: The wedding rings shouldn't be too tight, because they'll torture you, but if they're too loose, they'll fall off. So we have to be careful, she said blushing.\n\nPodest said she and Ciuffardi had also explained to Francis that when they first started dating, she was his boss at LATAM. Francis asked if she was still the boss, and both readily agreed.\n\nAnd that's why the marriage works, Ciuffardi said.\n\nAfter applause — and a breakfast of fresh fruit, croissants, coffee and tea — the plane landed in Iquique and the couple bid the passengers farewell.\n\nWe hope you had a good flight, the bride said.

He was also a Montreal legend who has been a source of inspiration and a hero for me for pretty much my whole life.\n\nGeorge Takei praised Plummer as a giant of stage and screen, and actor Daniel Dae Kim expressed his grievances on Twitter, labeling Plummer a legend.\n\n'All the Money in the World':Christopher Plummer to the rescue! How he saved the film\n\nMarried three times, Plummer is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Elaine, and his only daughter, actress Amanda Plummer, whom he had in a previous marriage to actress Tammy Grimes.\n\nContributing: Matthew Wilson and The Associated Press

The New York Post was first with the news; all cited unnamed sources close to the couple.\n\nBarrymore, 41, and Kopelman, 38, an art consultant, started dating in February 2011 and married at her Montecito, Calif., estate in June 2012. She was five months pregnant at the time.\n\nPeople reported the two confirmed the divorce in a joint statement Saturday. They said, however, that it does not take away from them being a family.\n\nDivorce might make one feel like a failure, but eventually you start to find grace in the idea that life goes on, they said in the statement. Our children are our universe, and we look forward to living the rest of our lives with them as the first priority.\n\nCelebrity year in review: Marriages, breakups\n\nTheir daughters are Olive, 3, and Frankie, 23 months. In an interview with People in October, Barrymore spoke out about her postpartum depression after Frankie was born.\n\nDrew Barrymore talks postpartum depression: 'I understand'\n\nLast week, Netflix announced that Barrymore (Charlie's Angels, Blended) and Timothy Olyphant (Justified, Deadwood) will star in a new comedy series, Santa Clarita Diet, about married realtors in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita who lead vaguely discontented lives … until Sheila goes through a dramatic change sending both their lives down a road of death and destruction – but in a good way, as the press release said.\n\nBarrymore, the descendant of a famous acting family dynasty, became a child star in 1982 as little Gertie in Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and by age 10 was drinking and drugging and hanging out mostly with adults.\n\nLast February she announced she would publish another book, this one an autobiographical collection of essays about her tumultuous life.\n\nDrew Barrymore is pregnant\n\nBarrymore is already the co-author, with Todd Gold, of another book about the first part of her life, Little Girl Lost, which came out in 1991 when she was 16.\n\nDrew Barrymore gets memoir deal\n\nShe's a successful actress, producer, director, beauty entrepreneur and spokes-model, but her romantic life hasn't always been rosy.\n\nShe married a Welsh bar owner in March 1994 and then split weeks later; then she married comic Tom Green in July 2001 and he filed for divorce six months later.
Andrea Mandell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFormer Spice Girl Mel B has filed a temporary restraining order against her estranged husband, claiming years of abuse.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by TMZ and People, the America's Got Talent and X Factor judge (real name: Melanie Brown), has accused her husband, Stephen Belafonte, of beating and threatening her throughout their 10-year marriage.\n\nBelafonte, 41, is a large, extremely aggressive, hostile and violent individual who subjected her to multiple physical beatings throughout their relationship, Brown, 41, wrote in her filing.\n\nBrown was granted the restraining order, and Belafonte was ordered to leave the family's Los Angeles home and to stay away from Brown and her three children, Phoenix, 18, Angel, 10, and Madison, 5.\n\nIncidents of alleged abuse include:\n\n-Following her Dancing with the Stars finale in November 2007, Belafonte allegedly choked and slammed Brown against the floor while she prepared for a TV appearance.\n\n-In July 2012, Brown says her ex accused her of flirting with Usher while she taped a segment for X Factor. Brown claims Belafonte flew into a rage, punching her in the face with a closed fist and splitting her lip.\n\n-In August 2012, Brown says Belafonte punched and pushed her down after she performed with the Spice Girls at the London Olympics closing ceremonies. Brown says Belafonte then forced her to tweet out she injured herself running in 7-inch Christian Louboutins.\n\nBrown says Belafonte would abuse her in retaliation for her success. When something good would happen for me, he would beat me down to let me know he was in charge, she writes in her declaration.\n\nOther allegations: The pop star says her ex forced her to participate in threesomes and threatened to release videos of the acts to ruin her career.\n\nBrown also claims that Belafonte impregnated their nanny and told Brown that he wanted the woman to keep the baby and all three of us live together. She says Belafonte ultimately forced the woman to get an abortion and used Brown's money to pay the fees.\n\nOver the course of their relationship, Brown says Belafonte has taken millions of dollars from her.\n\nNews of the restraining order comes just weeks after Brown filed for divorce from Belafonte, requesting joint legal and physical custody of their daughter, Madison. (Elder children Angel and Phoenix are from her relationships with exes Eddie Murphy and Jimmy Gulzar.)\n\nIn her filing, Brown says she met Belafonte just two months after giving birth to her second child. At the time I was vulnerable...as a single mother, my self-esteem was very low, she says. The couple married in June 2007 in Las Vegas after a short courtship.\n\nImmediately after their marriage, Brown says, Belafonte became emotionally and verbally abusive. He would tell me I was worthless...he would demean my appearance by telling me I was fat, ugly and old.\n\nA final straw came when her father was dying of cancer. Brown says she believes Belafonte took her passport so as to intentionally delay my travel such that I would not see my father prior to his death.\n\nBrown ultimately flew to the U.K. on Feb. 28, 2017. Her father died on March 4.\n\nBelafonte denied all the allegations to TMZ on Monday.\n\nA rep for Brown did not respond to USA TODAY. USA TODAY has been unable to reach Belafonte.

And we'll also tell you where to get off – people in Alabama don't do that!\n\nTalia comes from your typical nuclear family, with a father in the oil industry, stay-at-home mom and younger brother named Beau.\n\nRELATED: Tripp Halstead's freak accident ignites mom's incredible strength\n\nWhile attending Lafayette High School, she was in the gifted program, which provided her with several opportunities later in life.\n\nAfter graduation, Talia headed to Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, to pursue a degree in sports medicine.\n\nIt was the beginning of a wild ride with more incredible highs and and horrific lows than most people face in a lifetime.\n\nWhile in college, Talia met her future husband, Josh, a special operations veteran. The couple got together after his return, when he decided to attend college as a way of reconnecting with society. Despite hitting it off, Josh wound up going back overseas to the Middle East with the Department of Defense, and Talia moved to Mobile, Alabama, for medical school.\n\nThey maintained a long-distance relationship, got married in 2007 moved to New Orleans in 2010 for Talia's residency in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN).\n\nWhy the switch from sports medicine?\n\nI realized I loved the operating room, she explains. It's the perfect blend – I get to do procedures and be part of a big event in people's lives. I liked the relationship side.\n\nTalia loved every minute of her residency, and being in New Orleans was wonderful.\n\nIt's a fantastic city with its own personality, she says. I loved living there and felt like I was home again.\n\nDuring her residency, Talia got a big surprise - she was expecting her first child.\n\nKye Gates was born in January 2013, and balancing everything wasn't always easy, especially with her husband working a demanding job as well.\n\nIt was insane, she says. My mom saved my life. She moved to New Orleans and took care of him.\n\nWhen Kye was 1, Talia found her dream job in Jasper, Alabama. She fell in love with the practice, and it was close to Josh's family.\n\nLife was falling into place.\n\nBetween the money and the women I was working with, it was perfect, she says.\n\nAnd so was everything else.\n\nRELATED: The brutal truth about losing my baby girl\n\nJosh had an amazing job, the family settled into a beautiful home, and Talia was in love with her new career.\n\nI remember thinking, 'Oh my gosh, I am super lucky. My life is perfect, and I am super blessed.' \n\nAround that time, Talia and Josh decided to have another baby. They wanted their children to be close in age so they stop preventing and started trying.\n\nOne month later, in October 2014, Talia found out she was pregnant.\n\nWe were thrilled, she says. I always thought the ideal spacing was two-and-a-half years apart. My son's birthday is Jan. 6, and my due date was July 8.\n\nAt 14 weeks into the pregnancy, they learned the baby was a girl. Her name would be Aubrey.\n\nI was over the moon, Talia recalls. When we found out, we were like, 'We're done. I have my perfect little family.' \n\nThings couldn't get any better.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, they didn't.\n\nAs an OB/GYN, Talia had the privilege of unlimited ultrasounds, so she quite frequently checked on her baby girl. About 16 weeks into the pregnancy, her legs started measuring a little short. But no alarms went off in Talia's head.\n\nRELATED: Family's life goes from happiness to hell\n\nWe joked because Josh, Kye and I all have really long torsos and short legs, so we thought she would be just like us, Talia says. At 18 weeks, I saw that her legs were still measuring at 14 weeks, but I sort of blew it off and thought we weren't getting a good angle, or that she was sitting funny.\n\nTalia recalls a Wednesday afternoon, at 19 weeks pregnant, when she was scanned again. The baby's legs hadn't changed, and no matter which way they measured, they couldn't get past 14 weeks.\n\nMy medical brain was saying, 'This isn't right, what makes short legs,' but my personal brain was saying, 'this can't be right, nothing can be wrong with my baby.' \n\nTalia called her mentor for advice. She told him all measurements were perfect besides the baby's arms and legs, and like everyone else, he said she must be getting bad pictures. But he acted fast and got her an appointment two days later with the Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nThe day before her appointment, Talia began to think something might really be wrong. She was on call at the hospital with a laboring patient when she started researching and scanning herself for hours.\n\nI started taking all crazy measurements, and I convinced myself that she must have some sort of chondrodysplasia (dwarfism). But it never entered my brain that it was something that could be lethal. I don't know if it was God protecting me or what. I stayed up all night.\n\nThe next morning, Talia's laboring patient gave birth to a still-born baby.\n\nShe calls it ironic.\n\nOn Friday, Talia and Josh headed to the appointment, where the technician took a special interest in her case.\n\nI told her she has to talk to me, Talia says. Tell me what you're seeing. Dr. Biggio, the head of the department, came in, and I will never forget how incredibly compassionate and straight-forward he was. He looked right at me and said, 'The pictures I am seeing are consistent with a skeletal dysplasia that is lethal.'\n\nI never saw it coming. Never. We were not prepared for those words. They hit us both in the chest like a ton of bricks.\n\nThe doctor was quite sure of the baby's prognosis, but he said interval growth would be the defining factor. He told them to come back for a check-up in four weeks.\n\nI don't even know how I got out of that hospital, Talia recalls. I never saw my husband cry like that. I knew something was wrong, but not that. I was sad my daughter would have struggles, but I never thought she wouldn't be with us until the doctor said that. I guess it was my body protecting me.\n\nTalia spiraled into a deep depression. Terminating the pregnancy was an option, but the couple immediately said no.\n\nAnd that was it, she recalls. The doctor never pushed it.\n\nFour weeks later, Talia and Josh went back, and it was confirmed that the baby's condition was lethal. Doctors weren't sure when she would pass – during pregnancy, birth or shortly thereafter – but chances of her survival were almost nonexistent.\n\nI had already resigned myself to the fact that Aubrey wasn't going to live, Talia recalls. I would talk about the future and refer to only Kye. Josh would tell me, 'No, say 'them,' not just Kye.' It wasn't until that appointment that he finally lost all hope.\n\nHow does a mother move forward knowing that the life inside her is going to die? Talia didn't know – but she refused to miss a single moment with her daughter.\n\nTalia tried to cherish every second. Josh made them a jazz tape, and Aubrey loved it.\n\nShe would move for him, she says. That was their special bond.\n\nTalia did everything in her power to get to know the daughter she may never meet.\n\nHer partners made sure she continued to have regular check-ups and scans, with ultrasound pictures that are now so special.\n\nAlthough the future was unfathomable, Aubrey was perfectly content in her mother's womb, and for Talia, that was more important than anything.\n\nI was still hopeful because she was still alive, Talia says. I was 99 percent sure of what was going to happen, but she was still alive.\n\nRELATED: The scariest day of my life as a mom\n\nTalia developed a new appreciation for the beginning of life.\n\nI tell my patients, 'You are a mom or dad the moment you get that positive test.' My daughter made me a better doctor and mom.\n\nIn a world where miscarriage and infant loss are still somewhat taboo, Talia's experience allows her to relate with patients on a deeper level.\n\nYou have to acknowledge that life and the loss, she says. You have to celebrate it no matter what form it takes.\n\nAs the pregnancy progressed, reality set in, and life became a ticking time bomb.\n\nTalia had lots of excess fluid, which can lead to preterm labor. Her doctor told her that, at some point, she had to start thinking about her own life and what's best for her body. With Aubrey's condition, the head gets very big – at just 36 weeks, Aubrey's head was measuring at 42. Her doctor said she needed to start considering induction.\n\nBut I felt like I was picking her death date, Talia explains. My partner – Bridget Brunner – stepped up and said, 'You have to do this. You're being induced Friday.' \n\nOn June 12, 2015, everyone gathered at the hospital for Aubrey's arrival.\n\nI listened to her heartbeat all day, so I knew she was alive, Talia says. We didn't know if she would make it through the delivery though.\n\nThen, at 6:51 p.m., Aubrey was born crying.\n\nFor Talia and Josh, it was love at first sight.\n\nShe opened her eyes, and we got to hear her voice, Talia says. Josh synced with her right away. My best friend Jen heard me and said, 'You're finally back. You're peaceful for the first time in a long time.' \n\nBut Aubrey lived for just 49 beautiful minutes before taking her last breath.\n\nThe death was peaceful, Talia says. Kye sang her 'Happy Birthday,' and everyone got to see her.\n\nHer breathing slowed, and then stopped. It was everything I wanted it to be, considering the circumstances.\n\nWhat did Talia and Josh think when they saw their daughter?\n\nShe was beautiful, Talia says. She looked like her daddy. She had his nose. Aubrey was just 15 inches long, and her chubby little arms and legs were cute.\n\nThrough an organization called HALO (Hope After Loss Organization), Talia and Josh were able to keep Aubrey in their hospital room overnight on something called a cuddle cot, a pad that uses water to keep the baby cold.\n\nI held her, I memorized the weight of her, and what it felt like to have her on my chest and in my arms, Talia recalls. I can still close my eyes and remember the weight of her.\n\nThe next day, baby Aubrey was carried out in a blanket and laid to rest on June 15.\n\nFor Talia, leaving the hospital was rough. Her friends came to visit and cooked her a huge Louisiana meal.\n\nIt felt like the first time that I ate in years, Talia recalls. And Josh was amazing. He took care of all the arrangements. It's bizarre to pick out a grave site for a daughter who is still alive, and he took care of everything while I was still pregnant.\n\nThe tragedy did take a toll on the couple's marriage, but their strength carried them through the storm.\n\nRELATED: Infant's death turns teen mom's world upside down\n\nWe both needed each other so much and didn't have a lot to give, Talia says. We almost took turns falling apart. I know marriages crumble through these things, but he is the only person in the universe who knew how I felt.\n\nIt's been roughly nine months since Talia and Josh welcomed Aubrey into this world and said their goodbyes.\n\nHow is life today?\n\nI was better when I was pregnant, then numb, then bitter around the holidays, Talia explains. About a month ago, it got better. I give a lot of credit to God. Our marriage came out the other side. We weren't on the rocks, per se, but it was just hard. When we are good, I am good, and vice versa.\n\nTalia was happy to close the book on 2015 and is looking toward the future.\n\nWhat did she learn from this bittersweet, yet beautiful, tragedy?\n\nLife truly begins at conception, and just how precious those moments in the womb really are, she says. Women wish pregnancy away, want to meet their babies, and I get that. But I want to tell them, just cherish it. Only God is the author of life and death, and without faith, really all is lost. Be still. Be content. Be grateful. Even with my kid, I am appreciating the moments with my son. Cherish every stage. Life can change in an instant.\n\nTalia points out that the death of a baby is unlike anything else.\n\nMiscarriage and infant loss are different because you lose potential – not the person they were, but the person they could have been.\n\nShe's grateful for the past and hopeful for the future.\n\nTomorrow will come, she says. Put one foot in front of the other, lean on the Lord. I remember thinking, 'I can't go on, this is where life stops.' But it doesn't. You will feel joy again.\n\nRead more about Talia's story on her blog, storyofaubreylea.blogspot.com.
Retired astronaut Mark Kelly announced Tuesday that he is running to finish the late Sen. John McCain's last term representing Arizona, which ends in 2022.\n\nKelly is the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in a 2011 mass shooting that left six dead in Tucson, Arizona. Since that attack, Giffords and Kelly have been prominent advocates for gun control.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to enter the field ahead of 2020 and is widely seen as a formidable candidate, given his biography and likely ability to raise the millions of dollars needed to take on the GOP's established candidate, Sen. Martha McSally.\n\nMcSally, who formerly served in the House, was appointed to the seat by Gov. Doug Ducey after she narrowly lost her campaign for Arizona's other Senate seat to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema in the 2018 midterm election. She is considered one of the most vulnerable Republican senators heading into the 2020 election.\n\nProfile:Seven years after shooting that changed everything, Kelly still working on what comes next\n\nMcSally is a former Air Force pilot and was the first woman to fly combat missions. Kelly was a pilot in the Navy.\n\nBoth veterans will fight to fill the seat of a legendary Navy pilot who was shot down and held as a prisoner of war by North Vietnamese communists for five and a half years.\n\nKelly's announcement comes a few days after former attorney general Grant Woods – a Republican who joined the Democratic Party and is a fierce critic of President Donald Trump – announced he would not be getting in the race. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is also considering a run for the seat.\n\nKelly announced his candidacy in a video he shared on social media that largely focused on his biography and his marriage to Giffords.\n\nYou know, I thought then that I had the risky job, the former astronaut tells his wife as they discuss her shooting. Turned out that you were the one who had the risky job.\n\nHe credited his wife for giving him the drive to run for the Senate.\n\nI learned a lot from being an astronaut. I learned a lot from being a pilot in the Navy. I learned a lot about solving problems from being an engineer. But what I learned from my wife is how you use policy to improve people's lives, he said.\n\nI care about people. I care about the state of Arizona. I care about this nation, he said. So, because of that, I've decided that I'm launching a campaign for the United States Senate.\n\nThe video ends with Kelly and Giffords sitting on a couch, Damn the torpedoes, he says.\n\nFull speed ahead, they say together.\n\nHe received a degree in marine engineering and nautical science from the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, graduating with highest honors in 1986, according to his biography with NASA. He also has a master's degree in aeronautical engineering.\n\nDuring his military career, Kelly picked up awards ranging from the Distinguished Flying Cross to the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. He flew 39 combat missions in Operation Desert Storm and logged more than 5,000 hours in 50 different aircraft, NASA reported.\n\nKelly announced his retirement from NASA in June 2011, five months after Giffords was shot. He co-founded Americans For Responsible Solutions, a gun-control organization.\n\nContributing: Ronald J. Hansen, Arizona Republic

Netflix's Tidying Up with Marie Kondo has people in a frenzy to clean up their spaces and throw out half their belongings, but the show ' exposes something else: a gender divide in tidying up.\n\nWhile Kondo's KonMari method may require equal responsibility when it comes to tidying up, the burden of the physical act of decluttering and the emotional labor that comes with keeping a house orderly ultimately (and unfairly) falls back on the woman in the household, episode after episode.\n\nI think women in our society are a lot more oppressed than we like to think – sexual assault and harassment are ubiquitous, we work and earn outside the home, getting paid one-third less than similarly situated men, yet are expected to do most of the unpaid household work and emotional labor when we get home, says Sheena Wadhawan, a diversity consultant and the deputy director of EverydayFeminism.com.\n\nCleaning the house was definitely – wasn't my priority, but it would definitely be hers, Ron Akiyama says of his wife in the second episode of Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.\n\nMore:Marie Kondo shares her secret to decluttering\n\nMore:Want to get organized? Even more of Marie Kondo's tips for decluttering\n\nIn almost every episode with a heterosexual couple, the woman expresses how she feels that the mess is her responsibility to fix. The men, on the other hand, don't come across as apologetic, nor do they take accountability for how the home got to its untidy state.\n\nKavita Daiya, director of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program at George Washington University, says that happens because women internalize societal expectations about a woman's place in the home.\n\nEven when women are educated, and whether they're stay-at-home or working mothers, the show reveals that women have internalized social norms and expectations about gender that mark women as primarily responsible for domestic lives, domestic chores and family – in a way, the men in this show are freed up from these responsibilities for the most part, Daiya says.\n\nThe eight-episode series kicks off with the Friend family – Kevin and Rachel, a couple with two kids whose five-year marriage is seemingly being wedged apart by finances and cleanliness.\n\nWe fight about laundry, and it seems so silly when I say it, but really it (ticks) me off, says Kevin, who adds he'd rather do it together as a family. It's not because she doesn't do the laundry, it's because we hire somebody to come do it.\n\nMore:Keeping your New Year's fitness resolution\n\nRachel divides her time between part-time work and being a stay-at-home mom with two toddlers, which she describes as chaotic. And the one thing she absolutely hates to do – to the point it gives her anxiety – is laundry.\n\nOnce Kondo comes through and helps Rachel and her husband get their house in order, Rachel candidly says to Kondo that Kevin has become more romantic and affectionate and told her that cleaning is sexy.\n\nThe rest of the episodes with heterosexual couples follow the same pattern as Rachel and Kevin. Although each of the couples come from a different background than the Friend family, the gender divide is blatant in every household.\n\nThe Marie Kondo show has me pondering in particular sentimental items, Wadhawan says. I find the creation, gathering and labor of deciding what to keep or discard in terms of sentimental items defaulting to me as the woman and mother. If I didn't print and frame photos of my children, there wouldn't be any. If my mother-in-law didn't gather photos of my child into photo books, they wouldn't exist.\n\nThis holds especially true for the Mattison family – more specifically Shenita. The guilt of a messy home quickly falls to her because she's depicted as the one who can't seem to let go of things. Not her kids' toys, not her clothes, not her books and most importantly not her scarves.\n\nMore:We need a 'Bird Box' sequel to answer our many, many burning questions\n\nShenita tells Kondo she's Pakistani, and because she doesn't have a big community in L.A., she treasures her scarves and clothing because they give her a connection to her culture. But Aaron, her husband, doesn't appear to understand why she holds on to a lot of things and ends up making her feel guilty until she gives in to his way of tidying up.\n\nShe is having to justify taking up space in the home. The scarf thing is so interesting, because those scarves are a connection for her to her culture, and it was interesting to see him say that she wasn't wearing them, so why is she keeping them, Daiya says. He doesn't acknowledge their cultural significance, or the fact that we all hold on to objects for their sentimental value. That kind of shaming can be very emotionally oppressive.\n\nIn another episode, one husband, Douglas Mersier, was frustrated because he'd go into the kitchen to grab a glass but find the cabinet cluttered with spices – but he admits that he never cooks. When the show cuts to another scene, the Mersier kids and husband reveal that anytime they need anything, anything at all, they ask, call or text their mother nonstop, because she's the keeper of all their things.\n\nIn a subsequent scene, Katrina Mersier, the mom, then breaks down crying because she feels she's the one to blame for the mess. She's the only one taking responsibility for the home being the way it is.\n\nIt looked like a lot of women that they were featuring had internalized the idea that they were responsible for the kitchen, the cooking, and the organization (of space and clothes), and that it was a reflection of their own self, their own competence – in a way that the men didn't internalize it, Daiya says.\n\nDaiya also adds that the gender divide became more apparent in the allocation of household tasks. Kondo assigned the men to clean up the garage, while women were mostly relegated to tidying up the kitchen.\n\nNone of the men in the series seem embarrassed or take accountability for the garage or any other areas of the house being cluttered. It was just cluttered because it was cluttered and not because they failed at being a good husband.\n\nThe men didn't think 'The garage is a disaster, that reflects my failure as a husband,' whereas the women were sometimes depicted as thinking, 'This reflects my failure to be a good mom (or wife),' Daiya says.\n\nIt's something to consider while binge-watching Tidying up – gender bias and guilt certainly don't spark joy.

GILLETTE, Wyo. – From behind the counter of his brother's auto-parts store, Bubba Miller looks out at the 2020 presidential race and worries about what will happen to his hometown if a Democrat wins. Not just a Democrat, but, based on the current frontrunners, a liberal Democrat. Or a progressive. Or an avowed socialist.\n\nI wish we could build a wall around Wyoming, he says with a laugh. I think there's just something wrong in their heads to think you can get everything for free.\n\nShifting the wad of tobacco tucked in his lip, Miller, 24, lays out the case for reelecting President Donald Trump, from this coal town's booming economy to the president's protection of gun rights to his tough border policies to his efforts to reduce the size of the federal government. As far as Miller is concerned, Trump can do no wrong.\n\nHe's not alone. In 2016, then-candidate Trump won 86% of the vote here as he swept every Wyoming county but one, the wealthy liberal enclave of Teton County, home to Jackson Hole. Only once since 1952 has the state voted for a Democratic presidential candidate, and in 2016 Trump beat Hillary Clinton here by the widest margin of any state. And ahead of the November presidential election, none of the 2020 Democratic candidates are making any inroads with these most conservative of voters.\n\nI've very concerned about the direction of the Democratic Party, says Robin Clover, a 20-year Wyoming resident and registered Republican who has voted for Democrats at the local level. They're either past their prime or far too progressive.\n\nHere in Wyoming, where every other car is a pickup and cowboy hats and boots are a working man's uniform, the 2020 election worries voters, who fear the election of a Democrat will upend their way of life and force the coal mines to close and the oil wells to stop pumping. Force them to pay higher taxes, force them to give up their AR-15 rifles and high-capacity magazines. Force them to subsidize the health care of immigrants. Force them to pay for college loans for city kids. Force. Force. Force.\n\nThat's the problem, Miller says. I'm an adult. You can't make me. It's just taking away from letting people grow up.\n\nLike his neighbors, Miller says he wishes Trump could lead the country the way he was elected to, without being second-guessed or attacked by what he considers a corrupt class of politicians and bureaucrats. The way Miller sees it, the fact that Trump is being so forcefully opposed perfectly demonstrates that the president is on the right track in draining the swamp in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe state Republican Party officially endorses a slew of other conservative positions, from disarming forest rangers to returning to a Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy for the military and banning birthright citizenship. The party has also called for banning the acceptance of any international refugees unless they are vetted Christians, defining marriage as only between a man and a woman, abolishing the EPA and the U.S. Department of Education, and strictly enforcing all immigration laws.\n\nBut for most voters here, coal and the jobs it provides are the biggest drivers of decisions. And that means Trump is their guy.\n\nBecause Wyoming has only three Electoral College votes, there's little chance a Democrat will even bother campaigning here, and even Trump is considered unlikely to visit, because most voters across the state will back him regardless if they see him in person shaking hands and holding babies. That leaves Wyoming's voters in a uniquely powerless situation: Ignored by both parties, they are effectively sidelined despite the critical role federal policy plays in their future. And they're facing Democratic candidates who all see a bigger federal government as a solution to the nation's problems.\n\nPolls suggest their worst nightmare could come true in November. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are all narrowly leading or in a close tie with Trump in recent polls. The president's supporters in Wyoming, however, point out that polls showed Clinton winning the presidency in 2016, so they don't put much stock in them.\n\nWyoming's 578,000 residents, most of them white and living on land seized from Native Americans, have long prided themselves on a frontier spirit of rugged individualism and independence. They also see themselves as a world apart from the nation's big coastal states, all of which tend to vote Democrat. For generations, they've voted Republican and argued that big-city liberals can't possibly understand what life is like where there's just six people per square mile. New York City, by contrast, has 27,000 people per square mile.\n\nBut the outside world is increasingly moving in a different direction, where global warming is settled science, inclusivity, diversity and tolerance are honored, and access to health care is seen as a fundamental human right. The United Nations even has set a 2030 goal for achieving universal health coverage internationally. That's setting up an increasingly stark contrast for Wyomingites who see a Trump victory as essential to preserving their freedoms and independence.\n\nOur way of life here is threatened by a Democratic administration, said state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer, a Republican who represents a portion of the largest city, Cheyenne, where Trump won 60% of the vote in 2016. Every Republican in Wyoming you'll talk to would agree that Wyoming is better off under a Republican administration. No one liked Hillary. They just knew that she was the enemy. And whether it's Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, I don't think the vote totals would change by 5%. There's just this attitude that you have to maintain control of the presidency at all costs.\n\nTo understand Wyoming, you have to understand a little bit about coal, the state's backbone, both physically and financially. In Gillette, which calls itself the Energy Capital of the Nation, coal is inextricable from daily life. The mines outside town set the pace, explosives blasting the windswept ground to free the coal. Many of the workers are no longer full-time employees but work as contractors, missing out on the benefits but still keeping the same 12-hour shifts they used to before repeated bankruptcies prompted many mine operators to restructure.\n\nIn town, restaurants proudly display coal keeps the lights on and friends of coal stickers, and the diesel-equipment repair shops and heavy machinery repair yards line the approaches to the historic downtown, where the Gillette Brewing Company's bar is supported by pieces of drilling rigs.\n\nTaxes levied on the vast trainloads of coal hauled to power plants across the West means the state has never had an income tax, and its sales taxes are among the nation's lowest. While Eastern coal states like Kentucky and West Virginia get the president's attention, Wyoming leads the nation in coal production, with its approximately 5,500 miners digging more than the next six states combined.\n\nVirtually all of that coal is mined from land owned by the federal government, which leases the property to conglomerates to mine and then burn the coal for electricity. That quirk of geology has long helped Wyoming maintain its financial independence, but even coal's strongest backers worry that times are changing. The federal government plays a key role because slowing down new coal leases or restricting coal-powered generating plants almost immediately affects the miners themselves.\n\nDuring the 2016 campaign, Clinton declared we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, a statement that infuriated Wyoming residents who already disliked her for reasons ranging from Benghazi to her work with the Clinton Foundation. While Clinton then went on to explain that she planned to offer job retraining to coal workers, Wyoming's voters – who weren't going to support her anyway – hardened their opposition further.\n\nThey say there's still life in coal, and that Clinton would have harmed an already struggling industry. And they say the Democrats running for president in 2020 have a similar playbook.\n\nI think Hillary would have killed our economy. And I think any of the people running on the Democrat side would absolutely eviscerate our economy. The Democrats seem to do everything they can to squash business, says Vicki Million Hughes, a Cheyenne real estate agent whose grandparents moved to Wyoming in 1920.\n\nHughes says she's 100% behind the president, aside from offensive tweets attacking specific people, because his focus has been creating a strong economy, growing industry and jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nThe strength of the national and local economy is a major factor for Trump's support in Wyoming, even though coal mining jobs have been on the decline for decades. Voters here believe four more years of his administration will keep the economy humming and extend the life of the coal mines for the foreseeable future.\n\nIf God is good enough to give us a natural resource, we should use that resource wisely, says Hughes, who like many Wyoming voters says she believes the planet naturally warms and cools and that humans have little to do with it. Why waste what God has given us?\n\nAbout 70% of Americans say climate change is occurring, and a majority – 55% – say it's mostly human-caused, according to an April 2019 study by Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. In Wyoming, voters like Hughes and Miller say they have the right to disagree and worry that their voices will be shouted down by the modern-day shaming mobs populating social media.\n\nI have lots of friends who live on the coasts and they tell me it's time to evolve, that Wyoming needs to get past fossil fuels. But we make our living and livelihood off oil and gas and coal, Zwonitzer says. You've got people who have been involved in these industries for generations.\n\nThat singular focus on coal and federal land management means Wyoming's voters spend little time worrying about the nuances of immigration or health care reform, although many shake their heads at what they see as the entitlement culture of the Democratic candidates and their supporters.\n\nWyomingites pride themselves on their low-tax, work-focused culture, and the idea of erasing student loans or giving everyone government-run health insurance runs counter to their deeply held ideology of taking care of their own problems and being responsible for their own decisions.\n\nMiller, for instance, is paying off medical debt accumulated when he crashed his dirtbike and blew out his knee. He didn't have health insurance at the time and instead paid the Obamacare tax because it was cheaper than paying for health insurance. While having to pay the bills sucks, Miller says, he accepts that it was his decision to forgo insurance.\n\nEverybody in Wyoming would love to have the best college education, the best health care, and for it all to be done for free. And that's just impossible, said Carl Bunky Loucks, a Republican state representative from Casper. I just don't understand the mentality that you can get everything for free.\n\nLoucks, 52, said he and many other Wyoming residents support both an audit of the federal government and a balanced budget amendment that would limit government spending to what it can actually afford, instead of adding to the ballooning national deficit. Loucks said he's frustrated the national debt has increased under Trump but says it would have been worse under a Democrat. Trump won Louck's county with 70% of the vote.\n\nMiller says Wyoming has flourished under Trump, and none of his neighbors regret their 2016 votes. If anything, he says, Trump's support has increased.\n\nHow can you hate someone who is so good for the United States? Miller says. I think his mouth gets him in trouble, but sometimes what he says is well-needed.
Bruce Lowry\n\nThe (Bergen County, N.J.) Record\n\nFirst there was Roy Moore, now there is Rob Porter.\n\nPresident Trump, our tell it like it is tough-guy, president, seems to have an affinity for men who reportedly act out inappropriately, or even violently, against women.\n\nMaybe he feels their pain. The men's pain, that is.\n\nOur president, who refuses to stand up for a single Syrian refugee who came to this country to flee war, or for Dreamers who have made the best of their situations and want only the chance to achieve the American Dream, has now twice publicly stood up for men facing serious allegations of either sexual or physical abuse against women.\n\nFriday, after the departure of Porter, the White House staff secretary accused of physical abuse by two ex-wives — including one who produced photos of a black eye she said Porter gave her — Trump had only glowing reviews for the former aide.\n\nWe found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, but we certainly wish him well and it's a tough time for him, Trump said. He did a very good job when he was in the White House.\n\nTrump went on to say that Porter says he's innocent and I think you have to remember that and that we absolutely wish him well. Porter has indeed denied the accusations.\n\nThe Porter story was reported first in the British tabloid, The Daily Mail. One ex-wife claimed Porter choked and punched her during their marriage, while the other said he dragged her wet and naked out of the shower and was verbally abusive.\n\nWhether Trump believes these accusations verbatim should have nothing to do with whether he could perhaps bring himself to show a smidgen of sympathy for possible victims of domestic violence.\n\nOr how about the slightest recognition that such violence is a longtime problem in this country, and a daily nightmare for millions of women who feel trapped in their circumstance.\n\nInstead of gushing praise for an aide accused of horrible behavior, why not temper it a little by saying something, geez I don't know, like Rob did a good job in the White House, but these are troubling allegations, and we take the issue of domestic violence seriously. If there is truth to these reports, our hearts go out to the victims and are sorry for the pain they endured. No one should ever have to go through that.\n\nAccording to the Violence Policy Center, nearly three women are murdered every day in the United States by current or former romantic partners. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence says that on average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. The NCADV also reports that one in three women and one in four men have been victims of (some form of) physical violence by an intimate partner within their lifetime.\n\nWe recall Trump steadfastly defended Moore, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Alabama whose candidacy was derailed after multiple, credible reports that he engaged in sexual misconduct with young girls early in his career. Trump stuck with his man Moore all the way to the finish line.\n\nIn fact, roughly a week before that election, Trump let it be known that his dislike of Democrats was more important than allowing an accused child molester to serve in the U.S. Senate, tweeting Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama.\n\nOur president, he of Access Hollywood fame, can't seem to bring himself to even consider that Moore or Porter might be the monsters they are portrayed to be, who may well have preyed upon women. All that matters, apparently, is that they share the Trump worldview, and presumably, his view toward women in general.\n\nNo one was going to mistake Trump for being a flag waver in the #MeToo movement. But you might think that any decent person, much less the president, might have the strength of character to at least acknowledge that domestic violence is a pressing problem that too often goes unreported and too often ends in death.\n\nTrump's tone deafness, again, speaks volumes.\n\nMany have criticized Trump for what he says, or what he tweets. In this case, he should get an earful of protest about what he never had the courage to say.\n\nBruce Lowry is an editorial writer for The (Bergen County, N.J.) Record.

Do you stick tortilla chips in your burrito for crunch or have a cat that walks across your keys proudly while you play a piano? If so, congratulations – you have a little something in common with Taylor Swift.\n\nThe new documentary Miss Americana, which premiered at Sundance Film Festival last week and starts streaming on Netflix this Friday, delves deep into the music but especially the life of the 30-year-old superstar.\n\nThe film shows her goofy side, such as boasting about the light-up party shoes she wears while recording or mocking her too-tight metallic dress for an awards show (I look like a Pop-Tart wrapper), but also sees her wrestling to reconcile the good girl she's always wanted to be with the mature, complex woman she's become. As she gets older, Swift also wonders about her own shelf life in a culture where female artists and entertainers are discarded in an elephant graveyard at age 35.\n\n'Miss Americana':First reactions praise Taylor Swift doc as 'illuminating, empowering'\n\nTaylor Swift:The singer reveals her struggles to overcome an eating disorder in 'Miss Americana' and a new interview\n\nWhether you're a hardcore Lover of all things T-Swift or not, these five moments in Miss Americana undoubtedly will have you relating to the star as a human being rather than just another celebrity.\n\n1. Taylor Swift worries about job performance just like the rest of us.\n\nThe documentary's earliest emotional turn finds Swift and her cat by the phone waiting for Grammy Awards nominations in 2018. Nervous, she gets a call that Reputation, the year's best-selling album, isn't nominated for album of the year, a category she's won twice in the past. This is good. This is fine. I just need to make a better record, she says, trying to put on a brave face but looking absolutely heartbroken and near tears.\n\nIt's obvious she sets the bar exceedingly high for herself, and the movie takes a look at her ups and downs writing tunes for last year's Lover album. There's so much pressure going into putting new music out, she says. If I don't beat everything I've done prior, it'll be deemed as a colossal failure.\n\n2. Kanye West is pretty much the Joker to her Batgirl.\n\nSwift revisits the 2009 MTV VMAs moment where West infamously interrupted her acceptance speech, expressing thoughts about how it was a catalyst for a lot of psychological paths I went down. And not all of them were beneficial. However, the rekindling of their on-again, off-again feud in 2016 – when West put out his song Famous about Swift with the lyric, I made that (expletive) famous – arguably had an even bigger effect.\n\nWhen the hashtag #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty trends on Twitter in the aftermath, she breaks down in front of her mom, Andrea. I just wanted to disappear. Nobody physically saw me for a year, and that was what I thought they wanted, Swift narrates. The backlash hurt so much because adulation was all I used to have and her writing for Reputation was like a wounded animal lashing out. Around the same time, though, she was falling in love with British actor Joe Alwyn and his really wonderfully normal, balanced, grounded life, she says. We decided together that we wanted our relationship to be private. (He's never mentioned by name, though one scene shows him hugging Swift and kissing her forehead backstage.)\n\n3. Her mom's cancer puts everything into perspective.\n\nOn a plane ride, we meet Andrea Swift's cancer dog, a large pooch that handles the turbulence of takeoff better than Taylor does. Her mother's battle with breast cancer– and the brain tumor found while undergoing treatment – has been really hard for me because she is my favorite person, Swift says. It woke me up from this life where I used to sweat all these things. But do you really care if the Internet doesn't like you today if your mom's sick from her chemo?\n\nThe diagnosis in general made her prioritize family and friends. She has dinner with one childhood pal and the subject of children comes up in conversation, which has been described to Swift as You feed them, you change them, they sleep. I was like, 'So it's like a Tamagotchi,'  she quips, though her friend adds, I think you would be an excellent mother. No questions.\n\n4. Swift gets real about battling an eating disorder.\n\nOne major revelation in Miss Americana: Swift admits that it's not good for me to see pictures of myself every day because a few times in the past where she felt her stomach was too big or someone said she looked pregnant, she's been triggered enough to starve a little bit. Just stop eating. Swift had the really good revelation that food's a good thing and I don't care as much if somebody points out that I have gained weight. It's something that makes my life better, the fact that I'm a size 6 instead of a size double-0.\n\nIt's also an ongoing struggle, as she shows the camera a picture that almost sent her to a bad place. I was like, 'We do not do that anymore. It's better to think you look fat than to look sick. We're changing the channel in our brain.' \n\n5. Look what you made her do: Swift isn't keeping her mouth shut anymore.\n\nAfter long toeing the country music line and not espousing her political views, Swift is now a proud leader of the resistance. During the 2018 midterm elections, she very publicly opposed Tennessee senatorial candidate Marsha Blackburn, a Republican conservative (whom Swift calls Trump in a wig) against gay marriage and women's issues important to the singer.\n\nThe movie looks at the internal strife this new strategy caused, including one meeting where Swift cries when discussing it with her divided management team. Publicist Tree Paine tries to foresee any possible issues, including backlash from the president. Yeah, (expletive) that, Swift says defiantly. I don't care.\n\nBlackburn ended up winning, leading Swift to write Only the Young, a new single from the movie written to inspire the next generation of voters to keep hope alive and not give up trying to make the world a better place. But Swift acknowledges she's happy to not feel muzzled now. It's time to take the masking tape off my mouth. Like, forever.
Lori Vallow, the mother of two Idaho children missing since September, was arrested in Hawaii on Thursday on felony child desertion charges. She is being held on $5 million bail.\n\nPolice in Kauai said they do not believe Joshua JJ Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, are on the island.\n\nThe children were last seen in Rexburg, Idaho, and Vallow, who was also charged with contempt of court and other misdemeanors, missed a January deadline to bring the children to authorities.\n\nRexburg police have said they strongly believe that Joshua and Tylee's lives are in danger.\n\nNewly released Idaho court documents allege Vallow lied several times about her children's whereabouts. Her bank account shows no sign that she is providing money to care for the kids, Rexburg police Lt. Ron Ball said in a document filed this week.\n\nFeb. 21:Mother of 2 children missing since September appears in court; bail set at $5 million\n\nCourt documents say JJ's winter clothes and other belongings have been found in an abandoned storage unit.\n\nWhen police announced in December the children were missing, police also said they were investigating the death of Tammy Daybell, the late wife of Lori Vallow's new husband Chad Daybell.\n\nUnderpinning the investigation are a series of suspicious deaths and cult-like religious beliefs. Here's what to know about the deaths connected to Lori and Chad Daybell:\n\nLori and Chad Daybell marry within weeks of Tammy Daybell's death\n\nOn Oct. 19, Tammy Daybell died of what was initially said to be natural causes. According to KSAZ-TV in Phoenix, no autopsy was performed on the 49-year-old mother of five who had been married to Chad Daybell for roughly 30 years.\n\nWithin in weeks, Lori and Chad Daybell were married, in Hawaii, per KSAZ-TV.\n\nOn Dec. 11, police exhumed Tammy's remains to perform an autopsy, with results pending. When police announced the children were missing, they also noted that Tammy's death may be suspicious.\n\nChad and Tammy Daybell had lived in Idaho for several years, and Chad was a writer who published dozens of novels and an autobiography on his near-death experiences and apocalyptic beliefs.\n\nPolice welfare check on Joshua Vallow\n\nJoshua Vallow's biological grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock, were concerned after not hearing from the boy for months. Lori Vallow had moved the children to Idaho in August, but she had not told the Woodcocks or other family members where they were.\n\nKay Woodcock told Dateline she discovered Lori was in Idaho when she logged into the email account of her late brother and Lori's ex-husband, Charles Vallow.\n\nWoodcock contacted authorities, and police in Rexburg tried to perform a welfare check on the child, who was not present. Police say Lori and Chad Daybell lied about Joshua and Tylee's whereabouts, and when they returned the next day, the couple had fled.\n\nIn December, police said that they believed both children's lives were in danger and that Vallow knew where they were or what had happened to them.\n\nLori's brother fatally shot her ex-husband\n\nIn July, Charles Vallow, Lori's estranged husband and adoptive father of Joshua, arrived in Arizona where she and her children had been living.\n\nPolice in Chandler said Lori's brother, Alex Cox, called 911 and said he shot Charles Vallow after an argument between Charles and Lori broke out.\n\nCox claimed self-defense, but on Dateline, detectives said details in Cox's and Lori's stories did not add up and they exhibited strange behavior not typical of family members whose relative had just died.\n\nKay Woodcock told Dateline her brother was not a violent man, but Cox said Charles Vallow struck him with a baseball bat.\n\nChandler police had an open homicide investigation into the incident, but no arrests were made.\n\nLori's brother dies in December\n\nAlex Cox is the most recent confirmed fatality in the string of deaths tied to the case.\n\nHe died Dec. 12 in Arizona after a man who said he was Cox's girlfriend's son called 911 when finding Cox unresponsive, KSAZ-TV reported. The TV station also reported Cox had recently married in Nevada.\n\nAn autopsy was performed and results are pending. Police have said Cox's death remains under investigation.\n\nLori had been married several times before\n\nAccording to the East Idaho News, Lori Vallow has been married at least five times.\n\nHer first marriage in 1992 ended in divorce to an unknown man, the news outlet reported.\n\nMarriage records show she married William Lagioia in 1995 in Travis County, Texas. Vallow was 22 at the time, and Lagioia was 23. His current status is unknown, but he is the biological father of Lori's eldest son, Colby Ryan, per the East Idaho News.\n\nIn 2001, she married Joseph Ryan, who is Tylee Ryan's biological father, the news outlet reported. Their marriage ended in divorce in 2004, and Joseph Ryan died of an apparent heart attack in 2018, KSAZ-TV reported.\n\nIn 2006, Lori and Charles Vallow married. Friends and family told Dateline the couple apparently had a happy marriage in their early years. Charles had a successful business, and Kay Woodcock wanted her brother and his wife to adopt Joshua, for whom they had been caring.\n\nThe family lived in Hawaii for a couple of years, but returned to Arizona in June 2018, Dateline reported. Within a year, Charles Vallow filed for divorce.\n\nCharles Vallow's divorce records: Lori said she was 'a god'\n\nIn his February 2019 divorce filing, Charles Vallow described Lori as uninterested in him or Joshua because she had a more important mission to carry out.\n\nLori claimed she was a god assigned to carry out the work of the 144,000 at Christ's second coming in July 2020, the court documents said.\n\nCharles feared Lori would try to kill him and she allegedly told him she had an angel there to help her dispose of the body, court documents said. Shortly after her alleged threats, Charles took out an order of protection against Lori, according to court documents.\n\nCharles was shot dead in the altercation with Alex Cox about five months later.\n\nContributing: Jordan Culver, USA TODAY; Chelsea Curtis, Arizona Republic\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller

Leapies who stay at the hotel on their birthday will receive overnight accommodations, and a celebratory dinner for two, complete with birthday cake and champagne toast, at the farm-to-fork Jardenea restaurant (from $229, valid February 29, 2016).\n\nSince Leap Day babies only have a birthday every four years, Melrose Georgetown Hotel wanted to make leap year 2016 one they will never forget, said Jale Hashimi, general manager of the Melrose Georgetown Hotel.\n\nFor those who are ready to take the leap into marriage on Leap Day, here are a few offers for you, too.\n\nBack at the Caldwell House Bed and Breakfast, the Irish tradition of women asking men to marry them is fodder for its Take a Luck of the Irish Leap package: overnight accommodations February 28 and receive Monday night's stay free if the woman proposes, as well as a complimentary bottle of champagne, box of chocolates, three-course gourmet breakfasts and more (from $245; valid February 28–March 1, 2016).\n\nThis is such a special holiday and it only comes around once every four years, said Dena Finneran, who co-owns the Caldwell House Bed and Breakfast with her husband John. It's important that we help out guests mark this Irish tradition with some incredible memories.\n\nFurther south, the Take a Leap of Faith wedding package at the National Hotel Miami Beach is for spontaneous couples who are ready to take the plunge on February 29. The package includes an oceanfront or garden wedding ceremony for the couple and up to five guests, complete with officiant and bridal bouquet; dinner for two at Tamara Bistro; and wedding night accommodations in a Cabana Suite (from $700; valid February 29, 2016).\n\nThough celebrated once every four years, this one's as odd as it gets. Shanty Creek Resorts in Bellaire (just northeast of Traverse City), Mich., takes a different approach to Leap Day – for reasons unknown, the Shanty Creek designates February 29 as Brad Day. On February 29, anyone named Brad and has valid ID to prove it can ski and use rentals free; has a special section in Ivan's restaurant Reserved for Brad; has a Brad-only restroom within the Day Lodge at his disposal; and can stay February 28 for $29 (per person). What's more, prizes will be award for the Brads who travel the furthest, and bring the most non-Brads with them.
A revelatory new documentary highlights the Circus that pop singer Britney Spears had to survive. Many on social media are rallying round the singer after watching Framing Britney Spears (now streaming on Hulu), from FX and The New York Times.\n\nThe project examines the rise of Spears, 39, her mental health challenges, inappropriate treatment by unrelenting media and the discord over her conservatorship, controlled largely by her father, Jamie.\n\nAmid social media uproar and speculation surrounding her wellbeing, Spears shared on Twitter and Instagram Tuesday that she's focused on being a normal person.\n\nI'll always love being on stage, Spears captioned a throwback video of herself performing Toxic three years ago. But I am taking the time to learn and be a normal person… I love simply enjoying the basics of every day life!\n\nSpears advised her fans to take what they see with a grain of salt, reminding her devoted followers that each person has their story and their take on other people's stories.\n\nWe all have so many different bright beautiful lives, she wrote. Remember, no matter what we think we know about a person's life it is nothing compared to the actual person living behind the lens!\n\nKevin Federline's lawyer Mark Vincent Kaplan told USA TODAY Wednesday Federline intends to stay out of public conversation surrounding Spears' conservatorship. Federline and Spears were married from 2004 to 2007 and share two kids: Sean Preston, 15, and Jayden James, 14.\n\nKevin has kept himself completely out of whatever issues there may be between Britney and the conservatorship, said the Los Angeles divorce attorney. Kevin doesn't have an opinion whether she should or shouldn't have a conservator, and he's done well to keep himself out of that fray.\n\nKaplan continued: Right now, he's letting them deal with it, and his only interest is that when (their children) go visit their mom they are doing it in a structured, secure environment that champions their best interest.\n\nOn Tuesday, Spears' boyfriend Sam Asghari, 27, joined those speaking out about the treatment of Spears on social media, specifically calling out the pop icon's father on his Instagram Story.\n\nNow it's important for people to understand that I have zero respect for someone trying to control our relationship and constantly throwing obstacles our way, he wrote. In my opinion, Jamie is a total (expletive). I won't be going into details because I've always respected our privacy but at the same time, I didn't come to this country to not be able to express my opinion and freedom.\n\nAsghari was born in Tehran, Iran and moved to the U.S. in 2006. He met Spears in 2016 on the set of her Slumber Party music video, and the couple made their red carpet debut together in 2019 at the premiere for Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time In Hollywood.\n\nOther celebrities are also speaking out following the documentary's release, including talk show host Tamron Hall, who tweeted, It's an understatement to call it heartbreaking. Fashion designer Christian Siriano posted that he wanted so much to help Spears, and Paramore singer Hayley Williams addressed Spears' suffering.\n\nNo artist today would have to endure the literal torture that media/society/utter misogynists inflicted upon her, wrote Williams. The mental health awareness conversation, culturally, could never be where it is without the awful price she has paid.\n\nFraming Britney fired fans up about how people treated Spears, including:\n\nBritney Spears drops 'Matches' collaboration with the Backstreet Boys\n\nSurprise! Previously unheard Britney Spears song 'Swimming In the Stars' drops on singer's 39th birthday\n\nJustin Timberlake's comments on Spears, sex\n\nSpears reconnected with her All New Mickey Mouse Club co-star, and the two dated for a few years before splitting in 2002. There is speculation they broke up because Spears was unfaithful, which Timberlake appeared to fuel with the release of the music video for his 2002 single Cry Me A River. It featured a Spears lookalike, on whom Timberlake exacts revenge by recording a steamy make-out session with another woman.\n\nA clip from a radio interview with Timberlake featured in Framing Britney depicts another instance when former boy-bander didn't always show compassion for his ex, who at one point said she desired to remain a virgin until marriage. Asked if he slept with Spears, he playfully responds, OK, I did it! but seems to backtrack, though the audio is unclear. Timberlake's 2002 interview with Barbara Walters shows a better example of his lack of restraint when it came to his sex life with Spears (though the moment is not included in the doc). Walters asked whether the couple abstained from sex during their relationship. Instead of shutting the question down, he says, Sure, and then lets out an uncomfortable laugh.\n\nSome on Twitter demanded Timberlake extend an apology to Spears for his transgressions depicted in the documentary.\n\nToday's a great day for @jtimberlake to publicly own up to his misogyny and apologize to Britney Spears, one user wrote. #FramingBritneySpears #FreeBritney\n\nI don't care that it's been well over a decade, another posted, Justin Timberlake still owes Britney Spears an apology for framing her as a cheater in the public eye and pouring gasoline on the paparazzi fire send tweet.\n\nIn a tweet to Timberlake directly, another shared: You have to publicly apologize to @britneyspears for what you've done. And you call yourself a man?! Puah.\n\nBritney Spears is 'afraid of father' Jamie, lawyer says; judge declines to rule on conservatorship\n\nThe 10 best albums of 2020, including Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers and Chloe x Halle\n\nDiane Sawyer brings up Kendel Ehrlich's remarks\n\nSawyer is a target for criticism by documentary views thanks to a 2003 interview with Spears included in Framing Britney.\n\nThe then-ABC anchor asked Spears about her high-profile breakup with Timberlake and brought up comments from former Maryland first lady Kendel Ehrlich, who said, ... really, if I had an opportunity to shoot Britney Spears, I think I would.\n\nOh, that's horrible! a shocked Spears said during the sit-down. That's really bad.\n\nWhen looking solely at the snippet included in the documentary, Sawyer seems to justify Ehrlich's remarks, explaining to Spears: Because of the example for kids and how hard it is to be a parent.\n\nEvery Britney interviewer from the old clips in #FramingBritneySpears that is still alive, owes Britney a public apology, one Twitter user asserted. You can go first @DianeSawyer\n\nAwful, another member of the Twitterverse wrote in reply. 'She feels like you're a bad influence for her kids' how is that even a reason to harm someone????????\n\nThe Weeknd delivers a charismatic Super Bowl halftime show, but he was no Beyoncé or Prince\n\nThe Weeknd's Super Bowl 55 backup dancers had bandaged faces and Twitter has thoughts\n\n'The paparazzi destroyed Britney Spears'\n\nThe documentary highlights another vulnerable Spears moment from a 2006 talk with disgraced former Today host Matt Lauer. Through tears, she tells him being left alone by the paparazzi would be one of her biggest wishes.\n\nBut they didn't relent. The following year, photographers snapped the singer, supposedly after her ex-husband Federline denied her request to see their children.\n\nDaniel Ramos, then a paparazzo, tried to interview Spears, triggering her so much that she struck his automobile with an umbrella.\n\nThat night was not a good night for her, he says in the documentary. It was not a good night for us. But it was a good night for us, 'cause it was a money shot.\n\nFor one Twitter user, the doc offered clarity on the incident. I now understand the infamous 2007 Britney moment, the person wrote. And I would totally beat the (expletive) outta that paparazzi car window too.\n\nAnother user declared: The paparazzi destroyed Britney Spears.\n\nRamos, however, takes no responsibility for Spears' mental health. Working on her for so many years, she never gave a clue or information to us that 'I don't appreciate you guys. Leave me the F alone.' \n\nOther resurfacings: Sarah Silverman and Craig Ferguson\n\nThe documentary has stirred up other moments that didn't make it into the doc itself, including Sarah Silverman, who is coming under fire for comments she made about Spears at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nIn the clip, Silverman says onstage, She's a mother. It's a crazy. It's weird to think that just a few years ago on this very show she was this, like, sweet, innocent, little girl in slutty clothes riding around with a python.\n\nSilverman went on to call the singer's children the most adorable mistakes you will ever see before making a NSFW joke about Spears' body.\n\nTwitter user @joshcharles_21 shared the clip Sunday and wrote, um @SarahKSilverman girl what is this explain yourself x\n\nSilverman responded, saying she was known then 4 roasts.\n\nMTV asked me to mini-roast Britney after her big performance, Silverman tweeted, saying she was in the bathroom and going over her jokes while Spears was performing. Had no idea she didn't kill. Unfortunate. Art changes over yrs as we know more & the world changes.\n\nIn another tweet, she added, I wish I could delete it but I can't. But you are posting it for people to see. So r u trying to be kind or right?\n\nA more positive resurfaced commentary involving Spears is Craig Ferguson's defense of the star during a 2007 monologue on the Late Late Show.\n\nIn a clip that was re-shared to Twitter Monday (and has garnered more than 145,000 likes since), host Ferguson showed some sympathy for the singer.\n\nI'm starting to feel uncomfortable making fun of these people, he said. Comedy should have a certain amount of joy in it. It should be about us attacking the powerful people, attacking the politicians and the Trumps and the blowhards, going after them. We shouldn't be attacking the vulnerable people.\n\nHe continued, I think my aim's been off a bit and I want to change it. So tonight, no Britney Spears jokes. This woman has two kids. She's 25 years old. She's a baby herself. She's a baby.\n\nContributing: Charles Trepany, Cydney Henderson
MINONG, Wis. – The gatherings were typical of what takes place when teenagers get together at the holidays after high school graduation.\n\nFriendships stretched by distance, experiences or both are renewed. College life is compared with work life, which is compared with military life. Contact information is updated and shared.\n\nThat was true when recent graduates of the Northwood School of Minong got together toward the end of 2015 – except for Jake Patterson.\n\nEven with the guys with whom he'd been closest in the group of 34 students, Patterson wasn't interested in staying in touch, a friend's mother recalled. He didn't give out his email address, didn't want anyone's phone number.\n\nHe was always pretty quiet, which I thought was a little odd, said Minong resident Victoria Fisher, whose son Dylan had been running buddies with Patterson on and off while the two attended the tiny K-12 school in northwestern Wisconsin.\n\nBut I chalked it up to Jake just wanting a little independence for himself.\n\nMore:Jake Patterson hosted a Christmas party while Jayme Closs was imprisoned in the same house, sources say\n\nMore:Jake Patterson, suspect in Closs case, was discharged early from Marines because of character issues\n\nAs it turned out, it was a step in a journey that saw Patterson grow increasingly isolated from friends, classmates and almost everyone except immediate family.\n\nSome schoolmates thought Patterson was serving in the Marine Corps, probably as an infantryman as he'd vowed he would via a message in their 2015 yearbooks. Others, if they bumped into him at one of the handful of jobs he cycled through after graduation, assumed he'd begun a career at a local meat-packing plant or a wood-pellet factory.\n\nHis increasing isolation continued until late 2018 when Patterson, four months after his 21st birthday, was so far off people's radar that he was able to avoid being a suspect in the shotgun slayings of a Barron County couple and the kidnapping of their 13-year-old daughter, Jayme Closs. That's despite, as prosecutors now allege, having held Jayme captive for nearly three months in the house where he'd lived since 2006.\n\nNow, his classmates and their families struggle to make sense of the news.\n\nHe isn't the person I would've guessed out of my class to do something like this, said a woman who attended Northwood with Patterson for 12 years; like several other classmates, she asked that her name not be used. It makes all of us who knew him sad … but it also makes a lot of us angry.\n\nWe trusted this classmate and friend, she said, and he did something horrible.\n\nA move, then divorce\n\nPatterson was born June 17, 1997. He was the youngest child of Patrick, an electrical-supply worker, and Deborah Moyer Patterson, a homemaker. The couple had married in 1989. Jake was their third child, joining Katie, then 5; and Erik, almost 4.\n\nThough little is known about Jake's childhood, public records show the family spent his first eight years in a small house on 2.5 wooded acres off South Black Widow Road, a rural dead-end street in the woods of Wascott, a Douglas County town of fewer than 800 residents.\n\nDeborah Patterson, now living in Haugen, in Barron County, didn't respond to a note requesting an interview. Patrick Patterson couldn't be reached.\n\nIn June 2005, one of his parents decided the marriage was broken, filing papers seeking a divorce or separation. But that case was never finalized, and records of the filing aren't available.\n\nTen months later, the family bought the house in Gordon where Jake is accused of imprisoning Jayme and moved 15 miles east from Black Widow Road.\n\nMore:Gifts and support pour in for Jayme Closs after abducted teen's escape\n\nMore:Church of Jayme Closs' mother holds service to honor Wisconsin teen's return\n\nIn October 2007, the Pattersons were back in divorce court by mutual agreement. This time it was for real.\n\nAs the calendar turned to 2008, Deborah moved to Minong. Her husband agreed to pay $800 in monthly child support, $40,000 for her stake in the house, and to grant her a share of his work pension and $28,000 from his profit-sharing plan.\n\nOn March 31, 2008, the marriage was legally dissolved. The children, court papers show, would split time between their parents' houses, switching homes every other week.\n\nJake Patterson was 10.\n\n'Just kind of there'\n\nWhen he began high school at Northwood in 2011, Patterson didn't present a memorable figure.\n\nHe was just kind of there, one classmate would later recall of the freshman whose 2012 yearbook photo shows him smiling in a T-shirt, tousled brown hair and glasses.\n\nSaid another: He did keep to himself a lot, but we had no issues. … He had a few close friends.\n\nSuperintendent Jean Serum this month called Patterson a quiet kid and a good student. She said he was part of Northwood's Quiz Bowl team, which competed academically against other schools, but didn't participate in sports or other activities. He read a lot – often Tom Clancy thrillers.\n\nBefore junior year, students noticed changes. He began sporting a crewcut. And he showed flashes of a temper, although a classmate said he wasn't the only student to do so.\n\nMore:Father of Jake Patterson has a letter for Jayme Closs' family\n\nMore:Jake Patterson's car was seen the night of Jayme Closs' kidnapping, but cops didn't have enough to pull him over\n\nSomething simple like someone throwing a ball (in gym class) and hitting him in the face by accident would set him off, the longtime acquaintance said. He would cry or get really upset and whip a ball back with anger. That's the closest I'd seen him be violent.\n\nProblems began to emerge on the home front, too. And his potential support group had grown smaller.\n\nAt some point – it's unclear when – his father moved out of the house in Gordon, neighbor Daphne Ronning said. With their sister already gone, it was just Jake and Erik, who was almost four years older.\n\nWe had some problems with them when they were teenagers – we caught them siphoning gas, Ronning recalled. After a talking-to from her husband, though, there was never anything else.\n\nJake had no legal troubles, but Erik had brushes with the law: a 2013 conviction for fourth-degree sexual assault, then a 2014 conviction for bail-jumping and two felony counts of manufacturing or delivering THC, the compound that gives marijuana its potency. The latter resulted in an eight-month jail sentence.\n\nAs graduation approached in 2015, Jake was ready to be done with school. He skipped prom, his class trip and the senior photo, and spoke of a plan to join the Marines.\n\nClassmates voted him most quiet.\n\n'I hope he gets what he deserves'\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps' basic-training course lasts 13 weeks. Patterson began it in September 2015 in San Diego. He was thrown out in week five, a time when recruits typically have yet to begin rifle marksmanship and field-training.\n\nBack in Wisconsin in 2016, he quit a job at a Barron turkey-processing plant after one day. At some point, he worked at a wood-pellet factory in Hayward, but quit after a day or two.\n\nA job in October at Saputo Cheese USA near Almena yielded a similar result: two days, then done. Police said he was on his way to work at the cheese plant when he saw Jayme Closs board a school bus in Barron, and decided he'd kidnap her.\n\nPeople who know Patterson remain stunned. Fisher said her son, who didn't want to be interviewed for this story, has spent sleepless nights periodically interrupted by tears.\n\nI'd thought, 'Boy, there's a kid who's got it together, who's gonna go far in life,' said Fisher, who recalled Patterson coming over to play video games and the board game Risk. Now he's got this whole community torn up.\n\nHis longtime classmate says she holds out hope for Jayme Closs' future, but not for Patterson's.\n\nI just hope,' she said, that little girl can come back from this and live a somewhat normal life. And I hope (Patterson) gets what he deserves – which is probably life in prison.\n\nMore:Jake Patterson targeted Jayme Closs after seeing her board school bus, complaint says\n\nMore:After 88 days of horror, how Jayme Closs and her small town of Barron can heal\n\nContributing: Bill Glauber, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nFollow Doug Schneider on Twitter: @PGDougSchneider
Thomas Content\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nMILWAUKEE — The inversion crackdown by the Obama administration that blocked Pfizer's big merger won't stop Johnson Controls Inc.'s merger with Tyco International, the companies announced Thursday.\n\nThe announcement came in a filing with securities regulators. The companies said they have completed their review of the new rules, announced earlier this month, and that the deal is expected to be completed on schedule Oct. 1.\n\nThe new rules represented the Treasury Department's third attempt in recent years to thwart companies looking to move their headquarters offshore for tax purposes. Inversions have become an issue on the presidential campaign trail this year, with Democrats calling the tax-shifting moves unpatriotic and Republicans arguing the practice underscores the need for tax reform.\n\nAnalysts and tax experts who weighed in on the Treasury Department's latest attempt to make inversion deals more difficult had predicted it would not stop the Tyco-Johnson marriage, but the companies had declined to comment on the impact of the regulations until Thursday.\n\nRemaining tax-cutting inversions fight to survive\n\nSignificantly, the companies said they still expect the deal to deliver $650 million in operational and tax savings over three years. When the deal was announced in January, the companies said they expected $500 million in operational savings and $150 million in tax savings as a result of the combined company being headquartered in Ireland.\n\nFollowing a review of the U.S. Department of Treasury's Temporary and Proposed Tax Regulations issued on April 4, 2016, Tyco and Johnson Controls today confirm that they will proceed with their merger plans and that the combined company expects to deliver $650 million in operational and global tax synergies over the first three years after closing, the companies said in the filing.\n\nMilwaukee-based Johnson Controls (JCI) company is in the midst of several transformational moves, including its merger with Tyco International (TYC) and its plan to spin off its automotive business into a separate company, to be known as Adient.\n\nBoth will be run from Milwaukee. Johnson Controls will become an Irish company for tax purposes and adopt Tyco's Ireland office as its global headquarters. But its primary North American headquarters will be in Wisconsin.\n\nIn conjunction with its earnings announcement, Johnson Controls signaled that its automotive business also will be domiciled in Ireland. Without saying that specifically, the company said the spinoff would be completed at the end of October, after its merger is completed, and that the automotive seating business would have a tax rate in the range of 10% to 12%.\n\nJohnson Controls disputes Hillary Clinton on tax inversion\n\nJohnson Controls' own tax rate last year was 19%, and the company said in January it expected the combined company would have a tax rate of 12%.\n\nThe announcement came as Johnson Controls executives prepared to update analysts and investors on the company's performance and merger planning in conjunction with its second-quarter results.\n\nThis is a truly historic time for our company. We continue to make significant progress on our path to building two leading, independent global companies, said Alex Molinaroli, chairman and chief executive, in a statement. The merger between Johnson Controls and Tyco is expected to close October 1, 2016. My confidence that this powerful combination will create a world leader in buildings and energy technologies with significant strategic value for our customers, employees and shareholders just continues to grow.\n\nJohnson Controls reported a loss of $530 million, or 82 cents a share, in the quarter, with its results weighed down by merger, tax and severance expenses. Excluding the one-time items, the company said its operating profit was 86 cents a share, 4 cents above the forecast of analysts who track the company. The company increased its operating profit outlook for the full fiscal year.\n\nJohnson Controls, Tyco merge in tax-avoiding inversion deal\n\nThe company's quarterly sales fell to $9 billion from $9.2 billion. The company said its strongest performance came from a 33% jump in sales for its building efficiency business, the heating and cooling equipment and controls unit based in downtown Milwaukee. That business saw strong growth and announced several key new orders, including a $67.8 million contract over 23 years for energy improvements at the Norfolk Naval Base and a partnership with Target Stores to replace heating and cooling equipment at 225 stores to maximize energy savings.\n\nThe company reported sales were unchanged in its battery business, which saw a 60% increase in shipments to China, Johnson Controls' key market for growth. China sales in the automotive seating and interiors business grew 51%.\n\nJohnson Controls is Wisconsin's largest company based on sales, with $37 billion in revenues last year. That was split among its three businesses, which supply car batteries, car seats and other auto parts, and building heating and cooling equipment and controls.\n\nFollow Thomas Content on Twitter: @plugged_in
Pamela Anderson and producer Jon Peters are married, The Hollywood Reporter and People confirmed.\n\nThe news outlets reported the couple secretly wed in a private Malibu ceremony Monday.\n\nThey are very much in love and were married yesterday, Anderson's publicist Matthew Berritt told People.\n\nIn a statement to THR, Peters said, There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but – for 35 years – I've only wanted Pamela.\n\nAnderson shared a statement with THR in the form of a poem, which partly read, Jon is the original 'bad boy' of Hollywood / no one compares / I love him deeply like family ...

I will support the happy couple however I can, and I'm excited to get to know Jon's family even better.\n\nThe nuptials mark the fifth marriage for both Anderson, 52, and Peters, 74, who dated each other more than 30 years ago.\n\nAnderson was married to musician Tommy Lee, Kid Rock and twice to poker player Rick Salomon. She had a close relationship with Julian Assange.\n\nPeters was married to Henrietta Zampitella, film producers Christine Forsyth-Peters and Mindy Peters and actress Lesley Ann Warren.\n\nAnderson and Peters both have children from previous relationships; Peters has five, and Anderson has two.\n\nAnderson is best known for her role in the 1989 series Baywatch. She also starred in 1996's Barb Wire and 2003's Scary Movie 3.\n\nPeters had producing roles in 2018's A Star Is Born, 2006's Superman Returns and 1989's Batman.\n\nMore:Oprah Winfrey reveals why she never married Stedman Graham, recalls thinking he was a 'player'\n\nMore:Kathy Griffin drops surprise video of her New Year's wedding that Lily Tomlin officiated
Anthony McCartney\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES — Attorneys for Robin Thicke's ex-wife in a court filing made public Thursday accused the singer of tampering with a court order.\n\nThe documents by attorneys for actress Paula Patton, 41, filed this week accuse Thicke, 39, of altering a custody court order and attempting to get her arrested in front of their 6-year-old son during a bitter custody dispute.\n\nIt was the latest dose of poisonous accusations in the Thicke/Patton battle, yet another toxic celebrity split involving minor children currently feeding the voracious celebrity media. They join Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie who are divorcing and fighting over custody of their six kids under 15, and Lisa Presley and her fourth husband who are divorcing and fighting over custody of their 8-year-old twin girls.\n\nThe Thicke filing became public a day before a trial is scheduled to begin in Patton's efforts to obtain a five-year restraining order against the Blurred Lines singer.\n\nPaula Patton, Robin Thicke engage in new custody battle\n\nPatton has accused Thicke of being physically abusive to her during their marriage, and severely spanking their son. In late January, she obtained a temporary restraining order requiring Thicke to stay away from her and see his son only under supervision.\n\nThicke has denied he has abused his son and his former attorney has said there was no basis for Patton's domestic violence allegations, calling them retaliatory. Phone and email messages left seeking comment from one of Thicke's current attorneys, Angela Pierce DiDonato, were not immediately returned.\n\nPatton contends the singer's alleged alteration of a court custody order and attempts to get her arrested are part of an effort to harass, intimidate and cause her emotional distress and constitute domestic violence.\n\nMr. Thicke's egregious, premeditated and unlawful domestic violence has terrorized Patton and their son, the court documents said.\n\nPatton's attorneys said the restraining order trial could include as many as 26 witnesses and last 15 days or more.\n\nHer filing also accuses Thicke of trying to manipulate a child services investigation by taking a case worker out to an expensive sushi restaurant with his son while the case was active. However, the court order requires a monitor be present for all visits between Thicke and his son, including at restaurants, and the monitors don't eat.\n\nA message seeking comment from the Department of Children and Family Services was not immediately returned but its policy is to not comment under any circumstances anyway.\n\nJudge OKs restraining order against Robin Thicke after Patton alleges abuse\n\nPatton was granted sole custody of the boy on Jan. 26 and a judge ordered Thicke to stay away from his ex-wife and her home.\n\nTo obtain the temporary restraining order, Patton included a sworn declaration alleging Thicke was abusive during their marriage and pushed her to the ground and kicked her during a fight in April 2013. S\n\nShe also cited a Jan. 19 incident in which she stated Thicke showed up at her mother's house while their son was being interviewed by child services workers and then refused to leave. After the child services workers left, Thicke banged on the door and demanded to see his son, leaving only after Patton's mother called police, Patton wrote.\n\nThicke's lawyers have said in court filings that the singer was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nThicke's former attorney, Larry Ginsberg, accused Patton of manipulating her son to gain full custody. Ginsberg and his law firm were disqualified from working for Thicke on Tuesday because a new lawyer in his firm once worked for lawyers representing Patton and may have learned inside information about the case.\n\nThe legal fighting between Thicke and Patton began weeks after the singer's father, Growing Pains actor Alan Thicke, died in December.\n\nThicke, whose biggest hit was the 2013 song Blurred Lines, and Patton dated for 10 years before marrying in June 2005. She filed for divorce in October 2014, and their judgment was finalized a few months later.
Bill Keveney\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES — This Is Us fans want to learn the details of Jack Pearson's death, but Milo Ventimiglia, who plays the husband and father of three, has a different perspective.\n\nLast week, NBC's hit drama, which jumps between decades to show the Pearson family at various stages of life, hinted at Jack's demise in a scene from the 1990s. In Tuesday's first-season finale (9 ET/PT), he and wife Rebecca (Mandy Moore), get the spotlight, toggling between eras.\n\nEveryone, particularly now, is so focused on when he dies, how he dies, why he dies. I think the opposite. I think you focus on how he lives, why he lives, Ventimiglia says. None of us know when we'll meet our ends. You just have to appreciate life and move positively through life.\n\nAs Ventimiglia, 39, absorbs Jack's unusual status as a central character who's long deceased in the present day, the Heroes and Gilmore Girls alum understands the special nature of the critically acclaimed Us. The series, which has brought many viewers to tears with its emotionally charged scenes, received a rare two-season renewal, reflecting its status as TV's No. 1 new series among young adults.\n\nWith Heroes, it felt like we were there to entertain, whereas This Is Us feels like we're doing important work, he says. When someone approaches me just to talk about how one moment in one episode got them to reach out to their adopted father or connect with their sibling, I feel like we are getting (people) to face themselves and then reflect a little differently.\n\nVentimiglia praises Moore for helping to make the Pearsons' marriage feel real. Any of the struggle I've ever had with (interpreting) Jack, the second I look in Mandy's eyes, I'm right there with her and I'm him, he says. The nice part has just been having Mandy to partner with, shoulder to shoulder, the whole time.\n\nBecause Jack is dead in the present, Ventimiglia hasn't shared screen time with series regulars Justin Hartley and Chrissy Metz, who play adult versions of his children, Kevin and Kate. (In one episode, he appeared in a hallucination to son Randall, played by Sterling K. Brown.)\n\nI do miss acting with people from the cast. It's rare when you have such a talented group of performers assembled with such amazing material, he says. But I did a scene with Sterling, so I'm slowly going to rack them up, hopefully, over the entirety of the series.\n\nVentimiglia — whose facial hair has been a useful guide to the show's time jumps — and Moore have acted with infant, child and teen versions of the Pearson kids. Ventimiglia, who's single and has no children, appreciates the rewards and demands of fatherhood, and he's assumed a bit of a parental role with the young actors.\n\nI'm getting to exercise a muscle of fatherhood that I haven't ever worked out myself, he says. I have nieces and nephews I care about. I want them to feel safe and take in all the good sides of life. That's the way I approach working with these kids.\n\nExecutive producer Ken Olin, who directed the season finale, credits Ventimiglia for providing early insight about salt of the Earth Jack, who is less lyrical in speech and expressive emotionally than some other Us characters.\n\nFor Jack, Rebecca was enough, but that's not who Rebecca is. Rebecca is unsettled and Jack has a certainty. Milo found that in the pilot, says Olin, who has on- and off-screen expertise with such family dramas as ABC's thirtysomething and Brothers & Sisters. This character is so important to the show because he's different.\n\nAlthough Jack is a decent man, whom Ventimiglia modeled on his own father, his family focus squelches his wife's longtime dream of being a singer. He is hardly supportive when she goes on tour with a band, leaving him to care for their teens. Jack isn't jealous so much as he's protective of his family structure, Ventimiglia says.\n\nFrustration leads to heavy drinking, a dangerous prelude when Jack decides to drive to his wife's first tour stop at the end of last week's episode. His inevitable death — which fans previously learned happens in that 1990s era — was further underlined in a present-day scene in which Kate blames herself for her father's passing.\n\nTo avoid spoiling the finale, Ventimiglia gets philosophical when discussing Jack's fate and future on a show where characters, including Randall's biological father, William (Ron Cephas Jones), can die but continue to be seen in another era.\n\nI always go back to: The answer is going to reveal itself when it's supposed to, he says. Even when we discover how Jack died, it doesn't mean his story is ending, which is a nice thing about the show. There is no real end.
Bachelor Nation, hometowns are here. And you know what means: Concerned parents, proclamations of love and deeper narrowing of the competition.\n\nBuckle up, everyone. You might not see this one coming.\n\nWe start off with first impression-rose winner Hannah Ann in Knoxville, Tennessee. Hannah Ann's father, Rick, works in the lumber industry as a forester, and there are two ways to impress him: Good character, and being tough. Ah, yes, traditional masculinity (we're rolling our eyes).\n\nThe two go ax-throwing, and neither are particularly good at it. Peter manages to nail a bullseye, which foreshadows the successful date to come. No, that's not a spoiler: What did you think was going to happen?\n\nIf you watched last week's episode, you'll remember that Hannah Ann wrote a letter to Peter detailing all the things she loved about him. He returns the favor this week and lets her know that he loves how intentional she is, how she gives him butterflies and how she has a name for every dress she's worn.\n\nTime to meet the parents. Hannah Ann's mom, Jennifer, warns Peter that Rick is guarded and won't give her away to just anybody. Peter explains to Rick that he has something real with Hannah Ann, and that he hopes to tell her that he's falling in love with her. Rick doesn't want him to say it unless he means it.\n\nApparently he does. Peter tells her! And Hannah Ann has an announcement of her own: She's in love with him. Rose one seemingly secured.\n\nLast week:'The Bachelor' recap: Peter picks final four women for hometown dates; pressure ratchets up\n\nKelsey tells Peter she's in love with him\n\nNext up is a visit to Kelsey's hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. She takes Peter to a winery where they stomp on grapes and make their own bottle of wine. They dance while grape-stomping – a blatant audition tape for Dancing With the Stars, if we're being honest with ourselves.\n\nPeter cannot stop himself from making wine metaphors about their relationship. It's that perfect blend that just makes you want to keep coming back, he says.\n\nKelsey tells him that she's in love with him. Will he ultimately find this too sweet?\n\nWhen she loves, she loves like no other, her mother Beth tells Peter later. She warns him not to break Kelsey's heart.\n\nGulp.\n\nYes this is a real thing:What is 'Bachelor Live on Stage' exactly? Show veterans explain ahead of national tour\n\nMadison is keeping a secret from Peter\n\nPeter heads south for a date with Madison in Auburn, Alabama. The pair play basketball at Auburn University's Auburn Arena (Madison's dad is an Auburn Tigers coach).\n\nRetired basketball player and Inside the NBA analyst Charles Barkley warns Peter over the Jumbotron to treat Madison right, and Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl stops by before they play some one-on-one. Madison wins, obviously.\n\nThe pair head to dinner with Madison's family, including parents Tonya and Chad. Tonya later asks Madison if she's talked to Peter about decisions she's made about her relationships. This has been hinted about it previews but now we know: Madison is saving herself for marriage – and Peter doesn't know it. Yes, this is the same man who slept with Hannah Brown four times in that windmill.\n\nMadison was hoping to tell Peter she was in love with him, but is still trying to figure out if their spirits and souls are compatible. Telling him the truth might help matters!\n\nThe cuts this season have been odd:'The Bachelor' recap: Peter eliminates another four contestants – including some surprises\n\nVictoria F. and Peter's hometown date is a disaster\n\nThe show pays a visit to Virginia Beach, Virginia, for Peter's hometown date with Victoria F. The day stars off great: They pose in costumes at Old Time Photos, eat ice cream and dance to a live performance by Hunter Hayes.\n\nAppropriately, he sings I Want Crazy, echoing the sentiment Peter left Victoria F. with toward the end of last week's episode.\n\nBut then the date actually turns crazy.\n\nA woman from Peter's past named Marissa – her face is obscured by the camera – approaches him. They apparently knew each other in 2012 (we later learn she's an ex-girlfriend) and her hometown just so happens to be Virginia Beach. Convenient!\n\nMarissa warns him about Victoria F. Be careful, she says. She used to be her friend, and apparently Victoria F. has broken up many relationships. Marissa doesn't think this is a good one for Peter to be in.\n\nWhen it's time to meet Victoria F.'s family, Peter pulls her aside. He notes that her ex Chase Rice stopped by one of their dates, and now his ex interrupted this one. Victoria denies causing these supposed breakups and is disgusted.\n\nDo you think that I enjoy this right now? Peter says, asking if she thinks there was any way he wouldn't address it. He wants the truth, but Victoria F. says it doesn't matter anymore. (Peter: The fact she can't have a rational conversation with you portends a horrible future. Run!)\n\nPeter apologizes if it sounded like he was taking Marissa's side, because that's not what he was doing. Victoria F. explains she wanted to tell him that she was falling in love with him, and wonders how they're supposed to move forward from this.\n\nPeter opts to leave before he gets a chance to meet her family. They find her outside and comfort her. Does that mean she's off the show?\n\nThe next day, she says she's falling in love with him. He feels like she doesn't want him to love her the way he wants to love her, and that they lack communication skill. You think?\n\nDid you see this? 'Bachelor' contestant Victoria Fuller apologizes for White Lives Matter controversy\n\nWho goes home on 'The Bachelor' this week?\n\nHannah Ann and Madison nab the first two roses. The third goes to ... Victoria F., which means he cuts Kelsey. It looks like their wine soured after all.\n\nKelsey told him she was in love with him, but Peter wasn't quite there.\n\nBefore the episode ends, Madison asks to talk. Will she finally tell him her secret? We'll have to wait.\n\nAlways funny:'Ha ha, I love that': J.J.

Tax refunds are coming in smaller versus last year, the Internal Revenue Service reported.\n\nThe average tax refund issued so far fell to $1,865, down 8.4 percent from $2,035 at the same time last year, according to IRS statistics. The number of refunds issued also dropped by 24.3 percent.\n\nOverall, the number of returns the agency has processed so far is off 25.8 percent versus the same time last year. The IRS has also received 12.4 percent fewer returns from taxpayers. The earliest taxpayers could file returns was Jan. 28. In most states, the last day you can file is April 15.\n\nMarriage goals?:Financial bliss: More married couples have roommates to help with costs, Trulia study shows\n\nWe have said people will be surprised, but how that comes out in the aggregate is to be seen, says Kathy Pickering, executive director of H&R Block's Tax Institute. Don't put too much into these initial numbers from the IRS, because the volume is down, and it may be hard to parse out the tax reform impact from the shutdown impact.\n\nTax professionals have been warning that refunds could be smaller than expected if people didn't adjust their paycheck withholdings after the new tax law changes.\n\nThe amount withheld from your paycheck is determined by how many allowances you claim on your W-4 tax form. The more allowances you claim, the less money is withheld from your paycheck.\n\nWhat now?:Wells Fargo fixes outage issue that caused some paychecks not to appear in accounts\n\nThe federal government decides how much an allowance is worth. For the 2018 tax year, the Treasury Department tried to find an allowance value that improved withholding accuracy, so what you pay in taxes from your paycheck over the year is approximately the same as your total tax liability.\n\nGetting a smaller refund doesn't mean you're paying more in total in taxes. In many cases, much of your tax savings showed up in each paycheck, which could result in a smaller refund.
Brent Schrotenboer\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nSAN DIEGO – The owner of the Chargers once came to a startling conclusion about the future of his franchise in Los Angeles.\n\nAfter one season in L.A. in 1960, he realized his team couldn't draw crowds and couldn't make money in the same market as the Rams.\n\nSo he left – for San Diego, in 1961. We can't compete in the same market with the Rams, team owner Barron Hilton said then, according to the book The Way We Were in San Diego.\n\nMORE CHARGERS COVERAGE:\n\nCongrats, San Diego, you win by losing Chargers\n\nChargers plan to play in smallest 'NFL stadium' for next two seasons\n\nRoger Goodell: Chargers 'did everything they could' to stay in San Diego\n\nBut now one of his successors has reached the opposite conclusion.\n\nChargers owner Dean Spanos announced Thursday his team was moving back to L.A. because it couldn't compete with the rest of the league financially at his old stadium in San Diego.\n\nInstead, he's betting that he will not only compete with the Rams in L.A, but he'll also be better off sharing a stadium with them in nearby Inglewood, scheduled to open in 2019.\n\nThe Chargers are determined to fight for L.A. and we are excited to get started, Spanos said in a statement.\n\nWhere will they play?\n\nUntil the Inglewood stadium is ready, the team will play in the StubHub Center in nearby Carson, which will be by far the smallest stadium in the league at 30,000 seats. The Chargers need to be cool in L.A., where they will be challenged to stand out in the crowd of many pro and college sports teams.\n\nBy playing in such an intimate, novel NFL setting, they hope to be a hot ticket.\n\nThe experience for our fans at StubHub Center will be fun and entertaining, and every seat will feel close to the action, said a statement from A.G. Spanos, Spanos' son and a team executive.\n\nBy contrast, the Rams are temporarily playing in the much older and spacious L.A. Coliseum.\n\nWill the team change its name?\n\nNot likely. They've always been the Chargers even when they were in L.A. 57 years ago. But they already have changed their logo to something that looks like an italicized version of the classic L.A. Dodgers logo. Either that, or it's the offspring of a marriage between the Dodgers' logo and the logo of the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Lightning joked about it on Twitter, saying that for the record, us & the @dodgers are just friends.\n\nHow is San Diego reacting?\n\nPredictably, with anger and sadness. The team leaves behind 56 years of memories here, with many great players, including Dan Fouts and Junior Seau. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said at a news conference Thursday that Spanos made a bad decision, and he will regret it.\n\nSan Diego didn't lose the Chargers, he said. The Chargers just lost San Diego.\n\nSan Diego County Supervisor Ron Roberts ripped the Chargers on Twitter and compared them to former Los Angeles Clipper owner Donald Sterling, who moved the team from San Diego in 1984. Before that, San Diego lost another NBA team, the Rockets, who moved to Houston in 1971.\n\nThe Chargers will stand next to Donald Sterling in the Hall of Shame, Roberts wrote on Twitter. It hurts, but we will move on.\n\nFans showed up at Chargers headquarters in San Diego to discard their jerseys and other Chargers' gear. One started to burn a team flag before it was snuffed out by security.\n\nHow does L.A. feel about this?\n\nDoes it even know the Rams moved back last year? It's hard to stand out in the entertainment capital of the world. And the Chargers have no history there, unless you count their invisible year there in 1960, when they sometimes drew 10,000 in a Coliseum that seated about 100,000, according to the aforementioned book by Richard Crawford.\n\nThe last time the L.A. market had two teams, in 1994, the Raiders and Rams ranked 24th and 28th out of 28 NFL teams in home attendance with 42,000 and 51,000 per game, according to STATS, LLC.\n\nThe bet is the market is so big now that two well-marketed, well-managed teams can take advantage of it. They'll both probably need to improve. The Rams finished 4-12 this year and fired their coach. The Chargers finished 5-11, fired their coach and moved.\n\nKnowing they've got work to do, the Chargers unveiled a new website Thursday called fightforla.com.\n\nThis isn't any city, the team's website said. This is Los Angeles. L.A. is people and places and passion and pride. Any respect given, must be earned.\n\nHow and why is this happening?\n\nSpanos exercised an option given to him exactly one year ago by the NFL at the same time the league approved the relocation of the Rams from St. Louis. The Chargers could move in with the Rams or stay indefinitely in San Diego at Qualcomm Stadium, one of the oldest and worst stadiums in the NFL.\n\nHe had been trying for 15 years to get a new stadium in San Diego but never could reach a deal with the city or county to help pay for it. He wanted taxpayer funding to pay for a big portion. He didn't get it. In November, 56% of voters rejected a plan to raise hotel taxes to help fund a new $1.8 billion stadium and convention center downtown.\n\nAs difficult as the news is for Charger fans, I know Dean Spanos and his family did everything they could to try to find a viable solution in San Diego, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement.\n\nTo break their lease in San Diego, the Chargers are required to pay $12.6 million to the city of San Diego. They also will pay a $650 million NFL relocation fee if it's paid over 10 years. Because of the new stadium and the much bigger market size, the franchise can make more money and become more valuable in the long run in L.A. according to estimates by Vanderbilt sports economist John Vrooman.\n\nWhy didn't the Chargers use that $650 million to pay for a new stadium in San Diego?\n\nThe team reached the conclusion that San Diego's much smaller market size didn't support that level of additional investment. L.A. is a much bigger and wealthier market where it expects greater returns and where the team will share construction costs with the Rams for their new $2.6 billion stadium. The Chargers and NFL had been willing to contribute $650 million toward a stadium in San Diego. Part of that will go toward the Inglewood stadium construction instead, in addition to the NFL relocation fee.
As an actress, singer and now author, Priyanka Chopra has an impressive resume – but let it be known that her road to success wasn't easy.\n\nIn her new memoir, Unfinished, Chopra, 38, chronicles her rise to fame, marriage to Nick Jonas and favorite acting roles while paying tribute to her Indian roots and upbringing that shaped who she is today.\n\nAny Chopra fan will love reading about the DM that initiated her relationship with Jonas, or the story behind her momentous Miss World crowning in 2000. She documents her inspiring friendship with Mindy Kaling and even addresses past controversies of the Quantico Hindu terror plot and her endorsement of skin-lightening creams.\n\nHowever, as the daughter of two Korean immigrants, I was especially moved by Chopra's stories of the trials and tribulations of making it big in both Bollywood and Hollywood. From her resilience as a victim of racism to her bicultural identity influenced by Eastern and Western experiences, Chopra credits her global mindset for broadening her thinking and contributing to her success as an actress.\n\nMovies:Priyanka Chopra gets real about quarantine with Nick Jonas and chasing 'The White Tiger'\n\nUnfinished answers the question: Who is Priyanka? She recalls the childhood experiences in India that sparked her passion for philanthropy and the relationships in the Midwest, Queens and suburban Boston that allowed her to feel welcomed as a brown and different immigrant.\n\nJust as my father came here from his home country to make a name for himself, so did Chopra. She reflects on how she catapulted herself into America's entertainment industry with her charisma and resilience – traits she developed during her beauty-pageant years in India – and recalled that the most daunting part of her experience was the responsibility to represent her culture on a global stage.\n\nRepresenting my country and culture gave me confidence on an international stage, and it would continue to give me confidence as I broke into an industry that can be brutal on those who haven't had their mettle tested in the glare of public scrutiny – the entertainment industry, she writes.\n\nMovies:'Baywatch' star Priyanka Chopra towers as a villain in Louboutins\n\nMany immigrants are familiar with the immense pressure to succeed in the country of opportunities, and Chopra demonstrates exactly how difficult yet rewarding this journey can be. Her stories of experiencing racism and prejudice, both before and after stardom, are a little too familiar to immigrant children like me, who have been mocked for our differences in appearance and culture.\n\nFor instance, hostile remarks made at her high school in Newton, Massachusetts, such as, Do you smell curry coming? or Go back on the elephant you came from, eroded some of her confidence. Even with fame came the reality check that some people would dislike her simply for the color of her skin. Chopra recalled how the excitement of her 2012 musical debut with the song In My City, which premiered on the NFL Network before Thursday Night Football, was destroyed by a storm of explicitly racist hate mail and tweets, including, What's a brown terrorist doing promoting an all-American game?\n\nThis frustration and disappointment with unnecessary hate resonates deeply with me, as my first published article for USA TODAY was met with online criticism – not directed at my journalistic skills, but rather my Asian identity.\n\nChopra's book exemplifies how she persisted in the face of her detractors, especially with the help of those who supported her the most: her parents.\n\nAsk any immigrant child about the sacrifices their parents have made, and the list will be endless. It was refreshing to see such an influential celebrity dedicate much of her success to her parents' overwhelming support and love, from their willingness to send her to America in her teenage years to their decision to give up the hospital they had founded together to support her career. The building of our careers is behind us. She is building hers now. So we have to support her, her father had told her mother.\n\nJust like Chopra's parents, mine too fully supported all of my dreams at the expense of their own –something I am forever grateful for. My hard-working father juggled a gruesome work schedule with rooting for me in the stands of my soccer games, and my mother left her job at the time of my birth to become a full-time mom, making sure America would be a country her daughter could call her home.\n\nThough Unfinished entertainingly documents Chopra's life story, it did more than that for me: Her book inspired.
'Married at First Sight' expert: 'We learn from any past mistakes'\n\nDr. Viviana Coles from the reality TV series Married at First Sight says if the show believes any mistakes or matchmaking errors occur, they try to correct them for future seasons.

Every Swiftie should see these\n\nTaylor Swift was recently named the Artist of the Decade by the American Music Awards, in addition to being named Billboard's Woman of the Decade. Since Taylor's career began when she was in her early teens, she has achieved both commercial and critical success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaylor's talent for showcasing her music by creatively collaborating with top music video directors has been a constant throughout her music career, and she has directed and co-directed several of her own.\n\nHere are 10 unforgettable locales from some of Taylor's most fascinating music videos. You just may want to visit them in person to see if they're just as stunning in real life. (Spoiler alert: They are!)\n\nBlank Space | Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York\n\nBlank Space showcases a lot of Oheka Castle's beauty — Photo courtesy of Oheka\n\nIn Blank Space, Taylor Swift addressed her critics with a fabulously exaggerated, outrageous interpretation of how her detractors have mischaracterized her, and the video is an extravagant continuation of the fun parody version of Swift.\n\nSet in castles and estates, the Taylor of this music video has a seemingly wealthy beau to obsess over, and her cat Olivia makes an early appearance. Several scenes from the video were shot at Oheka Castle, a gorgeous location that serves as a hotel in Huntington, New York. You can stay at the Long Island castle and visit the other locales from the video.\n\nStyle | Caves of Hercules in Tangier, Morocco\n\nThe Caves of Hercules near Tangier, Morocco are unlike any other part of the world — Photo courtesy of iStock / ZAKARIA EL YAMNI\n\nAs the artistic, unusual Style music video begins, we see glimpses of the beauty of Tangier, Morocco in all its glory. The song from Taylor's 1989 album is flirty and fun, and it also hints at moodiness which the music video takes to the next level.\n\nThe video plays with the beauty of the human form and the natural formations at the Caves of Hercules in Tangier, Morocco.

San Camp is considered a luxury safari camp.\n\n22 | Point Dume State Beach in Malibu, California\n\nTaylor parties on the beach with friends in 22 — Photo courtesy of iStock / tommystokes\n\nIn the music video for 22, Taylor embraces her youth wholeheartedly. While she sang of the trials and tribulations of being a teen in one of her earliest tracks called Fifteen, this time she focuses on the fun of being a young woman in her early twenties.\n\nPerfectly matching the song's sentiments, the video shows her in heart-shaped sunglasses and cat ears as she playfully enjoys time with her girlfriends. Part of the video was shot at Point Dume State Beach in Malibu, California.\n\nThe picture-perfect shores of Malibu are a great backdrop for hanging out with friends, so bring some along to reenact the carefree giddiness of the video.\n\nMean | The Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, California\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Orpheum Theatre Los Angeles (@orpheumtheatrela) on Mar 14, 2017 at 12:27pm PDT\n\nThe Mean song and music video were a triumph for Taylor Swift, winning Grammy Awards for Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.

I was on the phone with one of my besties the other day, and I asked her if she and her husband ever disagree on how to load the dishwasher. Of course. He's an engineer. He thinks he knows how to do it better. Note that her husband usually remains in his chair after dinner, and rarely carries his plate to the sink, much less loads it into the dishwasher. But he still has strong opinions on how she should do it.\n\nTo be fair, it's not just men who rearrange the dishes after they're loaded. I have a male colleague who says that his wife doesn't think he loads the dishwasher efficiently.\n\nNeither of these cases is unique. In a study done by Bosch, maker of our current favorite dishwasher, results showed that over 40% of American couples fight about loading the dishwasher. But in their defense, with dishwashers changing, the way our parents taught us to load the dishes may no longer be the most efficient.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYour modern dishwasher may have an adjustable top rack, moveable tines, bottle jets, supports for wine glasses, and a third rack for flatware and utensils. These allow for some variation in the way you load. Even the food you served on the plates affects the best place to put them.\n\nTo keep the peace at home, here are a few suggestions on how to load your dishwasher the right way to get the dishes clean.\n\n1. Place heavier stuff on the lower rack.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Johnny Yu Make sure nothing is blocking the wash arm or detergent dispenser when you load the dishwasher.\n\nPut the big plates and bowls on the bottom, and make sure they're facing the spray. If you're washing a platter or baking pan, place it on the side, so it's not blocking the spray arm or detergent dispenser.\n\n2. Load glasses, cups, and small bowls on the top (or middle) rack.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Johnny Yu Different dishwashers require different loading patterns. Check the owner's manual for specifics.\n\nOrient bowls so that they're facing downward. Do I need to remind you of how gross it is to open a clean dishwasher and find a bowl filled with dishwater?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n3. Mix up the silverware in the basket or place it in the third rack.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Johnny Yu If your dishwasher has a third rack, you can load the flatware in it. This Miele model doesn't even have a cutlery basket.\n\nOkay, I'll admit I struggled with this concept. I liked the idea of putting all the spoons in one compartment, and all the forks in another, with all handles down—easier to unload. But what happens when you do this is that the silverware tends to stick together, so it doesn't get clean. Better to put some pieces in the basket handle down and others the opposite way. Knives are an exception. And, if you have a third rack for cutlery, this may be a moot point.\n\n4. Don't overload.\n\nOverloading makes it hard for the hot water to reach each dish. It may also cause your dishes to break. (Do you hear them rattling against one another when you start the cycle? That could be a clue.) Running a couple of smaller loads will do a better job.\n\n5. Try some other cycles.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Jonathan Chan There's more than just Normal on your dishwasher.\n\nIf your dishes aren't getting clean, it might have nothing to do with the way you're loading. Explore some of the dishwasher's options beyond Normal and Auto. Pots and pans can get cleaner in their own cycle, which takes off more of the crusty gunk. The Light cycle is the one to use with your fancy china. You might even want to use Rinse to hold down odors and keep food stains from drying out, if you're not going to run a full cycle anytime soon.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n6. Read the user manual.\n\nCredit: Reviewed.com / Jonathan Chan If you're not sure how to load something, check the manual.\n\nOkay, I can hear you laughing, but your dishwasher's owner's manual is filled with custom tips and diagrams that explain how and where to load the dishes to get the best cleaning. If you've never seen it, go online to the manufacturer's site and take a look. It may change your life.\n\nAs far as loading the dishwasher correctly goes, I say let the partner who cares most about it load the dishes, and the other can unload when the cycle's done. I'm no marriage counselor, but if you do that, either you'll end up with cleaner dishes, or fewer complaints. Sounds like a win-win.\n\nRelated Video: How to make your dishwasher dry dishes better
Charisse Jones\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFor celebrity sightings, viewers had to look no further than the advertising during Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nThis year's crop of commercials had plenty of star power, more than enough to even keep non-avid football fans tuned into the big game.\n\nThe small screen was filled with big-name stars from movies, music, TV and the sports world. LG Electronics brought Liam Neeson back from the future, talking to his younger self and revealing the company's cutting-edge TV technology. Helen Mirren gave a searing lecture about drunk driving in an ad for Budweiser. Christopher Walken touted Kia's new ) Optima midsize sedan as the ideal car for those who want to stand out from others. And Steve Harvey poked fun at his Miss Universe mix-up in an ad for T-Mobile.\n\nAnd that's just a sampling.\n\nAt least 38 celebrities were slated to appear in commercials during the game, according to E-Poll Market Research. That's more than the 28 celebrities who popped up during game breaks last year, the 26 who starred in commercials the year before, and the 19 in 2013.\n\nThere is a very clear increase in the number of ads using celebrities this year, and most of them are using a lighthearted tone,'' Charles Taylor, a marketing professor at Villanova University who also edits the International Journal of Advertising, said in an email. This appears to be a reaction to the more somber/serious tone of many of last year's ads.\n\nDuring 2015's game, there were some solemn, and even unsettling ads, including one from Nationwide that showed a young boy explaining that he was dead due to a preventable accident. That led some observers to deem it a sad-vertising Super Bowl.\n\nCurrent events may also have spurred companies to ramp up the humor in this year's ads, Taylor says.\n\nIt also makes sense that in an election year, with so much national discussion of politics and serious topics, advertisers might be tempted to lighten things up, he says\n\nBud Light capitalized on the political theme, creating an ad with Amy Schumer and Seth Rogen that spoofed elections and promoted the Bud Light party. It riffed on the fact that we are in the midst of a raucous, often divisive, campaign season. The comic duo ultimately declared that there is one thing everyone can all unite around: beer.\n\nIn a second T-Mobile ad, recording artist Drake couldn't get through a video shoot for his hit song Hotline Bling without executives from rival cell service providers suggesting he add lyrics about their extra fees.\n\nAlec Baldwin and Willem Dafoe showed up in commercials for Amazon and Snickers respectively. And in a Skittles ad, Aerosmith's Steven Tyler instructed a talking portrait of himself - etched from pieces of the rainbow-colored candy - on how to wail like a rock star.\n\nWe're always looking for ways to entertain our fans in unexpected ways,'' Matt Montei, senior marketing director for confections at Wrigley, which owns Skittles, said in an email. We felt a celebrity really helped enhance the (advertising) copy to take it to the next level.\n\nHyundai featured comedian Kevin Hart, star of Ride Along 2, and Ryan Reynolds who will star in Marvel's soon-to be released superhero flick Deadpool, in two of its ads.\n\nHart and Reynolds were particularly appealing given their current pop culture prominence, says Dean Evans, Hyundai's chief marketing officer.\n\nThe premise of the ad with Reynolds: the fact that nearly every guy in town looks like him distracts two women cruising in a new 2017 Hyundai Elantra. But the car's technology, which puts on the brakes when a motorist isn't paying attention, saves the day. In his commercial, Reynolds played a policeman, the motorist the officer pulls over and a dog walker, among other characters.\n\nMeanwhile Hart loaned his Hyundai Genesis to his daughter's suitor - then used the car's tracking device to show up wherever the young couple went that evening\n\nThe fact that both men have a tremendous social media following also helps to bolster Hyundai's big game buzz.\n\nHart has more than 25 million Twitter followers and Reynolds has more than one million. And just last week, Reynolds tweeted a link to his Super Bowl spot to social media fans.\n\nThe attention these actors get through their social followings is a big part of the promotion strategy, Evans says. And the attention the ads have gotten from entertainment publications shows that the celebrities help you reach even more people, in fresher, newer ways, he says.\n\nBut does using a celebrity spokesperson actually help to improve a brand's image? The messages on that are mixed.\n\nThere is evidence that celebrity endorsers sometimes make a commercial more memorable, says Frank Germann, a marketing professor at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nAnd he said in an email that some research suggests that today's younger generations are quite influenced by celebrity endorsers.''\n\nBut there's no guarantee that a star will give a brand a boost.\n\nIt really depends on how well that marriage was thought out, what the intent of the advertiser is and what that celebrity means to the brand,'' says Gerry Philpott, President and CEO of E-Poll Market Research, which is a consumer research company. For instance, you could have a brand that's considered a bit stodgy and they're trying to update their image and if they get a cutting edge, fast-rising star to work for them, that could be exactly what they need.''\n\nIts also possible, however, that the celebrity gets all the attention,'' he says, but the brand gets forgotten.''\n\nMarketing professor Taylor says that research consistently shows that ads with celebrities perform slightly lower than the average for a Super Bowl ad,'' in terms of likeability, brand building and generating buzz on social media.\n\nThere are notable exceptions, like the popular You're not you when you're hungry'' Snickers spot in the 2010 Super Bowl that featured Betty White on a football field. That ad won USA TODAY's 2010 Ad Meter, which is an annual consumer rating of big game commercials.\n\nSome of the most effective Super Bowl ads of all time have used celebrities,'' says Taylor, referring to those that have been considered top notch by experts or succeeded in helping a brand to get attention.\n\nHowever, too many ads with celebrities don't reinforce key product benefits, whether functional or emotional, Taylor says. The key to good celebrity endorsements is use the right celebrity, for the right target audience, using the right message.\n\nBMW's Mini brand also capitalized on star power for its Super Bowl ad. But unlike many of the other big game commercials that went for laughs, it brought out a more serious message of empowerment.\n\nTennis star Serena Williams, soccer champ Abby Wambach and rapper T-Pain, were among those in the ad who defiantly unspooled a string of adjectives about the Mini – such as chick car,''gay'' and cute,'' that presumably would keep them from driving that brand of car.\n\nThe whole concept is about defying labels,'' says Tom Noble, head of marketing for MINI USA. And the quickest way to communicate that idea is to find people who have labels that they've overcome that the general population understands.\n\nHe adds: We didn't pick celebrities just because they were celebrities. We picked celebrities because they have something to say that relates to the situation that Mini's in.''\n\nEach of the entertainers or athletes featured in the ad were familiar with the Mini brand, he says, whether they owned the car or once rode in one.\n\nAll of the labels of the brand -- being cute, under powered, a 'chick' car -- those are the things that the brand has to fight as it moves into new segments,'' Noble says.\n\nAnd a humorous ad wasn't deemed necessary, he says.\n\nOur perspective is if you have a relevant message and you're confident, that will certainly come through in the Super Bowl,'' Noble says.
The best-picture race is looking like a nail-biter heading into the 92nd Academy Awards on Sunday night, and while some contenders have pulled away from the competition, it's still a toss-up who's getting Oscar's biggest prize.\n\nThis year's category offers a wide-ranging view of genres and filmmaking – there are cinematic blockbusters, streaming favorites, book adaptations, crowd-pleasers and a foreign-language film looking to make a little history.\n\nOne could make a case for any of the nine best-picture nominees to win, and that's what we're going to do. USA TODAY's movie experts deliver their passionate defenses for why each film deserves to be celebrating at the end of Oscar night.\n\nAll things Oscar:Check out all our Academy Awards coverage in one place\n\nThe biggest Oscar drama:Which one of these 5 movies will win best picture?\n\n'Ford v Ferrari'\n\nGetting America to rally around a movie featuring ego-bruised Ford executives aiming to win a French endurance car race is the underdog story of the year. But Ford v. Ferrari has the raw power and inspiring can-do story to make even a racing non-enthusiast grip the theater arm rest.\n\nMatt Damon keeps the charisma humming in low gear as car designer Carroll Shelby so his stubborn, perfectionist engineer Ken Miles (Christian Bale) can take the wheel. Bale's face seems stuck in a position that suggests he could snap into a sharp turn at 130 mph at any second, even when he's not behind the wheel. Behind director James Mangold's audacious race camera work, Ford v. Ferrari is an exhilarating ride that captures movie glory. – Bryan Alexander\n\n'The Irishman'\n\nJust putting Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and Al Pacino into Martin Scorsese's camera frame is enough to make an instant Oscar contender. Yet even behind the bluster of Pacino's charismatic, Mob-tied union leader Jimmy Hoffa and De Niro's opaque hit man Frank Sheeran, The Irishman succeeds on a whole other unexpected level.\n\nScorsese's crime drama dares to live not in the violent hits but around the question of what happens when a man somehow survives the world's deadliest business, far longer than he could ever want. Scorsese's famed Goodfellas restaurant tracking shot showing Mob life in its giddy purest form is replaced with one that runs through the neon-lit hallways of a nursing home. At 209 minutes, it's the fitting, profoundly sobering final chapter to a master filmmaker's most celebrated genre. – Alexander\n\n'Jojo Rabbit'\n\nThere's a lot of familiarity among the best pictures this year – divorce dramas, gangster epics – but only one has Adolf Hitler getting cartoonishly kicked through a window. That would be Jojo, writer/director Taika Waititi's brilliant World War II satire that battles hate and intolerance with a story about love and acceptance.\n\nThankfully, it does all that with a lack of corniness and an impressive amount of chutzpah: Young Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a member of the Hitler Youth who's so enamored, the fuhrer is his imaginary friend (played by Waititi). It's a big swing, but it totally works as Jojo's best pal and personal hype man ultimately loses his metaphorical hold on the kid when the youngster befriends a Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie).\n\nLike a modern Mel Brooks, Waititi makes us laugh, cry, but most important think about our present-day struggles with white supremacy, with a big, warm, understanding hug of a movie rather than a cinematic history lesson. – Brian Truitt\n\n'Joker'\n\nNo Oscar contender had quite the tumult around it as Todd Phillips' pot-stirring origin story, which put a pitch-black spin on the iconic comic book supervillain. In an era where superhero films rule the box office, Joker made scads of money with no good guys but tons of dark atmosphere exploring how one social outcast (best-actor favorite Joaquin Phoenix) with a litany of issues could turn into a truly bad guy.\n\nJoker harks back to the beloved retro works of Martin Scorsese, from Taxi Driver to The King of Comedy, offering a gritty and often bleak look at humanity. Say what you will about the subject matter that divided audiences and critics, but you can't argue with how good it looks and sounds – a haunting cello score makes Arthur Fleck's dancing, face-painted descent into nihilism that much more visceral.\n\nBut everything pales in comparison to Phoenix, whose bold, transformative performance is the main reason why we're still talking about this movie. Joker is a chilling, hard-to-watch investigation of a tortured soul, and yet you can't take your eyes off him. – Truitt\n\n'Little Women'\n\nThe story of the Marsh sisters is so baked into our literary bones, it seems almost sacrilegious to try anything new with their story. Yet writer/director Greta Gerwig waded into those waters and emerged with an adaptation that emanated author Louisa May Alcott from opening shot to credits.\n\nHer March sisters feel like actual people: They are loud and petulant and infuriating and bound by a mother who insists they must love each other. Saoirse Ronan was right, she was born to play Jo, so we could watch her beg Meg to ditch her superbly average groom, saying, You'll be bored of him in two years, but we'll be interesting forever.\n\nThanks to Gerwig, girls big and small got a fresh chance to debate Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth's virtues – and what it means to grow up and live with your choices. Alcott had to live with hers, too: She preferred her Jo remain a spinster, but as Gerwig's film concedes, in the end Jo runs to her professor in the pouring rain – because that was the only way to get Little Women published. In real life, the profits from satisfied readers fed Alcott's family the rest of their lives. We were lucky to get this richly felt version of Little Women – and so were Oscar voters. – Andrea Mandell\n\n'Marriage Story'\n\nOf all of the award contenders this year, only Marriage Story can elicit both laughter and tears, even while viewed on the tiniest screen Netflix can stream to (which isn't to say that you should limit your viewing of it to there). It's effective that way, because it's such an intimate film that shows exactly why two people should want to be together, and also why they cannot. And, it does something revolutionary: It shows how both parties' points of views are at odds, but both still valid.\n\nWriter/director Noah Baumbach has long crafted realistic dialogue, but in Marriage Story the exchanges between Oscar-nominated Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver feel so raw and emotionally charged, it's hard to believe their lines were written that way on the page (though they were). Those scenes show a stark contrast to the ones where the divorcing couple is arguing through their lawyers, played by Laura Dern (also nominated) and Ray Liotta, where the back and forth is so calculated and measured it becomes humorous. A film where Stephen Sondheim's masterpiece Being Alive is not only sung by Driver at a bar but also becomes the story's thesis – well, that's a brilliant movie.\n\nThe story behind Marriage Story is also compelling: Baumbach's split from wife Jennifer Jason Leigh perhaps inspired some of the movie (along with her lawyer). Now, his partner is Gerwig, herself nominated for best picture with Little Women. Although Marriage Story has a rather melancholy ending, it seems that Baumbach's post-divorce life is looking happily ever after. – Carly Mallenbaum\n\n'1917'\n\nImagine traversing a battlefield, walking over the corpses of your peers. Or skulking carefully through a deserted village and hearing sniper fire from behind. Or watching in horror as a curious rat triggers a trench to cave in around you. Director Sam Mendes doesn't leave any of that to the imagination but instead puts a viewer through two hours of a harrowing, ticking-clock ordeal in his technically marvelous World War I thriller.\n\nCleverly filmed as one long take, 1917 succeeds because it puts emotions and character at the center of a wartime narrative. We follow two young British soldiers (George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman) who are thrown into a life-or-death situation to deliver an important order with 1,600 lives at stake. They're not just cannon fodder; their mission matters and connects amid tragic circumstances and constant obstacles.\n\nBattlefield films have long been an Oscar mainstay (from Apocalypse Now to Saving Private Ryan to Dunkirk) and 1917 is an instant classic, bringing enough innovation to make an old-school genre feel gloriously fresh. – Truitt\n\n'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'\n\nPeople outside the 30-mile zone of Los Angeles tend to snicker at love letters to the acting business, like 2014's Birdman (even though that drama won best picture). But writer/director Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the kind of unabashed mash note to the magical movie kingdom of his youth that the whole country can get behind. Set in 1969 around the saga of decent but struggling actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his loyal, quietly lethal and totally hot stuntman Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), the tale even fantastically sets right the decade's most heinous stain.\n\nBest-actor nominee DiCaprio is at the top of his game and Pitt strolls effortlessly into a sure supporting-actor win with the role we've been waiting years for him to play: fairy tale Brad Pitt with an adorable pooch. The fact that Tarantino draws out a scene as a shirtless Pitt fixes a rooftop TV antenna is just icing on the cake. – Alexander\n\n'Parasite'\n\nIf Parasite takes home best picture, it'd probably go down in history as the coolest winner ever. It's a crackling, stylish class satire about two disparate yet co-dependent families in an Oscar year dominated by movies about angry, insecure men. Written and directed by beloved Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer) and starring an all-South Korean cast, it's also one of the only racially and culturally diverse films in contention.\n\nThrow in the fact that it could become the first foreign-language movie to win best picture in the Oscars' 92-year history, and a Parasite victory feels like just the kind of shake-up we need in an otherwise dull, predictable awards season.\n\nBut all significance of a potential win aside, Parasite is simply the best of the bunch. Deliciously dark and jaw-droppingly unpredictable, it's the rare best-picture nominee that could actually be called fun. Watching it in no way feels like medicine but rather like a twisty, thrilling roller coaster you never want to get off. Yet it also packs a bruising, haunting emotional punch, with fully realized characters and no easy villains on either side of the wealthy and poor families. Like a crippling peach allergy or mystical stone – both weapons in the movie's class warfare – Parasite is the kind of film that knocks you off your feet. – Patrick Ryan
AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Serena Williams definitely doesn't want to talk about the No. 23. She doesn't really want to think about planning a wedding, either, while she's pursuing a Grand Slam record.\n\nNewly engaged Williams brushed off concerns about the 88 unforced errors she had in a loss in New Zealand last week in her only warmup tournament ahead of the Australian Open, which starts Monday and where she's aiming for Open-era record 23rd major title.\n\nI've moved on, she said. I'm feeling relaxed, calm, ready and poised.\n\nWilliams responded to questions about milestone achievements last year when she had 21 Grand Slam titles, and it didn't help — she lost the final here to Angelique Kerber and to Garbine Muguruza at the French Open before winning Wimbledon to equal Steffi Graf's Open era mark of 22. She's being more superstitious this time.\n\nI'm not talking about that, Williams, a six-time Australian Open winner, said as she shut down questions during a promotional activity this week. I said I'm not talking about that. Move on.\n\nAnother Australian title is also high on the agenda for Novak Djokovic, who already has won six. But he isn't thinking much beyond his opening match after drawing Fernando Verdasco.\n\nA first is the priority for Andy Murray, recently knighted in Britain after finishing 2016 at No. 1. He is looking at the draw from the top for the first time at a major and is hoping it comes with a change in fortunes at Melbourne Park. He has lost five Australian Open finals — the first to Roger Federer in 2010, the other four to Djokovic.\n\nFederer could again stand in his way, only at the quarterfinal stage this time. The 17-time major winner slipped down the rankings during six months off last year recovering from an injured left knee and was seeded No. 17.\n\nWilliams took time off after the U.S. Open, where she lost in the semifinals for the second year running and lost the top ranking to Kerber.\n\nThe big news during her break was her engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian last month, when she posted a poem on the news website to confirm she'd accepted his proposal.\n\nAfter hitting this week with 16-year-old Destanee Aiava, who will be the first person born in the 2000s to play in the main draw of a major when she meets a qualifier in the first round, Williams said her mind was back entirely on business.\n\nI told (Ohanian) my main goal was to win this title, she said. Yeah, it really doesn't feel like anything different.\n\nNo date has been set for the wedding, with Williams' mind on one major thing, so she's not thinking about a dress or a cake, and she's not wearing a ring to practice.\n\nOh my God. I don't think about it really, she said, responding to questions about her marriage plans. I'm just ... I don't know I'll have to ask him that. I have a job — I mean, he does too. I kinda gotta focus.\n\nKerber won the Australian and U.S. Open titles last year, so will be attempting to defend a major for the first time in Melbourne. She may be feeling pressure as the No. 1 seed, having won only one match in two warmup tournaments in Brisbane and Sydney.\n\nThat doesn't take any pressure off Williams.\n\nI am No. 2, I guess. I definitely don't feel like anyone's saying that, 'Oh, there's no pressure on Serena,' she said. It's always there, I'm used to it.\n\nI feel like I've been No. 1 for so long, so many times. I've done things that are amazing. Sometimes that ranking really means a lot, but also I feel like sometimes just winning events ... means just as much.\n\nThat's something Djokovic understands. His 122-week streak at No. 1 ended amid Murray's incredible finish to last season, when he won Wimbledon and defended the Olympic gold medal among eight titles he won after reuniting with Ivan Lendl as coach.\n\nBefore then, Djokovic had beaten Murray in the Australian and French Open finals, his 11th and 12th major titles.\n\nHalf of those have come in Melbourne, where his victory last year equaled the record six Australian titles Roy Emerson won (1961 and 1963-67).\n\nI'm feeling phenomenal, Djokovic said after arriving in Australia following a win over Murray in his season-opening event at Doha. Maybe this is the year — 2017 for seven. I'm not a numerologist, but it sounds good.\n\nMurray jumped on a flight almost immediately after last year's final to be with his wife, who was expecting their first child. There have been plenty of changes for him since, becoming a father for the first time, No. 1 in the world for the first time, and reuniting with Lendl.\n\nEach time I come, I think I've got a chance of winning but it's just never happened, he said. Hopefully, this year will be different.\n\nI do think the last few months of last year can help me with giving me confidence — other players look at that and see you're playing well and (I) feel physically and mentally strong.\n\nFourth-seeded Stan Wawrinka, who ended the run of wins by Djokovic and Murray when he won the U.S. Open last September, said the next generation of players such as Wimbledon finalist Milos Raonic and 2014 U.S. Open runner-up Kei Nishikori would be among the contenders for the Australian title.\n\nBut he thinks it will be difficult for any new champion to emerge against the likes of the in-form Murray and Djokovic, and the returning Federer and Rafael Nadal.\n\nSo far, last 10 years, the 'Big Four' was really strong, Wawrinka said, so it's going to be interesting to see this year how Novak, Andy, Rafa, and Roger will play.
'Sleeping Beauty' marriage proposal is real-life fairytale\n\nThis may be the best marriage proposal we've ever seen.
Jayme Deerwester\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPrince's first wife, Mayte Garcia, sheds light on their four-year marriage and the loss of their only child in a book titled The Most Beautiful: My Life With Prince. It's due April 4, shortly before the first anniversary of the music icon's death on the 21st.\n\nTheir son Amiir, born Oct. 16, 1996, died six days later due to the rare genetic disorder Pfeiffer syndrome type 2, in which bones fuse early, preventing normal skeletal growth, especially those in the head, hands and feet. The disorder can cause the eyes to form outside the sockets or the hands and feet to appear webbed.\n\nI don't think he ever got over it, she told People in an interview published Wednesday. I don't know how anybody can get over it. I know I haven't.\n\nGarcia, now 43, also revealed that Prince refused genetic testing on the fetus when complications arose during the pregnancy. When a doctor suggested she undergo an amniocentesis (a test in which a needle is injected into the womb to draw amniotic fluid for testing), he said, No, we're not doing that.\n\nShe didn't specify whether it was because the procedure violated his religious beliefs or because it involves a risk of miscarriage. However, she noted that he did pray for the child's health when they got home from the appointment.\n\nPlease, bless this child, he implored. We know you won't allow this child to be harmed.\n\nPrince's stance didn't change even after an ultrasound revealed that the child might have other genetic anomalies, including a form of dwarfism. And? the singer asked. I'm totally fine with that.\n\nGarcia recalls she laughed at that one, noting, Of all the possible outcomes that had been offered to us, this was the first one that didn't terrify me.\n\nAmiir, whose name meant Prince in Arabic, was delivered via C-section. I don't know how to describe the look on my husband's face. Pure joy ... And then they held the baby up to those harsh lights. The elation on my husband's face turned to pure terror.
WASHINGTON – Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg knows that some people won't vote for him because he's gay, including the Iowa woman captured on video withdrawing her support for Buttigieg after learning that he's married to a man.\n\nWhat I want her to know is that I'm running to be her president too, Buttigieg said Thursday, when asked, during an appearance on ABC's The View, about the widely-viewed video.\n\nThe former South Bend, Indiana, mayor added that he wishes the woman could see that my love is the same as her love for those that she cares about.\n\nBut if she can't see that...I am still, if I'm elected president, going to get up in the morning and try to make the best decisions for her and the people that she loves, he said.\n\nThe video, shot at an Iowa precinct Monday, shows a woman who had turned in her caucus card for Buttigieg saying she had no idea he's gay.\n\nI don't want anybody like that in the White House, she said. So can I have my card back?\n\nThe precinct captain responded that she respects the other woman's view but suggested the caucusgoer dig deep inside and ask if Buttigieg's sexuality really matters.\n\nHe better read the Bible, the woman said.\n\nAt a fundraiser Thursday morning in Manhattan, Buttigieg praised how the precinct captain handled the situation.\n\nButtigieg to Pence:If you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is with my creator\n\nSince launching his longshot campaign for the Democratic nomination, Buttigieg's standard response to the question of whether the nation is ready to elect a gay president has been: There's only one way to find out.\n\nAlthough the results in Iowa are still being tabulated, Buttigieg is locked in a very close battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for the win.\n\nAn unusually emotional Buttigieg choked up Tuesday when describing what that support means for the LGBTQ community and others who have felt excluded.\n\nIt validates for a kid, somewhere in a community, wondering if he belongs, or she belongs, or they belong, in their own family, that if you believe in yourself and your country, there's a lot backing up that belief, Buttigieg said.\n\nA man who attended Buttigieg's Manhattan fundraiser Thursday described himself as having been that child Buttigieg referenced. After being a lifelong Republican, the man said, he changed his party affiliation because of Buttigieg.\n\nA recent USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll showed some qualms remain about the electoral appeal of a gay candidate.\n\nBeing a gay man makes a candidate less appealing, according to 32% of Americans and 23% of Democratic voters.

Saudi Arabian courts will notify women by text message when their husbands have been granted divorces under a law that took effect Sunday.\n\nThe initiative is aimed at concerns that Saudi men were increasingly neglecting to tell their wives they were divorced.\n\nLawyer Somayya Al-Hindi told Okaz/Saudi Gazette that Saudi courts in the past heard many cases of Saudi women still living with their ex-husbands without realizing they had been divorced.\n\n\n\nThis will put an end to any attempts at cheating or impersonating the identity of women to take control of their bank accounts and property using previously issued powers of attorney, Al-Hindi said.\n\nMore:Death penalty sought for 5 suspects in Jamal Khashoggi killing\n\nMore:Death penalty sought for 5 suspects in Jamal Khashoggi killing\n\nLawyer Nasreen Al-Ghamdi said Saudi courts regularly receive complaints about impersonating the identity of divorced women.\n\nThis is a huge step forward ...(for) divorced women, he told the Gazette.\n\nWomen will be notified immediately when a divorce deed is issued by a court. The text includes the number of the divorce document and the court that issued it.\n\nThe move is part of a drive by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country's de facto ruler, to liberalize the kingdom, home to some of the world's most restrictive laws for women.\n\nA new law last year allowed women to drive for the first time.\n\nThe crown prince has been the subject of controversy in the U.S. since the Oct. 2 death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi, a frequent critic of the Saudi royal family, died after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain paperwork for his upcoming marriage.\n\nTurkish prosecutors have accused the crown prince of arranging the attack on Khashoggi in the consulate or knowing about it in advance. The kingdom denies the claim, and five Saudis face trial in Riyadh on murder charges that could result in the death penalty.
Mike Snider\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLove will find a way.\n\nFor sure, politics and strife command much of our attention today. But occasionally, there emerges an amazing story of how love perseveres.\n\nYou don't think so? Well, how about the story of Roy Vickerman, 90, and Nora Jackson, 89, of the U.K., who plan to get married more than 70 years after getting engaged. The D-Day and Battle of the Bulge veteran broke off the engagement after his World War II service, suffering with what today would be called post-traumatic stress syndrome, as reported earlier this month by the Daily Mail. Both married other people and had children; their spouses have since died.\n\nA year ago, Vickerman decided he wanted to apologize over how he ended it and took flowers to Jackson's home not knowing what to expect – he didn't know Jackson's situation. Their reunion was just like old times, she told the Mail.\n\nSee, hope does spring eternal. Even more recently, I got to see the culmination of a love story myself.\n\nMy wife Julie's aunt Margaret, 77, whose husband died nearly three years ago, surprised Julie with a text message that she was getting married in April. The following year, at her high school reunion in Asheville, N.C., Margaret struck up a short conversation with another student she hadn't known as a teen.\n\nShe traded email addresses with Vernon, a 76-year-old professor of theology and philosophy and an ordained minister for 50 years, and a widower whose wife of 44 years died in 2009. They subsequently began a daily email and messaging conversation that blossomed.\n\nVernon, who lives in Grayslake, Ill., made two visits to Margaret's hometown in Huntsville, Ala. Along the way, they developed a deep and strong love for each other, Vernon says in a note on Facebook.\n\nJulie got the news in a text message from her tech-savvy aunt. As they texted back and forth, Margaret said, I am so happy. I do believe God had a hand in this. ... You sure I'm old enough to get married?\n\nI think so (smiley face emoji, blowing kiss emoji), Julie responded.\n\nJulie and I definitely wanted to be at the ceremony. It's not every day that you get a wedding invitation – via text – from your 77-year-old aunt, said Julie, who was inspired by her aunt's schoolgirl giddiness.\n\nDivorce may be on the rise and Millennials may be putting off marriage to an older age, according to the Pew Research Center. But Americans age 65 or older have increasingly chosen to remarry. Half of once-married seniors (those 65 and over) had remarried in 2013, up from 34% in 1960, Pew has found.\n\nThe definition of 70 or even 80 now has really changed, said Pepper Schwartz, the AARP's relationships guru and author of several books on love and relationships. I think that window of healthy living, as well as long life, makes people feel more ambitious and more entitled to ... begin a relationship.\n\nSchwartz often tells the story of an 81-year-old woman widowed after 43 years of marriage who contacted her five years ago about how to explore finding a new partner. She tried online dating and eventually was introduced, through a woman she met at a cocktail party, to a man she wound up falling in love with and who became her life partner. That story gives others inspiration and belief in their own possible good future, Schwartz says. Part of being vital and being young is being with a partner.\n\nAs for our aunt's wedding, we made the drive to Mundelien, Ill., just northwest of Chicago and south of Milwaukee. It was a joyful event – smiles were abundant – with now-new relatives happily hugging one another. Bread was broken, wine sipped and more email addresses traded. We are all family now, one of Vernon's three daughters told her own daughter as the festivities were breaking up.\n\nThe newly married couple, radiating with the look of love, departed toward a honeymoon location that was secret – as the wedding itself had been for months.\n\nThe rest of us basked in the glow, knowing we had been witness to proof that some of us can be lucky enough to get a chance for a second great love.\n\nSnider is a USA TODAY technology reporter.

Associated Press\n\nHAMILTON, Bermuda — Legislation replacing same-sex marriage with domestic partnerships in Bermuda was signed into law by the governor Wednesday as critics called it an unprecedented rollback of civil rights in the British island territory.\n\nMinister of Home Affairs Walton Brown said the legislation signed by Gov. John Rankin seeks to balance opposition to same-sex marriage on the socially conservative island while complying with European court rulings that ensure recognition and protection for same-sex couples in the territory.\n\nMore:Australians overwhelmingly vote to legalize gay marriage\n\nMore:Where is same-sex marriage legal across the world?\n\nMore:German lawmakers vote to legalize same-sex marriage\n\nBermuda's Senate and House of Assembly passed the legislation by wide margins in December and a majority of voters opposed same-sex marriage in a referendum.\n\nThe act is intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in Bermuda, by restating that marriage must be between a male and a female while at the same time recognizing and protecting the rights of same-sex couples, Brown said.\n\nLGBTQ civil rights groups said that domestic partnerships amount to a second-class status and that it is unprecedented for a jurisdiction to take away the legal right to marriage after it has been granted.\n\nGovernor Rankin and the Bermuda Parliament have shamefully made Bermuda the first national territory in the world to repeal marriage equality, said Ty Cobb, director of the Human Rights Campaign Global.\n\nCouples in a registered domestic partnership will now have equivalent rights to those of married heterosexual couples, including the right to make medical decisions on behalf of one's partner, Brown said in a statement issued by the government.\n\nAbout a half dozen same-sex marriages that took place in Bermuda between when they were legalized by a court ruling in May 2017 and the repeal are recognized under the new law.
Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar TurboTax quickly picked up on the different forms to file for our fictional personas.\n\nBest Overall Intuit TurboTax Deluxe TurboTax takes the top spot for having the most intuitive tax filing system that's easy to follow, even for tax newbies. Did you file taxes somewhere else last year? No problem. TurboTax lets you upload last year's tax information to save data entry time, whether you previously filed with TurboTax or used another service such as H&R Block, Credit Karma, or TaxAct as long as you have a PDF of your 1040. TurboTax guarantees that it can find you a larger refund or smaller tax bill than competitors. If not, TurboTax will refund your filing fee. If you didn't receive your stimulus check, there's a section early on in the process that determines if you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit. Cost: Like most to make this list, there's a free version and paid versions of TurboTax. People with simple returns who use Form 1040 (and/or Form 1099-G for Unemployment Income) and claim the standard deduction can file for free. To be clear, TurboTax offers a Free File program in partnership with the IRS, which is separate from its Free Edition. It's available to individuals with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of $39,000 or less, active military members with an AGI as high as $72,000, or individuals who qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). If you have a more complex filing where you earned rental income, investment income, ran a business, and/or you decide to itemize deductions, you'll likely get prompted to upgrade to one of the paid plans. The Deluxe, Premier, and Self-Employed tiers range from $40 to $90, with additional fees for state returns (at time of publishing). In that case, TurboTax will review more than 350 credits and deductions to see if you qualify for tax breaks. Customer support and guarantees: The TurboTax Free Edition doesn't offer live support, but there's a virtual chat box where you can type general questions to search for answers. Plus, you can upgrade to TurboTax Live Basic (for $50) to share your screen with tax experts. There are even higher tiers for those looking to maximize deductions or report investments or business expenses. In addition, paying customers have access to phone support, and this could come in handy if you run into problems filing forms for your rental or investments. Every online return is backed by TurboTax's 100% Accurate Calculations Guarantee and 100% Accurate, Expert Approved Guarantee that will pay your IRS or state tax penalties if the software or a specialist makes an error. There's also an Audit Support Guarantee that provides one-on-one guidance from a tax professional if you're audited. How did TurboTax adapt to our personas? TurboTax quickly picked up on the different forms to file for our fictional personas—more on this below. Marva Maven was able to file her W-2 and unemployment income with TurboTax's Free Edition. Peter Pensioner was also able to report his IRA retirement distributions and Social Security income with the Free Edition. Carla Coder, our fictitious filer with student loans, was upgraded to Deluxe to claim the student loan deduction. Since Michael DeAmbitious owns a freelance business, he and his wife were prompted to join the Self-Employed version to maximize deductions. Pros Intuitive for tax novices\n\nOptions, options, options\n\nComprehensive customer guarantees Cons Stricter Free File requirements Buy now at Intuit\n\n$49.90 from Amazon\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHow We Tested\n\nThe Tester\n\nMy name is Taylor Medine, and I'm a money nerd and finance writer with seven years of experience digging into the fine print details of finance products so you don't have to. I read terms and conditions as a hobby, and uncovering gotchas gives me an adrenaline rush. As a self-employed writer, I know intimately how stressful tax time can be, so I put my money-nerd powers to the test and reviewed what the top online tax software has to offer.\n\nThe Tests\n\nWe looked beyond the cost of the software to see which ones offer the best user experience for the average Jo(e) without intimate knowledge of tax laws.\n\nSeveral tax preparation companies offer free product tiers for people with simple tax returns. Simple generally means that you're filing W-2s or unemployment income and claiming the standard deduction. If you want to itemize your deductions or you earn income from a side hustle, rental property, or investments, you typically need to upgrade to a paid plan.\n\nThis year we tested five online tax-filing programs: TurboTax, H&R Block, TaxAct, TaxSlayer, and Jackson Hewitt. The products were chosen for testing based on their percentage of market share and/or visibility with the public. In addition to cost, we judged software in three areas:\n\nProduct experience: How easy is the software to use when entering and/or uploading information? How easy is it to report stimulus check payments to receive the Recovery Rebate Credit?\n\nCustomer support and guarantees: How easy is it to find customer support, and how good is the support the user receives? What service guarantees are offered?\n\nPersona adaptability: How well did the software respond to the information from each of the fictional personas? More on that next.\n\nOur Fictional Tax Filers\n\nTo test each online tax-filing software, we developed these four fictional personas with common tax scenarios:\n\nCarla Coder is a recent college graduate who's filing as single. She works as a project coordinator at a tech company earning $50,000 per year and is repaying $30,000 worth of student loan debt. Carla has health insurance and a retirement account.\n\nMichael and Michelle DeAmbitous are a young married couple with one child who goes to daycare while Michael and Michelle are at work. They have a mortgage on their home. In 2020, Michael brought in about $65,000 as a freelance graphic designer, while Michelle earned $90,000 as a senior accountant.\n\nPeter Pensioner is a single retired man who's enrolled in Medicare and receives IRA distributions and Social Security income. He's paid off his mortgage and has no dependents.\n\nMarva Maven is a divorcee who was laid off in June when the boutique she managed went out of business because of the pandemic. She earned about $27,000 before receiving unemployment payments for the remainder of 2020 while looking for another full-time job. Taxes were not withheld from her unemployment checks.\n\nWhat to Know About Filing Your Taxes Online\n\nWhat documents do you need to file your taxes online?\n\nThe bare minimum most people need, according to Amy Northard, a CPA and owner of The Accountants For Creatives, are things like W-2s, 1098s, 1099s, and health insurance 1095 forms. You should receive these in your mailbox by late January, although Northard says two forms often don't get mailed out: student loan interest forms and brokerage account 1099 statements. (The good news: You'll likely find these by logging into your online accounts.)\n\nIf that all looks like a jumble of numbers to you, here's a basic breakdown of these common tax forms:\n\nW-2: Your employer uses this form to report your wages and various taxes withheld from your paycheck throughout the year, and also notes things like your retirement contributions and tips. It mails you and the IRS copies to determine whether you owe additional taxes or should receive a refund.\n\n1095: As a health insurance holder, you'll receive one (or more) of three forms. These detail the type and length of coverage you received under the plan.\n\n1098: There are a handful of 1098 forms, but the most common involve interest lenders received from loan payments. Specifically, be on the lookout for these if you've got student loans or a mortgage. You can also expect a 1098 if you paid college tuition bills during 2020.\n\n1099: There are more than a dozen types of 1099s. Essentially, these account for any income you earned that did not come from your employer. For example, if you worked as a freelancer or independent contractor, you may receive a 1099-NEC from clients. Anyone who received state unemployment benefits can expect a 1099-G to arrive in their mailbox. Money received from pensions, IRAs, and life insurance policies also falls under this category.\n\nHow do you file your taxes online for free?\n\nIf your adjusted gross income in 2020 is $72,000 or less, you may be eligible to file your federal taxes for free with the IRS Free File program. Several platforms are involved in the program, however, they set their own income and age limits. TurboTax, as we mentioned, caps AGI at $39,000, while TaxSlayer restricts filers above the age of 51. Keep in mind that you while multiple state filings are also free of charge, you may have to pay depending where you live.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf your AGI in 2020 is greater than $72,000, it may be possible to e-file using a tax software that has an unpaid version. However, if you're planning on certain deductions, such as student loan interest, you may be prompted to use a paid version depending on the platform.\n\nIn a nutshell, you can file your federal tax return for free depending on what forms you need to submit.\n\nHere for the TL;DR?\n\nBefore we dive into more specifics, let's roll the highlights reel. Time, as they say, is money.\n\nFirst off, if you have an adjusted gross income (AGI) below $72,000, consider filing your taxes with an IRS partner that offers Free File. The Free File program lets you file both simple and complex federal tax returns with partners at no cost.\n\nThree companies that we reviewed—TurboTax, TaxSlayer, and TaxAct—are Free File partners, but you have to sign up for this service at a separate home page and each platform sets its own income and age limits. Explore that option before you pay for a product. The IRS has a list of the Free File tax partners and the requirements on its website.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf you don't qualify for IRS Free File and you have a straightforward return, including if you received unemployment assistance in 2020, we recommend TurboTax because it's an uncomplicated process—you upload a PDF version of Form 1040 from last year to pre-fill basic information, and then TurboTax's Q&A style questions quickly fill in the required forms.\n\nThe exception would be for filers with student loans who prefer a free version. In that case, turn to H&R Block. Its free version lets you deduct student loan interest, whereas TurboTax's free tax-filing does not.\n\nH&R Block also has a lot to offer for gig workers or side hustlers who do not have business expenses. These filers may manage with H&R Block's Deluxe version (starting at $29.99) rather than other self-employed options that run around $80 on most platforms.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther Tax Software We Tested\n\nH&R Block Deluxe Tax Software H&R Block offers in-office assistance at more than 12,000 locations worldwide as well as online tax preparation. Like TurboTax, you can upload information from last year's return to save time, including if you used H&R Block, TurboTax, TaxAct, another company, or if you have a PDF of your 2019 return. H&R Block also asks questions in the Credits section to see if you qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit. Overall, the H&R Block tax preparation flow is a bit more self-guided than other software, but that's not a knock against it—this could actually be ideal if you would rather skip around and complete tax forms at your own pace. Cost: At the time of publishing, H&R Block Deluxe is $29.99, Premium is $49.99, and Self-Employed is $84.99. There's a free federal and state return option that supports W-2 income, unemployment income, and retirement income. Unlike TurboTax, you are able to deduct student loan interest payments in the free version. Customer support and guarantees: If you're looking for tech support, H&R Block doesn't offer it over the phone unless you upgrade to a paid version, but there are guarantees that protect everyone (even free users) from software errors. H&R Block will reimburse you up to $10,000 to cover penalties or interest incurred because of a system miscalculation. If you're audited, H&R Block will advise you on what to do next at no cost, but this doesn't include responding for you or representing you—you have to purchase Worry-Free Audit Support® for $19.99 for that. How did H&R Block adapt to our personas? Simple returns for Carla Coder, Marva Maven, and Peter Pensioner took under 30 minutes to complete with H&R Block. One area where the platform particularly shines is how easy it is to report freelance and gig worker income. You can use the Deluxe package for $29.99 to organize your contract or gig work income as long as you don't have business expenses. This could be a more affordable route than investing in a full Self-Employed package at TurboTax or H&R Block if you make a few hundred dollars here and there from a side hustle each month. The DeAmbitious family got pushed to H&R Block Self-Employed for $84.99 since Michael had business expenses to include, though adding these to the software was painless. Pros Sleek interface\n\nEasily report freelance income\n\nFree version deducts student loan interest Cons Additional expense for audit support Buy now at H&R Block\n\n$32.99 from Amazon\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTaxAct Deluxe TaxAct gets high marks from us in the user experience category. The dashboard maintains an ongoing summary and tax refund snapshot that illustrates exactly how your refund is calculated. If you're making the switch from TurboTax or H&R Block, you can upload a PDF of your 1040 from either company. There's also a log that shows how forms you complete change your refund, which makes it easy to review your work. TaxAct asks how much you received in stimulus payments during the Credit section to see if you're eligible for the Recovery Rebate Credit. Cost: Similar to TurboTax and H&R Block, TaxAct's free filing version supports people with dependents, W-2s, unemployment income, and retirement income. Although, if you want to deduct child care costs, student loan interest, or mortgage interest, you have to upgrade to the Deluxe plan, $24.95 at the time of publishing. If you sold a home in 2020 or earned investment income, you likely need the Premier plan for $34.95. Contractors and small business owners will need Self-Employed for $64.95 to report business income and expenses. However, TaxAct is another IRS Free File partner that allows eligible taxpayers to file both simple and complex tax return scenarios for free at a separate web page. In order to qualify, you have to be 56 or younger with an AGI of $63,000 or less, eligible for the EITC, or an active duty service member with an AGI of $63,000 or less. Customer support and guarantees: TaxAct offers free email and phone support to everyone (including free filers), and you can also ask tax-related questions in the virtual help section while filling out your return. Looking for on-demand help? Turn to TaxAct's new Xpert Help feature, which starts at $35 and connects you with a CPA for one-on-one guidance over the phone or by sharing your computer screen. The company offers a 100% accuracy guarantee that refunds the price of the software plus the difference in your tax refund or tax liability if you get a higher refund or tax bill with another tax preparer because of a TaxAct software error. Filers are also covered up to $100,000 in auditing costs if audited because of a software error. How did TaxAct adapt to our personas? Forms throughout the TaxAct process are easy to find. Marva Maven and Peter Pensioner could use the free file version for their tax situations. As with TurboTax, Carla Coder wasn't able to report her student loan interest in the free version and had to go with the $24.95 plan. However, since her AGI is below $63,000, she could go to TaxAct's Free File site and file there without paying. As expected, the DeAmbitious family had to upgrade to the Self-Employed version to include freelance income and business expenses. Pros Straightforward navigation\n\nFree email and phone support Cons Limited free forms Buy now at TaxAct\n\nTaxSlayer Classic TaxSlayer asks for the basic information you would expect from a tax-filing service. Early on, you're asked if you received your stimulus payment to determine Recovery Rebate Credit eligibility. One gripe while filing taxes for our fictitious personas: The software plan would sometimes change tiers, and there wasn't a way to start over or change the plan back. Cost: TaxSlayer's Simply Free version supports W-2 income and unemployment income, and similar to H&R Block, it also allows for student loan interest and education expenses. The Classic plan—$17 at the time of publishing, plus additional fees for state filings—might offer a higher return for people with dependents who want to maximize deductions, as you get access to all deduction and tax credit forms. That said, you may be able to avoid this fee if you qualify for TaxSlayer's Free File program. To qualify, your AGI has to be $72,000 or less, and you have to be 51 years or younger. You can also qualify if you're eligible for the EITC or you're an active duty service member who has an AGI of less than $72,000. Email and phone support is included in each service plan, free or paid. However, upgrading to TaxSlayer Premium ($37) will help you skip the line for phone and live chat support, and it gets you three years of IRS audit assistance. The Self-Employed plan for people with 1099 income and business expenses costs $47. Customer support and guarantees: Aside from email and phone support, TaxSlayer has tax guides you can use while completing your filing. If there's a tax preparation error, TaxSlayer offers a 100% accuracy guarantee that reimburses you for federal or tax penalties. How did TaxSlayer adapt to our personas? TaxSlayer is easy to follow. You can answer tax-related questions and have TaxSlayer fill out the tax forms for you, or you can choose to select the tax forms you need and fill them out on your own. Both Marva Maven and Carla Coder qualified for the Simply Free version, which lets you report student loan interest. Peter Pensioner managed to use free versions of the previous software, though while using TaxSlayer, he was upgraded to the Classic plan because of his Social Security income. And finally, no surprise here—TaxSlayer took the DeAmbitious family to the Self-Employed version so they could maximize Schedule C deductions and report mortgage interest payments and child care costs. Pros Lower price points\n\nExtensive Free File options Cons Changed product tiers without explanation\n\nDifficult to revisit forms Buy now at TaxSlayer\n\nJackson Hewitt Online Filing Jackson Hewitt is known for offering in-person service at nearly 6,000 locations in all 50 states, and 3,000 of those locations are in Walmart stores. The company offers a File with a Tax Pro From Home service, which lets you upload documents online and sit back while a tax specialist handles the rest. At the time of publishing, this option starts at $69. When it comes to Jackson Hewitt's DIY filing product, it doesn't have the slick interface or graphics that other tax software companies use to add color to the tax-filing process, and it's not as user-friendly. That said, the price point could make it an attractive option for budget-conscious filers. Cost: While there is no free option available, Jackson Hewitt's pricing structure is unique because filing every federal and state return costs $49, regardless of the tax situation. Taxpayers who run a business, pay mortgage interest, or earn rental income can all file taxes online with Jackson Hewitt for $49. Customer support and guarantees: Jackson Hewitt offers online customer care via live chat or email if you have questions. The service comes with a 100% Accuracy Guarantee that covers interest and penalty charges if a mistake is made on your filing. Also, if you try another software and get a higher refund (or lower tax bill), Jackson Hewitt will refund your federal tax prep fee. How did Jackson Hewitt adapt to our personas? Jackson Hewitt wasn't the easiest platform to navigate for the fictitious personas. For instance, it wasn't immediately clear where to input stimulus payments to determine eligibility for the Recovery Rebate Credit. While entering information for our fictitious filers, it sometimes glitched by adding forms without explanation, making it difficult to check the return for accuracy. All of our fictitious taxpayers could file under Jackson Hewitt's $49 plan, which led to tax prep savings for the DeAmbitious family. Their business typically pushed them to more expensive tax preparation package tiers with other companies. However, paying a bit more for another service could be worth the cost if it means you'll have a better user experience. Pros Uniform price points\n\nLive chat support Cons Less flashy user experience\n\nDifficult to review progress Buy now at Jackson Hewitt\n\nWhen to Hire a CPA or Tax Pro\n\nDoing taxes yourself could save you money, but there are instances where it might be better to call in a tax preparer or CPA. Here are situations where you might benefit from expert help:\n\nYou're looking for strategic tax planning to help you prepare for retirement.\n\nYou started a business or sold a business.\n\nYou bought a home or got a cash windfall.\n\nThe cost of tax preparation services can vary depending on where you live. On average, tax preparers charge $188 to file a tax return without itemization and $294 with itemization, according to the National Association of Accountants. This is potentially three times what you might pay for a DIY tax software. However, this could be well worth the cost if you're unsure about your return and want confidence that someone experienced is taking care of it for you.\n\nWhat to Do When You Switch Tax Software\n\nOne of the conveniences of using the same tax software year after year is having everything in one place. If you choose another product, you're going to want to keep your documents somewhere safe and accessible—though this advice certainly applies to any of us filing taxes. The IRS recommends keeping most forms for at least three years. And you could need to produce your most recent W-2 when renewing your driver's license, or applying for a mortgage or marriage license.\n\nIn this case, we think it's convenient to keep your documents digitally, partly to avoid paper clutter. Download PDFs of your federal and state return, and save the email confirming you've successfully submitted. Name each file with the year, and save them in secure password-protected folders on your computer, which you can do on both iOS and Windows.\n\nThen, back up your computer files with an external, encryptable hard drive, like the Western Digital portable hard drive, or a cloud-based service like Dropbox, Apple iCloud, or Google Drive. Whatever you choose, be sure it uses two-factor verification so your files are more secure.\n\nIf you want to digitize physical paperwork, Lindsay O'Brien, a professional organizer and owner of Room to Breathe, recommends the mobile app Genius Scan, which allows you to take a photo of a document and convert it to PDF. I especially recommend this for tax-related documents so that you can easily send the files to your accountant or easily upload to TurboTax or other tax platforms, she says. The app's free version has a solid privacy policy—documents are only saved automatically to your phone, not anywhere else—but for more sensitive documents, one of its upgraded versions, like Genius Scan Enterprise, makes it easier to restrict outside access to the files.\n\nMore Articles You Might Enjoy
Steph Cha\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nKorea went through a lot in the 20th century. It was colonized by Japan for decades, then split into two due to the interests of foreign powers. Its people died from war and from deprivation, and many of them left, scattering to other lands.\n\nA large number wound up in Japan during Imperial Japanese rule, and while some repatriated, many remained, despite explicit, legal discrimination — the U.S., as it turns out, does not have a monopoly on xenophobia.\n\nThis is a lot of history to pack into one novel, but Min Jin Lee is nothing if not ambitious. Pachinko (Grand Central, 485 pp., ***½ out of four stars), her follow-up to her lovely debut Free Food for Millionaires, spans the better part of the century, from 1910, the year Japan annexed Korea, until 1989. It follows multiple generations of one ethnically Korean family in its never-ending search for a comfortable place in the world.\n\nThere are several protagonists, but the backbone is a steady, quietly principled woman named Sunja. Her unplanned teen pregnancy and subsequent marriage to Presbyterian minister Baek Isak take her from her parents' boardinghouse in a small fishing village near Busan to her in-laws' home in a Korean enclave of Osaka, where she raises sons Noa and Mozasu.\n\nBefore her departure, she gets this piece of advice from a woman in her village: Sunja-ya, a woman's life is endless work and suffering. There is suffering and then more suffering….no matter what, always expect suffering, and just keep working hard.\n\nPessimistic, to say the least, but this turns out to be true, not just for Sunja, but for almost everyone in the Baek family (also called the Boku or the Bando family — not even their name is a certainty in Japan). Lee is an obvious fan of classic English literature, and she uses omniscient narration and a large cast of characters to create a social novel in the Dickensian vein.\n\nHer protagonists struggle with the whims of history, with survival and acceptance in a land that treats even native-born Koreans as foreigners — For people like us, home doesn't exist, notes Koh Hansu, a shadowy guardian of the Baek family, with immense wealth of vaguely disreputable origin, the only kind available to Koreans in Japan. They also swallow what seems like more than their fair share of tragedy over eight decades.\n\nThe novel is frequently heartbreaking — its scope doesn't deter attachment to individual characters, and when bad things happen, the swift pacing and wide-angle view make them seem even more brutal, if at times too sudden. This is the rare 500-page novel that would benefit from some extra flesh, particularly in the last third.\n\nLike many Koreans in Japan, the Baek family gets into the pachinko business, a scorned line of work that gave off a strong odor of poverty and criminality, at least to the Japanese.\n\nPachinko is an unfair game — a gambler's pinball with strong house odds — one that lends itself rather easily to metaphors about life. There could only be a few winners and a lot of losers, one character reflects. And yet, we played on, because we had hope that we might be the lucky ones.\n\n—————\n\nSteph Cha is author of the Juniper Song mysteries.
Brian Lyman\n\nMontgomery (Ala.) Advertiser\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama's governor pursued an increasingly public relationship with a senior political adviser that cut or strained ties with his wife and family, led him to misuse state workers and vehicles and in at least two cases threatened a staffer he believed recorded a conversation he had with the aide, according to a state report.\n\nAnd on Saturday, the Alabama Supreme Court lifted a temporary restraining order that Gov. Robert Bentley's lawyers had requested, allowing state legislators to continue Monday with proceedings to impeach the two-term Republican governor.\n\nThe allegations were made in a report for the state's House Judiciary Committee, released late Friday, as it prepares to consider the Bentley's removal from office.\n\n► More: Alabama governor seeks forgiveness in wake of ethics ruling\n\n► More: Alabama governor may face prosecution after ethics ruling\n\nThe 131-report, part of a broader filing running around 3,000 pages, paints a picture of Bentley, 74, becoming enamored with Rebekah Caldwell Mason, 45, while they worked on his 2014 re-election campaign.\n\nThe two had known each other for years. The Bentleys, Mason, her husband and three children were members of First Baptist Church in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Mason served as press secretary for Bentley's 2010 gubernatorial campaign as well as communications director during part of his first term in office.\n\nThe report also suggests the governor's suspicions that his wife taped a suggestive conversation he had with Mason made him emotionally unstable.\n\nAt times, Bentley spoke to aides about the relationship with tearful contrition, the report said. At other times, he confronted aides who knew or whom he thought knew about the relationship with defiance, anger and threats.\n\nThe report details growing suspicions among Bentley's friends and family. At one point, first lady Dianne Bentley, who divorced the governor in 2015 after 50 years of marriage, took a cellphone picture of what capitol employees termed the love bench, a bench in full view of office windows where Robert Bentley and Mason would sit together.\n\nIf Governor Bentley meant to hide his affair from his wife, he did not do it well, the report said.\n\nBentley maintains that he has broken no laws and resisted calls from Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh and House Speaker Mac McCutcheon, also Republicans, to resign. He said Friday that he saw no need to release details of his personal life.\n\n► Related: Panel sends Alabama chief justice's ethics case to trial\n\n► Related: Alabama House speaker convicted on ethics charges\n\nExposing embarrassing details of my past personal life, as has happened in the past, and as I'm told will happen again, will not create one single job, will not pass one budget, the governor said. It will not help any child get a good education. It will not help a child get good health care.\n\nRoss Garber, Robert Bentley's lawyer, was largely dismissive of the report Friday.\n\nWe will review today's document dump, which appears to be an amalgam of hearsay, rumor and innuendo, the statement said. I continue to have confidence there will ultimately be fairness and due process in this matter.\n\nDramatic finish\n\nThe report's release followed three dramatic days in the state capital, pushing the Bentley administration to the brink.\n\n• On Wednesday, the Alabama Ethics Commission found probable cause that Robert Bentley violated the state's ethics and campaign finance laws.\n\n• On Friday, Bentley coupled an emotional plea for forgiveness with a lawsuit to delay release of the report and the impeachment process.\n\nWe think it's appropriate to have that in the public arena, Jack Sharman, the state House Judiciary Committee's special counsel, said after a hearing before Judge Greg Griffin of the 15th Judicial Circuit Court in Montgomery. It is the public's information. It's where it should be.\n\nThe state Supreme Court directed briefs to be filed in that case by 1 p.m. CT Monday.\n\nAllegations of the governor's affair with Mason, first made by former Secretary Spencer Collier of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, came amid major political crises dating to 2014 that led to House Speaker Mike Hubbard's conviction and removal from office and the removal of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore. Robert Bentley had fired Collier the day before he came forward the the allegations.\n\nThe compromised political leadership led to messy fights over the state's budgets that required multiple sessions to resolve.\n\nTrips, disruptions\n\nThe report, culled from interviews with dozens of witnesses, added detail to some of the allegations made against the governor. Collier alleged that Robert Bentley and Mason used state resources to pursue the affair though the scope of the misuse wasn't clear.\n\nThe report alleges that Robert Bentley became increasingly heedless of allowing Mason — who was not a state employee at the time — to use state vehicles, including joining the governor on a helicopter trip to Wilcox County in 2014 while spokeswoman Jennifer Ardis drove to the event.\n\nRay Lewis, who was responsible for protecting governor, believed that keeping Mason out of the cars was a necessity based on his years of experience in dignitary protection, according to the report.\n\nLewis explained that, in the event of an emergency situation, the presence of nonofficial personnel could impede his primary duty of protecting Governor Bentley, it said. Mason left her state job as the governor's communications director in 2013 to become spokeswoman for his 2014 re-election campaign; though she is his senior political adviser now, she is a consultant and not back on the state payroll.\n\nThe relationship disrupted operations of the governor's office: Nothing could be done in the office without Mason's sign-off, Ardis said.\n\nSeth Hammett, a former Alabama House speaker and the governor's former chief of staff, said in the report that Mason upended his efforts to keep the office disciplined. And sometimes Bentley would decide something late in the evening only to change it in the morning.\n\nThe only person in the administration with regular access to Governor Bentley after hours was Mason, the report said.\n\nTen days before the Bentleys' divorce was final in 2015, Mason drafted a Bentley Joint Statement that would have had Dianne Bentley speak appreciatively of her time as first lady, while blasting erroneous and unsubstantiated media reports about the governor and Mason's relationship, according to the report.\n\nMs. Bentley never delivered that statement, the report said.\n\nA 'watershed' moment\n\nHowever, the report points to recordings that Dianne Bentley made of her husband and Mason as a watershed moment.\n\nMost relevant to the committee's consideration of the proposed articles of impeachment, however, is the fact that Governor Bentley became obsessed with the existence of the tapes and a desire to prevent them from becoming public, according to the report.\n\nThe recordings — which Heather Hannah, Dianne Bentley's chief of staff, made a copy of and which Dianne Bentley shared with her son Paul and daughter-in-law Melissa — led the governor to threaten staff members or use them in strange ways.\n\n► 2016: Scandal-plagued Ala. governor faces new impeachment articles\n\n► 2016: Alabama governor took alleged paramour to formal White House dinner\n\nIn 2014, the governor confronted Hannah in a kitchen and said, You will never work in the state of Alabama again if you tell anyone about this (the affair), according to the report.\n\nOn another occasion, the report indicates that Robert Bentley confronted Hannah in the parking lot of the governor's mansion and suggested that she had planted bugs in his office to listen to his conversations with Mason.\n\nHannah relates that Governor Bentley warned her to 'watch herself,' that she 'did not know what she was getting into,' and that because he was the governor, people 'bow to his throne,'  the report said.\n\n► More: Lawmaker plans impeachment articles against Ala. gov\n\n► More: Aide to Ala. governor resigns in wake of affair scandal\n\nThe report also claims that Robert Bentley directed Lewis to break off the affair on at least two occasions. In the first, Lewis had an hourlong conversation with Mason saying it was time to end the affair, only to have governor enter the conference room where they were meeting. Robert Bentley comforted Mason, telling her, 'It's all right, baby. It's going to be all right.\n\nLewis recalls thinking at that point that his efforts to end the affair were out the window, the report said.\n\nIn fall 2014, Robert Bentley took significant efforts to find the tapes, sending staff members to question Hannah and Linda Adams, his director of scheduling, about the tapes. Collier, the Cabinet-level Alabama Law Enforcement Agency secretary, visited and questioned Adams about the tapes, a visit that left her shaken though Collier concluded she didn't know anything about the recordings, according to the report.\n\n► More: Ethics report filed against Ala. gov. accused of affair\n\n​ ► More: Alabama governor denies having affair with staffer\n\nThe report also says governor and Collier asked Special Agent Scot Lee of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency's State Bureau of Investigation to investigate Hannah, which Lee refused.\n\nLee was bothered by what he called the 'you may want to look at ...' nature of the proposed assignment, the report said. The objective, he felt, was not to solve a crime, but to determine who had the tapes.\n\nWhat's next\n\nThe report will form the basis of the impeachment investigation. Chairman Mike Jones of the Alabama House Judiciary Committee said the committee will meet Monday.\n\nRobert Bentley asked for forgiveness Friday but rejected calls from the Senate president pro tem, Marsh of Anniston, Ala., and the House speaker, McCutcheon of Monrovia, Ala., to resign. Both have said impeachment would be a wrenching distraction for the state.\n\nThe next governor's race in Alabama will take place in 2018, and because of term limits Robert Bentley cannot run. If he resigns or is impeached, Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey would become the state's second female governor — the wife of controversial Gov. George Wallace, Lurleen Wallace was the first, elected in 1966 — and its first Republican woman governor.\n\nRobert Bentley's resignation is the only way to avoid taking our state on a long, painful and embarrassing journey whose ending is likely known to us all, McCutcheon said.\n\nFollow Brian Lyman on Twitter: @lyman_brian
Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nKeith Emerson, the 1970s-era rock composer and keyboardist found dead last week, committed suicide by gun shot, the Los Angeles coroner's office reported.\n\nEd Winter, spokesman for the county Medical Examiner's Office, said Monday the autopsy confirmed the cause of death was a shot from a .38 revolver. He said the death was ruled a suicide.\n\nEmerson, one-third and co-founder of the influential British band Emerson, Lake & Palmer, was found dead early Friday when his longtime companion, Mari Kawaguchi, 52, returned home to their condominium in Santa Monica, Calif.\n\nWinter said the autopsy report on Emerson, 71, showed he suffered from heart disease and depression.\n\nCarl Palmer, another member of the band, eulogized his friend and said on his website that he was organizing a tribute concert in June.\n\nPalmer announced Emerson's death on his website on Friday.\n\nKeith was a gentle soul whose love for music and passion for his performance as a keyboard player will remain unmatched for many years to come. He was a pioneer and an innovator whose musical genius touched all of us in the worlds of rock, classical and jazz.\n\nEmerson's next-of-kin were listed as his two sons from a previous marriage.\n\nEL&P was acclaimed in the 1970s for its orchestral approach to rock, drawing on classical and jazz styles and employing complicated rhythms and chords. It was also dismissed by traditional rock critics as pompous and over-the-top. But the band helped open audiences to the idea that rock music could be more than just three guitar chords and dance beats.\n\nThe band was founded in 1970 and broke up in 1979, reunited in 1991, later disbanded again and reunited one last time for a 2010 tour. In between, Emerson, a classically trained musician and a child prodigy, continued to compose music and perform, sometimes solo and other times with various musicians\n\nKawaguchi told the Associated Press that before his death, Emerson had been working with symphonies, including two in Germany and Japan, and was about to embark on a short tour in Japan starting on April 14 with his band. His work included a classical piano concerto.\n\nShe tweeted Monday a link to a YouTube video of one of his compositions, written on the day of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011, she said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
Former U.S. Rep. John David Dingell Jr., who was one of the U.S. House's most powerful chairmen and helped write and pass some of the most consequential legislation in the nation's history, died Thursday. He was 92.\n\nDingell, of Dearborn, served nearly 60 years in the House, making him the longest-serving member in Congress' history. He stepped down in early 2015. His wife, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, confirmed his death for the Free Press at about 9:30 p.m.\n\nHe was my love, she said, beginning to cry. She said he passed peacefully.\n\nHe was talking to us and we were all laughing (just before he died), she said, before becoming emotional and asking to get off the phone. Her office, shortly thereafter, put out a statement saying he died in their Dearborn home and will be remembered for his decades of public service to the people of southeast Michigan, his razor-sharp wit, and a lifetime of dedication to improving the lives of all who walk this Earth.\n\nDingell's death followed hospitalizations for various health problems in recent years. On Wednesday, sources close to his family and other reports said he had entered hospice with prostate cancer. That was after his wife, who replaced her husband in Congress, posted on social media that rather than being in Washington, she was home with John and we have entered a new phase.\n\nMore:John Dingell was a Twitter superstar. Here are his greatest hits.\n\nHe is my love and we have been a team for nearly 40 years. I will be taking each day as it comes, she said in the post. Five months earlier, in September 2018, Dingell had suffered a mild heart attack and was briefly hospitalized.\n\nToday the great state of Michigan said farewell to one of our greatest leaders, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement as condolences from public officials began to pour in. John Dingell will forever be remembered as 'The Dean' of Congress not simply for the length of his service, but for his unparalleled record of legislative accomplishments.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who occasionally sparred with John Dingell, in the past, put out a statement saying, Today, we have lost a beloved pillar of the Congress and one of the greatest legislators in American history. ... Chairman Dingell was our distinguished dean and Chairman, our legendary colleague and a beloved friend. His memory will stand as an inspiration.\n\nArrangements for Dingell's funeral were not immediately released.\n\nKnown in Washington and metro Detroit as Big John or the truck for his hard-charging personality, Dingell was an iconic presence in both.\n\nAn erudite, gentlemanly presence, Dingell, in his heyday atop the House Energy and Commerce Committee, brimmed with self-confidence and legislative savvy. At 6-foot-3, he towered over witnesses and was as feared and revered as any member of Congress. Throughout his career, he remained an advocate of Michigan manufacturing, its signature auto industry and its natural resources.\n\nAfter retiring at age 88, Dingell surprisingly embraced Twitter, reveling in the brevity of the form. He had more than 258,000 followers as he made playful, often sarcastic comments on culture (Staff has now informed me of what a Kardashian is. I'm only left with more questions), Michigan sports (Say what you will about the Lions, they've nearly perfected walking backward between plays while the flags are being picked up) and politics.\n\nFollowing the conflict in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017 in which white nationalists brawled with protesters wanting to pull down a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee — after which President Donald Trump said there were very fine people on both sides — Dingell tweeted, I signed up to fight Nazis 73 years ago and I'll do it again if I have to.\n\nOn Wednesday, he dictated his last tweet to his wife, saying, The Lovely Deborah is insisting I rest and stay off here, but after long negotiations we've worked out a deal where she'll keep up with Twitter for me as I dictate the messages. I want to thank you all for your incredibly kind words and prayers. You're not done with me just yet.\n\nHe will always be known first and foremost, however, for a remarkable legislative tenure that lasted 59 years — spanning all or part of 11 presidencies — during which time he cast tens of thousands of votes and helped write or otherwise played a role in passing the most significant measures of the era, including Medicare, the Civil Rights Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air acts, the Endangered Species Act and more.\n\nIn 2010, he helped pass the Affordable Care Act, modeled in part on legislation dating to that first proposed by his father, a New Deal Democrat whose career the younger Dingell set out to model his own on — and ended up surpassing.\n\nOne of the most consequential members of Congress in the last century is how congressional scholar Norm Ornstein described Dingell, noting he had a hand in virtually every major social policy advance since the 1960s. He was mentioned alongside congressional giants such as House Speakers Sam Rayburn and Tip O'Neill, as well as the late Sen. Robert Byrd, whom Dingell surpassed as the longest-serving member in 2013.\n\nHe referred to himself as just a dumb Polish lawyer — the family name was altered from Dzieglewicz — but such self-appraisal beggared the facts: For decades, Dingell was considered among the most effective members of Congress in terms of working his will and wasn't afraid to take on presidents, Cabinet officials, industrialists or even leaders of his own party to do so.\n\nMore:John Dingell recalled as icon: Here's what colleagues, friends are saying\n\nHe was not beloved by all. Some environmentalists considered him too close to the auto industry and an enemy to anti-pollution efforts, but he was still praised as a conservationist. For decades, he ran counter to his party's policy and defended gun rights, even sitting for a time on the National Rifle Association's board, but he was also an advocate for policies to help society's most vulnerable citizens. Some who ran afoul of him considered him ruthless and arrogant, a bully; his many friends and allies — Democrat and Republican — described him as generous, trustworthy and loyal.\n\nDingell joined Congress as a Democrat in a post-war era when that party's dominance in the House was a given and survived to see the institution he loved crippled by partisan factions and an intransigence that he loathed. His own career saw him expand exponentially the scope of the Commerce Committee and lead oversight efforts that would see the breakup of AT&T and run several Reagan-era officials out of office.\n\nEven at the end, Dingell — having lost his committee chairmanship to a challenge in his own party and bent by age and injury — continued to employ an encyclopedic knowledge of legislative processes and a lifetime of relationships on both sides of the political aisle to help shape legislation, including pipeline regulations and food safety protections. Even after Republicans regained majority control in 2011, he remained a force to contend with as chairman emeritus — and a longtime friend of the chairman who succeeded him for a time, U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-St. Joseph.\n\nIn his Dearborn-based district, Dingell's presence was felt in terms of innumerable earmarks and funding for rail lines and stations, new roads and bridges, airport improvements, educational facilities and much more. He put together land deals and federal authorizations to help create the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge and the River Raisin National Battlefield Park. He helped arrange federal support for Detroit during its bankruptcy and played a role in getting federal aid to GM and Chrysler.\n\nA few years ago when Ann Arbor desperately needed financial help to replace a crumbling bridge, he placed a call to then-Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, an old friend, to help secure funding.\n\nDespite his name recognition, political savvy and long list of friends, however, he was never seriously tempted to pursue higher office.\n\nI never wanted any other job, Dingell told the Free Press in 2013 on the verge of surpassing Byrd as the longest-serving member ever. I'm one of the luckiest guys in shoe leather.\n\nDingell seemed destined for Congress\n\nBorn on July 8, 1926, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Dingell spent much of his formative years in Washington, D.C. His father, who had ties to organized labor, moved the family back to Detroit and won election to a newly created congressional district in 1933. Despite redistricting, changes in political fortunes and Michigan's loss of seats through the years, the state has had a Dingell representing it since that time.\n\nJohn David Dingell Jr. served as a House page and attended schools in the Washington area before going to Georgetown University, where he got a law degree. In 1944, he was drafted, rose to the rank of second lieutenant and was about to be sent on a planned Japanese invasion when it was preempted by the U.S. dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nAfter the war, he entered private practice in Detroit, before joining the staff of U.S. Circuit Judge Theodore Levin and then becoming an assistant prosecuting attorney for Wayne County. After his father died in 1955, Dingell was elected in a special election to replace him. As he was sworn in by Rayburn, and other members gave remembrances of his father, it was difficult for him not to burst into tears.\n\nHe was 29 years old.\n\nIn the years that would follow, Dingell would learn from Rayburn, Speaker John McCormack and others how to legislate, build coalitions and master parliamentary rules, taking key roles on committees and amassing legislative acumen. In 1991, U.S. News and World Report named him one of its National Heroes, calling him Congress' most feared Democrat. In 1994, at the height of his powers, the Almanac of American Politics described Dingell as by any measure … one of the big men of the House.\n\nTaking control of what would from then on be known as the Energy and Commerce Committee in 1981 — a time when powerful committee chairs still virtually ruled Congress — he expanded its reach to cover pollution, securities, telecommunications, energy, railroads, toys, defense contracting, auto regulations, consumer protection and more. It was a job he would hold onto for an uninterrupted 14 years.\n\nSome 40 percent of all legislation went through the committee, more than any other, and Dingell kept a photo of the Earth from space near his office desk so that if anyone asked the limits of the committee's jurisdiction, he could point to it.\n\nAs chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee — a position he held onto for a time after becoming full committee chair — Dingell continued a practice of calling recalcitrant business people and errant bureaucrats before him to pepper them with questions. He investigated the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and oversaw the sale of Conrail; it was his committee that learned the Pentagon was spending $640 each for toilet seats. His letters to agency officials — often demanding specific answers to questions in a tight time frame — grew legendary in Washington as Dingell-grams.\n\nMore:Flashback: Trump meets match in 'tweet king' John Dingell\n\nHe was a watchdog over the government par excellence, Don Wolfensberger, a congressional scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said in 2014, shortly after Dingell announced his impending retirement. He went hard and fast after the answers to a lot of questions about how the agencies were run.\n\nHis skill and doggedness was such that presidents and congressional leaders often tried to get around him — with varying degrees of success. Many embraced him instead. Dingell was considered in such high esteem, for instance, that it was said that President Bill Clinton chose a former UAW staffer as his chief congressional liaison just to keep the lines of communication open with Dingell.\n\nHe was credited with developing a staff as aggressive and demanding as he was and they remained devoutly loyal to him through the years. One chief of staff of his remembered his interests as so varied and deep that he could describe a Russian ballet, or he could tell you how to gut an elk without getting any blood above the second knuckle.\n\nMeanwhile, he had few political challenges at home. In 1964, he squared off in a redrawn district against another incumbent — John Lesinski Jr., also the son of a former congressman — in what was seen as a referendum on the Civil Rights Act. Dingell had voted for it; Lesinski was the only northern Democrat to vote against it. Dingell, with the help of labor, won.\n\nIn 2002, Dingell was placed in the same district as Rep. Lynn Rivers and it led to a hard-fought, fractious race. Dingell won, and, when Democrats took back the majority in the House in 2006, he again became chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. It was short-lived, however — two years later, with Dingell recovering from knee surgery, an ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi — Rep. Henry Waxman of California, a legislative legend in his own right whose work with Dingell helped write Clean Air Act standards — challenged him for the chairmanship and won.\n\nMany thought Dingell would leave after that but he stayed — helping to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2010 and taking on angry constituents in town hall meetings to explain it and winning two more terms before calling it quits.\n\nA power couple in Washington and Michigan\n\nHe referred to his wife Debbie — the lovely Deborah, he called her in public — as his secret weapon. For decades, they were one of Washington and Michigan's premier political power couples with connections that stretched from industry and labor through the halls of Congress to the White House.\n\nMore than 26 years his junior, the former Deborah Insley notably only agreed to go out with the divorced Dingell — he had four children from his first marriage — after he asked several times. Married in 1981, he doted on her and she proved a political power in her own right, guarding his back with pundits — though not always agreeing with him, such as on gun rights — and becoming a Democratic national committeewoman before she was a member of Congress.\n\nWhen he announced his retirement, no one was surprised that Debbie Dingell, who had also been talked about as a possible contender when U.S. Sen. Carl Levin announced his impending retirement in 2013, said she would run to fill her husband's seat, which no one other than someone with the last name Dingell has ever held.\n\nDingell's retirement came as a host of Michigan politicians were headed for the exits: Levin, a Democrat, as well as Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, R-Midland, and Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Howell. With Dingell's departure, a former staffer of his — U.S. Rep. John Conyers, of Detroit — became the longest-serving acting member of Congress, having been first elected in 1964.\n\nConyers' chances of catching Dingell and surpassing his longevity in Congress disappeared in December 2017 when Conyers stepped down amid allegations he had harassed and otherwise mistreated women staffers, accusations the congressman denied.\n\nDingell's service stretched back to a time when there were just 48 stars on the American flag, before Alaska and Hawaii had been admitted as states. And the fact that he remained an integral member of the House all those years amazed many.\n\nDingell is, just deep in his bones, a man of the House, remembered Ornstein, who had known Dingell for decades, around the time of his retirement. He loves the House, the rhythms of the House. He loves to represent people. He loves to get his fingers into policy.\n\nAdded Wolfensberger: I'm not saying there's a gene there, but it's pretty close, considering he succeeded his father. There's something there that sets him apart from most people.\n\nIn 2014, Dingell was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then-President Barack Obama.\n\nIn recent years, Dingell had suffered health problems, though typically they involved relatively short stays in the hospital. Shortly after announcing his retirement plans, Dingell had a medical procedure done to correct an abnormal heart rhythm, then returned to work — finishing out his term in January 2015 — after that. Around the time of his retirement, in late 2014, he also took a couple of falls that landed him in the hospital, including one in which he fractured his hip, even as his wife was preparing to take office.\n\nHe got a pacemaker in 2015 — after which the former congressman tweeted, Being old sucks. And in December 2017, he was hospitalized at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, D.C. after a fall, telling his Twitter followers, Particularly glad I'm not a horse.\n\nDingell knew, prior to his retirement announcement in early 2014, that some critics thought it was time for him to leave before he did but he believed it was important to remain in office as long as he thought he could make a difference. When the end came, Dingell — who often employed homespun quips to make his point — didn't mince words.\n\nI've reached the age when people don't buy green bananas, he joked in February 2014, making the official announcement before the Southern Wayne County Chamber of Commerce in Southgate. And I don't think that I can assure people that the green banana I buy today, I'm going to be around tomorrow to eat.\n\nI want to serve honorably and well, and I want to do the job I can and should do,  he added. I don't want people to feel sorry for me. .... I don't want to go out feet first.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: 703-854-8947 or tspangler@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter at @tsspangler.

Jolie Lee\n\nfor USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nGet out your green! It's St. Patrick's Day. USA TODAY Network explains the origins of some of the Irish holiday's traditions.\n\n\n\n1. Who was St. Patrick?\n\n\n\nSt. Patrick — brace yourself — was not actually Irish. Patrick was a nobleman born in about 400 A.D. in Britain and kidnapped by Irish pirates at the age of 16, said Philip Freeman, author of St. Patrick of Ireland: A Biography.\n\nPatrick was born into a religious family, but was an atheist early in his life. However, he rediscovered his faith while enslaved in Ireland, Freeman told USA TODAY Network.\n\nAfter 17 years as a slave, St. Patrick escaped Ireland and found his way home, but returned to Ireland as a missionary.\n\nHe said he was ready to die in Ireland in order to make his mission successful, Freeman said.\n\nIt's unclear if St. Patrick did in fact die in Ireland, but March 17 is widely believed to be the day of his death, according to Freeman.\n\n2. Green River in Chicago is a family affair:\n\nAnother unique tradition that has grown in popularity every year is the annual dyeing of the Chicago River for St. Patrick's Day.\n\nIf you've never had the chance to see it, you can watch a timelapse here:\n\nThe Butler and Rowan family clans are responsible for turning the murky water bright green, and they've done it for more than 50 years.\n\nThe only way to become part of the six-person boat crew is to be related by blood or marriage to either Mike Butler or Tom Rowan, according to The Chicago Tribune. Each year, the crew shakes an orange powder — a top secret recipe — into the Chicago River from a sifter and it stays green for about five hours.\n\n3. Parades\n\nSt. Patrick's Day began as a religious holiday in Ireland but became a celebratory affair because of Irish Americans, according to Timothy Meagher, a history professor at Catholic University in D.C.\n\nIn the United States, St. Patrick's Day was first celebrated with banquets at elite clubs in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, Charleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga., Meagher said.\n\nNew York City hosted the first St. Patrick's Day parade in 1762, and by the mid-19th century parades were common, he said.\n\nThe parades are a statement of showing our colors, showing our numbers, showing that we are powerful and important, Meagher said of the role of parades in celebrating Irish-American identity.\n\n4. Shamrocks\n\nLegend has it that St. Patrick used the three-leaved shamrock to explain the Christian Holy Trinity.\n\nBut Freeman said, There's no evidence St. Patrick ever did that.\n\nTraditions as early as the 17th century incorporated the plant, said Mike Cronin, author of Wearing the Green: A History of St. Patrick's Day.\n\nPeople wore shamrocks on their coats and closed the day by drowning the shamrock — placing it in a glass of whiskey before drinking, Cronin said.\n\n5. Gobs and gobs of Guinness:\n\nThe Irish stout is the drink of choice on St. Patrick's Day.\n\nOn a typical day, Americans drink about 600,000 pints of the Dublin-based beer. But on St. Patrick's Day, about 3 million pints of Guinness are downed, according to Guinness in an email to USA TODAY Network.\n\nPlanning on drinking a pint on Monday? Tips from Guinness on the perfect pour: Tilt the glass at 45 degrees when pouring until it is three-quarters full, then let the beer settle before filling the glass completely to the top.\n\nAnalysts are predicting that 13 million pints of Guinness will be consumed worldwide, during this year's holiday.\n\n6. Leprechauns\n\nToday's leprechauns, usually rosy-cheeked, boozy little men in green attire, come from Irish folklore.\n\nThe first recorded mention of a leprechaun goes back to the 8th century, coming from the word luchorpán, meaning little body to describe water spirits, according to John and Caitlin Matthews in The Element Encyclopedia of Magical Creatures.\n\nAnother possible origin is the Irish god Lugh, whose Welch variant is known as one of the Three Golden Shoemakers.\n\nThere's also the Irish fairy Cluricaune, a cunning spirit who haunts cellars, drinks, smokes and plays tricks, the Matthewses write. Cluricaune was popularized in a 1825 publication called Fairy Legends.\n\n7. Corned beef and cabbage\n\nAlthough a classic St. Patrick's Day meal, corned beef and cabbage is more American than Irish.\n\nIrish Americans in the 19th century were mostly poor. The most affordable meat available was corned beef, according to Cronin.\n\nAnd cabbage? It's a spring vegetable and it's cheap, Cronin said.\n\nHere's more on St. Patrick's Day:\n\nThrowing a party?\n\n13 tips for throwing a St. Patrick's Day party on a budget\n\nSt. Patty's Day Caribbean style\n\nIsland greenery: St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the Caribbean\n\nContributing: Teresa Blackman, KGW-TV
Bob Nightengale\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nST. LOUIS - Colorado Rockies shortstop Trevor Story keeps trying to ignore the noise, but everywhere he turns, it's there.\n\nHere he is, trying to maintain his splendid play six weeks into his first major-league season, but there's that elephant in the room, getting larger by the day.\n\nWhile Story was at Busch Stadium on Thursday preparing to play the St. Louis Cardinals, 1,400 miles away in Scottsdale, Ariz., there was that noise.\n\nJose Reyes was at the Rockies' spring-training complex, working out and speaking publicly for the first time in eight months, apologizing for his domestic violence incident that resulted in a 51-game suspension from Major League Baseball.\n\nI'm sorry, Reyes said. I put myself in this situation. Now I need to put this in the past and continue with my life and my career.\n\nRight now, for me, it's time to get ready and help the Rockies win.\n\nIn just 12 days, Reyes' suspension is over.\n\nJose Reyes returns to Rockies, vows to be 'a better man, a better husband'\n\nThe four-time All-Star shortstop will be free to rejoin the Rockies any time they want him back, with Reyes expected to first begin a minor-league rehab assignment on June 1.\n\nReyes said Thursday that he expects to be called up by the Rockies as soon as he's ready, but the trouble is that there is no job to be filled. The Rockies have a starting shortstop, and with the way Story has performed, it would be unfair to strip him of it.\n\nYou don't bench a kid who's hitting 12 homers with 31 RBI, tied for the major-league lead with four triples and playing solid defense.\n\nThat decision I don't have,'' Reyes said. The only decision I can control right now is being here and, you know, working out every day and trying to get back in baseball shape.\n\nConsidering the Rockies still owe Reyes $41 million through the 2017 season, would they dare release him and eat that much money?\n\nOr do they bring him back, perhaps even having him play different positions, to make him marketable?\n\nIt's a little weird for sure,'' Rockies All-Star third baseman Nolan Arenado told USA TODAY Sports. Hopefully, he does what he needs to get back here, and hopefully if he comes back with us, we can use him in some way to help us win.\n\nIf he comes back with us, we can use him in some way to help us win. But we got our shortstop.''\n\nStory, 23, has earned this job. Sure, his opportunity arose awkwardly. Reyes was arrested Oct. 30 at a Maui resort after a domestic dispute with his wife, leaving the Rockies with a wide-open vacancy at shortstop while Reyes was placed on administrative leave.\n\nStory grabbed the job and stuffed it in his back pocket in spring training, hitting .340 with six homers and 13 RBI. He then made sure no one would take it away with the greatest power-hitting start in baseball history. He became the first player to ever homer in his first four major-league games, and the only one to homer six times in his team's first four games.\n\nYou know what was so impressive,'' says Rockies first base coach Eric Young, is that it didn't faze him at all. He had all of this attention, with all of the press clippings, and I don't think he even bothered to know what people were saying about him.\n\nHe just kept to himself, kept working hard, and has been a class act. Really, he's just a cool cat.''\n\nStory, who was playing at Class AA New Britain 12 months ago, no longer is hitting a home run a day, but his numbers remain remarkable. He finished April with 10 home runs, the most by a National League rookie in history, and his 11 are tied for fifth in the major leagues.\n\nMost impressive has been his steady defense, with Rockies manager Walt Weiss saying, There were a couple of times I'd look up, and say, That's Tulo right there.' He has just the right mixture of humility and confidence.\n\nIt was the July trade of Troy Tulowitzki that brought Reyes to Denver. No one in the Rockies organization figured Story would be next man up so soon.\n\nHe's had a lot thrown at him, and he's been in such a tough spot for a rookie,'' Weiss said, but you couldn't draw it up any better than the way he's handled everything. He's had the Reyes stuff thrown at him. He's had to answer questions about that in spring training, and again now.\n\nHe hasn't wavered. Really, he's been unflappable.''\n\nMark Trumbo powering Orioles - and slowly gaining control of his destiny\n\nNo one knows exactly what will transpire when Reyes' suspension ends, and Weiss says he hasn't even spoken with Reyes, but he made sure to let Story know that there will be no shortstop controversy.\n\nThere had to be some reassurance,'' Weiss said, that's only fair to Trevor. You know as a player, and especially as a young player, a lot of crazy thoughts can go through your mind, especially in your alone time.''\n\nThe Rockies players, even those who befriended Reyes after he was traded last July to Colorado, have also let Story know they stand behind him. They want the best for Reyes and his family, but it doesn't mean he should be given a starting job, with Story helping lead their surprising 20-19 start.\n\nJose Reyes had a tough moment in life; we forgive him,'' Arenado said. You've got to forgive people. The good thing is that he and his wife are better, which is nice, because marriage is a big thing. I'm happy for him that it's going OK.\n\nBut when things are going good like they are for us, you don't change it.''\n\nSaid outfielder Carlos Gonzalez: (Story) is a potential All-Star, and the way he's playing, you don't have to worry about anything. But they're going to have to make a spot for either him or Jose. Two good players, so it's a tough decision.\n\nBut this kid is handling it the right way. He's just focusing on his game, knowing that's all he can control.''\n\nAlthough no Rockies official wants to say it, Story is a better shortstop than Reyes, whose defensive skills have eroded. He turns 33 in three weeks.\n\nStory, who has never met Reyes, says he's indebted to Tulowitzki for tutoring him through the years. He believed all along he could do this, but until the strange circumstances, there was never an opening.\n\nI've always been confident,'' Story said, and had the belief that I can perform at this level. It's still baseball to me, just everything is on a bigger stage.''\n\nThe biggest struggle, just like any rookie, has been the ever-ending battle of adjustments. Story, who's hitting .277 with a .337 on-base percentage and .597 slugging, found out that scouting reports make their way around big-league clubhouses pretty quickly.\n\nThose inside fastballs that he was launching for homers stopped being thrown. Pitchers instead fed him a steady diet of off-speed pitches, getting him to chase pitches off the plate. It has resulted in a league-leading 57 strikeouts.\n\nStill, Story is adjusting right back. He hit .455 last weekend in the Rockies' three-game sweep over the New York Mets, and .321 with eight extra-base hits in his last 12 games.\n\nI'm having the time of my life,'' Story said. The rest of the stuff, it doesn't make me uncomfortable. I just worry about what I can control, and help my team win. Really, that's the only way to approach it.\n\nWhoever gets the job done, that's who they'll go with. It's the way it should be, right?''

The prime suspect remains Glen Taylor, a mild-mannered delivery driver whose professional aspirations are never realized and whose childless marriage is put under scrutiny. The only problem is, Bella has never been found and now Glen, released after an unsuccessful prosecution, is dead in an accident.\n\nThe result is even more press coverage, more police inquiries and much more pressure for the widow, Jean Turner.\n\nUSA TODAY says *** out of four stars. Here is where the brilliance of The Widow lies. Whom do you trust? Whom can you trust?\n\nFiona Barton's 'The Widow' offers psychological thrills\n\nAmerican Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers by Nancy Jo Sales; Knopf, 375 pp.; non-fiction\n\nSales talks to young women around the country to learn the extent to which their lives revolve around social media, and the sometimes traumatic effect it's having on their interactions and aspirations.\n\nUSA TODAY says ***½ stars.

An actress who had a role in Marriage Story and her husband are suing Princess Cruises, alleging their room on the Emerald Princess ship was infested with bedbugs and left them with bites all over their bodies. The cruise line has responded with a statement addressing the couple's concerns.\n\nConnie and Alvin Flores allege in a lawsuit, filed in November 2019, that their stateroom aboard the cruise they took a year earlier was infested with hundreds of bedbugs. The pair cruised from Nov. 28, 2018, through Dec. 4, 2018, out of Los Angeles. Connie Flores played an arguing woman in Marriage Story, and is now speaking publicly about the suit.\n\nMy husband and I thought we were going on our dream vacation for our wedding anniversary. Never did we imagine that we would be trapped on a ship with a room infested with bedbugs, Flores told USA TODAY in a statement. This was a horrific experience, and no one should ever go through such pain and trauma. This ordeal has prompted us to be advocates and bring awareness to people who have been exposed to bedbugs.\n\nThe couple is seeking $75,000 in damages.\n\nThe exposure to Connie and her husband is another indication of the bedbug epidemic not only in the United States, but also worldwide, Brian Virag, Flores' attorney, told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the cruise line was negligent, wanton, reckless and failed to deal with pest control aboard the ship. It also states the bug bites aggravated a preexisting physical condition.\n\nThe bedbugs latched onto the (couple) while they slept and sucked their blood until they were gorged, the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in California, reads. (The couple) suffered from numerous bites and skin rashes, which caused pain, discomfort, annoyance sleeplessness, inconvenience, humiliation, anxiety and emotional distress. The couple alleges employees and medical staff both refused and delayed their requests for care and a new room.\n\nIn response, Princess Cruises emphasized stateroom attendants are trained to spot bedbugs.\n\nWe were very sorry to hear about Ms. Flores' concerns, spokeswoman for Princess Cruises Negin Kamali told USA TODAY. Princess Cruises is committed to following and often exceed stringent sanitation and health guidelines. Given that this is an open lawsuit, we are limited in what information we can share right now, however, it is worth noting, our room attendants are highly trained to identify bedbugs and all staterooms are thoroughly inspected each month as a preventative measure.\n\nBy virtue of how the cruise vacation experience is designed our staterooms receive considerably more cleaning attention by our room attendants than a hotel room on land (twice a day, including evening turn-down service along with a thorough cleaning – including changing linen at the end of each cruise), the statement continued. It would be highly unusual for the presence of bedbugs to go unnoticed for more than the length of one cruise.\n\nWhat are bedbugs and what should you do if you find them?\n\nBedbugs are tiny insects approximately the size of an apple seed. Adult bedbugs are oval, reddish-brown and flat. Younger ones can be difficult to see because they're so small.\n\nAnd there's a reason they're called bedbugs: They like to lurk during the daytime where people sleep and feed on them at night (bedbugs feed on both human and animal blood). The insects can be found in a host of places from mattresses to bedding to cracks in furniture to under carpeting and more.\n\nBedbugs can be found worldwide, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and are not a reflection on the cleanliness of any accommodation (so, yes, even a five-star hotel can have bedbugs). They don't spread disease nor are they seen as dangerous, but allergic reactions to bites could require a doctor visit.\n\nThe bites look like mosquito or flea bites, with a swollen, red spot that could itch or hurt. They could present randomly as well as in a straight line. Some people might not have any adverse reaction to the bites, but others could see swelling.\n\nMake looking for them a priority. The University of Minnesota recommends looking at the edging and seams of mattresses and box springs, as well as a bed's headboard. You should also check out the furniture near the bed, cracks in nightstands as well as behind picture frames, where bedbugs can hide.\n\nIf you notified staff and they are indeed bedbugs, make sure you ask to be moved to a different room (and not one next to the one where you stayed).\n\nGross! What you need to know and do if your hotel room has bedbugs\n\nYikes:Princess Cruises apologizes for 'cultural insensitivity' after workers dress in Maori garb
The Editorial Board\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLet's see whether we understand this. A lawyer for Donald Trump sets up a private Delaware company weeks before the 2016 election to arrange a $130,000 secret payoff to a porn star named Stormy Daniels, buying her silence about an alleged Trump tryst in 2006.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal breaks this perfidy recently, and leading evangelical leaders promptly ... denounce his immoral behavior? No, silly us. They give Trump a spiritual pass:\n\n►You get a mulligan, said Tony Perkins, head of the Family Research Council.\n\n►The president is a much different person today (than in 2006), said the Rev. Franklin Graham, the son of Billy Graham.\n\n►He's changed, said Jerry Falwell Jr.\n\nMessage: That 7th Commandment is overrated. It's hard to imagine these religious leaders being so forgiving if the sinner in question was a Democrat. In fact, this sort of rank hypocrisy only serves to diminish their moral authority.\n\nTONY PERKINS:President is keeping his promises\n\nThis isn't to say that their flock — the nation's estimated 60 million evangelical Christians — is acting irrationally by supporting Trump. About 80% of white evangelicals voted for Trump, who identifies as Presbyterian. And while that support has slipped a bit, they remain a strong constituency for the president.\n\nBorn-again Christians have a long record of being highly pragmatic, rather than purist, in (using) the tools of the federal government to protect their own authority and advance a moral agenda, Molly Worthen, assistant professor of history at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, has written.\n\nBetween Trump and Hillary Clinton, if evangelicals saw the former as the better vessel — albeit a morally flawed one — for overturning Roe v. Wade or safeguarding religious freedom, why not support him? After all, the Lord works in mysterious ways and through imperfect vessels.\n\nWhat's more puzzling is that leaders of the religious right feel it's somehow necessary to shoehorn the president's character into some kind of born-again template, a mold he has never fit and never will.\n\nBy the accounts of more than a dozen women, Trump is a serial sexual predator. On the infamous Access Hollywood tape, he boasted of grabbing women's genitals. And in the 2006 encounter with Stormy Daniels, he allegedly betrayed his marriage vows to Melania shortly after the birth of his youngest son.\n\nTo this day, he bears false witness an average of several times a day and uses vulgarities to denigrate entire nations of people.\n\nYet Graham and Falwell say they believe Trump has morally changed over the years. He's not the same person now that he was back then, Falwell told CNN. That's why evangelicals are so quick to forgive Donald Trump when he asked for forgiveness for things that happened 10, 15 years ago.\n\nExcept he never really did. The Access Hollywood tape is about the only thing Trump has publicly apologized for. But The New York Times reported he has since questioned the tape's authenticity.\n\nOn more than one occasion, the president has all but rejected a fundamental religious tenet: seeking Christ's forgiveness. I am not sure I (ever) have, he said in 2015.\n\nEvangelical leaders should dispense with the do-overs and simply acknowledge that Trump is what he is: a means to a political end.
A group of state representatives in Kansas introduced legislation Wednesday that seeks to define same-sex marriage as parody marriage, stop the state from recognizing gay marriage and establish an elevated marriage option for straight couples who seek higher standards of commitment.\n\nOne of the two bills introduced contends LGBTQ people are aligned with the secular humanism movement, which it calls a religion. It also calls the gay pride rainbow flag a symbol of a faith-based worldview.\n\nBy doing so, the proposed legislation seeks to define marriage between a man and a woman as neutral and same-sex marriage as religious in nature. It then contends the state cannot constitutionally condone a religious practice.\n\nLegislation with a similar approach never made it to a vote in a South Carolina last year. The American Civil Liberties Union called that bill unconstitutional and absurd.\n\nThe two Kansas bills contain a sweeping set of proposals and a number of controversial assertions. Among the proposals the legislation seeks to enact:\n\nBarring the state from recognizing same-sex marriage\n\nBarring the state from recognizing transgender individuals\n\nAllowing gay conversion therapy\n\nBarring public libraries and public schools from participating in programs such as drag queen storytime.\n\nThe bills assert:\n\nThe government's endorsement of LGBTQ ideology has amounted to the greatest sham since the inception of American jurisprudence\n\nSame-sex marriages erode community standards of decency\n\nLGBTQ advocacy is different from civil rights advocacy for reasons such as: There are no ex-blacks but there are thousands of ex-gays\n\nThe Wichita Eagle reports the legislation stands little chance of advancing and that the sponsor Rep. Randy Garber has acknowledged the language used in the legislation is kind of harsh.\n\nTheir marriage probably doesn't affect me – their union or whatever you want to call it. But in my opinion, they're trying to force their beliefs on society, Garber told the publication. He also said that he does not consider himself a bigot and believes that Christians such as himself should take a stand on what you believe, lovingly.\n\nLGBTQ advocacy group Equality Kansas has condemned both pieces of legislation.\n\nEvery year, we see bills that restrict, remove, and limit the rights of LGBT Kansans, but never have we seen this level of extremist vitriol laid out in legislative language, Thomas Witt, executive director of the group, said in a written statement. Witt said the bills amount to 18 pages of insults and name calling.\n\nThe two bills have at least seven sponsors, all Republicans, according to online records accessed Wednesday.\n\nA 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling sanctioned same-sex marriage, but the state's constitution prohibits it. Should the two proposed bills pass, they would likely face legal challenges.\n\nContributing: Susan Miller
Cardi B and Offset's marriage may not be as imminently over as it once seemed.\n\nThe Bodak Yellow rapper answered a question about the status of their relationship as she left a courthouse in Queens, New York, after a Thursday hearing regarding her ongoing strip club fight case.\n\nWe working things out, baby, Cardi said, according to reports from E! News and People, after being asked if she had reunited with her estranged husband. The apparent truce in their marriage comes about two months after she announced their split in early December.\n\nIn a now-delated Instagram video from Dec. 5, Cardi, 26, claimed she and the Migos rapper had tried and failed to make their relationship work.\n\nWe are really good friends and we are really good business partners, you know, he's always somebody that I run to talk to, and we got a lot of love for each other but things just haven't been working out between us for a long time, she said. It's nobody fault. I guess we just grew out of love, but we are not together anymore. I don't know it might take time to get a divorce and I'm going to always have a lot of love for him because he is my daughter's father.\n\nAbout a week later, Offset, 27, tried and failed to win her back with a public stunt at December's Rolling Loud Festival in Los Angeles. He wheeled out flower arrangements that spelled out Take Me Back Cardi during Cardi's headling set. In video of the concert, Cardi can be seen shaking her head and having a verbal exchange with Offset, before he quickly leaves the stage.\n\nCardi and Offset secretly married in September 2017 before the Migos rapper's public proposal on Oct. 28, when he offered her a giant ring onstage at Power 99 radio's Powerhouse concert in Philadelphia.\n\nThe couple's baby daughter, Kulture, was born in July.
Andrea Mandell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSean Penn and Lee Daniels have buried the hatchet.\n\nSettling a a $10 million defamation lawsuit Penn filed against Daniels in September, the Empire creator has issued an apology to Penn, along with a generous donation to the actor's Haitian Relief Organization.\n\nThe lawsuit stemmed from an interview Daniels gave to The Hollywood Reporter last year about domestic abuse allegations surrounding Empire star Terrence Howard.\n\nPenn files $10 mil lawsuit against 'Empire' creator\n\n(Howard) ain't done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn, and all of a sudden he's some (expletive) demon, Daniels told THR. That's a sign of the time, of race, of where we are right now in America.\n\nPenn reacted with a lawsuit, stating he would no longer tolerate allegations of past violence against women. For months, the two continued to engage in a war of words, with Daniels citing the First Amendment.\n\nBy December, Penn had added an addendum to the lawsuit: his ex-wife, Madonna, submitted a written statement pointedly denying Penn abused her during their marriage (from 1985 - 1989), calling the rumors completely outrageous, malicious, reckless and false.\n\nMadonna defends Sean Penn: He 'never struck me'\n\nOn Wednesday, Daniels released an apology. Here's his statement in full:\n\nI am so sorry that I have hurt you, Sean, and I apologize and retract my reckless statements about you. How thoughtless of me. You are someone I consider a friend, a brilliant actor and true Hollywood legend and humanitarian. I too have been the subject of false attacks by others, like those made here. My most important role is as a father, and it is important to me that my children learn that it is wrong to reference gossip as fact, as I did here. That can be very damaging and hurtful. Domestic violence is a very serious issue. My comments were cavalier; it was not my intention to diminish the severity of the issue, but rather to express a view regarding the disparate treatment of men of color in our national conversation. I apologize again for the distress that this has caused you and your family. My very best, Lee Daniels.\n\nPenn also released a statement: I accept Lee's heartfelt apology and appreciate the sincerity with which it was delivered. I also accept and appreciate his generous donation to J/P HRO, which will have a transformative effect on the lives of those we serve in Haiti.\n\nSean Penn will soon debut his latest film, The Last Face, starring Charlize Theron, at the Cannes Film Festival. Daniels' new show, Star, headlined by Queen Latifah, was recently picked up for a series order by Fox.
WASHINGTON – When second lady Karen Pence illustrated a children's book about the vice president's family rabbit, comedian John Oliver created a parody version that was meant as a criticism of Mike Pence's record on gay rights.\n\nNow a support group for LGBTQ young people is sending 100 copies of that alternative version to the Christian school where Karen Pence is teaching art two days a week.\n\nUnder a parent agreement posted on the school's website, Immanuel Christian School can refuse admission to students who participate in, support or condone sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity. The school also can refuse admission based on similar activities of a parent or guardian or within a particular home.\n\nAmit Paley, head of The Trevor Project, said the suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization hopes the school will adopt policies of inclusion.\n\nThe group's statement includes comments from Luke Hartman, a former student of the school who calls himself a living example that intolerance, both in policy and rhetoric, are harmful to the mental wellness and development of LGBTQ students, who are desperately looking for ways to fin it.\n\nThe silent and spoken messages of rejection that are constantly felt by LGBTQ students directly impact the relationship they have with their faith, education, and relationships with family and friends, Hartman said.\n\nAfter news reports highlighted the school's rules, Pence's spokeswoman Kara Brooks called it absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack.\n\nIn an interview Thursday with the Catholic News Network EWTN, Mike Pence said his family will let the critics roll off our backs.\n\nBut this criticism of Christian education in America should stop, he said.\n\nTony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, urged supporters to pledge to pray for Karen Pence and other leaders who choose to openly live by their faith in the face of those who seek to marginalize those who live by biblical truth.\n\nThe truth is that Karen, like other Christians faithful to the Bible, believes sexual conduct outside of the marriage of a man and woman is contrary to God's plan, Perkins wrote in an email missive.\n\nPence taught at the suburban Virginia school for 12 years when her husband served in Congress. She's also taught at public and private schools in Indiana.\n\nA watercolor artist, Pence has illustrated books written by her daughter, Charlotte, about Marlon Bundo, a family pet.\n\nIn Oliver's book, the boy bunny falls in love with another boy bunny. Proceeds benefit The Trevor Project and the health organization AIDS United.\n\nInstead of dismissing Oliver's parody, Charlotte Pence bought a copy. She said people should support both books since the proceeds from both go to charity.\n\nMy dad has always taught me to handle situations with grace … just to be kind whenever you can, she told USA TODAY last year.\n\nMike Pence, the former Indiana governor, has long maintained that marriage is between a man and a woman. As governor, he pushed a religious freedom law that put Indiana in the national spotlight. While Pence insisted he was protecting the rights of the faithful, many feared it was a thinly veiled attempt to allow businesses to refuse to serve gay, lesbian and transgender customers.\n\nContributing: Chris Sikich, USA TODAY Network\n\nMore:Why Mike Pence's daughter is proud she's one of the few women he'll dine alone with\n\nMore:Marlon Bundo, Vice President Mike Pence's bunny, will be back in two more books in 2019
USA TODAY\n\nWhat's a gold statue to do?\n\nThe odds are all over the map this awards season – particularly in the best-picture race, where critical darlings are going head to head with box-office blockbusters. Should it be a small film made in Mexico City or the expertly crafted world of Wakanda that earns Oscar's biggest prize of the night? USA TODAY's movie experts fight for their favorites.\n\n'Black Panther'\n\nBest picture should go to the best picture, and undoubtedly this Marvel powerhouse deserves a nod for the top prize – that's just science. Filled with sprawling, African-influenced visuals and spectacular special effects (Chadwick Boseman runs up the side of a building!), Black Panther might as well go on a shopping spree for technical nominations.\n\nThe cast is stellar but the Academy would be foolish to leave out Michael B. Jordan, who lends hunger, charisma and tragic depth to Killmonger – the best cinematic supervillain since Heath Ledger's Oscar-winning Joker. (A supporting-actress nod for Letitia Wright's awesome Shuri would also be welcome, but let's not be too greedy.)\n\nBlack Panther is that rare beast that shakes up pop culture for the better, changes the game for an entire genre, and is endlessly entertaining. If a blockbuster like Titanic can make a splash with scads of nominations, then this ship should come in, too. – Brian Truitt\n\n'Eighth Grade'\n\nThe name alone is an impossible sell. Because who wants to relive Eighth Grade? But no film will sear your soul more intensely than Bo Burnham's tale of an awkward teen navigating her last week of middle school, which manages to be both universal (unretouched zits) and of the moment (active-shooter training). Think of it as this year's Lady Bird, minus the part about being nominated for five Oscars and winning none.\n\nLike Jordan Peele, another comic turned writer/director, Burnham could contend for original screenplay, even if he will be crowded out of newbie director consideration by Bradley Cooper's A Star Is Born. So root hard instead for a best-picture nomination (hey, there are believers at GoldDerby.com) and an acting slot for Elsie Fisher, who'll break your heart when Kayla torches her time capsule of hopes and dreams.\n\nThough Josh Hamilton has been unjustly overlooked in supporting actor categories as Kayla's hovering dad, danged if his emotional fireside speech won't remind you of Michael Stuhlbarg's tear-jerking Call Me By Your Name monologue. Is it too much to hope that the Academy will throw Hamilton a Hail Mary? – Kim Willis\n\n'The Favourite'\n\nHow much should Oscars voters start leaning toward The Favourite? Let us count the bodice-ripping ways. The diabolical comedy is steeped in Sapphic subterfuge while serving up gold-star performances from a triangle of female leads. It's got a gout-ridden Queen Anne, played delectably by Olivia Colman in all her bejeweled inertia. Her scheming confidante (and lover) Lady Sarah Churchill, played with gusto by Rachel Weisz, hasn't been hailed enough this awards season. And bless Emma Stone, going full speed ahead at this point in her career as a social-climbing scullery maid hell-bent on trampling her cousin Sarah by way of the queen's tufted bed.\n\nIt's true that Oscar voters tend to lean away from comedy on the big night, but is there anything more 2019 than the madcap way The Favourite shakes up royal history books through the female gaze? (For extra measure, Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos – of The Lobster fame – is one of the most exciting directors working today.) Anoint Feb. 24 ladies' night and call it for this wonderfully weird film, would you? – Andrea Mandell\n\n'Roma'\n\nAnyone who's not moved by Roma should probably get their pulse checked. Alfonso Cuaron's latest is a transcendent piece of filmmaking, which he tenderly constructed from his memories growing up in 1970s Mexico City.\n\nThe Spanish-language drama is a tribute to Cuaron's own childhood nanny, who is represented here by Cleo (newcomer Yalitza Aparicio), a beloved live-in housekeeper for a middle-class family. Although she is silent for much of the film, Aparicio's expressive face is filled with a lifetime of emotions: empathy, as she watches a marriage crumble inside their home; heartache, when she sees her first love for who he truly is; and relief, after overcoming unspeakable loss with her head (quite literally) above water. It's a quietly devastating performance that most of this year's acting nominees could only hope to achieve, captured in striking black and white by Cuaron, who also takes on duties of cinematographer.\n\nRoma is a celebration of all of life's little moments, both good and bad, and a rewarding slow burn for those that give it the time and attention it so richly deserves. And while no foreign-language movie has won best picture in the Oscars' 90-year history, Cuaron's masterpiece has what it takes to buck the trend. – Patrick Ryan\n\n'A Star Is Born'\n\nThe Academy has previously nominated Bradley Cooper, but never given him a trophy. This year, it's time he be rewarded for his out-on-a-limb efforts to make a devastating romance that has original tunes, soul-baring acting and the national treasure who is Sam Elliott. Sure, Lady Gaga's red-carpet performance of what a nominated actor should say, namely her 100 people in a room spiel, is tired. But her acting as Ally is purely divine: from believably wooing a drunk rocker while in faux drag, to delivering a finale ballad that's a tearjerker even in repeated viewings.\n\nOn its surface, remaking A Star Is Born sounded like a bizarre notion. But Cooper's film is authentic, moving and far from the shallow now. – Carly Mallenbaum\n\n'Vice'\n\nDistill the politics from Vice, and writer/director Adam McKay's film remains a powerful portrait of former Vice President Dick Cheney (Christian Bale), and a love story with wife Lynne Cheney (Amy Adams). It's one of the year's best movies based solely on the respective, Oscar-worthy performances.\n\nBale deserves to win for transforming into Cheney in ways far beyond the weight gain and stunning prosthetic work. It's the way Bale's Cheney looks out from behind the glasses, breathes before talking, even stands. He puts life into a complicated, internal man whose rock-solid love of family, country and power trumps all.\n\nAdd the potent political dynamite, and McKay gleefully celebrates an undeniably strong point of view, and the gonzo entertainment/history approach proves worthy of writing and directing honors. An audaciously ambitious run for best picture is not only deserved, but fitting for Vice and these tumultuous political times. – Bryan Alexander
Rosina Bosco and her then-husband were like many couples she saw on Facebook.\n\nThey regularly posted photos on vacations, at concerts and of the activities they did together.\n\nHer social media feeds were always bombarded with images of friends getting together and having families. All you see on social media is weddings and babies, she said.\n\nSo when it came to updating her profiles after her divorce, it was incredibly painful.\n\nAll of a sudden I have to basically shed half of my world, said Bosco, 34. Five years of our relationship was up on Facebook. Like, what are you supposed to do?\n\nA friend came over one day to go through it. She would say a name, and I would say, 'yes,' and she would de-friend them, Bosco said. For photos, the task became too challenging, so she created a new profile.\n\nToday, Bosco is in increasingly rare company – divorced and millennial. In September, millennials made headlines for killing divorce when research found that the U.S. divorce rate dropped from 2008 to 2017 and that younger couples were driving the trend.\n\nMore:Add divorce to the list of things millennials are 'killing'\n\nEven so, those getting divorced face an array of changes – decoupling on social media, swiping through dating apps and utilizing online legal services – that comes with splitting in the digital era.\n\nSocial splits\n\nSocial media can be this knife that stabs into your wound and makes it worse, Bosco said.\n\nDealing with her social media presence was one of the hardest parts of moving on. She said she wished there was a 101-guide on being a divorcee online.\n\nNew York divorce attorney Bryan M. Goldstein, a millennial himself, said he's seen firsthand how social media impacts his clients.\n\nWhether it's deleting accounts or seeing posts from an ex, using the platforms can be challenging right after a split, said Goldstein, 35.\n\nDating apps also present new hurdles.\n\nTinder survey:Are millennials 'killing' relationships, too? Young people are embracing single life\n\nSwiping on the apps after a long-term relationship felt foreign, Bosco noted. I had to pretend I wasn't recently divorced, she said.\n\nHowever, apps can make it easier to get back out there once a person is ready, Goldstein said.\n\nNew lawyer's office\n\nNew digital tools can help with navigating the tricky and sometimes archaic process of legally splitting.\n\nStorey Jones, 55, founded dtour.life as a platform to better facilitate divorces in the digital age. One goal: remove some of the financial stress associated with divorce.\n\nThere's so much chaos and lack of clarity about what (divorce) is, it becomes a black vortex of fear, Jones said.\n\nDtour.life users can create a dashboard to navigate documents and financial records. They enter bank account information, log assets and debt, track expenses and manage other aspects of their divorce digitally.\n\nWhile Jones knows technology alone won't make divorce easier on couples emotionally, she hopes the product can make the process more straightforward.\n\nSurvey:32% of millennials would break up with their significant other for a $37,000 raise\n\nSo much of the 'hating' and animosity honestly comes from a fear of not knowing how they're going to be at the end of the day, Jones said.\n\nProcessing a split in a digital way is essential for millennials, Jones and divorce attorneys say. For one, legal bills shrink because attorneys spend less time sifting through paperwork, and clients can have a smarter hour with lawyers, Jones said.\n\nIt certainly makes my job easier, Goldstein said. Because millennial clients are digitally organized, using an online tool is natural.\n\nRather than making a phone call, a digital platform allows them to communicate when they want to, on their time frame, said Dallas-based divorce attorney Elizabeth Hunter. And it allows the lawyer the same thing.\n\nOn the flip side, millennials are also looking online to prepare for marriage. For example, writing up a prenuptial agreement.\n\nI don't have to go to an office and sit in a big leather chair and wait in the lobby. I can sit and talk with my (soon-to-be) spouse, pop open the app and say, 'Let's do this together,' said Dave Coffey of LegalShield.\n\nLegalShield connects clients with attorneys for a variety of legal services, and users can fill out questionnaires to start up prenuptial agreements and divorce proceedings.\n\nWant news from USA TODAY on WhatsApp?Click this link on your mobile device to get started\n\nDid 'millennials' really 'kill' divorce?\n\nThe millennial generation takes a lot of heat. They're accused of killing bras, top sheets and chain restaurants. They love eating avocado toast and taking selfies.\n\nLast year, divorce was added to the graveyard after University of Maryland sociology professor Philip Cohen found that since the 1990s, the prevalence of divorce for people under age 45 has leveled off, whereas it continues to rise for people over 45.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, millennials are those born between 1981 and 1996.\n\nAre you a Xennial?:How to tell if you're the microgeneration between Gen X and millennial\n\nBut Cohen, who doesn't like the term millennial, said many generalizations for that wide-ranging age group can be too broad. The category of millennials really doesn't make much sense.\n\nFor example, the Great Recession in the late 2000s divides millennials depending upon whether they had graduated college, Cohen noted. And the demographic makeup of the generation is much more diverse than past ones.\n\nAs a result, seemingly arbitrary characterizations of who a millennial is arise.\n\nIf you draw those lines by the categories, you can make a story that's not a real story, and you end up giving a character that is not justified, Cohen said.\n\nDivorced but equals\n\nFor young people who do marry, they often wait until they're further along in their careers and more highly educated.\n\nLegalShield has seen a seven-time increase in users' prenuptial agreements within the app in the past year, with millennials contributing to 40 percent of that growth, Coffey said.\n\nGoldstein has also seen more prenups in recent years as millennials enter marriage with more wealth. Why? Younger clients view their spouses as equals more so than past generations. That's tamed some of the stigma around them.\n\nThey don't look at their spouses the way our grandparents did, Goldstein said.\n\nStudy:Millennials strive for perfectionism more than past generations\n\nAs for divorce, even though it's rarer for millennials, it's also less wrought with stigma.\n\nIn one case, Hunter's client posted a photo on social media with their ex, smiling as they held finalized divorce papers.\n\n(Millennials) want to be different and better, Hunter said. If they end up going through a divorce, they don't approach each other the same way as prior generations.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller Twitter @RyanW_Miller\n\nDear fellow millennials:Why marrying at 22 is the best decision I ever made
A wave of Bible literacy bills emerging in state legislatures would allow more students in public high schools to study the Old and New Testaments.\n\nProposals from lawmakers in at least six states would require or encourage public schools to offer elective classes on the Bible's literary and historical significance. That's a more narrow focus than what's typically covered in courses on world religions.\n\nSome of the lawmakers – and leaders of Christian groups supporting the bills – say they want to restore traditional values in schools and give students a chance to study the religious text deeply.\n\nThe Bible is an integral part of our society and deserves a place in the classroom, said Republican state Rep. Aaron McWilliams of North Dakota, a co-sponsor of a bill that would require the state's public high schools to offer an elective on Bible studies.\n\nMore from this debate:U.S. culture 'less hospitable to people of faith,' Sessions says\n\nOpponents say the measures come perilously close to violating the constitutional line between church and state – and, in practice, might overstep it. They say the proposals are part of a coordinated effort by evangelical political groups pushing model legislation in several states.\n\nState legislators should not be fooled that these bills are anything more than part of a scheme to impose Christian beliefs on public schoolchildren, said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n\nDone right, the bills are legal\n\nThis year, Bible literacy bills have been introduced in Florida, Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAt least three Bible literacy bills were considered in 2018 – in Alabama, Iowa and West Virginia – but none passed, according to the ACLU. Tennessee passed a related but slightly different bill.\n\nThe year before, Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin signed into law a Bible studies bill. It created guidelines for public high schools to offer electives on the literature of the Bible and Hebrew Scriptures.\n\nMore about Kentucky's law:State ed board approves Bible literacy standards for public schools\n\nLaser said the Bible studies classes are likely to convey a religious message and preference. That would violate the First Amendment, which guarantees that the government won't act in a way that prefers one religion over another and that people can practice whatever religion they wish.\n\nIn short, there's a line in public schools between teaching about a religion and proselytizing. Lawmakers bringing the proposals say the classes can be taught in a way that doesn't overstep that line.\n\nConservative Christian groups involved\n\nThe proposals are getting more attention because they're linked to a common source: an initiative called Project Blitz coordinated by conservative Christian political groups.\n\nThose groups include the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation, which aims to protect religious liberties; the National Legal Foundation, a Christian public-interest law firm; and the nonprofit WallBuilders, which emphasizes the moral, religious and constitutional foundation upon which America was built, according to its website. WallBuilders' name is a biblical reference to grass-roots work and does not refer to the debate over the border wall between the USA and Mexico.\n\nCritics say the groups are trying to reshape America by cementing pro-Christian messages in public schools.\n\nThey have put out a more than 100-page playbook that lays out very plainly their strategy into tiers of bills that they want to pass, and the last tier is promoting a particular religious point of view for legislation, said Amanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, which advocates for keeping government out of matters pertaining to faith.\n\nThe ACLU provided a copy of the 2018 version of the playbook, called the Report and Analysis on Religious Freedom Measures Affecting Prayer and Faith in America. Model legislation and talking points within it advocate for preserving the country's Judeo-Christian heritage and enshrining conservative values in public policy. For instance, the groups say marriage and child adoption should be practiced only by heterosexual, married couples.\n\nAs for the Bible literacy proposals, Tyler of the Baptist Joint Committee said that lawmakers who have busy legislative calendars may sign on to bills that look innocuous but may further a troubling agenda.\n\nAnything that might send a message to our children that you have to be a Christian to be a full American is extremely problematic, she said.\n\nDavid Barton, a Christian political activist and the founder of WallBuilders, said that's a mischaracterization of the bills.\n\nBible literacy is a good thing to have, he said. For me, the issue is that many schools don't (offer Bible studies courses) because they think they can't legally. We are saying, 'Well, yes, you can.' \n\nRequests for comment to the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation were not returned.\n\n'In God We Trust' legislation\n\nThe same coordinated initiative helped push bills in 12 states last year that called for public schools to post the national motto, In God We Trust, ACLU leaders said.\n\nSix states passed those bills into law. This year, similar bills have been introduced in Alaska, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, New York and South Carolina, according to the ACLU.\n\nThe Indiana bill from state Sen. Dennis Kruse, R-Auburn, calls for the national motto to be posted in public schools and for high schools to add a biblical studies component to world religion classes.\n\nKruse said he was not aware of Project Blitz and didn't talk to lawmakers in other states before introducing his proposal.\n\nI think it's good to remind people of our national motto and that God is who we really place our trust in, Kruse said. This is how we came about as a country.\n\nEducation coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Control of Larry King's estate is pitting his family members against each other in court.\n\nShawn King, wife of the late, legendary talk-show host, sought to block efforts by his son, Larry King Jr., to administer an estate valued at $2 million, according to documents filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court.\n\nShe says Larry King, her husband of 22 years, nominated her to be executor of his estate in a 2015 will and she disputes an October 2019 handwritten will that the younger King contends takes precedence.\n\nIn the barely legible handwritten will, King, who died at 87 on Jan. 23, splits his estate equally between his five children. Shawn King, who is not named in that will, has petitioned to be appointed executor.\n\n'We are heartbroken':Larry King, CNN talk show legend, dies at 87 after being hospitalized with COVID-19\n\nThe handwritten will, signed by Larry King and witnessed by two others and included in Larry King Jr.'s Feb. 10 filing, says: This is my Last Will & Testament. It should replace all previous writings(.) In the event of my death, any day after the above date I want 100% of my funds to be divided equally among my children Andy, Chaia, Lary Jr, Chance & Cannon. Larry King (Andy and Chaia both died in 2020.)\n\nChance and Cannon are King's two children with Shawn King.\n\nKing's widow also contends in her objection that Larry King Jr. has a conflict of interest because he is indebted to the estate for $266,261 paid to him by his father from a secret account that Shawn King says she only learned of recently.\n\n'TV is less interesting without you': Barbra Streisand, Oprah, more react to Larry King death\n\nIn his petition, Larry King Jr. says he has priority over Shawn King, because she and his father were involved in a divorce proceeding and they did not live together at the time of his death.\n\nShawn King acknowledges a divorce proceeding had been pending since August 2019, but her objection states that, Larry was not pushing the divorce and was generally nonresponsive and refused to participate in the divorce proceeding. He gave no indication that he actually wanted to pursue divorce (other than the initial filing of the Petition for Dissolution). After the (divorce) filing, the parties had gone to counseling, were still speaking, and reconciliation remained possible until Larry's health conditions made that impractical.\n\nHer objection also argues she had a much closer relationship with the longtime CNN talk host and his career and businesses, putting her in a better position to oversee the estate because she has the most knowledge of Larry's businesses, assets and wishes.\n\nIn contrast, Shawn King's filing says her husband didn't know of Larry King Jr. until the son, who court documents note lives in Florida, was well into his thirties. He has never been involved in Larry's career or business, and it would be highly inappropriate to place him in a position of representing Larry's estate.\n\nLarry King Jr., 59, is King's oldest child, from his marriage to Annette Kaye.\n\nIn another part of her objection, Shawn King says the handwritten will would violate two post-nuptial agreements she and her husband made that that limited his ability to make testamentary gifts to his children.\n\nShe also questions her husband's capacity to change his will in 2019.\n\nDuring the last few years of his life, Larry was highly susceptible to outside influences and at the time he purportedly executed the (handwritten will) was of questionable mental capacity, having recently suffered a stroke and about to undergo a medical procedure (and possibly already under the influence of pre-operative medication), the court papers say.\n\nIn a statement, Larry King Jr.'s lawyers said Shawn King's legal objection contained unsupported allegations and innuendo and that they will pursue efforts to have the court admit to probate the valid October 17, 2019 will, entirely drafted and written in Larry King's hand, which is the true and final statement of Larry's intent to fully benefit his children equally.\n\nAttorneys for Shawn King have not responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nCourt hearings have been set for Feb. 24 and March 25.
Woman forced to marry rapist inspires child marriage ban in Florida\n\nA woman in Florida who was forced to marry her rapist when she was 11-years-old has helped push forward a bill to ban child marriage in the state.
There's beauty in the bromance on screen of On the Count of Three, which debuted Friday night at the virtual Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe dramedy, which also serves as the directorial debut of stand-up comedian Jerrod Carmichael, spends a tumultuous day with two lifelong friends who have found themselves mired in depression and can't visualize a way out.\n\nVal (Carmichael) hatches a plan and springs his best friend Kevin (Christopher Abbott) from the mental institution where he's been convalescing – against his will – since his last suicide attempt. The two hatch a suicide pact, but not before spending one last day tying up loose ends, exacting revenge on foes and joyriding on dirt bikes.\n\nMore:All the best movies we saw at Sundance Film Festival, ranked (including 'John and the Hole')\n\nThough dry, comedic moments pepper the story (the anti-gun Kevin mutters about lack of coherent weapons legislation before holding up a convenience store), the film itself is a study in the feeling of hopelessness that often accompanies depression. What led Carmichael to launch his film directing career with more serious fare, rather than a comedy in line with his more broad NBC television series, The Carmichael Show?\n\nCarmichael said while he was on track to keep doing such fare, the weight of On the Count of Three appealed to him.\n\nI've always been infatuated with getting more complicated thoughts to broader audiences, said the star in a Sundance Q&A that followed the film's debut. It's the reason 'The Carmichael Show' was technically a family sitcom that I used to kind of Trojan Horse these topics we found really interesting. So it just feels natural. It feels right ... And with the film, it just felt like a natural progression of like, truth.\n\nIn On the Count of Three, the director reunites with Carmichael Show star Tiffany Haddish, who has a small role playing Val's estranged girlfriend. Carmichael praised Haddish for the truthful way she played the character. What comedians can do oftentimes is relay reality in a way that sounds familiar, said Carmichael, adding that he hopes to see Haddish in more dramatic roles.\n\nDid the star, who also directs Henry Winkler in the film as Kevin's former psychologist, get overly critical while directing himself?\n\nOh, Jesus, yeah. Of course, said Carmichael, who kept a trusted group close during the process. I have an honest group of people around me who will criticize – very brutally honest criticisms and thoughts. It's very constructive and I appreciate that, he chuckled.\n\n'Right now, I'm terrific':Rita Moreno opens up about her controlling marriage, trailblazing career and Marlon Brando\n\nQuestions arose in the Q&A on if Carmichael worried about glorifying suicide while making the film.\n\nThe actor/director said he considers mental health incredibly important. The story itself is not an easy place to go to, he said, but as a director it's my job to see this story through and tell the story completely.\n\nOn the Count of Three is currently for sale at the film festival.
Staton McGowin went house hunting seven years ago but couldn't afford the monthly mortgage payments on his $18-an-hour construction worker salary.\n\nNow 29 and an electrical engineer, McGowin's pay has more than doubled, allowing the Greenville, Texas, resident to easily purchase a $223,000 newly built starter home, which he and his girlfriend, Caitlin Nance, moved into late last month.\n\nAltura Homes sold McGowin the three-bedroom, one-story home after ramping up construction of entry-level houses last year. Units costing less than $300,000 made up about 50% of the company's production in 2019, up from 20% to 30% the previous six years.\n\nIn the last 12 months, we have made an effort to try to build more affordable homes, Altura CEO Justin Webb says. We just know there are buyers out there.\n\nThe starter home, an endangered species since the housing recovery began eight years ago, is making a comeback. Builders are putting up more small, low-priced homes as demand from millennials picks up and contractors figure out how to turn a profit from the units, even with persistently high construction costs.\n\nBuilders are finally pushing to capture first-time buyers, says economist Yelena Maleyev of Grant Thornton.\n\nThe pickup is also helping address a nationwide shortage of affordable housing for low- to middle-income Americans of all age groups, says Stephen Kim, a senior housing analyst at Evercore ISI.\n\nStore closings:Macy's is reportedly closing more than two dozen stores. Is your location on the list?\n\nIn November, single-family homes and townhouses priced at $200,000 to $299,000 comprised about 34% of all new home sales through the first 11 months of last year, up from 30% in 2017 and 2018, U.S. Census Bureau figures show. The median price of a new home in the third quarter was $311,000, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).\n\nBut since prices keep climbing and vary widely depending on the market, house size trends are even more telling. From 2015 to 2018, the share of new houses under 2,400 square feet rose to 51% from 47%, according to an NAHB analysis of Census Bureau data.\n\nThere's some movement in the right direction, says NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. We think it's a fairly clear signal.\n\nSmall new homes nearly vanished\n\nWhen the housing recovery began in 2012 following the late 2000s crash, the trend was decidedly in the other direction. The share of new homes with less than 2,400 square feet was tumbling after reaching 60% in 2009. Many of the first-time buyers who drove sales during the housing bubble left the market after their risky subprime mortgages imploded and they lost their homes to foreclosure.\n\nMeanwhile, the Great Recession of 2007-09 set back the early careers of the millennials who were supposed to comprise a new crop of first-time buyers, leading many to delay marriage and children. That, combined with massive student loan debt, prompted many young adults to live with relatives, or to rent, and put off home purchases.\n\nBanks, meanwhile, tightened lending standards after the housing meltdown, making it harder to qualify for a mortgage even for millennials who wanted to buy.\n\nAt the same time, construction costs soared as housing emerged from the depths. Land prices leaped because of a shortage of developed lots. Labor expenses shot up amid construction worker shortages after laid-off employees left the industry. And material costs surged, most recently because of Trump Administration tariffs on imports such as Canadian lumber.\n\nDoes claiming benefits early make sense?:Why claiming Social Security early could be more popular than ever this decade\n\nHomebuilders also faced stringent local regulations that limited construction of smaller homes and townhouses.\n\nBuilders, in turn, overwhelmingly put up larger homes priced above $400,000 that could earn a healthy profit despite the higher costs and sold them to higher-income buyers who were trading up or moving into the luxury market.\n\nIt became increasingly difficult to build entry-level homes, says Jerry Konter, president of Konter Quality Homes in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nThe tide is turning\n\nBut many older millennials in their early to mid-30s have better-paying jobs and savings for down payments. They're finally getting married and having kids. And they're moving to the suburbs from the urban cores they favored in their 20s, says Brad Hunter, managing director of RCLCO, a real estate consulting firm.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2019, 37.5% of millennials owned homes, up from 36.8% a year earlier and the largest share since 2011. Millennials also made up the biggest portion of all homebuyers in 2018, at 37%, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nIt's just the peace of mind knowing I'm investing in something that can benefit me in the future instead of burning money on rent, says McGowin, the freshly minted Greenville, Texas, homeowner. While his higher salary allowed him to qualify for a bigger mortgage, he also whittled down his student loan debt to about $3,500 from $24,000 when he first shopped for a home.\n\nBuilders, meanwhile, have figured out ways to squeeze out an industry average 20% profit margin on starter homes despite the higher costs. Their chief strategy: provide just a handful of choices for floor plans and features such as cabinets, countertops, and carpeting. That allows them to order materials in bulk so they can get discounts and minimize changes that delay construction and add costs, Kim says.\n\nBuilders have been able to crack the code, he says.\n\nNational homebuilder D.R. Horton led the effort, launching its Express Homes division in 2014 to target first-time homebuyers, Hunter says. The brand offers fewer floor plans and little to no options, company vice president Jessica Hansen said in an email. It also has lower material costs because it's such a large buyer. And it snapped up lots of land before prices skyrocketed.\n\nNoting that its flagship D.R. Horton brand also has been putting up more entry-level homes, Hansen says 68% of the houses it closed in fiscal 2019 were priced at less than $300,000.\n\nThe other national builders have followed that path the past couple of years. Besides offering fewer floor plans, Pulte Group typically builds starter homes a little further from the city center where land is less expensive, says company Vice President Jim Zeumer.\n\nIn its fourth-quarter earnings report Wednesday, Lennar said it produced 16% more homes compared to a year ago but its average sales price fell 7%. Entry-level homes make up about 40% of its business, the company recently said.\n\nWhile starter homes are cheaper, builders can put them up more quickly and in greater numbers, helping offset lower per-unit profits, Kim says. It takes as little as three months to complete a starter house, he says, compared with six months or longer for pricier units.\n\nPrices have risen\n\nOne caveat: With entry-level homes still in short supply, their average price has climbed from about $200,000 to nearly $300,000 the past several years, Hunter says. Even existing starter homes are appreciating at nearly twice the rate of expensive houses, according to real estate research firm Trulia. That could shut out some first-time buyers but it bolsters the business case for affordable homes.\n\nFor example, luxury home builder Toll Brothers, with an average sale price close to $900,000, has waded into starter homes but with a higher price range of $300,000 to $500,000, says company Senior Vice President Fred Cooper.\n\nNoting that many millennials waited until their mid-30s to buy, he says, The choices of first-time homebuyers may not be traditional…Instead, they're looking for more features and a more upscale design.\n\nRegulations are also slowly easing in some areas, Dietz says. Places like Minneapolis and Oregon are allowing higher housing densities.\n\nKonter, the Savannah builder, notes the Trump administration is relaxing a 2015 rule that restricted development even on small wetlands areas. That – along with strategies such as smaller bedroom doors that don't swing out as much to save space -- should help Konter build about 10 starter homes this year and 35 in 2021, he says.\n\nWebb, the Texas builder, developed the community where McGowin lives after obtaining a zoning change that let him construct more houses on smaller lots.\n\nThe market is fixing itself, he says.
Two months after her wedding to Nick Jonas, Priyanka Chopra is still getting used to hearing her new last name.\n\nEvery time someone says that, my face goes a little like, 'Oh, that happened,'  the actress revealed to Tonight host Jimmy Fallon after he introduced her as Priyanka Chopra Jonas on Tuesday.\n\nIt's a big deal! I didn't realize it was that much of a big deal until I did it, she said, explaining that keeping her previous surname was never in the cards.\n\nI always wanted to add his last name to mine because I feel like we're becoming family, she told Fallon. I'm a little traditional and old-school like that.\n\nEven so, Chopra Jonas said, I don't take away my identity. He gets added to who I am.\n\nDone deal: Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas get marriedwith Hindu wedding in India\n\nFallon couldn't resist from showing a few photos from the couple's three-day wedding extravaganza, which went down in India on Dec. 1.\n\nFallon and the actress agreed that her new husband looks like a prince in the picture from their Hindu ceremony.\n\nHe really rocked that turban, she laughed. It's hard to rock a turban with a feather!\n\nSurprisingly, the Bollywood-bred actress revealed she hadn't initially planned to marry in India.\n\nShe said that after the couple rejected numerous remote island locations due to logistical complications, Nick just said, 'Why aren't we doing this in India? Shouldn't I be taking my bride from her home?' \n\nOnce she committed to the idea, they went full-on Indian wedding, including holding a sangeet ceremony, which she described as a rehearsal dinner but not boring.\n\nShe explained, It's like a song-and-dance celebration that the families put on for the bride and groom. So there's Team Bride and Team Groom.\n\nAll the arrangements are kept secret, she said, because neither side can know what the other has planned. It's a competition and because we're really extra, we had a giant trophy and it looked like Coachella.\n\nFallon couldn't disagree. That's a rager, he declared, looking at the sangeet photo.\n\nChopra Jonas revealed that husband Nick was very competitive. He literally came out of a cake.\n\nIn fact, she was shocked at how far the Jonas clan went. They brought it in such a big way.
The Mentalist star Simon Baker and wife Rebecca Rigg are calling it quits.\n\nBaker, 51, and Rigg, 53, have separated after 29 years together, Baker's representative Susan Patricola confirmed to USA TODAY Friday.\n\nThe pair quietly split last April.\n\nWe remain close friends and our three children will always be the most important focus of our lives, Baker and Rigg said in a joint statement to USA TODAY Friday.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in October 1998 and share three children together: daughter Stella, 27, and sons Claude, 22, and Harry, 19.\n\nThe Australian actor is best known for playing psychic Patrick Jane on CBS' The Mentalist, which ended in 2015 after seven seasons.\n\n'I am crushed': 'Bachelorette' star Clare Crawley breaks silence on Dale Moss split\n\nIn 2016, Baker told Australian website Body + Soul that he was looking forward to more time with his wife and children, whom he described as his pride and joy, following the show.\n\nIt will feel so good to be able to spend more time at home, he told the Australian outlet. More than anything I want to dedicate my time to my family.\n\nDuring the interview, Baker called Rigg the greatest woman any man could ever hope to make a life with, adding that marrying her was the best decision I ever made.\n\n'Love is a funny thing':'Bachelor' Peter Weber announces split from Kelley Flanagan on New Year's Eve
Just how eager you are to file your 2019 tax return, which the IRS begins accepting on Jan. 27 — depends on a lot of things.\n\nDid you get socked with a bigger tax bill than usual last year after the sweeping changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? Did you suddenly owe money when you always got a refund?\n\nOr do you feel more confident after you got last year's taxes done under the new rules?\n\nEither way, you might as well get an early start long before that April 15 tax deadline.\n\nMany people, of course, file early in the season because they're banking on a four-figure tax refund — including payouts from the Earned Income Tax Credit — to cover the bills.\n\nThe average federal income tax refund was $2,869 in 2019 based on returns filed through Dec. 27, 2019. That's down slightly from an average of $2,910 in 2018.\n\nRoughly 72% of the nearly 156 million tax returns filed through late December generated a tax refund, according to the latest IRS filing season statistics.\n\nFICO scores:The 'most important numbers in your financial life,' are about to change\n\nBed Bath & Beyond 20% coupon:What shoppers need to know about the discount\n\nHere's what you need to consider whether you're filing your tax return in late January — or mid April:\n\nDo you itemize or take the standard deduction?\n\nMany people imagine that they've got a long list of expenses that they can take as itemized deductions on 2019 tax returns.\n\nAnd you might be dragging your feet as you try digging up receipts. Plenty of people can forget about setting them aside during the year.\n\nThe reality is that the standard deduction — which went up as part of Trump's tax reform that was enacted in December 2017 — is fairly tough to beat, and the odds have gone up that many tax filers simply will take the standard deduction.\n\nRoughly 10% of tax filers likely ended up claiming itemizing deductions — such as interest paid on their mortgages — on their 2018 tax returns. That's down from roughly 30% in previous years, thanks to the significant changes in tax rules that initially went into effect on the 2018 tax returns we filed last year. Based on the latest IRS data, 14.6 million taxpayers itemized in 2019 compared with 42.1 million itemized returns in 2018.\n\nThe percentage is expected to be similar for 2019 returns.\n\nWhat is your standard deduction? You're not going to itemize unless the value of all your deductions exceeds the standard deduction — now $12,200 for single filers, up from $12,000 for 2018.\n\nA married couple filing jointly, for example, would have a standard deduction of $24,400 on a 2019 return — an extra $400 from the 2018 return.\n\nFor heads of households, the standard deduction is $18,350 for a 2019 return — up by $350 from the 2018 return.\n\nThat letter from the IRS could be fake:Watch out for this tax scam and others in 2020\n\nWant to file your 2019 tax return for free?:New IRS changes make it easier\n\nThere is also an additional standard deduction for taxpayers who were born before Jan. 2, 1955 — or age 65 and older — or blind.\n\nIf you are 65 or older, the added deduction is $1,650 for someone who is single or head of household; and $1,300 for a married taxpayer. If both spouses are 65 or older, for example, you may increase your standard deduction by $2,600.\n\nIf legally blind, the added deductions again range from $1,300 to $2,600 and would be in addition to any extra amount if you also happened to be age 65 or older.\n\nWhat might you itemize? Homeowners may still want to itemize mortgage interest, property taxes and interest on a home equity loan if the loan proceeds were used to acquire or improve the property.\n\nOne major challenge: If you itemize, you now can only deduct up to $10,000 (up to $5,000 if married filing separately) for state and local real estate taxes, personal property taxes and income taxes.\n\nThe $10,000 cap — which is not indexed for inflation — will influence how many taxpayers may itemize in the future, depending on their other deductions.\n\nCan you still deduct mortgage interest? Yes — if you don't take the standard deduction. When it comes to mortgage interest, a married couple filing a joint return can deduct mortgage interest on the first $1 million of debt — if the mortgage was closed before Dec. 16, 2017.\n\nIf the mortgage was closed after that date, a married couple filing a joint return could deduct interest on the first $750,000 of mortgage debt. The amounts are the same for singles but halved for married couples filing separate returns.\n\nDid states overcome that SALT cap?\n\nShort answer: No.\n\nSure, some states — including New Jersey and Connecticut — have tried to engineer workarounds to ease the pain for taxpayers who face higher federal tax bills because of the new $10,000 federal limit on individual taxpayer deductions for state and local taxes, known as the SALT cap.\n\nBut taxpayers aren't in the clear, as much legal haggling has surrounded such efforts. The IRS put a stop to one workaround, which was attempted in New York and elsewhere, that would have reclassified tax payments as charitable contributions since charitable donations remain fully tax deductible.\n\nLately, states have been focusing on a potential strategy for re-engineering their small business taxes to workaround some issues brought up by the $10,000 SALT limit.\n\nStates do have discretion on how they set up their own tax system, said Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\nThe U.S. House also voted for a two-year elimination of the SALT cap late in 2019 but the odds remain against the effort getting any traction in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nWhile taxpayers remain angry in many states, it's unlikely a quick resolution will be reached.\n\nAnd individuals have to realize that you can't really work around it on the 2019 tax returns, Sammartino said.\n\nThe $10,000 limit applies to both married and single homeowners. So there is a marriage penalty because typically a limit would be twice as high for a married couple, Sammartino said.\n\nThe $10,000 limit, as with most individual income tax provisions in the Trump tax overall, will expire after 2025. It is unclear if the measure would be extended or new rules would be enacted by Congress.\n\nWhile deducting state and local income taxes is a tax break that certainly can help the wealthy, some policy experts maintain that state and local taxes help communities spend more on services to help low- and middle-income households.\n\nRefund delays, aging tech and confusing letters:Here are the top IRS challenges\n\nFiling for free:IRS bars TurboTax, H&R Block from hiding free tax filing option from Google search results\n\nThese tax breaks are gone, and other changes\n\nSeveral changes took place beginning on the 2018 tax returns. But the new rules remain in place on 2019 returns, too.\n\nJob search expenses: You can no longer deduct expenses related to finding a new job.\n\nTax preparation fees: You can't write off any costs from getting help with your taxes from 2018 through 2025 under the new tax law changes. There's one exclusion: Self-employed workers can still deduct these services as a business expense.\n\nMoving expense deductions: Gone in 2018 and 2019. But there remains an exception for active-duty military for a move relating to military orders to a permanent location. In that case, the military can deduct moving expenses, such as travel and lodging, transportation of belongings and shipping cars and pets.\n\nMoving expense reimbursements: Andy Phillips, director of H&R Block's Tax Institute, said workers need to understand that the new tax rules require employers to include all moving expenses in the employee's wages, which are subject to income and employment taxes.\n\nCasualty losses: Personal casualty and theft losses are generally no longer deductible, Phillips said. But losses relating to what IRS refers to as a presidentially declared disaster area would still be allowed as a deduction.\n\nEmployee business expenses: Here's one that caught many by surprise on 2018 returns. Employees are no longer permitted to deduct unreimbursed expenses that they incur for work. If you're in this situation, Phillips said, you may want to speak with your employer about possibly creating an accountable reimbursement plan.\n\nGot a job in the gig economy? The IRS kicked off a new Gig Economy Tax Center at www.irs.gov to offer tips and resources on questions relating to filing requirements, deductible business expenses and special rules for reporting vacation home rentals.\n\nDo you have health insurance? You no longer need to offer proof that you had health insurance in 2019 or had a reason to be exempt.\n\nNo box exists any more relating to health care on the front of the 1040. And you won't have to pay any penalty or claim any exemption if you did not have health insurance in 2019.\n\nThese key tax breaks are back and could boost your refund\n\nLast year, some taxpayers dragged their feet when it came to filing their 2018 tax returns because they weren't sure if Congress would extend some specialized tax breaks that expired at the end of 2017.\n\nWhy file a return in February or March if you'd soon need to amend it?\n\nWell, Congress didn't move quickly enough to meet the April 15 tax deadline but those key tax breaks were resurrected in a tax law signed by President Donald Trump in December 2019. The so-called extenders package would cover tax years for 2018, 2019, and 2020.\n\nAs a result, taxpayers who qualified for those breaks in 2018 may now want to consider whether they want to amend their returns, according to Susan Allen, senior manager for tax practice and ethics for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.\n\nSome folks could see a benefit in amending a 2018 return, she said.\n\nBut you'd have to analyze whether the cost of amending that return exceeds how much money you'd save.\n\nThe zombie tax breaks are worth noting — and taking into account on 2019 returns and 2020 returns — include:\n\nCollege tuition and fees. The above-the-line deduction of up to $4,000 for qualified college tuition and fees would reduce your income that's subject to tax, and you don't need to itemize to get this tax break. Income limits apply.\n\nBut Mark Steber, chief tax officer for Jackson Hewitt, notes that the deduction relating to college bills cannot be claimed if you've taken the American Opportunity or Lifetime Learning Credits.\n\nAnd income limits will apply for the resurrected deduction. You could deduct up to $4,000 in qualified expenses if your modified adjusted gross income is up to $65,000, or up to $130,000 if you're married and filing a joint return.\n\nYou can deduct up to $2,000 in expenses if you fall in the $65,001 and $80,000 range if single and the $130,001 and $160,000 range if married and filing a joint return.\n\nMortgage debt forgiveness. If you faced foreclosure and had up to $2 million in mortgage debt forgiven by a lender, you wouldn't be required to report that forgiven debt as income.\n\nThe PMI tax deduction. Homeowners who made a small downpayment may be required to pay private mortgage insurance, known as PMI. You would need to itemize to take this tax break, so if you take the new higher standard deduction now, the return of this tax break would not help.\n\nMedical expenses. For some families with big medical bills, here's a tax break that you don't want to ignore. Qualified medical and dental expenses will remain deductible on 2018 through 2020 tax returns. But, remember, you must pay attention to the threshold for taking such a deduction. You can deduct unreimbursed medical expenses to the extent that they exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income.\n\nSECURE Act:Some retirees feeling less secure about tax rule changes\n\n5 things to know:The SECURE Act could help boost your retirement savings\n\nAlimony deduction disappears\n\nFor recently divorced Americans, alimony payments are no longer tax deductible by the payer. They are also not considered or included as taxable income by the parent receiving support, which ends a decades-long practice.\n\nThe change affects divorce agreements signed after Dec. 31, 2018. Those who divorced in 2019 can't write off alimony payments on their returns anymore.\n\nThe move, however, is beneficial to alimony recipients in most cases, experts say. That's because they are no longer required to claim alimony as income and won't pay tax on it.\n\nThis is a way for the IRS to get rid of the deduction so that they're always collecting a tax on alimony, says Christina Taylor, head of operations at Credit Karma Tax. This is going to have a bigger impact on a person paying alimony.\n\nIt could also affect social programs that alimony recipients qualify for since their income will appear lower than it actually is. If they're not required to report alimony income for health care, their income will be lower and they could potentially get a better subsidy, Taylor says.\n\nThere's a new form for seniors\n\nThe two-page form, known as 1040-SR, uses a bigger font than the standard 1040 form and is better at contrasting colors. Taxpayers who turned 65 on or before Jan. 1, 2020, can use the new form for the 2019 filing year.\n\nThis could make filing easier for those who don't file electronically, experts say.\n\nIt's similar to the 1040-EZ, a form the IRS discontinued and was replaced with the redesigned 1040 form. It also allows you to report Social Security benefits and distributions from qualified retirement plans or annuities.\n\nStill, the number of Americans filing by paper is small, according to Kathy Pickering, chief tax officer at H&R Block.\n\nPeople probably aren't going to the library to fill out paper forms, Pickering says. Our statistics say that 97% of taxpayers use some kind of filing assistance, either through tax software or going to a professional.\n\nTax cuts are set to expire after 2025\n\nThe windfall from the tax cuts in recent years has helped boost corporate profits and put money in consumers' pockets. But concerns have grown on how Americans will be affected when those tax cuts expire.\n\nCorporate rate cuts are permanent following the tax overhaul. All individual tax cuts, however, are set to end after 2025. That means most Americans will end up with a tax increase, experts caution, unless some or all provisions are extended.\n\nBy 2027, about 35 million households with incomes below $200,000 would face tax increases, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Roughly 9.5 million of them could see increases of more than $500 apiece, the study showed.\n\nAmericans can expect higher taxes in the future, says Ric Edelman, co-founder of financial advisory firm Edelman Financial Engines. It will be a dominant issue in the 2024 campaign, and the answer will be determined by who's president when the tax cuts expire.
Chris Pratt is defending his church after star Ellen Page called it infamously anti-LGBTQ.\n\nIt has recently been suggested that I belong to a church which 'hates a certain group of people' and is 'infamously anti –LGBTQ.' Nothing could be further from the truth, the Guardians of the Galaxy star wrote on his Instagram Story Monday. I go to a church that opens their doors to absolutely everyone.\n\nPratt is reportedly a regular at Los Angeles' Zoe Church, attending with fiancee Katherine Schwarzenegger. The church's pastor, Chad Veach, formerly preached at Hillsong, another celeb-friendly evangelical church with two dozen locations that reportedly counts Justin and Hailey Bieber among its flock in addition to Kendall and Kylie Jenner.\n\nAfter Pratt discussed his faith with Late Show host Stephen Colbert last week, Page, who came out as a lesbian in 2014, asked why media outlets who wrote about the interview didn't mention the church's views onLGBTQ issues.\n\nHis church is infamously anti lgbtq so maybe address that too? the X-Men actress tweeted Friday.\n\nZoe Church's website does not clearly state its views on homosexuality, describing itself as a place where our doors are open to people of all backgrounds – regardless of where they are at in their journeys – and we hope all feel welcomed, comfortable and loved. It also promises engaging, powerful worship and Biblical truth broken down in practical and relevant ways.\n\nHowever, Zoe is associated with Hillsong, which does make its views on gay issues clear.\n\nIn a 2015 essay, Brian Houston, a senior pastor at Hillsong, wrote that his church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles. Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.\n\nHe continued, The western world is seemingly moving quickly toward gay marriage being universally legalized, so how does that affect us as a church, and how does it affect the various individual members of Hillsong Church? I believe we can quite comfortably continue to function within that environment, presuming we are not forced through legislation to compromise our own convictions.\n\nPage addressed Pratt's affiliation with the church in a subsequent tweet, writing, If you are a famous actor and you belong to an organization that hates a certain group of people, don't be surprised if someone simply wonders why it's not addressed. Being anti LGBTQ is wrong, there aren't two sides. The damage it causes is severe. Full stop.\n\nThe following day, she wrote, If lgbtq+ people are expressing their pain, their trauma, their experiences...maybe just try and listen? Open your heart, stop being defensive and have compassion. It's a beautiful and life changing feeling, empathy.\n\nOn Monday Pratt said his church was not judgmental, citing their support over his divorce from ex Anna Faris.\n\nDespite what the Bible says about divorce my church community was there for me every step of the way, never judging, just gracefully accompanying me on my walk, he wrote. They helped me tremendously offering love and support. It is what I have seen them do for others on countless occasions regardless of sexual orientation, race or gender.\n\nAdditionally, Pratt said, My faith is important to me but no church defines me or my life and I am not spokesman for any church or any group of people. My values define who I am. We need less hate in this world, not more. I am a man who believes that everyone is entitled to love who they want free from the judgment of their fellow man.\n\nIn large type, the Guardians star added: Jesus said, 'I give you a new command, love one another.' This is what guides me in my life. He is a God of Love, Acceptance and Forgiveness. Hate has no place in my or this world.\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell
Maureen Groppe\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNow that the Internet has had its say on Vice President Pence's rules for avoiding temptation as a married man, the president has weighed in.\n\nBefore signing executive orders on trade Friday, President Trump made a few remarks before slapping Pence on the back.\n\nI tell you one thing, the thrice-married Trump said of Pence, he has one hell of a good marriage going.\n\nA recent Washington Post profile of Karen Pence brought up the fact that when Pence was in Congress, he told The Hill newspaper that he never eats alone with a woman other than his wife and wouldn't attend events featuring alcohol unless she was there.\n\nThe practice is common among many evangelicals and is called The Billy Graham Rule.\n\nCritics called it sexist and old-fashioned, while some on the right said liberals' outrage showed how out of touch they are with family values.\n\nComedians, including The Late Show's Stephen Colbert, got in some digs.\n\nBut liberal Slate came to Pence's defense.
LOS ANGELES – On the set of NBC's Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the cast goes through a precisely choreographed sequence of high-fives, including the snake charmer, a Pete Townsend guitar strum and a no-look, double-backhand fist explosion.\n\nA superior officer, Ray Holt (Andre Braugher), has devised a special punishment for Detective Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg), the tardy squad member left out of the chorus line.\n\nIt was absolute hell, the proper Holt tells Peralta. But it will be worse for you.\n\nIt is delicious torture for the high-five aficionado, but metaphorically, it seems an appropriate celebration for Brooklyn, a critically acclaimed but low-rated cop comedy canceled by Fox last May but resurrected by NBC, which produces the series, for a sixth season a day later. The series returns Thursday (9 EST/PST).\n\nMore:Don't worry, 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' is just as wonderful on NBC\n\nMore:How 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' fan Lin-Manuel Miranda freaked out star Melissa Fumero\n\nSamberg says the public outcry that followed the brief cancellation – featuring the likes of superfans Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mark Hamill and Guillermo del Toro – was a surprise.\n\nThe intensity of their appreciation caught us off guard a little bit and was maybe something that had been simmering beneath the surface. The show getting canceled gave everyone a focus point to rally around, says Samberg, sitting in the squad's break room, a well-worn sanctuary adorned by a beaten-up bumper-pool table, a framed list of New York labor laws and ancient coffee and candy machines.\n\nBrooklyn writers were prepared for the possibility that the Season 5 closer, in which Jake marries his girlfriend and very competitive colleague, Sgt. Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), might be the series finale, executive producer Dan Goor says.\n\nWe approached every other season by making the cliffhanger as dramatic as possible, he says. But May's finale was designed more as a celebration, and to make the cliffhanger not so dire or stressful that cancellation would have upset loyal fans. (The lingering mystery, to be resolved in Thursday's opener, is whether Captain Holt gets promoted to police commissioner.)\n\nMore:Rescues prove TV cancellations are reversible: Is 'Designated Survivor' next?\n\nNBC's reprieve, for at least one 18-episode season, allows Brooklyn to explore the couple's marriage, along with developments in the lives and careers of Holt, Sgt. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews) and detectives Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) and Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio). Holt's saucy civilian assistant, Gina Linetti, gets an elaborate two-part sendoff later this month as Chelsea Peretti departs. (She might return as a guest star.)\n\nBrooklyn's near-death experience revealed (and likely stoked) a deep passion for the show.\n\nThe brief cancellation was incredibly dramatic and stressful and also wonderful and heartwarming, because we had the Tom-Sawyer-at-his-own-funeral aspect where we got to hear how much people in the world liked the show, Goor says.\n\nCast and producers are especially happy to land at NBC, which has given the series a big promotional push that includes a Die Hard-style trailer playing off Jake's fascination with the movie.\n\nMore:NBC rescues 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' one day after Fox canceled it\n\nNBC has a long institutional DNA with comedy, Braugher says. I feel like we're in good hands. They've got confidence in the show. So much of what we're doing here is going to remain stable. It's the same studio with the same set, the same cast, the same dressing room and the same writers.\n\nThe season premiere follows Jake and Amy on their honeymoon, while next week's second episode puts two background figures, Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker) and Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller), in the spotlight, with a flashback that doubles as a hilarious takeoff on '80s TV cops.\n\nFamiliar faces, such as the Pontiac Bandit (Craig Robinson), return, and Brooklyn picks up continuing storylines, such as Rosa's relationship with her parents after she came out as bisexual last season. The Halloween Heist, a fan favorite, will somehow return, even though it's well past trick-or-treat season.\n\nPeretti's departure story allows her to interact with all the other precinct characters.\n\nI always like doing physical stuff, (but) Gina, by the nature of being at a desk and not being a cop, frequently wasn't able to get into high-stakes, physical-comedy situations. That's what I wanted. So I got to go out with Jake and get into some shenanigans. That was really fun for me, says Peretti, who says she's leaving for a hodgepodge of reasons but declined to be specific.\n\nBrooklyn also continues to take on serious issues. In one episode, the show explores #MeToo and sexual misconduct, as an investigation Jake and Amy are working on reminds Amy of experiences from her own life.\n\nSome of Amy's history comes out around that issue, says Beatriz, who directed the episode. But it's not just Amy, it's Jake. Here's a married couple moving through this discussion about something really painful, not just for her but for both of them. #MeToo isn't just a women's issue.\n\nLo Truglio also directs the high-five episode while playing Boyle. It creates an odd look on set as he offers guidance to actors and crew while packing a gun on his hip.\n\nBut Boyle's puppy-dog persona doesn't necessarily help establish authority, even if he's armed.\n\nWe're all laughing about how hard it is to take him seriously because he's in costume as Boyle, Samberg says. Like, 'Alright, Boyle. Whatever you want.'
Tim Henderson and Alayna Alvarez\n\nPew/Stateline\n\nWASHINGTON – The U.S. Census Bureau has a problem that some parents of millennials will recognize: These adults often don't call. They don't write. If you want to reach them, you have to use social media.\n\nThe 2010 way – mailing a paper form with a follow-up knock on the door or call to a landline – just won't work for many of the residents the bureau needs to find. State and local governments are helping the agency work to avoid undercounts that sap funding and political power.\n\nMail? I feel like that's a dead thing, said Tim Slayton, 36, a Washington, D.C., resident for 18 years. And I don't have a lot of people randomly knocking at my front door, so I would be a little weirded out. 'Census Bureau!' It sounds like a joke. It sounds like you just want me to open my door. So I probably wouldn't.\n\nThe Census Bureau is learning some lessons long known to those trying to reach young people, said Ben Varquez, managing director of Youth Marketing Connection, which conducts marketing campaigns for businesses and nonprofits in Boston and Washington.\n\nNot even our nonprofits and associations are relying on direct mail or phone calls, when it comes to millennials and Gen Z, Varquez said. U.S. mail is inconvenient and archaic. And it's tough to get people to get on their phone browser or laptop to fill out online forms, when you're prompting them with a piece of mail. It's just too many steps.\n\nMillennials, generally those born between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z, those born afterward, make up an estimated 35 percent of the U.S. adult population. States that undercount them risk losing everything from seats in Congress to billions of dollars in federal funding. The trick is to find them and get them to respond.\n\nDivorced and millennials:How ending a marriage has changed in the digital age\n\nMore:LGBTQ families are on the cusp of dramatic growth, and millennials lead the way\n\nEleanor Janhunen, a 25-year-old who manages a jewelry store in the gentrifying NoMa neighborhood of Washington, D.C., agreed that a postcard leading to an online form would be too complicated.\n\nAsking young people to do an extra step is always going to be harder, she said.\n\nToday's millennials are more likely to rent and live in expensive urban areas than previous generations, according to an Urban Institute study in 2018.\n\nThe bureau is aware that young urban renters are less likely than they were in 2010 to communicate by mail, by phone or with strangers at the door. So it's developing social media and other internet publicity that will allow potential respondents to log in and fill out a form next year.\n\nYou're able to go in and be a part of the census, without getting what we're sending, said Deborah Stempowski, the bureau's chief of census management, speaking at a December meeting of the Census Scientific Advisory Committee in California. You can do it on the phone on the Metro. It fills that gap.\n\nA member of the committee, 32-year-old Jessica McKellar, expressed skepticism that the bureau could find her any other way.\n\nI don't check my physical mail. I just don't. I also don't answer my phone, and I live in an apartment complex. Nobody could get to my door if they tried to, said McKellar, a tech startup founder in San Francisco, at the meeting.\n\nFour out of five people ages 25-34 have no landline at home as of 2018, up from about a third in 2008, according to federal statistics. Almost 90 percent of people ages 18-29 use social media, according to a 2018 Pew Research Center survey (The Pew Charitable Trusts funds Stateline and the research center).\n\nSomebody like LeBron James could say, 'It's halftime! Pull out your phones, and let's answer the census!' said Burton Reist, communications chief for the census. Anybody anywhere can do it right then, right there. It gives us a power we've never had before. It's just huge.\n\nMcKellar said her friends and family likely would respond to social media and celebrity endorsements. In Washington, millennials mentioned political heroes.\n\nIf Obama was explaining it, or even Michelle [Obama], a lot of people would say, 'OK,' Slayton said. They need to hear it from people they trust or like.\n\nAre you a Xennial?:How to tell if you're the microgeneration between Gen X and Millennial\n\nMany areas deemed hard to count by the Census Bureau are poor or have large immigrant populations, the bureau said. But rental status and youth are bigger factors than income, so young people are the hardest to find, whether poor or relatively affluent, according to the census study.\n\nBecause they might be living with roommates, especially in high-cost areas, they may be reluctant to fill out forms asking for information about everybody in the household.\n\nThere are six other people in my building with the same address. I know them, but I couldn't answer the census for them, said Emily Peeler, a 29-year-old attorney who moved from Kentucky to Washington five years ago.\n\nIn fact, many of the areas that the Census Bureau identified as the hardest to count are expensive and popular with young professionals, such as Brooklyn, D.C., Manhattan and San Francisco.\n\nThose areas were identified as likely to be particularly hard to count in a 2017 study by a Google consultant and former census statistician, Chandra Erdman. The study won a national contest to predict low response rates in small areas so that census workers and local officials can prepare to give them extra attention.\n\nStates and cities across the country need new ways to find the surging wave of young urban renters, which has driven apartment construction to its highest levels since the 1970s.\n\nAdil Yalcin, a 31-year-old data analyst who works from home in Alexandria, a D.C. suburb in Northern Virginia, said he appreciates the fact that the 2020 forms will be online, but he doesn't mind watching for a postcard in the mail.\n\nIt's a novelty. Sometimes what's old school is new school because it stands out, Yalcin said. At the same time, I appreciate that I can fill it out online. I wouldn't want them to give me a big paper form to fill out by hand. At least they're modern and digitally aware.\n\nState groups grappling with the problem include the Minnesota Census Mobilization Partnership, a private-public partnership working on encouraging census participation.\n\nThe partnership is drafting state legislation to give census takers the same right to enter controlled-access apartment buildings as police and firefighters, said Bob Tracy, the group's public policy director.\n\nThe city of Houston, also struggling with how to reach millennial renters who have flocked to the city's energy employment boom, also might consider asking for such a state law, said Margaret Wallace Brown, the city's acting planning director who is directing the effort to encourage census participation.\n\nOne area in danger of being undercounted is Eldrige-West Oaks, in western Houston. Ninety-six percent of homes there are rental apartments, and typical household income is high, at $96,000 a year, according to census statistics. Loft-style housing and artist spaces built in the past decade have drawn new residents, Wallace Brown said.\n\nFast-changing urban neighborhoods are particularly tough for outreach, because they may comprise lower-income residents in tightknit communities who have been there for decades, along with more affluent young professionals seeking housing at the edges of sought-after enclaves.\n\nThe two groups are both important to avoid undercounts but need different kinds of attention, said Howard Hogan, who retired this year as the bureau's chief demographer.\n\nYoung, educated, mobile professionals might be much easier to reach on the internet, Hogan said. There's more indifference or suspicion among the less well-off, however. It will not be so easy to reach them that way, even if they carry a cellphone all day.\n\nWhether poor or affluent, many millennials said they want to hear more about why census participation matters.\n\nCelebrities won't convince me. I don't follow any of them, said Tiffany Johnson, 34, who works in Washington and lives in suburban Maryland. For me, it would have to be person to person, like a friend, telling me why I should do this. Why is it worth my time?\n\nThe Erdman study noted that young singles are less likely to mail back paper forms, but more likely than others to fill them out on the internet, offering hope that an online campaign could be successful.\n\nStill, some experts are concerned that internet links to census forms could open the door to widespread fraud or malicious attempts to distort data.\n\nHow do you verify? Couldn't some bot just fill out 900 million addresses? asked Jay Breidt, a statistics professor at Colorado State University who serves on the advisory committee. Breidt told Stateline that the committee will continue to discuss the issue at its next meeting, in April.\n\nTo deal with possible fake or duplicate census forms, the bureau has a highly confidential computer method, or algorithm, called the Primary Selection Algorithm. It is kept secret to avoid hackers attempting to defeat it by learning its specific parts.\n\nIf someone did try to fill out millions of forms, the algorithm would detect it, because only one form will be accepted from each household.\n\nOf the millions you might have entered, we would pick one, based on records and what we know about that address, said the bureau's deputy director, Enrique Lamas.\n\nToday's educated millennials and Gen Z members are dedicated to civic engagement, so it's ironic that they're in danger of contributing to census undercounts that could undermine the political power of cities they helped shape, said Jason Dorsey, a researcher for the Center for Generational Kinetics, a consulting group.\n\nYou have young, affluent renters who often want their voices to be heard, Dorsey said. Yet they might miss out on being counted in the census, which could reduce the influence their local community has.\n\nSome of those in the target audience suggested the bureau might have to resort to monetary incentives to get a spot on a busy young professional's calendar.\n\nI would fill out [a census form] because I know how important data collection is, said Katie Stasa, a 25-year-old communications analyst who recently moved to Washington. But if I'm having a really busy week, or life is out of control, absolutely not. If they're not going to give me an Amazon gift card, why would I do it?\n\nStateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.
Tom Arnold and his wife Ashley Groussman have split after 10 years of marriage.\n\nThe 59-year-old actor confirmed the breakup in an interview with Us Weekly, saying that Groussman recently moved out of the home they shared together.\n\nIt's a long time coming and we have been together for almost 11 years... I have many good years. I have my children because my wife, Arnold said.\n\nArmold and Groussman married in Nov. 2009, welcoming son Jax in April 2013 and daughter Quinn in Dec. 2015.\n\nFor the last couple years... it's been very unusual in the house, Arnold told the magazine. But my kids and I have a whole life, a wonderful life. I've been telling my wife, 'It's OK. Just do whatever you gotta do.' So, she moved out.\n\nBefore Groussman, Arnold was married to Roseanne Barr from 1990 and 1994, Julie Armstrong from 1995 to 1999 and Shelby Roos from 2002 to 2008.\n\nSometimes in our society people put things on (especially) women, they can feel guilty, Arnold continued. And I kept saying, 'Hey, listen. … You have done everything. We've been together. You've been amazing. There doesn't have to be a reason. There doesn't have to be a bad guy.' \n\nMore:Tom Arnold says Secret Service came to his house over anti-Trump tweets
Scott MacDonald\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nWhat should be done about America's $1.6 trillion in outstanding student debt? There is more student debt than credit card debt or any other kind of debt except mortgage debt.\n\nAlmost 45 million Americans have student debt, and the level is increasing. Seven in 10 seniors in the class of 2019 took out student loans.\n\nWith so much debt and comparatively low increases in wages, more debt is in arrears. About 11% of student loans are delinquent or in default.With so much debt, graduates are unable to participate fully in the national economy. Homebuying, marriage and childbearing are often delayed and consumer purchases deferred. The U.S. economy is largely based on consumer buying, and with newer members of the workforce burdened by high levels of debt, national economic growth will suffer, leading to fewer jobs and business opportunities.\n\nAlmost everyone acknowledges the country has a major problem, but there is little agreement about what to do. Some, like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, would cancel all outstanding debt.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren would cancel up to $50,000 for borrowers making less than $250,000. President Joe Biden has proposed canceling up to $10,000 per borrower.\n\nForgiving all debt is a hard argument\n\nOthers believe that student borrowers willingly borrowed the money and are obliged to pay it back. They support proposals for streamlining forms and processes and providing information, but oppose debt forgiveness.\n\nArguing that forgiving student debt is justified because it will help the economy is a difficult argument. If the government forgave all credit card debt, which is about $1 trillion, that would help the economy, too. But is it fair to give benefit to those who use their credit cards more than others?\n\nThere are other concerns about canceling student debt. Should taxpayers cancel debt of those who are making high incomes? Should borrowers from families with millions of dollars of assets have student debt forgiven? When deciding whose debt to forgive, details matter.\n\nThe fairness issue also is apparent when talking to graduates and parents who sacrificed and struggled to avoid or minimize debt while the student was in school. Is it fair to not give a rebate on expenditures to a student who worked during school and vacations, and whose parents stopped taking vacations and deferred other expenditures to avoid student debt, when the government gives one to students who did not take the same measures?\n\nThe highest levels of debt are usually held by students who went to medical school, law school or graduate school. If a doctor has $200,000 in student debt but has very high earning potential, should he or she be given taxpayer funds to pay off debt early?\n\nBloat is a problem:I took out student loans with eyes wide open, but too many degrees aren't worth the debt\n\nThere are many fairness arguments against giving money to graduates in debt and treating graduates who avoided or paid off their debt differently, but this does not solve the problem. Similarly, what about students in school who are still incurring debt? Do graduates get a free ride but those yet to graduate get nothing?\n\nOne could argue that student debt is different than other kinds of debt, and that reducing student debt is fair. The students who borrowed the money were typically 18 or 19 years old. They were often so happy to attend college, they did not realize what they were signing up for, and their financial intelligence was limited by lack of prior experience dealing with such issues. Yes, they signed the papers agreeing to the debt obligations, but too often schools took advantage of signing up young students and enabling them to pay necessary tuition and fees, which the college needed.\n\nA middle-ground solution\n\nThere is a middle-ground solution to the problem of too much debt while respecting fairness considerations. A student borrower of government loans who is not in default or delinquent on these loans would be entitled to debt forgiveness of $1 for every dollar of loan principal they paid during the year with a maximum of $6,000 per year.\n\nFor example, if the student paid down their federal debt by $500 in a year, their loan balance would decrease by $1,000. Such a proposal if adopted would reduce outstanding student debt, reduce likely default rates on government loans, incentivize borrowers to save and pay down debt as soon as possible, avoid windfall payments to borrowers and not to nonborrowers, spread federal loan write-offs over time and eliminate most student debt in five years.\n\nDefense against disinformation:Fair or not, we need free college and student loan forgiveness — and so does democracy\n\nSuch a plan would also respect the sacrifices made by those who avoided debt or already repaid their debt. Those earlier students likely attended school when tuition was less, requiring fewer loans. And current borrowers would still be required to make payments.\n\nThe average student debt is about $30,000. If a borrower paid $250 a month in principal or $3,000 a year and that was matched, his or her $30,000 would be paid off in five years. If they managed to pay $500 a month, the debt would be retired in 2 1/2 years. If a borrower paid the maximum $6,000 a year for five years and was matched, $60,000 of debt would be retired.If every borrower did this, roughly 85% of borrowers would have no student debt in five years.\n\nScott MacDonald is the founder of the MacDonald Community Scholarship Program.

Rita Moreno knows her best years aren't behind her. In fact, she's in them right now.\n\nThe scintillating acting legend has won an Oscar (West Side Story), two Emmys (The Muppet Show and The Rockford Files), a Tony (The Ritz) and a Grammy (The Electric Company), becoming the first Latina woman to achieve the coveted EGOT in 1977.\n\nBut at 89, the trailblazing Puerto Rican-born entertainer is busier than ever, having just wrapped a four-season reboot of sitcom One Day at a Time and played a new role in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story (in theaters Dec. 10), a reimagining of the 1961 movie musical that made her famous as the confident and savvy Anita.\n\nShe's now the subject of a candid new documentary Rita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It, which premiered at Sundance Film Festival Friday. In a virtual Q&A following the film, Moreno said she's not only the happiest she's ever been, but on a career high, too.\n\nSundance Film Festival:All the best movies we saw, ranked (including the new Rita Moreno doc)\n\nOh my God, yes, Moreno said. For one thing, I'm 89. I'm still here. My brain is working OK. I forget nouns, but nouns and I are not on good terms anymore because I'm old. The names of things or people constantly make me crazy. But I have a documentary about my life. I have a redo of 'West Side Story,' a film that had enormous, outrageous success. And I'm 89!\n\nRight now, I'm terrific, she continued. I'm one of the most terrific 89-year-olds I know.\n\nOne of the documentary's most surprising revelations involves Moreno's 45-year marriage to Leonard Gordon, who died in 2010. The couple had a seemingly perfect relationship and one daughter, Fernanda Luisa Gordon. But Moreno says he didn't like her raucous laughter and big personality, and was often a controller.\n\nWhen he died, I thought, 'It's over. I don't have to answer to anybody anymore,'  Moreno says in the film.\n\nInterview :Rita Moreno on bravery (still hard), her journey (not over) and the importance of listening (we must do better)\n\nThe actress says she wouldn't have spoken publicly about their marriage were he still alive today.\n\nI would never have talked about him without his permission. I couldn't do that, Moreno said during the Q&A. And it's entirely possible and probable that he would have said, 'What? Are you crazy? No you cannot.' In a way, having the freedom to do it was really very important to me because we ran quite an extraordinary and successful charade for many years.\n\nFilming the whole interview about my husband (for the documentary) was very hard, Moreno added. He was a wonderful person, it was just that our marriage didn't work out. I didn't realize how desperately I needed to be on my own. I really didn't realize how I was punishing myself by not being on my own.\n\nThe film, which airs on PBS' American Masters later this year, chronicles Moreno's humble beginnings in Humacao, Puerto Rico. She moved to New York with her mom as a young girl, taking up dance lessons and getting discovered by a talent scout at age 16. Movie mogul Louis B. Mayer called her a Spanish Elizabeth Taylor during their first meeting, and she was signed to MGM soon after.\n\nBut when she arrived in Hollywood, she was quickly typecast as sex objects and stereotypical minority characters: playing Native American and Filipino women with limited dialogue and so-called universal accents, and a Burmese slave named Tuptim in 1956 movie musical The King and I.\n\nI wanted to turn the parts down, but that's all that was offered and I had to make a living, Moreno says in the film. I was kind of stuck.\n\nSundance 2021:Questlove takes us to forgotten 'Black Woodstock' in joyous concert doc 'Summer of Soul'\n\nAround that time, Moreno recalls a harrowing encounter with her then-agent, who forced himself on the actress and raped her in his apartment.\n\nHere's what's terrible: I still let him be my agent, because he was the only one I knew that was helping me in my so-called career, Moreno says. That's what astonishes me – that I thought so little of myself.\n\nShe also describes her tumultuous eight-year love affair with Marlon Brando, who arranged for her to get an abortion as soon as he learned she was pregnant. The botched procedure proved near-fatal and she bled for days after. It was very scary, because I could've died, Moreno says.\n\nShortly after shooting West Side Story, and reeling from Brando's emotional abuse and philandering, Moreno attempted suicide by swallowing sleeping pills.\n\nIt was humiliating and I was letting him step all over me, Moreno says. I wanted to get rid of myself because I didn't think I deserved to live.\n\nAfter surviving the attempt, she went into therapy and managed to get closure with Brando. Although she doesn't currently attend therapy, I always have an open date, Moreno said. My therapist now lives in San Francisco and he said, 'Anytime you want some advice, you don't even have to come in – just call.' I talked to him a number of times when I was having problems with my marriage and it was immensely helpful.\n\nRita Moreno: Just a Girl Who Decided to Go For It screens again virtually Sunday at 10 am EST, and is still seeking a theatrical distributor.
Nate Davis\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nMost of the big names in free agency have gotten paid, with many finding new teams and shifting the balance of power in some divisions. The ripple effect will be felt in next month's draft and has definitely altered our fourth mock draft:\n\n1. Tennessee Titans – Laremy Tunsil, T, Mississippi: He's been entrenched in this spot mostly because of his ability to secure second-year QB Marcus Mariota's blind side. But the Titans didn't have one of the top 25 run-blocking tackles in 2015, per ProFootballFocus, an area they'll want to improve to maximize their acquisition of RB DeMarco Murray.\n\n2. Cleveland Browns – Carson Wentz, QB, North Dakota State: Even with Robert Griffin III's arrival, the Browns would be wise to take Wentz and let Hue Jackson coach him up on the practice field for a team that looks years away from winning. And if RG3 experiences a career resurgence, then the franchise has a pair of valuable trade chips (Griffin and Wentz) to assist with its massive rebuild.\n\nAFC status report: How each team has fared so far in the offseason\n\n3. San Diego Chargers – Jalen Ramsey, DB, Florida State: The Bolts added Casey Hayward in free agency, giving them a strong group of corners. But they remain thin at safety after giving Eric Weddle the boot. Ramsey, arguably the best player in the draft, can play anywhere in the secondary, but his track speed may allow him to make the biggest impact on the back line.\n\n4. Dallas Cowboys – Joey Bosa, DE, Ohio State: Only five teams had fewer sacks than Dallas' 31, and that was with the services of free agent DE Greg Hardy. Bosa, who's no slouch against the run, should be able to consistently provide double-digit sacks, a dimension the Cowboys have lacked since parting with DeMarcus Ware.\n\n5. Jacksonville Jaguars – Myles Jack, LB, UCLA: During free agency, GM Dave Caldwell upgraded the line (Malik Jackson) and secondary (Tashaun Gipson) of a defense that allowed the most points in the AFC a year ago. The versatile Jack would provide a major boost to a linebacking corps that lacks playmakers.\n\n6. Baltimore Ravens – DeForest Buckner, DE, Oregon: When he's not executing one of his typical draft night trades, GM Ozzie Newsome adheres to a best player on the board philosophy. In this scenario, that means Buckner goes to Baltimore, which could clearly use a disruptive 6-7, 291-pound five-technique to reinvigorate its three-man front.\n\n7. San Francisco 49ers – Jared Goff, QB, California: He makes good decisions, has quick feet, gets rid of the ball quickly and accurately, all traits that could make him highly effective in Chip Kelly's offense – provided his 6-4, 215-pound frame can withstand the punishment that's often a byproduct of this scheme.\n\n8. Philadelphia Eagles (from Miami Dolphins) – Ezekiel Elliott, RB, Ohio State: They moved up five spots after swapping first-round choices with the Dolphins, who took CB Byron Maxwell and LB Kiko Alonso off Philly's hands in the deal. Howie Roseman could go in any number of directions for the Eagles, but why not take a highly productive three-down back who could theoretically ease the burden on QB Sam Bradford (or Chase Daniel)?\n\nNFC status report: How each team has fared so far in the offseason\n\n9. Tampa Bay Buccaneers – Vernon Hargreaves III, CB, Florida: The ball's in the air quite a bit in the NFC South. Pairing Hargreaves with veteran CB Brent Grimes would give the ex-Gator more time to adapt to the pros while honing his skills against No. 2 receivers or while locking down the slot.\n\n10. New York Giants – Ronnie Stanley, T, Notre Dame: Adding the Irish star would allow the Giants to move last year's first rounder, T Ereck Flowers, to his more natural right side while potentially giving the O-line bookends well into the next decade.\n\n11. Chicago Bears – Jack Conklin, T, Michigan State: The Bears spent quite a bit on their defense in free agency, and the draft's wealth of D-linemen allows them to get a good one later. But Conklin would solidify a suspect O-line by allowing Kyle Long to move back inside to guard and keeping newly signed T Bobby Massie on the right side where he belongs.\n\n12. New Orleans Saints – Sheldon Rankins, DT, Louisville: The Saints allowed 28 more points in 2015 than any other team. They could certainly use a three-down lineman whose quickness makes him an asset in stopping the run and getting penetration on passing downs.\n\n13. Dolphins (from Eagles) – Reggie Ragland, ILB, Alabama: Only the Browns had more issues stopping the run in the AFC than Miami. Plugging Ragland into the middle of the Dolphins defense would have the dual benefit of shutting down some of those rushing lanes while also allowing Alonso to play in space on the outside.\n\n14. Oakland Raiders – Shaq Lawson, DE, Clemson: The Raiders struggled to stop the pass in 2015, partially because no one not named Khalil Mack had more than four sacks. Lawson is an all-down disruptor whose 25½ tackles for a loss was the most in the Football Bowl Subdivision in 2015.\n\n15. Los Angeles Rams – Paxton Lynch, QB, Memphis: He's got a big arm and nice mobility for such a large man (6-7, 244). Allowing him to adapt to the pro game behind Case Keenum and/or Nick Foles before he eventually takes over an offense that goes through RB Todd Gurley is pretty much an ideal scenario for a developmental quarterback.\n\n16. Detroit Lions – Jarran Reed, DT, Alabama: Even with Haloti Ngata back, the Lions still need to get better and younger at defensive tackle a year after parting with Ndamukong Suh. And getting more push inside only benefits DE Ziggy Ansah off the edge.\n\n17. Atlanta Falcons – Darron Lee, LB, Ohio State: One reason Dan Quinn's Seattle defenses were so dominant was due to the multi-faceted abilities of the linebackers. It's an area where the Falcons are sorely lacking, but Lee could instantly change as a rangy asset who's effective on all three downs.\n\n18. Indianapolis Colts – Taylor Decker, OT, Ohio State: The Colts are probably a few months away from giving QB Andrew Luck a contract in the neighborhood of $200 million, so it goes without saying that they need to do a much better job protecting him. Getting more out of the running game would also be nice.\n\n19. Buffalo Bills – Eli Apple, CB, Ohio State: Rex Ryan values cornerbacks and could definitely use a third one behind starters Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby. Given his athleticism and physicality, Apple looks ready to step in as a nickelback.\n\n20. New York Jets – Leonard Floyd, OLB, Georgia: The Jets have been trying for years – Calvin Pace, Vernon Gholston, Quinton Coples – to find an impact edge rusher. They're still trying, but maybe Floyd is the long-sought solution.\n\n21. Washington Redskins – Andrew Billings, DT, Baylor: Coming off a strong pro day – it included a sub 5-second 40-yard dash for the 6-1, 311-pounder – Billings could be a wrecking ball as the nose man in Washington, which needs a new one with Terrance Knighton unsigned. And GM Scot McCloughan has a penchant for picking linemen early.\n\nSeahawks' Richard Sherman: Roger Goodell 'foolish' for ejection proposal\n\n22. Houston Texans – Corey Coleman, WR, Baylor: Texans coach Bill O'Brien seemed to take special interest in him at Baylor's pro day. The speedy Coleman has the ability to catch up to new Houston QB Brock Osweiler's deep throws while opening things up underneath for WR DeAndre Hopkins and RB Lamar Miller.\n\n23. Minnesota Vikings – Laquon Treadwell, WR, Mississippi: A solid route runner with nice hands, he could be a better fit for this attack than departed Mike Wallace. Treadwell's steadiness could help QB Teddy Bridgewater open up the offense, something the Vikings want.\n\n24. Cincinnati Bengals – Will Fuller, WR, Notre Dame: The fastest wideout at the combine (4.32 in the 40), he could make defenses pay for doubling WR A.J. Green and/or TE Tyler Eifert. Fuller also fills a big hole after Cincinnati lost WRs Marvin Jones and Mohamed Sanu in free agency.\n\n25. Pittsburgh Steelers – Mackensie Alexander, CB, Clemson: No team allowed more passing yards in the AFC last year than Pittsburgh. Alexander could start immediately for a secondary begging for reinforcements and help ensure Ben Roethlisberger and Co. don't have to win so many shootouts.\n\n26. Seattle Seahawks – A'Shawn Robinson, DT, Alabama: Excellent value if he actually lasts this long for a team that needs to start rebuilding the D-line depth that was such a crucial component of its Super Bowl runs.\n\n27. Green Bay Packers – Vernon Butler, DT, Louisiana Tech: A massive man (6-4, 323) and promising talent who could instantly offset the absence of NT B.J. Raji for this defense.\n\n28. Kansas City Chiefs – William Jackson III, CB, Houston: A tall (6-0), physical player who could step right into the starting spot vacated when Sean Smith signed with the Raiders.\n\n29. Arizona Cardinals – Robert Nkemdiche, DL, Mississippi: Perhaps the second coming of Darnell Dockett? Of course, that assumes Nkemdiche's motor is revved and head screwed on straight. But his talent is undeniable, and coach Bruce Arians doesn't shy away from players with baggage. This could be a perfect marriage.\n\n30. Carolina Panthers – Kevin Dodd, DE, Clemson: The Panthers brought Charles Johnson back for one more year, but the declining vet only had one sack in 2015. Dodd could probably use a bit more time to develop but might be ready to make a major impact in 2017 if not by midseason this year. He was a breakout player last year for the Tigers, racking up 23½ tackles for loss and 12 sacks.\n\n31. Denver Broncos – Ryan Kelly, C, Alabama: Whether he takes over at center or slides to one of the vacated guard spots, Kelly could be a perfect fit in Denver's zone-blocking scheme given his mobility and intellect.\n\nNote: New England Patriots were stripped of their first-round pick for their alleged role in Deflategate\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nPHOTOS: Top NFL draft prospects
HLUHLUWE, South Africa — Everybody back in the vehicles!\n\nRon Schlossberg and nearly a dozen fellow passengers from the luxury ship Crystal Symphony are standing around a fold-up bar in the South African bush when the cry goes out. Two lions are approaching.\n\nScrambling back to the safety of their souped-up Toyota Land Cruisers, they watch as one of the big cats closes to within 30 feet. It then plops down directly across from the spot where just moments before they were having end-of-day cocktails.\n\nIt's been a wonderful marriage, Schlossberg, 75, jokes to his wife, Judy, as the deadly creature gives the group an extended stare.\n\nRELATED: The luxury of the revamped Crystal Symphony\n\nAssured by his ranger guide that the lion poses no danger, the semi-retired business owner from Avon, Conn. doesn't seem convinced.\n\nI'd feel better if it was stuffed, he quips.\n\nWelcome to the new era of South Africa cruise adventures. Schlossberg and his companions are on a two-night safari at South Africa's famed Phinda Private Game Reserve — home to lions, elephants, giraffes and other iconic African wildlife. They're also in the midst of a two-week Crystal Cruises voyage that has South Africa as its focus.\n\nCrystal is one of a growing number of lines touting extended sailings along the South Africa coast that offer the chance to see the country's wild lands in depth via multiple, multi-day overland excursions. More than half a dozen other cruise operators including Cunard, Seabourn and Oceania also have scheduled South Africa voyages with multi-day excursions over the coming year.\n\nTaking place from November through April, the cruises let vacationers explore the length of South Africa — one of the African continent's top spots for wildlife viewing — without the hassle of moving from hotel to hotel or lodge to lodge.\n\nIt's a dream come true, says Maida Hastings, a 75-year-old retiree from Pacific Palisades, Calif. who also is on the two-night Phinda safari along with her 88-year-old husband.\n\nPausing to talk after a sighting of a white rhinoceros, one of Africa's big five game animals, Hastings suggests it would have been tough for the couple to do a traditional land-based tour of South Africa.\n\nBeing able to return to the ship (after outings) makes it easy and comfortable for us, she says.\n\nStarting in Durban, South Africa, the two-night excursion to the Phinda game reserve is just one of half a dozen multi-day safaris available to Symphony passengers on this trip. Two-night safaris to South African game reserves also are available from the South African ports of Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. There also is a four-night safari trip to Zimbabwe available from Cape Town that includes a visit to Victoria Falls.\n\nPassengers on Symphony also can sign up for day trips to game reserves from all five of the South African ports the ship visits. In addition to Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, the vessel stops at Mossel Bay and Richards Bay.\n\nIt's a terrific way to see a lot of great animals in a short time, says Chris Snook, 69, of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., after a day visit to South Africa's Pumba Private Game Reserve, near Port Elizabeth.\n\nIn just three hours of bouncing around the reserve in Land Rover Defenders with guides, Snook and more than 40 fellow Symphony passengers see hundreds of animals including lions, rhinoceros, zebra, giraffe and elephants.\n\nDubbed Jewels of the Indian Ocean, the Symphony sailing also includes a day stop at Maputo, Mozambique. Passengers visit a small waterfront fort that once housed Portuguese soldiers and the city's central train station, designed by Gustav Eiffel of Eiffel Tower fame. The lush, volcanic French island of Reunion to the east of the African mainland also is on the itinerary. The trip ends at the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius.\n\nStill, South Africa is the focus of the voyage. Symphony spends two full days in Cape Town, South Africa's coastal gem, allowing time for tours to the rugged Cape of Good Hope — the most southwestern point of the African continent. There's also an overnight stay in Durban.\n\nLike other cruises that focus on South Africa, the sailing also features on-board programming tuned toward the destination. During the Cape Town stay, a traditional South African dance group comes on board to perform. The trip also boasts a series of cooking classes by South African celebrity chef Jenny Morris and lectures by noted South African political analyst and author Daniel Silke.\n\nThe voyage is, notably, the first segment of a 114-day world cruise that will take Symphony from Africa to Australia to the Americas. In a sign of South Africa's growing allure for cruisers, it's the first world cruise from any line to start in the country.\n\nSailing since 1995, Symphony long has been known as one of luxury cruising's finest vessels, and it has just emerged from a massive makeover that has left it sparkling. The upgrades brought a major overhaul of the vessel's dining options including the addition of a new Asian eatery and Brazilian steakhouse. Also revamped were several lounge areas, and an entire deck of cabins was reconfigured to create 40 new suites.\n\nStill, for many passengers on this South Africa sailing, the renewed elegance of the vessel is almost an afterthought.\n\nWe booked this specifically because it had the off-the-ship safari opportunities, says Joe Wurz, a 66-year-old retiree from Syracuse, N.Y. who along with his wife is on his 10th Crystal cruise.\n\nSome people go for the shows and food on the ship; we go for the itineraries.\n\nIf you go ...\n\nCrystal Cruises' next South Africa voyage kicks off Feb. 20, 2019. The 21-day trip from Perth, Australia to Cape Town, South Africa features stops in Richards Bay, Durban and Port Elizabeth, South Africa as well as ports in Mauritius, Madagascar and Mozambique. Fares start at $7,595 per person, based on double occupancy. Information: 888-722-0021; crystalcruises.com.\n\nOther lines offering South Africa sailings over the coming year include MSC Cruises and Ponant. MSC is the market leader in the region with more than two dozen voyages each winter out of Cape Town and Durban. Designed for quick getaways, the trips are just three- to five-nights in length and start at $429. Ponant typically offers at least one South Africa-focused sailing each winter. Its next South Africa voyage starts March 24 in Cape Town and is an eight-night trip to Durban with calls at Port Elizabeth and Richards Bay. Fares start at $4,254.\n\nAlso visiting South Africa over the coming year as part of extended world voyages are ships from Cunard, Holland America, Seabourn, Regent Seven Seas, Oceania, Hapag-Lloyd and Voyages to Antiquity. In addition, Silversea Cruises' expedition division typically offers one cruise a year up the west coast of Africa that begins in Cape Town. Silversea also occasionally offers East Africa cruises that include stops in South Africa.\n\nUSA TODAY Cruises: The 25 most beautiful cruise vessels
ASBURY PARK, N.J. – Under former President Donald Trump, transgender people couldn't serve their country, even if they wanted to. The administration had banned them from the military.\n\nPresident Joe Biden reversed that on Monday, five days after he took the oath of office.\n\nThe reversal follows Biden's day one actions that included executive orders reversing Trump's race and gender diversity training ban and prohibiting workplace discrimination in the federal government based on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as directing federal agencies to ensure LGBTQ protections are included in anti-discrimination statutes.\n\nThese actions are a strong indication of how the rights of the LGBTQ community will immediately change during the Biden administration, and advocates are optimistic about rights becoming permanent under federal law.\n\n(The Trump administration) will go down in history as one of the most blatantly hostile administrations to LGBTQ equality, said Sharon McGowan, chief strategy officer and legal director of Lambda Legal, a national nonprofit organization working for the civil rights of the LGBT community and those living with HIV. And again, you have to put that in context, because obviously going back not that long ago one might look to the indifference and hostility of the Reagan administration during the first days of the AIDS crisis as sort of another example.\n\nBiden and Vice President Kamala Harris have their work cut out for them as they endeavor to restore and shore up rights and protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans in the wake of Trump's time in office, advocates and experts said.\n\nIt certainly is a significant task that they have ahead, in part because the Trump administration literally up through sort of the last hours of the administration have tried to leave no stone unturned in terms of the amount of damage and harm that they can do to the LGBT community, said McGowan.\n\nPreviously:Most Americans want protections for LGBTQ people. Biden could finally make that happen.\n\nA rule published Jan. 12, LGBTQ advocates said, allows social service agencies and providers that receive U.S. Department of Health and Human Services grant funding to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, religion and sex.\n\nAs early as February 2017, the Trump administration rolled back Obama-era protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use school restrooms corresponding to their gender identity.\n\nThat was followed by Trump's announcement of the transgender troop ban in July 2017, with the policy taking effect in April 2019.\n\nHuman Rights Campaign president Alphonso David, in a statement Monday, described Trump's ban as an arbitrary and discriminatory executive action that has not only harmed transgender service members but our entire military.\n\nThe greatest military in the world will again value readiness over bias, and qualifications over discrimination, David said.\n\nBy prioritizing an end to this discriminatory, unjustified ban, President Biden has fulfilled a campaign promise and is making our military stronger and more unified, said GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis in a statement Monday.\n\nNow transgender people can see themselves reflected in the people serving their country, and young people will look to Biden's administration and see several LGBTQ people holding prominent positions.\n\nAmong them Pennsylvania Department of Health secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, Biden's pick for assistant secretary of health, would be the first openly transgender federal official confirmed by the U.S. Senate.\n\nHaving LGBTQ representation in the federal government, including multiracial people, a question like, 'Could I be in government as a trans or gay person?' stops being a question, said Ethan Levine, a GLSEN South Jersey volunteer and assistant professor at Stockton University. Broader LGBTQ policies that aren't directly aimed at kids still impact them ... that becomes part of the world you're being raised into.\n\nRachel Levine:Biden health appointee would be first transgender federal official confirmed by Senate\n\nGLAAD, via its Trump Accountability Project, reported 181 actions or statements on the LGBTQ communityfrom the Trump administration over the last four years.\n\nIn some ways it's different (from the Regan administration) because there had been progress made, said McGowan. And the amount of intentional reversal and undermining of progress that had been made by this administration is what will likely set it apart from anything that came before it.\n\nLooking back:LGBTQ community faced 'relentless' attacks under Trump\n\nWaiting for the Equality Act\n\nWith Biden in the White House and Democratic control over both houses of Congress, advocates are hopeful about the potential passage of the long-awaited Equality Act.\n\nThe Equality Act will help address a lot of the discriminatory practices that the Trump and Pence administration (put into place), said Christian Fuscarino, executive director of the education and advocacy organization Garden Stage Equality based in Asbury Park, New Jersey.\n\nPassed by the House of Representatives in May 2019 before stalling in the Senate, the act would update federal nondiscrimination laws to make discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity unlawful.\n\nSarah Warbelow, legal director for LGBTQ advocacy organization the Human Rights Campaign, described the Equality Act as almost a cradle-to-grave type of non-discrimination bill.\n\nIt would affect LGBTQ people in almost every area of life, Warbelow said. It certainly would codify the Bostock decision (by the United States Supreme Court in June), making it clear that you cannot be discriminated in employment. But it also applies it to housing, education, to jury service, access to credit.\n\nAnd then, where there are no sex non-discrimination laws, such as in most federally funded programs or places of public of accommodation, places you would expect to be able to go and get goods and services without discrimination, it adds sex, sexual orientation and gender identity (protections).\n\nThe Equality Act's passing would address a key issue LGBTQ seniors talk about in SAGE Jersey City meetings, said facilitator Gordon Sauer: discrimination in housing.\n\nA study conducted by SAGE – a national organization that advocates for LGBTQ seniors – and the Equal Rights Center found that 48% of older same-sex couples applying for senior housing experienced some form of discrimination.\n\nWhen I talk to LGBT older adults and they discuss [how] it's expensive to live in New Jersey and they need to move. I'll say to them look carefully at the rights you have in each state because you won't have the protections you have here in many other states, especially in regard to housing, Sauer said. That's something I really hope would change if we have a national bill.\n\nAnother change for discrimination policies involves adoption, which was protected before Trump rolled back LGBTQ anti-discrimination regulations. Levine hopes the Biden-Harris administration affirms that queer families are valid and as qualified to adopt children as heterosexual families.\n\nOn Monday, Biden established a policy that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity the military – another action, along with his day one executive orders, called for in the Human Rights Campaign's Blueprint for Positive Change 2020.\n\nA hopeful time\n\nMembers of the LGBTQ community and their allies who feel beaten down, disheartened and at the end of their ropes after the last four years should feel confident in the Biden administration, Fuscarino said.\n\nThe folks that are going into positions of leadership are speaking with leaders of LGBTQ nonprofit organizations that are on the cutting edge of what LGBTQ equality looks like in 2021, Fuscarino said. There are bright days ahead.\n\nLevine echoed hopeful is one word for their feelings toward the next four years. As an educator, he can't really imagine what it would be like to be a sixth grader seeing Pete Buttigieg [in a federal] role.\n\nButtigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana and the president's one-time Democratic presidential nomination rival, would be the first openly gay cabinet secretary if he is confirmed as Biden's transportation secretary by the Senate.\n\nThe American public increasingly appears to favor equality, with a mid-September swing-state poll by Hart Research Associates and the HRC of 4,000 likely voters living in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas finding overwhelming support for marriage equality, adoption rights and transgender military service, according to a report from The 19th and USA TODAY.\n\nBut a June study from progressive think tank the Center for American Progress and University of Chicago research group NORC found 67% of young LGBTQ adults surveyed reported being discriminated against in the past year, a drastic jump from a 2017 Center for American Progress survey in which 25% of LGBT adults reported discrimination.\n\nThe HRC reported that at least 44 transgender or gender non-conforming people, the majority of whom were Black or Latinx transgender women, were killed in 2020, the highest that number has ever been since the HRC began tracking this data in 2013.\n\nWhile some of Trump's work can be countered by executive orders from Biden, other efforts will have long-lasting ramifications – such as how Trump and Senate Republicans, in McGowan's words, packed the federal judiciary with people who had backgrounds and histories and records demonstrating their hostility to LGBTQ people.\n\nAccording to Lambda, nearly 40% of the judges appointed by Trump to federal appeals courts have a history of anti-LGBTQ animus.\n\nAnd these, of course, are lifetime appointees, said McGowan. So even though the harm of the Trump administration over these past four years has been significant, much of it can be reversed even if the damage can't be completely undone. But what has happened to the federal judiciary is obviously going to be something that has a legacy far beyond Jan. 20, 2021.\n\nStill, Christine Martucci, a 10-year U.S. Army veteran who served during the era of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, is optimistic about the country's future.\n\nI'm very hopeful, said Martucci, a singer/songwriter who lives in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey with her wife. I think as a country we're all going to come together and heal, and I'm very hopeful about the Biden administration and I'm hopeful for the LGBTQ community that things are still going to be moving forward in a positive direction.\n\nFollow reporters Alex Biese and Sammy Gibbons on Twitter: @ABieseAPP, @sammykgibbons\n\nMore:Supreme Court dismisses cases questioning Trump profits from private businesses\n\nInvestigations:A 2009 warning about right-wing extremism was engulfed by politics.

Valentine's Day just got extra Yummy — or maybe not.\n\nJustin Bieber's highly anticipated fifth studio album arrived Friday to mixed reviews for a grown-up Biebs.\n\nThe 25-year-old pop star has been mega-famous for nearly half of his life and his YouTube documentary series Justin Bieber: Seasons has shown the toll it has taken on him.\n\nHe spoke candidly first time about his past experiences with drug addiction, revealing that he began depending on marijuana heavily and later got involved with alcohol, lean (a mixture of codeine cough syrup, soda and hard candy), pills, MDMA, psychedelic mushrooms, everything. Bieber eventually decided he wanted to get sober when he felt like I was dying.\n\nNow, Bieber is embracing Changes and leaning on his marriage to the former Hailey Baldwin, who is the star of this comeback album, which is getting reviews that are neither enthusiastic nor critical.\n\nDemi Lovato shared the album on her Instagram and said she was proud of Bieber. So much 🔥🔥🔥 on this album, she captioned her post.\n\nBut The Independent thinks Bieber may be stuck in his adolescent ways, writing that he hasn't come all that far since the days of 'baby, baby, baby, oh.' \n\nHere are more excerpts from noteworthy reviews:\n\nUltimately, the album is at its most satisfying whenever Bieber places its creative catalyst, his marriage to Hailey, front and center. Sure, there are some puppy-love lyrics (You got the keys to my city! Bieber exclaims on Second Emotion), but the album's most compelling moments, from the yearning opener All Around Me to the crackling Quavo team-up Intentions, unabashedly detail the type of fullness that Bieber has found through his romantic partnership.\n\nThe singer makes yet another cocoon for himself on Changes, a low-key set of gentle electro-R&B jams that depicts his relationship with Baldwin as a refuge from the unkind world he's still not quite ready to reenter. Long on clean-toned guitars and drowsy soul grooves — and many, many words about the love of a good woman — it represents a distinct shift from the throbbing EDM of Bieber's last album, 2015's Purpose.\n\nThis isn't so much an album that would rile you to the point of turning it off. Rather, it washes over you, with its mostly average beats (Forever is a rare exception) and seemingly random cluster of guest features – Post Malone, Travis Scott, the comedian-rapper Lil Dicky ... For all Bieber's talk of change, this album, the way he talks about love – and the fact he feels compelled to make not one, but five jokes about male genitalia at the playback – suggest he hasn't come all that far since the days of 'baby, baby, baby, oh.'\n\n('Changes') deals largely in low-key, short, floaty paeans to Bieber's wife, Hailey Baldwin – it's a blessing that you're in my life, you make sure I'm comfortable, what are our kids going to be like?, etc – and to his faith. The title track is over almost before it begins, unexpectedly grinding to a halt with a spoken-word section: People change, circumstances change, but God always stays the same.\n\n...'Changes' does sound and feel like a polished and cohesive continuation of 'Journals' without all the experimental parts, like that song where he finds an alien in his backpack and it turns out to be Lil Wayne. There are plenty of good beats ('Intentions' ft. Quavo is one) and his voice is, as always, so delicate you could sell it in a French patisserie – but in the end 'Changes' lands like love itself: easy to appreciate, but only significant when it's happening to you.\n\nContributing Hannah Yasharoff\n\nJustin Bieber albums:The pop star 'Changes' through the years, from 'Baby' star to serious 'Intentions'\n\n'Justin Bieber is back':Singer enthralls fans with first 'SNL' appearance since 2013\n\nJustin Bieber gets candid in 'Seasons':He talks past drug addiction, getting sober: I 'felt like I was dying'

Nicolas Cage has never been more domesticated onscreen than as sweater-wearing Nathan Gardner – loving husband, father of two, Volvo driver and alpaca farmer – in Color Out of Space.\n\nThat doesn't last long.\n\nGardner's disposition drastically changes in the Richard Stanley-directed sci-fi horror film (in theaters Friday) after a meteorite lands in the front yard, leading to tragic consequences. Especially for those alpacas (come on, you saw that coming).\n\nEccentric Oscar winner Cage, 56, spoke to USA TODAY about his foray into horror, the prospects for alien visitation and what to do when meteorites land in your yard.\n\nYour ultimate 2020 horror film guide:From 'Halloween Kills' to the 'Quiet Place 2'\n\n'I was pretty upset': Nicolas Cage on split after 4-day marriage to Erika Koike\n\nQuestion: You start out so normal in Color Out of Space and then end up Shining crazy. What happened?\n\nNicolas Cage: We're combining a family drama with some pretty terrible stuff in the horror genre. Those are two genres I really like, and there's this collision between the two. The producers asked, 'What's your favorite genre?' I love ordinary people. They said, 'If you love ordinary people, have we got a script for you.' They sent me this family drama that transmogrifies into a nightmare horror film. And I loved it.\n\nQ: Does the concept of alien visitation fill you with hope or dread?\n\nCage: It's certainly worth noting that arguably the smartest man of the last century, Stephen Hawking, said we shouldn't make contact with alien life because it most likely will be dangerous. But for me, I think it would be very exciting. I remember once I met Carl Sagan at dinner a million years ago, I must have been 10. It was at my uncle's (Francis Ford Coppola) house, I think while he was directing The Godfather: Part II. I didn't know who Carl Sagan was, but I found out he was a scientist of the universe. And I asked him if he believed in life in outer space. He said, 'Absolutely, but I don't believe they'll come down here in flying saucers, But I think they're out there.' \n\nQ: Color Out of Space makes a clear case for proper, immediate meteorite disposal. Have you given this thought?\n\nCage: I was very lucky. At one time, I actually owned a slab of a Martian meteorite. It was actually quite famous because people thought there were microbes in it that may connote life and then that (theory) had been debunked. It's probably worth a fortune now. But, sadly, I think it was stolen from my house. There was a time when things were getting stolen from my properties, and that one went.\n\nBut I would be thrilled if a meteorite landed in my backyard. To know I have something from the Milky Way or somewhere in the universe is very exciting. It's not something that is entirely unlikely, either. I mean, there are meteorites constantly landing.\n\nQ: Camels can be difficult co-stars. How were the alpacas?\n\nCage: The alpacas were actually very sweet, gentle animals, not nasty at all, with beautiful eyes. They do have a kind of a comical appearance. It's hard not to laugh when you're looking at them, and the word alpaca is kind of funny. I enjoy the word alpaca. Sometimes camels get angry and they hiss sort of, and the llama can spit at you. But the alpaca was quite nice.\n\nQ: So you've had a tough camel experience?\n\nCage: I had to ride a camel in the movie Army of One. His name was Mickey Mouse, and he just was not a happy camel. He was just always kind of hissing and frustrated, and I felt bad for him. But they wanted me to ride the camel. I did. I'm friends with all animals, and I felt bad for Mickey Mouse. That's all.\n\nQ: In Color Out of Space, you lose it in your Volvo. I was worried you might have injured yourself hitting the ceiling of a solid car. Did you?\n\nCage: It's an opportunity that I look for in movies, ever since I saw Jack Nicholson in Five Easy Pieces and he kind of loses it and really freaks out. I put that in the movie I directed, Sonny, with James Franco. I told him, you're alone, and you've got to lose it, just throw your body into it. Whenever I get a chance to do that, I go for it.\n\nBut I didn't hurt myself. I try to be careful with the choreography of a performance. It's like a controlled state of being out of control. Anything goes in this moment, and let it rip.\n\nQ: Kesha made it clear on Twitter that she's a major fan and hit up the Color premiere in Los Angeles to meet you. What was that like?\n\nCage: Kesha is a great lady, and we had a lot of fun. I've always admired Kesha for the music, she's incredibly talented. I was happy to meet her, and she was interested in the movie. So it was a nice time.
Bart Jansen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPlane crash investigators have plenty of work in Alaska, which counts about 100 plane accidents per year and averages one each day during the summer.\n\nEach accident yields its own set of clues and delivers its own lesson that National Transportation Safety Board investigators can help pilots avoid future incidents. But dry accident reports about complex aerodynamics or mechanical flaws don't always make for the most scintillating reading.\n\nNow, through a new documentary television series, Alaska Aircrash Investigations, on The Smithsonian Channel, pilots — and the public — can come along for the ride and watch as investigators unravel both the mundane and mysterious crashes that plague the northernmost state.\n\nThe big test take-away from this is if we can get one pilot to think about something that is brought up on the show, a checklist item that gets them thinking — if it saves one person, all of this was worth it, NTSB investigator Shaun Williams, a former airline pilot and flight instructor, told USA TODAY.\n\nOne case investigated why an air taxi slammed into a mountain during a routine flight from the capital, Juneau. Another involved a recently repaired plane that crashed into a river during its first test flight. In one of the most emotional cases, a pilot flew over his daughter's wedding celebration and crashed into trees.\n\nResidents of the remote state more than twice as large as Texas depend on planes to get around with few roads between communities. But smaller, single-engine planes leave less room for error when something goes wrong. In most crashes, planes and their passengers survive with minor damage and injuries, but some crashes result in deaths.\n\nIn August 2010, U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens was among four passengers and the pilot who died in the crash of a de Havilland DHC-3T Otter. In October 1972, U.S. Rep. Hale Boggs, D-La., disappeared with three other passengers and a pilot aboard a Cessna 310C.\n\nWe look at what happened and try to make recommendations to keep it from happening again, Clint Johnson, chief of the NTSB regional office in Anchorage, told USA TODAY.\n\nAlaska's NTSB office with four investigators is one of a constellation of regional offices with 52 investigators nationwide. During Johnson's 18 years with NTSB, the number of accidents has dropped from 130 per year to about 100.\n\nAlaska's unforgiving terrain, weather sometimes lead to plane crashes\n\nGetting to crash sites quickly to take pictures and retrieve the plane is key to a successful investigation – a task that is not always easy in a state with challenging weather conditions, vast forests and mountains and often, few roads.\n\nAll of this information is pieces to the puzzle, said Johnson, who used to chat about cases with Stevens, whose Senate office was next door to the NTSB. Without that information, you can't solve the puzzle.\n\nWhen a Cessna 207 air taxi crashed into a mountain during the half-hour flight on July 17, 2015 from Juneau to Hoonah, killing two people and leaving three survivors, investigator Chris Shaver needed a lift from a Coast Guard helicopter to get him to the crash site just 18 miles from the capital. The site was so remote that the Coast Guard had to lower Shaver to the site in a metal basket.\n\nShaver ultimately had a helicopter lift the wreckage out of the forest so investigators could scrutinize it. Restarting the engine, reviewing navigational equipment and interviewing witnesses were each part of the effort to figure out what happened.\n\nWhen things go wrong, they can go wrong quickly, Johnson said.\n\nA crash into a river near Bethel carried broader implications because a company had made many similar improvements to all of the planes in its fleet. If the problem was mechanical, finding and fixing it could potentially save lives across the country and around the world, Johnson said.\n\nThat information could change a whole fleet or a whole series of airframes later on, Johnson told USA TODAY.\n\nInvestigator Millicent Hoidal discovered that the experienced pilot had flown just a few hundred feet above the ground during the Cessna 207's first flight after the repairs, rather than the customary 5,000 feet — a clue that led to solving the mystery on the show.\n\nHoidal had to wait a couple of months to retrieve the wreckage from the swollen river. But in the meantime, she got crucial information about the dead pilot that pointed where to look in the wreckage.\n\nIn the wedding case July 19, 2015, near Trapper Creek, the pilot had just officiated at his daughter's marriage. He flew over the crowd in a Cessna 206 to celebrate, but instead crashed in the trees and died.\n\nThe investigator, Brice Banning, an enthusiastic pilot himself who has survived a crash, said every accident carries a lesson to be learned.\n\nFor me, the motivation for this show is that I firmly believe if we can take pilots along with us on accidents and they can see what we do and apply it to their flying, we will reduce accidents in Alaska, Banning said.\n\nThe series will air Sundays at 9 p.m. Eastern starting March 13 on the Smithsonian Channel.
Lava Hot Springs\n\nThe housing market in southeastern Idaho is booming, with home prices soaring. Nowhere is this more true than in Lava Hot Springs, where houses are being bought up before they're even listed, sometimes for well above asking price. Second homes are a hot commodity here. There aren't many houses to begin with, and because of the town's layout, it's hard to build new ones. Plus, most of the people moving into town really only want vacation homes. One local real estate agent said 8 out of 10 people who ask her about buying a home in this tourist town are looking for second homes. And most of those people are also looking to rent out their homes when they're not around to recoup some of the costs of the mortgage.

Tonny Onyulo\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nITEN, Kenya — Rachael Chepsal clutched her Bible as she recalled her terrifying ordeal last month undergoing a ritual known as female genital mutilation without an anesthetic.\n\nI'm still feeling the pain, said the 14-year-old from Kaptul, a village in northwestern Kenya. The old woman used a sharp knife that was not sterilized. When I was cut the blood flew. I was terrified because it was not something I chose.\n\nRachael is among more than 2,000 girls from the ethnic Pokot community sent to the remote town of Iten by their parents to recuperate from the procedure, which has been illegal in Kenya since 2011.\n\nThe surgery, also known as female circumcision, involves cutting or removing all or part of the external female genitalia. The procedure usually is performed in August and December — when schools are closed.\n\nRachael's aunt made arrangements for traditional women circumcisers to abduct the seventh-grader from a local market last month. They bound her legs with ropes and forced her to have the operation.\n\nI was in great pain, she sobbed. I cried until I passed out. I bled profusely. I was thereafter treated with herbs, salt and water.\n\nFemale genital mutilation (FGM) is a global problem. The United Nations estimates more than 200 million girls and women around the world suffer the consequences of cutting procedure. The U.N. predicts that if current trends continue, 15 million additional girls ages 15 to 19 will be subjected to the mutilation by 2030.\n\nIn Kenya, 21% of women admit that they have undergone the painful procedure, according to Plan International, a humanitarian organization. The prevalence varies widely — 11% of women ages 15 to 19 are circumcised, whereas more than 40% of women ages 45 to 49 years are.\n\nFGM is illegal in Kenya, yet the law is not widely enforced, said Lindsey Pluimer, founder of With My Own Two Hands, a non-governmental organization that educates girls. These communities live in rural parts of the country, and (the law) is hard to enforce since they reject the modern aspects of Kenya society.\n\nJoseph Lorot, 70, a Pokot elder, said the cutting wouldn't stop because it's deep-rooted in the African culture.\n\nSome parents still believe that their uncircumcised girls will not be married, said Lorot, who hosts five girls recovering from the procedure in secret to avoid arrest or questioning by authorities. Men from these communities are making the situation worse by shunning these girls. Men who decide to marry uncircumcised women are rejected by the community and denied inheritance.\n\nTraditional women circumcisers, who are paid at least two goats or $30 to perform the ritual, maintained that it was the only rite of passage into womanhood and that the procedure also controls sexual arousal outside marriage.\n\nI don't think anybody can stop the practice, nodded Lucy Chenagat, a traditional circumciser. It's our culture. We cannot live without it. Some of the people who are telling us to stop the practice are already circumcised, and their daughters have been cut. Why shouldn't they allow others to be cut?\n\nExperts have warned residents of the dangers associated with the cutting ritual.\n\nThere are risks of infection and the possibility of bleeding to death, Pluimer explained. This procedure has been done on pregnant women, as well. Women who have had FGM are significantly more likely to experience difficulties, including high rates of cesarean sections during childbirth, and the babies are more likely to die as a result of the practice.\n\nMeanwhile, the ethnic Samburu community in northern Kenya is giving up its tradition of circumcising girls as a rite of passage. Local Samburu schools now offer alternatives, such as coming of age ceremonies. Samuel Leadismo, a Samburu warrior, is leading the fight against the practice of genital mutilation.\n\nI'm helping my community to ensure there are no cases of early marriages, female genital mutilation and also school dropouts, said Leadismo, the director of Pastoralist Child Foundation. FGM in the Samburu community has gone down. I will not allow the practice to continue in my community, because I know the effects.\n\nSome girls in the Maasai, Pokot and other ethnic groups hope that such open-mindedness soon comes to their communities.\n\nI don't want my sisters to go through the same experience, Rachael said, pointing out that the procedure can kill. I saw young girls crying in pain and no one could assist them. This practice should be stopped.\n\nMore:Genital cutting victims get backlash from Indian Muslim sect for condemning taboo ritual\n\nMore:Attorney: Michigan genital mutilation case stretches to other states
Tom Heneghan\n\nReligion News Service\n\nPARIS (RNS) — Two of the most interesting photo ops of France's current presidential election campaign took place last month 2,000 miles away in Lebanon — and they were all about religious optics.\n\nIn one, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen called off a scheduled meeting with Grand Mufti Abdellatif Deriane just outside his Beirut office when the Muslim cleric's staff insisted she don a headscarf before going in for the meeting.\n\nWith the video cameras rolling, she emphatically refused.\n\nLater that day, with the same media entourage in tow, she smiled and exchanged pleasantries with Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, leader of Lebanon's Maronite Christians and a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe National Front leader made her first trip abroad as presidential hopeful to burnish her weak foreign policy credentials, but the images flashed back to France sent a strong domestic message.\n\nHer supporters back home immediately got the memo — no to Muslims, yes to Christians — and loved it.\n\nPlaying the religion card so openly is unusual in France, where the official separation of church and state is normally taken so seriously that politicians rarely if ever mention in public whether they have a faith or not.\n\nBut this two-round election, on April 23 and May 7, is not taking place in normal times.\n\nAfter several deadly attacks by militant Islamists in recent years and sliding support for the main parties, politicians — especially from the right and far-right — are harking back to a secularized version of France's traditional Catholic identity as one of several ways to mobilize voters.\n\nRead more:\n\nBurkini-clad woman forced to disrobe on French beach\n\nTop French court overturns controversial burkini ban\n\n5 things to know about French burkini bans\n\nTheir occasional religious references, which are mostly aimed at reassuring worried swing voters who could provide a crucial margin of victory, stand out in a country where many — notably on the left — denounce any suggestion of religion in politics as unacceptable populist manipulation.\n\nCandidates know that religion as a shared culture speaks to many people in a world that no longer offers them a shining future, Philippe Portier, sociologist of religion, told the newspaper 20 Minutes. This talk can quickly resonate with a population that feels more and more culturally Christian, even while it doesn't always follow the rules.\n\nEleven candidates are competing in the election, and the top two from the first round will meet in the runoff two weeks later.\n\nOpinion polls have long put Le Pen out front in the first round with about 25% of the vote, but losing the runoff to whichever mainstream rival she faces. Centrist Emmanuel Macron, now polling about evenly with her, looks likely to be her opponent.\n\nWhen Le Pen took over the National Front from her father, Jean-Marie, in 2011, she set out to soften its reactionary image and woo mainstream voters by dropping its traditional anti-Semitism and stressing economic and social issues.\n\nA twice-divorced lawyer with three children and a sharp debater, she projected the image of a modern woman not afraid to take a stand.\n\nBut Francois Fillon showed in November that there were still lots of votes to win on the right when he swept the primary of the Republicans — the main conservative party — by openly appealing to traditional Catholics angered by the Socialist government's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2013.\n\nHis unexpected primary victory made him look like the probable next president. But his campaign soon became mired in a series of financial scandals that unsettled Catholics originally attracted by his Mr. Clean image.\n\nLe Pen's campaign shifted focus to go after those voters. In late February, she appeared at Mont Saint Michel, the famous medieval monastery off the Normandy coast, to deliver a stirring appeal to patriotic French voters to rally around her.\n\nMont Saint Michel, the eternal symbol of a France that draws strength and grandeur from its Christian roots, the National Front's secretary-general tweeted from her rally.\n\nIn interviews with Catholic publications, Le Pen explained she was Catholic but not practicing, like most French. I am a believer, she told the Christian news magazine La Vie. But I only go to church for weddings, funerals and baptisms.\n\nWhen asked how to square her opposition to immigration with the biblical teaching to welcome strangers, she insisted that those words pertained only to individual behavior and not political policies.\n\nReligion also figures in Le Pen's campaign in a negative way through her insistence on a vigorous application of laicite, the official church-state separation that enjoys wide support in majority public opinion, especially on the left wing.\n\nOn closer inspection, her version of laicite turns out to be aimed against Muslims because it would rule out headscarves, halal meat, Islamic holidays and any other religious-based demands the minority might make.\n\nFillon, the candidate who brought religion into the campaign last autumn, engineered his surprising primary win by wooing traditional Catholics who took to the streets in 2012-2013 — many for the first time — to demonstrate against same-sex marriage.\n\nAfter gay marriage was legalized, many of them formed a network to keep their movement going.\n\nFillon tapped it for his campaign by openly calling himself Christian and expressing a personal opposition to abortion, even though he did nothing to limit it when he was prime minister from 2007 to 2012.\n\nBecause of his financial scandals, Fillon has since slipped to third place behind Le Pen and Macron with 18% in the opinion polls.\n\nBut he commands continued loyalty from a hard core of supporters, including campaign organization help from his traditional Catholic network, and still hopes to overtake Macron to run against Le Pen in the second round.\n\nPerhaps fitting for a centrist, Macron performs a balancing act on religion, upholding France's policy of laicite but stressing it should not be pushed too far.\n\nDuring last summer's debate about the burkini, the full-body swimsuit for Muslim women, he defended both some mayors at Mediterranean resorts who banned it and a woman's freedom to decide what to wear.\n\nA child of an agnostic family, he revealed in December that he decided to be baptized a Catholic at 12 when he entered a Jesuit high school.\n\nDerided by his critics as a new messiah for the enthusiasm he generates among supporters, Macron doesn't talk much about faith publicly. But he likes to say that politics is mystical and he finds a transcendence in political activity.\n\nI think about the nature of my faith all the time, but I have enough humility that I don't pretend to speak with God, he told La Vie.
Robert Frank\n\nCNBC\n\nJeff Bezos' divorce could become the most expensive in history — exactly what he pays out will depend on the complexities of marital law and the value of Amazon.\n\nBezos announced in a tweet Wednesday that he and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, have decided to divorce. His tweet suggested that it will be an amicable parting, saying we remain a family and we remain cherished friends.\n\nAnd it's possible that any settlement and support he gives MacKenzie is negligible in the context of his wealth, which at the latest tally was around $137 billion.\n\nMore:Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and wife MacKenzie to divorce after 25 years of marriage\n\nBut Washington state, where the Bezos' live, is a community property state. That means that any wealth made during their marriage could be split equally between the two.\n\nSince Amazon was founded a year after the Bezos' were married, MacKenzie could argue that she is entitled to half of Bezos' entire Amazon-based fortune – $137 billion at latest count. That means she could get as much as $66 billion based on the value of the company today.\n\nTo fund a settlement that big, Bezos would have sell or pledge shares, which could dilute his ownership and control of the company. Bezos owns just under 80 million shares of Amazon, or just under 16 percent of the company, according to regulatory filings.\n\nBut divorce attorneys say that is highly likely MacKenzie would want the family fortune to continue to grow — and that is tied large part to Jeff Bezos' control of the company. So she would be unlikely to push for a settlement that would require him to sell shares that would dilute his control — and any reduction of his 15 percent stake in the company.\n\nThe issue will be how to value the assets with diminished control, said Jeffrey Fisher, a divorce attorney in West Palm Beach who has handled several billionaire divorces. There would be an argument by the attorneys that the Amazon stake is not worth as much without Bezos in control, so that would affect any settlement.\n\nThe most expensive U.S. divorce so far is believed to be Steve and Elaine Wynn in 2010, which was estimated at $1 billion. Oil tycoon Harold Hamm famously wrote a check for $974.8 million in 2012 for his divorce.

Knowing that you'll always have the friendship and that you can always go back to it is very important, she shared, and very powerful.\n\nIn addition to friendship, Ciara also encourages readers to have standards. You shouldn't feel like you have to give your body away to get someone to like you, the expectant mom said.\n\nCiara's baby bump gets red-carpet debut at the AMAs\n\nThough Ciara seems content with her decision to do the celibacy1,2 Step, she previously told Cosmopolitan.com, while dating Wilson in 2016, that sticking to her choice was a real struggle.\n\nI'm not gonna lie, she told the website.

CINCINNATI — A 27-year-old auto mechanic is stopped by police for driving, for a second time, without a driver's license.\n\nThe man, who is living in the United States illegally, is sentenced to 30 days in the Butler County, Ohio, jail and then turned over to federal immigration authorities, who begin the deportation process.\n\nHis lawyer appeals to allow him to stay.\n\nIt would appear to be a commonplace deportation case, except that the future of a 6-year-old boy hangs in the balance. The fact is, it's an example of the complicated, messy, no-win, real-life situations that U.S. immigration policy must untangle.\n\nThe mechanic, Yancarlos Mendez, is the sole supporter and one of two trained caregivers for the boy — a paraplegic U.S. citizen, severely injured in a car crash, who will need around-the-clock attention and treatment for the rest of his life.\n\nAt the heart of the immigration case is this child, Ricky Solis, born in November 2011 at University of Cincinnati Medical Center to an undocumented Guatemalan national.\n\nMore:Trump: DACA will be 'terrific' if Democrats back his own immigration plans\n\nMore:Washington state sues Motel 6 for giving guest info to immigration authorities\n\nRicky's personality sparkles despite his injuries, chronic pain and challenging long-term prognosis. He speaks softly and knows three languages — English, Spanish and Mam, one of many indigenous tongues of Guatemala — sometimes moving from one to another mid-sentence. He smiles and says one of his Christmas gifts was a toothbrush. At the end of an interview with his mother and the family's lawyer, Ricky gives this reporter a fist-bump.\n\nHe brings a clear plastic bag filled with miniature cars and fidget spinners to his daily three-hour session at Cincinnati Children's Liberty Campus.\n\nWhere do you spin those?\n\nEverywhere, he says.\n\nRicky was riding in a booster seat in the back seat of the car driven by his mother, Sandra Mendoza, 24, when they were hit broadside in February 2017 on Dixie Highway in Fairfield.\n\nMendoza, who'd been working in a pizza restaurant, sustained a broken arm and leg and other serious injuries.\n\nRicky's injuries were life-threatening. He was rushed Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. There, doctors treated him and began to catalog the long list of severe harm done to his little body. He fractured two vertebrae and suffered spinal cord bleeding, leading to permanent paralysis from the waist down. His bowel and bladder were ruptured and his colon torn. He had multiple facial bone fractures and traumatic brain injury. He is dependent on a tracheostomy that requires acute management. As a citizen, his medical expenses are covered by Medicaid.\n\nAt the time of the auto accident, the boy and his mother had been living for two years with Mendez, who has dual citizenship in Spain and the Dominican Republic but had moved to the United States to find higher-paying work.\n\nMendoza was brought to the United States illegally by her parents. She has twice been denied temporary permission to stay through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, otherwise known as DACA.\n\nThe couple had talked about marriage. Ricky's birth father left the picture years ago, after Mendoza reported the man for beating and emotionally abusing her. She has a pending application for a U Visa, which grants legal residency to victims of serious crime who cooperate with law enforcement. Mendez is Daddy to Ricky.\n\nWe were both working before the accident, Mendoza says during an interview Wednesday at Children's Liberty Campus. We needed no help from nobody.\n\nAs her injuries healed, she and Mendez moved into Ricky's hospital room, making it their home and being instructed by medical staff on how to care for Ricky. Before the boy could be discharged, though, the couple had to prove they could handle his complex needs during a supervised 24-hour surveillance period.\n\nMendoza had to quit her job to stay with Ricky. Mendez kept working as a mechanic, paying for food, utilities and the $565 monthly rent on their apartment in Springdale, Ohio.\n\nMendoza worried Mendez would leave them because of Ricky's life-altering injuries. Instead, he proposed marriage.\n\nThe day Ricky got hurt, I wanted to die, she says. Yancarlos was so strong. He loves me. He loves Ricky like he's his own child.\n\nAttorney Nazly Mamedova has applied for a stay of deportation to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, giving the reason as, Medical condition of the child. Ricky, who is paraplegic and (in) need of special care 24/7, which only Yancarlos and mother can provide, because they are trained specially by Children's Hospital.\n\nOur plea is for ICE to exercise favorable discretion and allow Yancarlos to come home, Mamedova says.\n\nThe application cost $155, paid on her behalf to the Columbus, Ohio, ICE office by the Central Ohio Worker Center, an immigrant and worker rights non-profit.\n\nThe Enquirer contacted ICE officials in Detroit on Wednesday about the case. On Thursday morning, a federal immigration caseworker contacted Mamedova to request more information on the case, asking specifically if Mendez is Ricky's biological father.\n\nThe filing included character references from the child care center Ricky attended before the car crash. Owner Amber Brown of Imagination Creation Childcare in Forest Park wrote that Mendez is mature beyond his years and never left this child's side.\n\nThe ministers of the church the family attends in Lincoln Heights, Life Ministry Center, wrote that the couple is of good faith, loving, helpful, and hardworking.\n\nThe threshold for federal immigration officials to grant the suspension of deportation is if it would result in extreme hardship to you or your United States citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse, parent, or unmarried child under 21 years of age.\n\nIn the meantime, as Ricky and his mother wait to see what ICE will decide, they take life one hour at a time.\n\nRicky, who weighs 58 pounds, has to be moved from his wheelchair by his 110-pound mother. Mendez used to handle these physical challenges, including giving Ricky his shower.\n\nHe is so heavy and the bathtub so slippery that I am afraid I will drop him, Mendoza says.\n\nRicky is in kindergarten at Sharonville Elementary School in the Princeton City School District. He likes school, he says. Despite the brain injury and educational challenges spelled out by the hospital, he is learning, his mother says.\n\nThe man he knows as Daddy is always on his mind.\n\nRicky asks where Daddy is, Mendoza says. I tell him, 'He will be home soon.'\n\nRicky cried in the courtroom Nov. 29 guards when took Mendez to the Butler County Jail for his 30-day sentence for driving without a license. Under the direction of Butler County's anti-immigration hard-line sheriff, Richard Jones, ICE was alerted, and federal officers took possession of Mendez at the end of his county sentence. He switched from the jail's black prisoner uniform to a yellow-and-white jumpsuit issued by ICE and moved to a jail several hours away, north of Columbus.\n\nMeanwhile, Mendoza waits. She prays.\n\nMendoza takes a call from a transportation service that will pick them up at Children's for the ride back to Springdale. Ricky looks out the large glass window into the clear winter sky. He frequently rests his chin in the palm of his hand, making sure to avoid his white tracheal tube. He rubs the corners of his mouth, like an adult, with thumb and index finger of the same hand.\n\nMendoza hangs up her phone and starts to weep.\n\nWe know we were breaking the law, but we were just trying to live and take care of ourselves, she says. Yancarlos has never done anything else bad. He is a good man. We want him to come home.\n\nShe looks at Ricky, who wears a blue sweatsuit and matching stocking cap.\n\nI pray every day, she says in a voice barely above a whisper. I hope I will see him walking. I trust God. They've been telling me he has no chance. But I know I am going to see him walk. He wasn't born like this. He was born strong.\n\nRicky turns back to his mother when he hears her cry. He speaks to her in Mam. He wants her to tell the reporter that he has a Christmas gift at home for his dad.\n\nCan you tell us what it is?\n\nIt's a surprise, Ricky says.\n\nFollow Mark Curnutte on Twitter: @MarkCurnutte
Erin Jensen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe honeymoon is certainly over!\n\nEpisode 6 of Girls, The Panic in Central Park, is completely devoted to the most disgruntled newlywed we know, Marnie Michaels. Wedding bliss isn't all it's cracked up to be for Marnie and her hubby. At the beginning of the show, the two were fighting again--surprise, surprise. Marnie accused Desi of playing aggressive guitar at her, and the overdramatic Desi called his Mrs. cruel. Marnie left the apartment to get some space, which we know she has none of in her studio apartment.\n\nWhile walking on the street, Marnie ran into a blast from season 1 and season 2. It was the person that she wanted to have little brown babies with and watch die, Charlie Dattolo. Yes, she suddenly found herself face to face with the man who left her when they were supposed to grill pizzas.\n\nCharlie informed Marnie, that running an app company was not the life for him, and due to legal issues, he basically walked away with no money. He invited Marnie to accompany him to a party, and she said no for obvious reasons--(if they're not obvious, it's because he said she was spoiled and that he never loved her. Way harsh!) But when Charlie explained that he was going through a tough time because his dad actually killed himself, Marnie agreed to go to the event. Charlie said that she needed a dress, so they went to a boutique. While Charlie was in the bathroom, Marnie did some thinking out loud about her sitch with the store's saleswoman.\n\nNo, the sales associate did not care. When Charlie came back from the bathroom, he hurriedly got Marnie's stuff out of the changing room and threw money on the counter without even hearing the price.\n\nWhile at the party, Charlie sold some drugs to an older gentleman who later propositioned Marnie to join him and his fiancée. Marnie conned the man into paying $600 upfront for services that would never be rendered.\n\nWith the cash monies, she and Charlie dined on pizza, pasta, and ice cream, and then danced. They took an after dinner walk in the park, where Marnie told her ex that half of her album was about him.\n\nThe former flames snuck onto a dock, and Charlie convinced Marnie to take a boat ride. With Charlie at the oars, we had The Notebook and The Little Mermaid vibes, and Charlie certainly kissed the girl. Which cause the two fall overboard.\n\nOn the way back to Charlie's apartment, the once upon a time couple got mugged at gunpoint, and Marnie had to hand over her purse along with her wedding and engagement rings.\n\nOnce they had made it safely to Charlie's apartment, Marnie looked longingly at Charlie and asked, What am I gonna do about you?\n\nHe suggested that they leave town. What if the last few years were just a bad dream, and we ran away?\n\nThey hooked up, and then Marnie took a shower in the bathroom down the hall. When she returned, Charlie was asleep, and she began tidying his apartment. While picking up his jeans, she found a needle in his pocket.\n\nHe told Marnie that he was a diabetic, and she didn't say anything but left his apartment for her own. When Marnie returned home, Desi was waiting for her on the stairs, because of course he was.\n\nMrs. Harperin broke the news that she wanted to end their marriage.\n\nI knew I shouldn't have married you. I just didn't want to give up on yet another dream, she said. And then continued, I just don't know who I am right now. I'm like a ghost of myself. I don't know what I'm doing here or anywhere else, but I don't want to be married to you.\n\nAnd Desi seemed okay with it at first, but then he said something that we never expected. Probably you're gonna get murdered, he said. I mean that is how little of a sense of the world that you have. You're just, you're gonna get murdered.\n\nUm, no thanks, Desi. We were not here for that, and neither was Marnie. She grabbed some things from their apartment and then headed to Hannah's and got in bed with her and Fran. It was friendship at its finest.\n\nWe are so glad that Marnie is finally free of that emotionally unstable hubby of hers. So what if she ends up alone and like Cher (whatever that means)? At least she gets to be herself, and to find herself again. Even if she might be an unpopular character, we can honestly say that we've missed the authentic Marnie very much.\n\nFollow along with her journey Sunday at 10 p.m. ET on HBO.
Matt Damsker\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nIf there's an irony to the fact that February, Black History Month, also contains Presidents' Day, Erica Armstrong Dunbar's new book brings that irony into sharp relief.\n\nNever Caught: The Washingtons' Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge (37Ink/Atria, 253 pp., **** out of four stars) is a chronicle that throws considerable shade on America's Founding Fathers for their slaveholding hypocrisy.\n\nIn this case, we learn how our first president, George Washington, skirted Philadelphia's anti-slavery laws during the five years he and his wife, Martha, resided there, while the nation's eventual capitol was being built — by slave labor, largely — along the Potomac River. As Dunbar, a professor of Black American history at the University of Delaware, recounts, Washington brazenly cycled his slaves in and out of his Virginia home, Mount Vernon, to avoid Philadelphia's time limit on slaveholding.\n\nBut this legal issue is hardly the book's subject. Instead, the human drama of one particular slave, Ona Judge, a Mount Vernon-born mulatto woman who became Martha Washington's prized servant, takes center stage. For in her life away from the Southern locus of slavery, Ona Judge breathed the freer air of the Northern states, and in 1796 she famously stole away from the Washingtons, dying free at last in New Hampshire, outliving her owners by nearly a half century.\n\nThe Ona Judge saga is a well-known matter of human bondage and presidential history, but Dunbar's book is touted as the first full-length account of Judge's life. Even for those who know the basics, Never Caught is a crisp and compulsively readable feat of research and storytelling.\n\nIndeed, Ona Judge suffered as much in freedom as in slavery, it seems, preferring a shadowed, secret life to the relative privilege of her slave stature. For her pains, George Washington never ceased in his efforts to recapture her, through hired minions and with an obsessiveness that reminds one of Javert, the iconic pursuer of Les Miserables.\n\nBelieving at one point that Judge, who would become Ona Staines through marriage, was pregnant, Washington could only have thought that his legal property had increased by the sum and value of an unborn slave. Strategic as ever, he encouraged a customs collector named Whipple to spirit her quietly to Virginia rather than to Philadelphia, lest the last few months of Washington's presidency endure bad publicity in the North.\n\nBut Whipple, and others, failed in their efforts to persuade their fugitive quarry to leave New Hampshire, where a free black community and the strong stirrings of abolition protected her to a fair degree. A final attempt to recapture her by force failed when the Staineses slipped away, forewarned.\n\nAnd so Ona Judge Staines lived free, though in the sort of poverty that most ex-slaves could rarely overcome. She would grieve the deaths of two daughters, and sorrow over the enslaved family members she had left behind. Nevertheless, she persisted.
Robert Powell\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ: I was married to my first husband for 23 years and have since remarried to a man seven years older than me. I am 80 and getting Social Security from my first marriage. My current husband did not pay into Social Security; he is a retired fireman. If my former husband predeceases me, will I be able to get a widow benefit on my first husband's earnings record? — Janet Lerouzes, Summerland Key, Fla.\n\nA: Yes, your spousal Social Security benefits you currently receive will convert to survivor benefits at the time of your ex-husband's death, according to David Cechanowicz, director of education at Social Security Timing.\n\nThere are several requirements that have to be met for benefits to continue, the first one being that the marriage had to have lasted 10 years. The second, dealing with remarriage, does not come into effect if you remarry after the age of 60.\n\nWe can't tell you with any degree of certainty the amount of benefit that you will receive as a widow, or survivor, because that benefit is subject to adjustment if your ex-spouse claimed benefits as early as possible, says Cechanowicz. Generally, survivor benefits for a widow or widower are dependent on two factors, the first being the age when the spouse or ex-spouse claimed benefits, and the second is the age at which the survivor claims benefits.\n\nSocial Security isn't broke: Sorting myths from truths\n\nOf note, survivor benefits reach their maximum benefit when the survivor reaches his or her full retirement age. In your case, that would have been age 65, says Cechanowicz. If your ex-spouse claimed as early as possible, then the survivor's benefit will be adjusted up to a 'floor' or minimum survivor's benefit.\n\nAlso note: Even if you were the beneficiary of your current husband's retirement benefits from what is known as non-covered employment, you would have been able to collect both your ex-spouse's survivor benefits and your current husband's retirement benefits, says Cechanowicz.\n\nAnd since you are already receiving ex-spousal benefits from the Social Security Administration, the conversion to survivor benefits should be rather smooth, he says.\n\nRead Survivors Planner: Survivors Benefits For Your Widow Or Widower on the SSA's website.\n\n3 huge Social Security mistakes you should avoid
Robert Powell\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ: I am a 65 and currently on Social Security disability insurance (SSDI). I was approved for SSDI in 2012, retroactive to 2003. I receive around $2,096 a month after Part B is deducted. Although I spend several months a year at my Florida residence during the winter, I currently reside in France with my partner, who is 67, and we are considering marriage, a same-sex union. I am a U.S. citizen but hold a French\n\nresidency card. My partner is a French citizen, and has no green card, no U.S. Social Security number nor any other residency permit for the U.S. He has never worked in the U.S., never earned U.S. Social Security credits and all his retirement earnings are from France.\n\nIf we get married, will he be entitled to spouse's benefits? If yes, what amount would he receive while I am alive, and if I die, would that amount increase to my full entitlement? And lastly, do you know if he would have pay taxes on that income? If yes, would he also have to declare his French retirement income? – Mark Andrews, France\n\nA: If you get married in a place that recognizes same-sex marriage, then your partner will be eligible for Social Security spousal benefits once the one-year duration of marriage requirement has been met, says Kurt Czarnowski, a principal with Czarnowski Consulting.\n\nAs a spouse, (your) partner will be eligible for a benefit equal to 50% of (your) gross monthly amount. If (you) were to pass away, then the payment amount would jump up to 100% of what (you were) collecting, says Czarnowski.\n\nOf course, complicating all of this is your future spouse's French pension. The receipt of a public pension based on work that was not covered under Social Security triggers the application of the windfall elimination provision (WEP), the government pension offset (GPO) or both, says Czarnowski. Because (your) future spouse has no Social Security earnings, WEP does not apply. However, GPO does apply, and the Social Security Administration will be required to reduce any spousal or survivor benefit due him by 2/3 of the amount of his pension. Thus, while he may meet the eligibility requirements after you have been married for a year, he may not end up actually receiving anything, depending on the amount of his French pension.\n\nMORE:\n\nQ&A: Does Social Security survivor benefit still apply if spouse never worked?\n\nQ&A: Social Security withdraws must start at 70-ish and they can be taxed - to a point\n\nAs for the tax question, if GPO prevents him from collecting anything, then the tax issue is obviously moot, says Czarnowski.\n\nFor more, read Your Payments While You are Outside the United States\n\nQ: Is it possible to get two separate payments from Social Security at the same time if you have two qualifying reasons, such as the correct number of work credits and a disability that prevents you from working again? – Verden Allen, California\n\nA: In some cases, it is possible to receive two different benefits simultaneously, says Mike Piper, author of Social Security Made Simple. It is not, however, possible to receive a retirement benefit and a disability benefit simultaneously, he says.\n\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

Love, marriage and shiplap with 'Fixer Upper'\n\nChip and Joanna Gaines aren't the first twosome to renovate homes on HGTV, but the couple's downhome sensibilities and talent are attracting a growing fan-base who dream of landing their own fixer upper, or just want to befriend the couple.
Richard Wolf\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Lawyers for a transgender boy and the Virginia school district that blocked him from using the boys' bathroom urged the Supreme Court on Wednesday to decide the case, despite a sudden change in the federal government's position on the issue.\n\nWhile lawyers for 17-year-old Gavin Grimm said the case should be argued later this month as scheduled, those representing the Gloucester County School Board suggested a delay to get the Trump administration's full views. That could provide time for the Senate to confirm Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, who might be the swing vote.\n\nThe high court asked both sides to weigh in after the new administration announced last week that it was withdrawing Obama-era guidelines instructing school districts to let transgender students use bathrooms corresponding to their chosen gender. That guidance provided the basis for a federal appeals court's ruling last year in Grimm's favor.\n\nBut lawyers for both sides said the justices still should hear and decide the second question in the case: whether a 1972 prohibition against sex discrimination in education requires that students can use sex-separated facilities based on their gender identity.\n\nThe court could decide in the coming days whether to go forward with its March 28 oral argument; postpone it and request the Trump administration's views, or send the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. Remanding the case could give Grimm at least a temporary victory — or the justices could vacate the lower court's decision and leave the school board's policy in place.\n\nRead more:\n\nSupreme Court could pull plug on transgender bathroom case\n\nTransgender student Gavin Grimm won't rest in his restroom quest\n\nThe school board believes the better course is for the court to proceed with argument and a decision on the merits, after receiving the current views of the United States, Kyle Duncan, the board's lawyer, wrote. Delaying action, he said, could lead to enormous litigation costs as well as needless and divisive political controversy.\n\nJoshua Block, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing Grimm, said the court should hear the case without delay. Delaying resolution would provide no benefit to the court and would needlessly prolong harm to transgender students across the country awaiting this court's decision, he wrote.\n\nMissing from both letters was Gorsuch's pending nomination. With hearings slated to begin March 20, the Senate could confirm the 49-year-old federal appeals court judge in time to hear April's oral arguments, and certainly those lined up for the 2017 term beginning in October.\n\nWithout a ninth justice, the court remains in danger of deadlocking 4-4 on the controversial case. Its decisions in favor of same-sex marriage in 2013 and 2015 both were decided by 5-4 votes when Justice Anthony Kennedy sided with the court's liberal justices. Kennedy's position on Grimm's case is not clear.

Trevor Lawrence grinned as his Pro Day workout came to a close.\n\nYeah, yeah, I saw him, Lawrence told ESPN when asked about Jaguars coach Urban Meyer hovering. Saw a lot of the guys coming through. Just waved at him real quick. Obviously can't really communicate out here.\n\nEven within the confines of nonverbal communication, the message was clear.\n\nJacksonville, who hired Meyer out of retirement last month, owns the No. 1 overall selection of the 2021 NFL Draft. Lawrence, a 2020 Heisman finalist who led Clemson to the 2018 national championship as a freshman, is widely expected to land in Jacksonville under Meyer's tutelage. The marriage is natural, sending a top prospect to the neediest team and pairing a three-time college football champion coach with a college-champion quarterback who can maximize his system.\n\nNFL 2021: Aikman says Cowboys aren't in rebuild mode\n\nOFFSEASON: Key dates between now and training camp\n\nSo why bother staging a Pro Day in the first place? And why now?\n\nJust to show I'm no different than anyone else, Lawrence said. I still want to do the process the right way.\n\nIn three seasons at Clemson, Lawrence completed 66.6% of passes for 10,098 passing yards, 90 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. He was scheduled to join Clemson's Pro Day on March 11 – the NFL scouting combine was cancelled this year due to COVID-19 restrictions – but is instead readying for surgery on his left, non-throwing shoulder. Lawrence projected he could throw six to eight weeks after surgery and receive full clearance within four to six months.\n\nWith the 2021 NFL season under seven months from kickoff, time was of the essence. So Lawrence moved up his Pro Day workout a month, prepared with quarterbacks coach Jordan Palmer in California for about a week, then headed back to South Carolina to rehearse timing and routes with receivers, including Clemson's Cornell Powell.\n\nLawrence donned purple dry-fit Clemson T-shirt, an orange nameplate spanning his shoulder blades with his number 16 ironed on beneath it. A script of dozens of throws followed, ranging from slants to deep throws, incorporating dropbacks and pressure in his face. Lawrence cycled through a would-be busted play on a curl route, shaking loose and extending the play to demonstrate his ability to throw on the run down the field. Clemson coach Dabo Swinney watched on from mere feet away. So did Meyer, in animated conversation with Swinney. Lawrence wasn't fazed.\n\nIt was a good day, considering kind of short notice, Lawrence said. I was pretty pleased with it. Like anything, you've got some throws you wish you could go back and hit a little bit better. But as a whole, I think it was good day.\n\nNext comes Lawrence's surgery to repair his left labrum, per ESPN, then a rehab period during which Lawrence said he'll grind physically to recover as efficiently as possible and mentally to continue deepening his understanding of the game. Lawrence noted his footwork, comfort in the pocket and pocket presence as areas he wants to improve physically. Mentally, he anticipates more nuanced gameday responsibilities at the professional level, including a need to advance his defensive recognition.\n\nJust really excited for that challenge. I love learning, Lawrence said. That's one of my favorite parts of the game. It's such a fun thing to learn a new system and piece everything together so I'm excited about that.\n\nHe'll take rehabilitation in stride with the poise and even keel he exemplified in three years at Clemson, from his freshman year title run through his hastily-assembled Pro Day. Sure, he hoped his Friday workout demonstrated his athletic acumen for the collection of coaching, general managers and scouting representatives who traveled Friday to Clemson. But even more so, his decision to throw and measure despite the surgery and his strong draft stock aimed to show his flexibility.\n\nLife happens sometimes, Lawrence said. So just having to adjust and showing I'm able to adjust and adapt and still come out here and throw and give teams a chance to see me.\n\nThat was important to me.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter, @JoriEpstein
Harriet Baskas, special to USA TODAY\n\nEver wish you could order delivery at the gate? Or, perhaps, even from your seat during an airline layover? You may soon have that option thanks to a new set of start-ups seeking to cater to that demand.\n\nSan Diego International has become the second airport in the country to benefit from an app-powered service that lets passengers and employees in the terminals order food, drink or merchandise for sale anywhere in the airport and have it delivered to them wherever they are in the airport.\n\nBilling itself as Your in-airport personal shopper, At Your Gate did a soft launch of its service at the end of January with the company's three founders joining two employees in making the initial in-airport deliveries to flight attendants, airline employees working gates and ticket counters, ramp break rooms and to a few passengers who caught wind of the program.\n\nMORE AIRPORT NEWS: Las Vegas airport to get a pop-up marriage license bureau\n\nUSA TODAY TRAVEL: The best new airport amenities of 2017 (story continues below)\n\nAirport employees figured out the benefits of the app right away, said PJ Mastracchio, At Your Gate founder and CEO, who made at least one early delivery himself by skateboard. On Super Bowl Sunday we got an order to deliver to two donut bars to a United Airlines baggage worker timed to his break and another request for a dozen orders of chips, salsa and other menu items for a Super Bowl party in the Virgin America break room.\n\nMastracchio said many flight crews with short turn-around times have already ordered food delivered to them at the gate. More broadly, at least one airline has set up an account with At Your Gate so they can order food for passengers in the first-class cabin in case the ground catering service doesn't have time to restock a departing flight.\n\nWe're not sure yet how that would work, said Mastracchio. They may just pass the app around and let passengers place their orders.\n\n\n\nAnother possible application for the app: delivering food to through passengers on Southwest Airlines flights who can't get off the plane to buy a snack. Southwest doesn't cater flights and there are passengers flying from, say Las Vegas to Los Angeles who have to stop in San Diego on the way, said Mastracchio. We're talking with Southwest about maybe being able to deliver food to the plane or to the gate agent who will bring the orders down.\n\nMORE AIRPORT NEWS: SFO first airport OK'd to send emergency alerts to any cellphone on site\n\nAt Your Gate is currently charging airport and airline employees a $2.99 delivery charge. Passengers in the airport will pay a $6.99 delivery charge when the service officially opens to them next month. That's equal to the fees off-airport delivery services charge, says Mastracchio. It's also what At Your Gate's research has determined passengers, especially those with expense accounts who need to be productive at the airport, will be comfortable paying.\n\nAcross the country: Airport Sherpa\n\nAt Your Gate will expand to other airports soon, but for now there's another gate-delivery service, Airport Sherpa.\n\nAirport Sherpa has been operating at Baltimore/Washington International Airport since last July. According to a company spokesperson, they've delivered meals to thousands of passengers inside the terminal and filled hundreds of orders from American Airlines via its Delayed Meals Program, which provides snacks and meals to passengers whose flights are delayed more than 2.5 hours.\n\nAirport Sherpa says it will be serving perhaps 10 other airports by the end of 2018.\n\nHarriet Baskas is a Seattle-based airports and aviation writer and USA TODAY Travel's At the Airport columnist.

Bill Keveney\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES – There's no end in sight for NCIS, but Michael Weatherly has decided it's time for him – and his Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo — to dismount the CBS ratings juggernaut.\n\nAfter 13 seasons and more than 300 episodes — hall-of-fame longevity for a TV series — Weatherly has just two shows remaining on TV's top-rated drama (Tuesday, 8 p.m. ET/PT), which has been renewed through May 2018.\n\nNot surprisingly, the biggest thing he'll miss is the people: a cast and crew of more than 200, many of whom go back to JAG, a former NBC (and then CBS) drama, also created by Donald Bellisario, that spawned NCIS. Weatherly and three other cast members — Mark Harmon (team leader Leroy Jethro Gibbs), Pauley Perrette (forensic specialist Abby Sciuto) and David McCallum (medical examiner Donald Ducky Mallard) — go back to the two 2003 JAG episodes that planted the seeds of NCIS.\n\nOne of the special alchemical aspects of the show is that chemistry that we all have. You never quite know when you put a cast together how it's going to work, if that soufflé will rise. And we did, Weatherly says.\n\nAs TV's most-watched drama for the past seven years (it's averaging more than 20 million viewers, up 9% compared with last season), the actors and their characters have become household names, so much so that my mom calls me Tony now, Weatherly says.\n\nThe 47-year-old New York native, married with two young children (and an older son from a previous marriage), doesn't take for granted the reach of NCIS, which makes up in global audience numbers and fan devotion what it lacks in critical buzz. To be dismissive of NCIS because you think (only) Republicans or people in the flyover states watch it is to fundamentally misunderstand the show, he says. Any thinking person should pay attention to why a band sells 100 million albums or a TV show is No. 1 in the world.\n\nDespite such rare job security, Weatherly has been thinking for some time that it made sense for Tony — and him — to depart. That feeling became stronger after 2013's departure of Cote de Pablo, who played colleague and former Mossad agent Ziva David. Her romantic chemistry with Tony captivated fans, even if it never became a full-on relationship.\n\nAfter de Pablo's Ziva left, with an emotional goodbye to Tony, I felt that the character had come to a cul-de-sac development-wise, and I was searching to see if there was some other way to do it, Weatherly says. While other characters grew and expanded, it became clear, not just to me, that DiNozzo had maybe (reached) the point where he needed to go on the next adventure.\n\nBefore DiNozzo leaves, however, expect the season's last two episodes to be a very special goodbye for a character who dubbed himself a very special agent.\n\nExecutive producer Gary Glasberg says he's lucky to have had months to plan for DiNozzo's departure, which is intertwined with a continuing story line about an escaped British prisoner on the hunt for NCIS agents.\n\nIt's a big deal to lose this character, he says. Michael is a warm, generous person who has been a huge part of our lives. We want to give fans the most memorable episode we can. All the characters in this finale have some really wonderful moments with Tony.\n\nGlasberg promises Tony-related guest stars, including Robert Wagner as Anthony DiNozzo Sr., will appear in the May 17 episode. Wagner and Weatherly, who played Wagner in the 2004 TV movie The Mystery of Natalie Wood, became friends on the show.\n\nIt was his idea to have me play his father on NCIS. I'm very grateful for that, Wagner says. We spend a lot of time offstage together. We are very much alike. It's not difficult for me to love him and be his father.\n\nDon't expect a new Ziva sighting, however: De Pablo told a Massachusetts college audience last month that she would not be returning for DiNozzo's sendoff. Glasberg, interviewed before de Pablo's comments, won't confirm her absence but says, I'll certainly say that Tony's relationship with Ziva absolutely has an impact on his reason to leave.\n\nIn teasing the finale, Weatherly acknowledges his and Tony's shared interest in film history, saying he used two movie characters — Jack Nicholson's Bobby Dupea from 1970's Five Easy Pieces and Peter O'Toole's King Henry II in 1964's Becket — as inspiration for his performance.\n\nTony is more alive in this episode in a human way than I've seen him in quite some time. I was very excited every day to do things that DiNozzo had never done before, and he had done a lot, he says.\n\nNCIS already has begun evolving for a post-DiNozzo era, as seen in the growing camaraderie between newer agent Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham) and Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), who's in line to become senior agent under Gibbs years after being hazed as an NCIS rookie by Tony.\n\nOver the years, DiNozzo and McGee's brotherly scuffling became a core relationship on NCIS, revealing the characters' personalities while highlighting the show's trademark humorous banter.\n\nTony and McGee have always counted on each other. The strong suits of McGee are the weak suits of Tony, and vice versa, Murray says. Tony is a big part of what made McGee who he is now. It's kind of the way it was meant to be.\n\nThe season's final two episodes, airing May 10 and 17, introduce two new characters, FBI agent Tess Monroe (Sarah Clarke) and British MI-6 officer Clayton Reeves (Duane Henry), both potential series regulars.\n\nViewers may not have to go into full Weatherly withdrawal: The actor shot a drama pilot, Bull, inspired by Phil McGraw's pre-Dr. Phil work as a trial consultant, advising lawyers about jury selection and witness preparation. CBS will announce the new show's fate as early as this week.\n\nTrial analytics is how Dr. Phil met Oprah, Weatherly says. His deep insight into how jury trials operate was eye-opening.\n\nBut NCIS fans will have to adjust to the absence of one of the show's central characters. Perrette describes the emotions of her final scene with Weatherly.\n\nI was bawling my eyes out the entire time. The camera guys and lighting guys were crying. Everyone was crying. It was really intense. The part of the scene where I'm acting is the part when I'm not crying, because that's hard, says Perrette, who lived in the same apartment complex as Weatherly for a couple of NCIS seasons. Tony and Abby are like brother and sister. Their relationship mirrors (our) relationship offscreen, You have to think how much of our lives we've spent together on and offscreen.\n\nWeatherly says there were no tears after his final day of shooting, because he had given himself time to process the departure. He also had said individual goodbyes, presenting each member of the cast and crew a Swiss Army knife inscribed NCIS: BIG KISS, reflecting the message he writes on autographed pictures.\n\nI felt like I completed that circle, he says. When I got into my car, it was just, 'That's done.' I had no anxiety or any regrets.
The College Republicans are worried – partially about their Democratic peers on campus but also about other young people who call themselves Republican.\n\nThe more moderate among them say they fear far-right students' antics will corrupt the party. Their counterparts argue the party is too stodgy to capture the attention of undecided voters. In California and Washington, the groups fractured over who should lead them.\n\nUnderlying the college conservatives' fears: that the Republican Party as a whole is in trouble.\n\nFor young Republicans, embracing a conservative identity while enrolled in college is a decision to be an outsider. Many of them say they feel ostracized on their campus for their beliefs, which fosters an us vs. them mentality.\n\nYoung voters in 2020:'I think they will decide the race'\n\nThat might partially explain why they host events such as affirmative action bake sales, in which they sell treats at different prices based on a person's race. These types of events are meant to rile college communities, and they often succeed. Students both broadcast their views against affirmative action and generate as much attention as they can.\n\nAt the University of Washington last May, a group calling itself College Republicans hosted such a bake sale. The campus conservatives found themselves the subject of national headlines, and the statewide organization of College Republicans denounced what the group did. The state organization instead recognized a different group – the Husky College Republicans. The original group declined to speak to USA TODAY unless members were offered anonymity. Members said they feared for their safety.\n\nJack Pickett, the western vice chairman at the College Republican National Committee, was part of the College Republicans at the University of Washington and also led the statewide group. He was involved in the decision to start over.\n\nThe chapter, he said, crossed the line a couple of times, and the bake sale was the final straw. Pickett recalled he was not happy when leaders brought Milo Yiannopoulos, a far-right speaker, to campus in 2017. Outside that event, a man protesting was shot by someone who had come to see Yiannopoulos.\n\nPickett considers himself a conservative but said he didn't initially support Donald Trump's campaign for president. (He now does.) He threw his support behind businesswoman and politician Carly Fiorina in 2016.\n\nHe wasn't alone:Trump's 2016 candidacy produced unusual divide in College Republican clubs\n\nHis critics have seized upon what he described as a more traditional type of conservatism, calling him a Republican in Name Only. People have attacked him online for his weight and claim he doesn't deserve his position. The old group of college leaders he helped to oust still meets.\n\nBattling over the identity of a college group is vexing, Pickett said. It distracts from a larger, perhaps more difficult goal: recruiting new conservatives.\n\nIt's very difficult to do that when you have a group who's misusing your name and working almost intentionally, it often seems, to drive people away with their antics, Pickett said. That's not something that anyone, even right-leaning students, want to be a part of.\n\nThe Republican National Committee doesn't appear worried about potential divisions in its youth movement. The party is running an effort to register voters called Make Campus Great Again.\n\nWhen it comes to issues college students care about, like securing a job after graduation, the choice is clear: a booming economy under President Trump or a government takeover of every aspect of their lives under Democrat leadership, RNC spokeswoman Mandi Merritt said in an email.\n\nCollege Republicans: 'Inflammatory' or conservative?\n\nThe split between conservative policy wonks and energized activists is one that Amy Binder, a sociologist at the University of California-San Diego, and Jeffrey Kidder, a sociologist at Northern Illinois University, have studied for years. They're writing a book on student activism.\n\nThey found individual students straddle those lines. They join the traditional College Republican groups because of the political connections they can build, but they might also join a group such as Turning Point USA. Founded by Charlie Kirk in 2012, when he was 18, the conservative group is known for its attention-grabbing tactics at colleges. It started the Professor Watchlist, a project meant to track, expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda. It hosts summits often attended by major figures in the Trump administration, including the president, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n\nKidder said such groups probably do a better job of appealing to students interested in more than traditional, campaigning-style politics.\n\nConservative and liberal students tend to organize differently, Binder said. Students on the left may feel more comfortable within the university. Many have student affairs offices directed toward minority students, such as black or LBGTQ cultural centers. Conservative students may be drawn off campus to groups such as Turning Point, which have a lot of money and resources to help them organize.\n\nJoaquin Romero, 21, a junior studying economics at the University of New Mexico, chairs the New Mexico Federation of College Republicans. He has long been involved in state and city politics. In New Mexico, the state with the largest percentage of Hispanics in the country, Democrats hold all seats in Congress, the governor's office and both the state House and Senate.\n\nRomero said his goal is to shift the college Republican group away from the incendiary approach some have taken. In 2017, the UNM group invited Yiannopoulos to campus, and police intervened to break up protests. Romero said he understands some people appreciate watching things burn, but he sees those efforts as counterproductive.\n\nThings like the Milo event, where you have someone on stage that says inflammatory things that are in my opinion not even conservative, he said, it not only drives people away, but it also ignites the wrong kind of people.\n\nThe goal, Romero said, should be to recruit people who want to carry on the conservatism of (Ronald) Reagan. That lasts longer, he argued, than the furor generated over provocative speakers.\n\nAt San Diego State, 'America first'\n\nInfighting among conservative students in California prompted a majority of the state'scollege Republicans to start a new organization altogether. They split off from the California College Republicans about a year ago to create the California Federation of College Republicans. That group's chairman, Matt Ronnau, also heads the chapter at University of California-Berkeley.\n\nInitially, Ronnau said, the divide among College Republicans was between those eager to embrace President Trump and those who wanted to embrace a more traditional model of conservatism. The split came down to differences in how to run the organization. The new group, the federation, has 30 chapters and is recognized by the College Republican National Committee. The old group, the California College Republicans, didn't return a request for comment.\n\nRonnau describes himself as a member of the Trumpian camp but said many of the federation's members are not. Some have swung far to the right. The San Diego State College Republicans, who belong to the federation, describe themselves as unapologetically Nationalist + America first in the group's Twitter profile. They have retweeted Michelle Malkin, a controversial figure who supports far-right writer Nicholas Fuentes and VDARE, an anti-immigration website popular among white nationalists.\n\nOliver Krvaric, president of the San Diego State group, said a split exists between establishment Republicans and the next generation.\n\nKrvaric, 21, a senior studying international security and conflict resolution, said he'd rather the group focus less on helping conservative students land political jobs, a traditional role for College Republican groups, and instead work to wage the culture war. For instance, although he wouldn't say where he stood on issues such as same-sex marriage, he said generally men and women are better suited for different roles. Many group members oppose abortion rights and hold hard-line views on immigration.\n\nRonnau said he is unconcerned that the San Diego chapter's views could be seen as reflective of the federation as a whole.\n\nWe want to let clubs operate kind of more or less the way they see fit, Ronnau said. San Diego State is much farther to the right than other clubs in our state federation, but we all coexist together.\n\nRonnau doesn't expect a return to the era of Republicanism that would be familiar to the Mitt Romney- or John McCain-types. He said many young people support the president, and more young people will step up to push the right-wing populist agenda.\n\nEditorial board:Forget Donald Trump, Republicans. Save the GOP for the sake of your party's future\n\nColumbus Day post rocks University of Maine\n\nKirk and his fellow Republicans used to be some of the most vocal conservative voices on college campuses. But some young Republicans view him as too moderate.\n\nJeremiah Childs, vice president for the College Republican group at the University of Maine, pushes an America first agenda that's unabashedly Trumpian in support of strict immigration policies. The group often posts criticism of Democratic presidential hopefuls and support for gun rights and the military.\n\nHe said groups such as Turning Point spend too much time talking about economic issues rather than cultural ones, such as the anti-abortion movement. Childs said he worries about the rise of concepts such as nontraditional gender roles and third-wave feminism.\n\nIn October, the group posted a message on Facebook in support of Columbus Day, describing some Native American tribes as corrupted by rampant ritual sacrifice and cannibalism. The post generated backlash. Childs said that the intent was not to rile and that he didn't think Native Americans in the area cared about the controversy over Columbus Day.\n\nAn indigenous student group protested the post, according to Inside Higher Education. A tribal ambassador of the Penobscot Nation told an NBC affiliate she was in favor of stripping Columbus' name from the holiday, calling him a war criminal.\n\nChilds said the outrage was the result of left-wing activists.\n\nThe College Republicans at the University of Maine recently also came under fire for their plans to bring in Malkin. The hotel hosting the event pulled out, but the students found a new venue, Childs said.\n\nThe group's adviser resigned after the students invited Malkin. Dan Demeritt, spokesman for the University of Maine, said the club isn't official without one. Childs said they have candidates lined up.\n\nMalkin supports Nicholas Fuentes, a far-right writer. Though he said he is not a white nationalist, he attended the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a gathering of white nationalists. Counterprotester Heather Heyer was killed after James Alex Field drove a car into a crowd of anti-racist demonstrators.\n\nFuentes has joked the Holocaust didn't happen. His fans have coordinated attempts to heckle speakers from Turning Point USA and another conservative group, the Young America Foundation, according to the Daily Beast.\n\nChilds said his group does not endorse Fuentes and is not associated with him.\n\nThe Maine group posted a poll featuring Kirk of Turning Point USA, whom Childs described as a Country Club Republican, and Fuentes.\n\nThe major question, the Maine students wrote, seems to be should the Republican Party move towards 'Nationalism/America First,' or towards 'Libertarianism' with a softer approach towards social issues and immigration? In the students' poll, Fuentes represented the first option, Kirk the second. Eighty-two percent of the 5,200 who voted went with Fuentes, the rest for Kirk. (These types of internet polls can be easily gamed, especially by young digital natives.)\n\nChilds said he doesn't think conservative critics understand the circumstances of poor and rural Americans. He said they probably come from prosperous backgrounds.\n\nChilds' sentiment reiterates what many of these young conservatives say about each other: They just don't get it.\n\nEducation coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Foundation.

Sophia Nelson\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nAmerica is at a critical inflection point and, dare I say, reflection point. We have to decide whether the men and women responsible for trying to overturn a free and fair election, and who later helped to incite a riot and insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, will be given pardon or punishment.\n\nJoe Biden, our incoming president, has from Day One built his campaign for the presidency around the issue of America's soul and trying to unify her broken factions. He opened his campaign with a video quoting Thomas Jefferson's famous refrain: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. Biden made clear that the reason he was compelled to run for the presidency was because of the racial horror that unfolded in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.\n\nLincoln's mistake\n\nFast-forward to 2021, Biden will be inaugurated the nation's 46th president on Wednesday at the same Capitol that was under siege by Trump supporters and domestic terrorists. The question is now that the House has impeached Donald Trump, again, will he be convicted in a Senate trial that will start presumably in late January or in the first 100 days of the Biden administration? And the bigger question is what will a Biden-Harris Department of Justice do with any investigations into criminal allegations against Trump or his associates?\n\nFrom my vantage point — as someone who was a center-right Republican from age 20, when I could first vote in a presidential election in 1988, until the Trump presidency began in 2017 — this is a very consequential moment not just for the fate of the Republican Party but also for the republic.\n\nPresident Biden must not make the same mistake that the first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, made when he forgave the traitors to the Union, when he pledged malice toward none and let the Confederates off without punishment. He let Robert E. Lee, the commanding general of the Confederacy, and the men who took up arms against the American Union return to rebuild their lives and communities in the South.\n\nNever a bottom:The defining phrase of Donald Trump's presidency was 'new low'\n\nI understand Lincoln's heart. I understand Lincoln's thought process but, in hindsight, it was a mistake not to hold these traitors accountable and publicly deal with their treachery and treason. John Wilkes Booth shot and killed Lincoln at Ford's Theatre. Wilkes was a Confederate sympathizer and was part of a conspiracy of Confederates who hated Lincoln. Who did not accept that they lost the war. And who could not accept Lincoln's gracious pardon. Instead, they plotted to kill him and decapitate the government at the time.\n\nWhat am I saying? President Biden desperately wants to heal the nation. On that we agree. However, healing does not come without apology, regret, repentance, restitution and change. No marriage heals that way. No family heals that way. No friendship heals that way. No nation can heal that way.\n\nWhat happened on Jan. 6\n\nOne reason America has not healed is because we are stuck in denial about what really happened on Jan. 6. It was not a day of patriots protesting. It was a day of white grievances. White rage. And white nationalism run wild. It was a day that we have seen many times before in our nation's ugly racial past, just not at the U.S. Capitol. We know about the Tulsa massacre in Oklahoma in 1921 and the Rosewood massacre in Florida in 1923 that killed hundreds of innocent Black people during the Jim Crow era. We know about lynch mobs and the little known Wilmington massacre in North Carolina in 1898. All of it happened right here in America.\n\nHere is the hard truth we face in 2021: President Lincoln welcomed traitors back into the Union with no consequence in his quest to unite the Union. Regrettably, after his assassination, his vision of a reconstruction to bring education and equality to African Americans ended abruptly with the Compromise of 1887. Black people, newly freed, endured eight more decades of racial terror and inequity during Jim Crow.\n\nIf Biden allows Trump, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and their ilk get away with the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, we will endure more violence. We will divide ourselves more deeply. We will damage this republic for an additional 50 to 100 years to come, if we last that long.\n\nOpen carry:With armed protests planned after D.C. attack, ban open carry of guns at state capitols\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi will go down in history as one of the patriots of this republic because she held Donald Trump accountable by getting the largest bipartisan vote ever to impeach a president. The question is will Biden be Lincoln, or will Biden be different and hold accountable those who engaged in lies and raged in sedition.\n\nSophia Nelson is an adjunct professor at Christopher Newport University in Virginia and the author of E Pluribus ONE: Reclaiming Our Founders' Vision for a United America.

Lauren Ready\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPHOENIX — Drivers in any city have likely seen it: a homeless person asking for money at a red light. Tim Owens had seen it many times before, including many drivers who didn't stop to help. One day, he decided to change his perspective and be the person standing on the corner. But he was giving money away, $50 at a time.\n\nWatch the video above to see how people reacted to his kindness.\n\nOnly one week before, Owens was laid off from his job. He had been in a director-level position for a major media company, with three children, a wife, a home, and a nest egg that they had been building. He looked at his final paycheck and realized that there were others who needed that money more than him. Owens says he felt compelled to give it away.\n\nI knew I had to do something crazy, Owens says. Not because of the theatrics of it, or not because of this self-fulfilling idea. It had to be a big and bold step in a way I would never forget it.\n\nOwens knew he couldn't hand out money on a street corner dressed in a suit and tie. What if we flipped this and showed people that things aren't always what they seem? said Owens. He dressed in disheveled clothing and held a sign saying, It's better to give than receive.\n\nOwens found himself talking people into taking the money. Many drivers rolled up their window, said no thanks, or waved him away. Owens kept repeating, My needs are met, my needs are met, when drivers would ask him if he was serious.\n\nPeople didn't know what to do. The perception that they saw, that they experienced, was not reality.\n\nOne man in a truck thanked Owens, saying, I just paid my bills and I came up short this week.\n\nOwens had no idea how the day would go, but he didn't anticipate his kindness to catch on so quickly. One man told Owens that his own needs were met for that day, and asked Owens to give it to the next person. And then another driver saw what Owens was doing and brought him a cold water from the nearby gas station.\n\nWatch the full film here.\n\nOwens recorded the experience for himself, never intending to share it with the public. It happened almost three years ago. After years of telling the story of kindness to family and friends, he decided to share his experience after all. The response has been huge. Now Owens is trying to create more moments like his around the country.\n\nOwens hopes people take away the lesson to give whatever you can, whatever that looks like. We don't know what the needy look like, we don't know who is in need, Owens says. Putting yourself second and other people first, even if it's just a moment.\n\nWe need to love each other and give where we can give and help where we can help and lift each other up.\n\nFor more stories like this, follow Humankind on Facebook.
AP\n\nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) — Brad Underwood is back home.\n\nWhile the 53-year-old was born in McPherson, Kansas, Illinois became home when he served as an assistant coach at Western Illinois from 1992-2003. It was then that he matched wits with Lon Kruger and Bill Self, and he saw what it meant to play against Illinois. He witnessed the support from the community and the students and was hooked.\n\nStill, it was a surprise when his agent let him know Illinois and other schools had reached out about his availability after just one season coaching at Oklahoma State. He had taken the Cowboys to the NCAA Tournament, but he had only been in Stillwater for a year and never let himself think about the possibility of coaching at Illinois.\n\nOn Saturday, he met with Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman and got the job he thought he'd never have.\n\nI felt this was an elite program, Underwood said Monday as the school formally introduced him in an on-campus news conference. I dream big, and I dream bigger. Winning national championships is something that can happen here, and I want to be a part of that.\n\nThe hiring came as a surprise, and not just to Underwood and Oklahoma State. It was Whitman making another aggressive move one year after bringing in Lovie Smith in a bid to turn around the moribund football program.\n\nWhitman didn't use a search firm as he looked for a replacement for John Groce, but did rely on others in the basketball community, including former players Jerry Colangelo and Mannie Jackson. After watching game film, interviews and other things, Whitman knew this was their guy. With openings at Indiana, California and Washington, he knew he had little time to waste.\n\nUnderwood didn't speak to Whitman until Saturday, but at that moment it seemed to be a perfect marriage for both parties.\n\n(Whitman's) a tremendous salesman and so proud of his university, Underwood said. He didn't have to sell me. The 'we will win,' that's what I'm about.\n\nUnderwood upped his salary for the second consecutive year. He will average $3 million for the next six seasons and has performance-based incentives in his contract. Underwood will also have $850,000 for three on-court assistants and said he'll talk to interim coach Jamall Walker about staying on his staff.\n\nThe new coach will also need to maintain the highly touted recruiting class he inherited. The incoming class is ranked in the top 15 and Underwood said he's spoken to the commits and wants to meet with them to talk about potential roles.\n\nThis state produces a lot of elite talent, Underwood said. We want to he best players in this state to play for Illinois. Keeping elite players is vital.\n\nAfter a quick weekend, the work doesn't stop for Underwood. With recruiting to do and a staff to firm up, Underwood also mentioned bringing back old players and coaches who made Illinois into what he considers a top program while he puts together a team that plays a fast offense and gritty defense.\n\nYou will all be proud of what goes out there, Underwood said. We're going to play for the name on the front.\n\n__\n\nMore AP college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25
Julia Letlow, the widow of U.S. Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, will run for the 5th Congressional District seat her husband was unable to fill because of his COVID-19 death Dec. 29.\n\nEverything in my life and in my marriage has prepared me for this moment, she said in a statement. My motivation is the passion Luke and I both shared: to better this region that we called home and to leave it a better place for our children and future generations.\n\nI am running to continue the mission Luke started — to stand up for our Christian values, to fight for our rural agricultural communities and to deliver real results to move our state forward.''\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards has called a special election on March 20 to fill the seat, which came open after former Congressman Ralph Abraham, R-Alto, didn't seek reelection to honor a three-term limit pledge.\n\nLuke Letlow, 41, who had served as Abraham's chief of staff, died from COVID-19 complications at Ochsner LSU Health Shreveport. He would have been sworn into office Jan. 3.\n\nJulia Letlow, 41, a Republican from Start in Richland Parish, is an executive at the University of Louisiana Monroe who was a finalist for the ULM president's job last fall. She and her late husband have two children — Jeremiah, 3, and Jacqueline, 1.\n\nDemocrat Sandra Candy Christophe of Alexandria, who finished third in the Nov. 3 primary election and missed the Dec. 5 runoff election by fewer than 500 votes, announced last week she will run again.\n\nAfter much prayer, I do not feel relieved of my assignment to serve District 5 as its next U.S. Congressional Representative, Christophe, a small business owner, said in her official announcement statement. When elected, I will be an advocate for all and accessible to all.\n\nAllen Guillory Sr., a Republican from Opelousas, who owns a trucking company and who earned 7% in the Nov. 3 election, is also making another bid. I want to be able to be an example that if you work hard you can accomplish anything, Guillory said.\n\nA host of other Republicans had been waiting to see if Julia Letlow would run for the seat before committing to the race.\n\nState Sen. Stewart Cathey, R-West Monroe, State Rep. Michael Echols, R-Monroe, State Rep. Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, and Ouachita Parish Police Juror Scotty Robinson told USA Today Network they won't run in deference to Letlow.\n\nState Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston, had no comment.\n\nState Rep. Lance Harris, R-Alexandria, who lost to Luke Letlow 62% to 38% in the Dec. 5 runoff, didn't return a call or text seeking comment.\n\nGreg Hilburn covers state politics for the USA TODAY Network of Louisiana.

The housing market is booming and much of the surge is due to first-time homebuyers. But amid a raging pandemic and soaring home prices, their parents also deserve a heap of credit.\n\nMore than half of Americans who bought their first home in 2020 said family or friends helped them with the down payment, according to a survey of 1,000 recent and prospective buyers conducted January 7-11 by HarrisX for realtor.com.\n\nIn July, just 26% of first-time home buyers who purchased during the prior 12 months said they got assistance from family or friends, according to a separate survey by the National Association of Realtors (NAR).\n\nDifferent surveys can have varying methodologies. And the NAR poll asked buyers if they received a gift or loan while the realtor.com survey only specified a loan. But realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale said she believes most respondents didn't distinguish between a loan or gift.\n\nHousing bubble?A rapid rise in home prices has some experts worried\n\n'This is life-changing':Meet the Redditors behind the GameStop saga\n\nBuyers ask for help during COVID\n\nRather, she said, high-flying home prices, low interest rates and the financial strains inflicted by the COVID-19 crisis have led more buyers to seek help from relatives or friends.\n\nThe pandemic has shifted things in a big way, Hale says.\n\nNick Libert, owner of Exit Strategy Realty in Chicago, says first-time buyers are racing to take advantage of mortgage rates that have been pushed to historically low levels during the health and economic crisis. Since they're buying before saving up all the cash they need for a down payment, many are turning to family or friends.\n\nBryce Corey, 24, a software developer, and his girlfriend hunted for a Denver-area starter home costing under $350,000 for several months beginning last summer. But they were outbid eight or nine times, he says.\n\nIt was definitely disheartening, he says. It kind of knocked us back a little bit each time.\n\nAs a result, Corey's parents agreed to provide a roughly $10,000 loan to enhance his 5% down payment and boost his chances of winning a bidding war.\n\nBye, Bezos:Amazon's Jeff Bezos to step down from CEO role and become executive chair; Andy Jassy named next CEO\n\nIt made us all feel better (that it was a loan rather than a gift), Corey says. I wouldn't want to just take their money and run with it. Ultimately, he couldn't find a suitable house and decided to move back in with his parents in Lansing, Michigan, to sock away more money before resuming his search in May, but their offer is still good, he says.\n\nHome prices rise\n\nThe median price of an existing U.S. home reached $309,800 in December, up 12.9% from a year earlier, according to NAR, as low housing supplies drove up prices. Nationally, there was a 1.9 month supply of homes on the market in December -- the time it would take to run out of homes for sale if no new units were added. That's an all-time low and down from a three-month supply a year earlier,\n\nMyPillow fight: Company Twitter account permanently suspended following Trump ally CEO Mike Lindell's ban from platform\n\nAt the same time, the COVID-19 crisis prompted the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates early last year, pushing down mortgage rates.\n\nAverage 30-year fixed mortgage rates stood at 2.7% last week, nearly a percentage point lower than a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac. If buyers can get aid with their down payment from family or friends to defray higher prices, the low rates can allow them to cut their monthly mortgage costs, Hale says.\n\nMillions of millennials who have been putting off marriage and living with their parents are finally ready to settle down and buy homes, Hale says. Nearly 5 million millennials turned 30 last year, according to the Census Bureau and realtor.com. Thirty-one percent of home purchases in December were by first-time buyers, NAR figures show. At the same time, the pandemic has spurred many Americans who are working remotely to flee cities for bigger houses in more sparsely populated suburban and rural areas, fueling housing sales.\n\nPeople feel now is the right time, she says. They're trying to make it happen sooner rather than later.\n\nEighteen percent of the first-time buyers surveyed by realtor.com said they got help from their parents, while 12% cited siblings; 14%, extended family; and 8%, friends.\n\nCan't afford a down payment\n\nAll told, 44% of first-time buyers didn't have enough for a down payment last year, the survey shows. Half of first-time buyers squirreled away enough in less than three years by setting aside a portion of their paycheck each month, cutting out discretionary spending and saving lump-sum money like tax refunds.\n\nOther survey findings:\n\n► Buyers had to compromise in 2020, with 21% expanding their searches to less expensive neighborhoods, 20% raising their budgets and 18% cutting out features they desired, like a garage, pool or finished basement.\n\n► Forty-nine percent of first-time buyers and 39% of prospective first-time buyers fell in love with a home but discovered they were outbid.\n\nFaster recovery?:Economy will return to pre-pandemic output level by mid-2021, sooner than expected, CBO predicts
Marijuana activists are poised for a major victory in New York as state lawmakers consider a sweeping plan to legalize and tax cannabis, and pour money into minority communities devastated by the War on Drugs.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, a moderate Democrat, is this year strongly backing marijuana legalization and hopes to persuade governors and voters in surrounding states to adopt similar measures. Cuomo's push for a regional approach is itself novel and highlights the potential national impact if one of the most influential states embraces recreational cannabis.\n\nNew York lawmakers considered a similar legalization plan last year, and while it was predictably opposed by law enforcement, conservatives and teacher groups, it also found opposition from an unexpected quarter: progressive activists who said the measure didn't do enough to help minority communities.\n\nMost states that have legalized marijuana have made only minor steps to aid communities historically targeted with unfair drug-law enforcement, and progressive activists said they would rather wait a year than accept yet another law that didn't do enough to correct policies upheld by the War on Drugs that targeted many blacks and Latinos for decades in the U.S.\n\nFor me, sometimes, incremental progress is not the answer. You have to look at what opportunities would be lost through the incremental progress, said longtime cannabis equity activist Shanita Penny, who was critical of last year's plan for not going far enough to benefit all New Yorkers. The folks that were left behind in the proposal last year were small businesses, and the communities and individuals impacted by the War on Drugs.\n\nNew York is one of several states that may legalize cannabis this year, as lawmakers and voters also consider proposals in Arizona, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Rhode Island and New Jersey. Eleven states already permit recreational cannabis, while 33 states permit some form of medical marijuana.\n\nLawmakers in New York last year failed to agree on the legalization plan's specifics to aid minority communities — provisions known as equity — and it ultimately died after also facing strong opposition from lawmakers outside New York City, particularly those from conservative areas. While Cuomo wanted a new office controlled by his administration to decide how to aid minority communities, some African American legislators insisted that the specifics be set out in the law itself.\n\nAlthough California's approximately 40 million residents legalized marijuana four years ago, New York is widely seen as a key building block toward national legalization since it both sets the tone for much of the Northeast and because so many investors are based in New York City's Manhattan borough.\n\nJacobi Holland, a 28-year-old cannabis entrepreneur from New York City, was disappointed when last year's effort failed. But because New York is also leading a multi-state effort, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, Holland says there's time to get the law right.\n\nNew York is going to be the center of all this. I see that it's worth the fight, he said.\n\nCuomo's proposal is similar to plans proposed by Democratic state legislators and creates a new Office of Cannabis Management to oversee and regulate the entire industry. Advocates say having a powerful centralized office will be an effective way to make sure women, minorities and farmers get help in acquiring licenses. Critics fear that central office could be improperly influenced by politics, given the huge sums of money at stake. But both agree minority communities should have the opportunity to benefit from new business opportunities\n\nIn other states that have legalized marijuana without making special equity provisions, sales licenses have overwhelmingly gone to wealthy white men without criminal records. Activists have said this system perpetuates the harms of the War on Drugs and its impact on minority communities.\n\nFederal studies show that while white and African American people use marijuana at roughly the same rates, African Americans, particularly young men, were arrested at far higher rates.\n\nCuomo's plan also allows people who might not otherwise qualify for a license on their own to join cooperatives, and uses some of the tax money collected on pot sales to help boost marijuana businesses in communities previously targeted by unfair drug-law enforcement.\n\nWe're talking about a multi-decade problem that was created. It's not going to be solved in a couple of budgets, Assembly Speaker Crystal Peoples-Stokes, D-Buffalo, said. So it has to be in the statute. Because the next governor, whoever he or she may be, should have the same responsibility to invest in the lives of these folks as the previous governor.\n\nNew York's legalization effort is being closely watched in part because the state has so many residents, but also because Cuomo is hoping to persuade Connecticut and Pennsylvania to adopt similar plans, while New Jersey residents may approve a similar one via a ballot initiative. Lawmakers in Illinois last year passed a comprehensive proposal sharing many similarities with Cuomo's.\n\nCuomo's office says legal marijuana in New York could ultimately generate as much as $300 million in new taxes once the industry is fully operational. New York is facing a $6.1 billion budget deficit driven largely by rising health care costs, and lawmakers across the country have eagerly taxed pot to help bridge budget gaps. But activists are increasingly pushing politicians to acknowledge that it's wrong to tax marijuana users without also offering assistance to unfairly targeted communities.\n\nOur economic growth would be a hollow victory if we did not continue our social progress, Cuomo said in announcing his plan in early January. For decades, communities of color were disproportionately affected by the unequal enforcement of marijuana laws.\n\nAlso driving this year's push is the growing understanding that politicians who support legalization are likely to earn more public support, not less, especially in Democrat-dominated states. Cuomo can see the tide has turned and he's free to push harder, said cannabis attorney and consultant David Feldman.\n\nCuomo included his legalization plan in the state's annual budget plan, which lawmakers must approve by April 1.\n\nI think what he learned in the intervening year, although there is some opposition, is that it's a much safer political choice, said Feldman, a partner at Hiller PC in New York and an expert in cannabis law and finance. It's how things evolved with gay marriage.\n\nLike other cannabis legalization efforts before state lawmakers or voters across the country this year, Cuomo's proposal contains provisions to address youth use, target stoned drivers and track marijuana production from seed to sale to reduce the black market.\n\nLast year, New York decriminalized marijuana by softening penalties and allowing for previous arrests for small amounts of weed to be expunged from people's criminal records. Cuomo's decision to support legalization represents a major shift seen in part to have been driven by a 2018 primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist who tied racial justice to marijuana legalization and equity assistance.\n\nPenny said the lessons learned in other states are bearing fruit in New York. Penny, who served as the president of Minority Cannabis Business Association until October, said she's learned not to initially compromise on equity programs because there's no going back to fix things later.\n\nWhen we just throw something out there and then come back and attempt to fix it, we know that doesn't work well. The same folks who have been left behind, who are still struggling, they will remain in that position, Penny said. We stood our ground, drew that line, and that delay was necessary so we can go full steam ahead.\n\nHolland, of New York City-based On The Revel, said he would have preferred to see New York be further along with legalization by 2020, rather than still debating the plan's specifics. Holland said he worries that minorities like him trying to break into the cannabis space could be left even further behind if the federal government acts before New York gets its system running.\n\nNationwide, the people who open marijuana stores in newly legal states have a significant advantage over late-comers, especially as multi-state operators have begun consolidating independent stores and squeezing down the margins. Because consolidation favors deep-pocketed investors, and because previous equity efforts were tentative at best, the cannabis industry nationally remains largely white and wealthy. New York's legislation aims to help correct that.\n\nThere's no denying that early players have an advantage, Holland said. I think that the pushback in New York is worth it because however New York legalizes is going to be a model for other states, and a statement across the globe. (But) whatever advantage you have at the local level, you lose that opportunity if it's federally legalized first.\n\nFor critics, however, federal legalization remains unlikely for the foreseeable future. Anti-legalization campaigner Kevin Sabet of the group Smart Approaches to Marijuana helped coordinate opposition to the New York plan last year in part by arguing that while most Americans want to see penalties for marijuana use eliminated, creating cannabis stores remains unpopular in many places. He said his group hopes to play the same role this year, although Cuomo appears more engaged this time around.\n\nI am concerned he's going to spend some political capital and twist arms. I think it's going to be tough but it's winnable, Sabet said of his opposition plans. Legalization has hit some walls.\n\nBut cannabis consultant Matt Karnes, founder of GreenWave Advisors, said if the Empire State moves ahead, much of the Northeast will likely follow.\n\nMomentum is really building in New York, Karnes said. When that happens, I think everybody is just going to pile on.\n\nContributing: Joseph Spector, New York State Editor for the USA TODAY Network.
Gordon Rago\n\nYork (Pa.) Daily Record\n\nA father rescued from Taliban-linked militants fewer than three months ago will be spending at least the next five days in a Canadian detention center after his arrest earlier on more than a dozen charges, including sexual assault.\n\nJoshua Boyle, 34, whose family now is living in Ottawa after moving from his parents' house in Smiths Falls, Ontario, made a brief appearance via video for a preliminary hearing Wednesday in Ottawa, where the 15 charges — including eight counts of assault, two of sexual assault, two claims of unlawful confinement and one accusation of a death threat — were filed. He was told that he will remain in custody until a Monday bail hearing, the Toronto Star reported.\n\nNo other details about the assault accusations nor his arrest date are available though police allege the offenses occurred between Oct. 14 and Dec. 30.\n\nCourt records show two alleged victims, the Canadian Broadcast Corp. reported. The provincial court issued an order preventing publication of information that could identify any alleged victims, different from laws in the United States where media generally don't identify potential victims of sexual assault without their consent.\n\n► Jan. 2:Joshua Boyle, former Canadian hostage in Afghanistan, faces 15 charges\n\n► Oct. 21:Fond memories of Pa. home helped woman during hostage ordeal\n\n► Oct. 17:Former hostage says his American wife was rushed to hospital\n\nPakistani security forces rescued Boyle; his 32-year-old wife, Caitlan Coleman Boyle; and their three children Oct. 11. The couple had been held captive for five years after being kidnapped in October 2012 in Afghanistan's Wardak province.\n\nThey had begun their tourist trek through Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan about a year after getting married in Costa Rica. When they were captured in the Taliban stronghold southwest of Kabul, Caitlan Boyle was seven months pregnant.\n\nWhile they were hostages, Caitlan Boyle miscarried their first child. Her husband said that came about because the militants put massive doses of estrogen in her food, causing her pregnancy to end.\n\n► Oct. 16:Taliban denies raping American hostage\n\n► Oct. 14:What were Caitlan Coleman and Joshua Boyle doing in Afghanistan?\n\n► Oct. 13:Taliban group killed my infant daughter, raped my wife, ex-hostage says\n\nLater she gave birth to three other children in captivity, sons who are ages 4 and 2 and a daughter less than a year old. The births were part of their plans to have a large family, she told the Toronto Star 10 days after the family landed Oct. 13 in Canada.\n\nin separate emails Tuesday to the Star, both Joshua Boyle's lawyer, Eric Granger, and Caitlan Boyle alluded to potential post-traumatic stress disorder as a reason for his alleged behavior.\n\nUltimately, it is the strain and trauma he was forced to endure for so many years and the effects that that had on his mental state that is most culpable for this, she wrote.\n\n► Oct. 13:What's ahead for family released by militants after 5 years' captivity?\n\n► Oct. 12:Father questions why Joshua Boyle's pregnant wife went to Afghanistan\n\n► Oct. 12:Family leaves Pakistan after being held by militants for five years\n\nHis lawyer emphasized that he never had been in trouble with the law previously.\n\nCaitlan Boyle is a U.S. citizen who grew up in Stewartstown, Pa., about 2 miles north of the Mason-Dixon line and 30 miles north of Baltimore. She and her husband of six years met online, bonding over their love of Star Wars.\n\nJoshua Boyle is a Canadian citizen in his second marriage.

Corrections/clarifications: A previous version of this story listed an incorrect roman numeral for the Super Bowl played in 2008.\n\nThe blown pass-interference call during this year's NFC Championship Game has diverted attention from another controversial and curious officiating story.\n\nIt's the story of Roy Ellison, a 53-year-old NFL umpire.\n\nIt took Ellison less than 15 years to go from officiating the Pop Warner Super Bowl to officiating the NFL's Super Bowl.\n\nMore:Ranking the New England Patriots' Super Bowl teams: Which group was No. 1?\n\nMore:From vegan to keto, Whole30 and more: Super Bowl party foods for popular diets\n\nDuring the 2015 season, he officiated despite undergoing dialysis twice a week, sometimes on the morning of the NFL's games. He had successful kidney transplant surgery in February 2016.\n\nHe has drawn high praise from Scott Green, executive director of the NFL Referees Association. Yet a year after Ellison officiated in his second Super Bowl, two of his close friends told USA TODAY Sports that Ellison fears the NFL might force him out despite a distinguished, 16-year career.\n\nI know he's concerned,'' said Jerry Williams, whose friendship with Ellison dates back to their high school days in Lakeland, Florida. You got a guy that has his career and future in jeopardy.''\n\nDespite officiating in Super Bowl XLII in 2008 and Super Bowl LII in 2018, Ellison is likely best known among NFL fans for something less exalted: Buffalo Bills defensive end Jerry Hughes accosted Ellison on Dec. 2 after the Bills lost to the Miami Dolphins 21-17. Television cameras captured the moment and the video went viral.\n\nYou called me a (expletive),'' Hughes hollered at Ellison inside the concourse of the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. I'll catch you! I'll catch you, guaranteed!''\n\nTwo days later, the NFL put Ellison on administrative leave for a week and fined him a $9,300 game check. It was the second time in five years the league has disciplined Ellison for allegedly directing derogatory language at a player.\n\nShannon Sharpe, the Hall of Fame tight end, is among Ellison's supporters. They played football together at Savannah State, where in 1986 Sharpe was a freshman wide receiver and Ellison was a senior offensive lineman who occasionally carried a briefcase to class.\n\nI've always thought of all the guys that I've played with, the guy that I thought would be most professional in a professional environment is him,'' Sharpe said. So am I surprised? Yes.\n\nI don't believe (Ellison) would have put himself in that situation.\n\nBut criminal records suggest Ellison has struggled with his anger.\n\nIn 1991, Ellison was arrested on charges of aggravated battery against his now-former wife, Nichelle, who was two months pregnant at the time of the incident, according to court records reviewed by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nNichelle Allison said Roy Ellison slapped her twice in the face and choked her, and the incident occurred in front of the couple's 9-month-old daughter, according to court records.\n\nHe was placed on one year probation and ordered to take anger management classes, according to court records.\n\nIn 1993, Nichelle filed for divorce and, in court records, accused Ellison of having a violent and ungovernable temper, and in the past has done bodily harm to the Petitioner. The Petitioner has repeatedly had to call for assistance from law enforcement agencies due to the Respondent's violent behavior …\n\nNichelle Ellison did not respond to a request for comment made through a family member.\n\nEllison declined comment when reached by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nTwo years later, in 1995, Ellison started officiating and joined a Pop Warner crew led by Don Trawick, who said he never witnessed Ellison get angry.\n\nHe just didn't stir up trouble or anything,'' Trawick said. You can tell pretty quick them guys that really take the initiative and want to learn to be a good official and he was one of the ones that was.\n\nYou could talk to him. If he missed (a call), you could chomp on him a little bit. He'd learn from his mistakes and become better and better and better.''\n\nQuickly Ellison climbed the ranks. From Pop Warner to high school to college (Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and Conference USA) and then in 2003, only eight years after he first put on an officiating uniform, on to the NFL.\n\nUnwanted scrutiny arrived in 2013, when Ellison was suspended for one game without pay for making what the league called a profane and derogatory statement'' toward Washington Redskins offensive lineman Trent Williams. Williams reported that Ellison called him a garbage (expletive), among other things, and teammates corroborated Williams' claim, according to story by USA TODAY Sports in 2013.\n\nAt the time, Mike Pereira, then the NFL's former director of officiating, told USA TODAY Sports the allegation deeply concerned him and there had been a similar accusation against the Ellison in the past.\n\nPereira, now an NFL rules analyst for Fox Sports, was unavailable to be interviewed, said Carmen Chavez of Fox Sports.\n\nOn Dec. 2, Ellison found himself back under scrutiny after Hughes' post-game verbal attack.\n\nCasey Grigley, who played football with Ellison at Savannah State, told USA TODAY Sports that Hughes was the aggressor. Grigley said Ellison told him he thinks Hughes targeted Ellison during the game and Hughes made contact with Ellison on one play.\n\nHe said, 'Man, that dude tried to hit me,'  Grigley said.\n\nNo such play was visible on the CBS Sports telecast or the all-22'' video footage used by coaches and game officials, based on a review by USA TODAY Sports.\n\nHughes declined to comment.\n\nActive NFL officials are prohibited from speaking to the news media without prior approval from the league, and efforts by USA TODAY Sports to speak to Ellison's current or former NFL colleagues were unsuccessful.\n\nEllison's family members were not available for interviews, Ellison said through a friend. After Ellison's divorce from the woman he was arrested for committing aggravated battery against, he remarried and has raised the two children from his first marriage and the daughter of his second wife, Mia, according to Williams, who said he is the godfather of Ellison's two biological children.\n\nBut Sharpe was happy to sound off about the Ellison and share recollections of his former teammate.\n\nHe was a jokester,'' Sharpe said. He got along with everybody.
Nicole Auerbach\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nFrom the moment Georgetown announced the dismissal of John Thompson III, it was clear the greatest challenge the school faced in making its next hire was straddling the Hoyas' storied past and moving them into the future as well.\n\nThe hire of Patrick Ewing should do just that.\n\nIt's clear that John Thompson Jr.'s fingerprints are all over this hire — the man still commands a great deal of power there, though the awkward situation with his son's ouster remains — which makes sense seeing as Ewing is arguably the greatest player to ever play for the elder Thompson. Ewing led Georgetown to three national title game appearances (winning one) before going on to have a Hall of Fame career in the NBA, with most of his 17 years in the pros spent with the New York Knicks.\n\nThough the natural instinct is to compare Georgetown's hiring of Ewing to that of St. John's and Chris Mullin — these two will face off on the sidelines twice a year now! — the situations are actually quite different. Mullin had zero coaching experience when he was hired in 2015 to resurrect St. John's, meaning he was a hire made solely based on the idea of rejuvenating a program by hiring a famously successful former player.\n\nMORE HOOPS NEWS\n\nPatrick Ewing hired as coach of Georgetown\n\nNCAA tournament's 15 highest-paid coaches\n\nWin-win: Archie Miller's patience pays off, Indiana gets proven winner\n\nWhile that latter part is the case with Georgetown, too, Ewing has bounced around the NBA as an assistant coach since 2003, most recently with the Charlotte Hornets. It appears, instead of waiting around for an NBA head coaching opportunity, he jumped at a college one — which actually follows a recent hiring trend in college basketball.\n\nNavigating the underbelly of college basketball — its recruiting and AAU scene — will be a challenge for Ewing, certainly. He's signing up to revive a program that's best known for underachieving in the NCAA tournament in recent years — and not even coming close to qualifying for the big dance this year.\n\nBut nabbing Ewing is a sign that Georgetown is still Georgetown, an appealing gig (especially for those on Big John's good side) that has increased resources in recent years and a recruiting hotbed nearby. Sure, the Big East isn't what it once was. But that doesn't mean this marriage can't work — and win big.\n\nCOLLEGE HOOPS COACHING CAROUSEL
PHOENIX — The same week the Trump administration opened a hotline in April to support victims of crimes by immigrants, Elena Maria Lopez called to report a complaint against her ex-husband.\n\nAt first, Lopez kept getting a busy signal.\n\nBut finally someone answered. For the next 20 minutes, Lopez provided a detailed account, accusing the Dutch immigrant of marrying her to get a green card and then threatening to harm her if she contacted immigration officials.\n\nWhat happened next shocked Lopez.\n\n► Jan. 19:The worst states economically for Hispanics and Latinos\n\n► Jan. 17:Deportation of Ohio woman was in error, appeals court says\n\n► Jan. 16:Can courts stop deportation of disabled boy's caregiver? Yes.\n\nNot only did Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency that operates the hotline, decline to take action, but immigration authorities also released much of the private information she provided. This includes a confidential Internet phone number she fears will now make it easier for anyone to locate her in New Jersey, where she has a protected address set up for domestic-violence victims.\n\nLopez is one of hundreds of people whose private information was inappropriately released by ICE when the agency posted call logs to the hotline on its website, a clear violation of the agency's own policies against divulging private information as well as privacy laws intended to protect individuals who provide sensitive information to the government.\n\n► Jan. 13:Chicago pays tribute to its Haitian founder after Trump vulgarity\n\n► Jan. 13:Federal government begins accepting DACA renewals\n\nThe agency also released some of the same information to The Arizona Republic in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nLopez contacted the newspaper after ICE officials notified her through telephone calls and emails that private information she provided in confidence was inadvertently released to the newspaper.\n\nI was very upset because I do my best to protect my privacy for my safety and I was especially upset that it was the Department of Homeland Security that gave out my personal information, she said. The same agency that claimed it had to protect my ex-husband's rights just destroyed my privacy and my safety.\n\n'This is a serious problem'\n\nThe agency's release of private information underscores problems that have surfaced since ICE launched the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement office, or VOICE, to serve the needs of crime victims and their families who have been affected by crimes committed by individuals with a nexus to immigration.\n\nThe office includes a telephone hotline that was not intended to report crimes but to answer questions from victims, according to the VOICE website. Instead, callers have treated it has a crime hotline, using it largely to accuse people of being in the country illegally or of violating immigration laws, according to telephone logs the agency released The Republic.\n\nThis is a serious problem and obviously will further discourage people from attempting to interact in any way with the federal government on immigration matters, said immigration policy analyst David Bier at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nVictims and witnesses of crimes already are hesitant to provide information to the government because having that information out in the public could pose a serious threat to them and to their family, he said.\n\nPresident Trump called for the creation of the VOICE program in an executive order on immigration in January 2016, which directed the Department of Homeland Security and ICE to take a tougher stance on illegal immigration and immigration-law violators.\n\nIn a written statement, ICE officials admitted that the agency erred in divulging private information protected by policy and law.\n\nWhen the agency receives evidence suggesting that non-releasable information is unintentionally available, immediate actions are taken to ensure proper mitigation both to correct and to prevent further disclosures, the statement said.\n\nThose action include temporarily removing and reviewing the entire contents of ICE's Freedom of Information Act library, the statement said. The library contained thousands of pages of data and documents the agency previously had released in response to requests.\n\n► Jan. 8:Trump orders 200,000 Salvadorans to leave U.S.\n\n► Jan. 5:Man gets 9 months in deaths of 5 Mexican immigrants in basement\n\nThe contents of ICE's Freedom of Information Act library were restored Oct. 16, the agency said.\n\nThe agency also offered identity-threat monitoring services to people affected because of the improper disclosure of private information, the statement said.\n\nLopez said ICE offered her two years of identity-theft protection and credit monitoring.\n\nIn truth, that does nothing for me, Lopez said.\n\nClaims of immigration fraud\n\nLopez said she became hopeful when Trump said he was creating the VOICE office.\n\nFor more a decade, she said she has tried unsuccessfully to get immigration authorities to investigate her ex-husband, Erik Niehof, a Dutch immigrant. He disputes her allegations accusing him of marriage fraud and domestic violence.\n\nLopez is also the creator of a website, immigrationfraud.com, which provides a forum for victims of marriage fraud.\n\nIn March, Lopez testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee during a hearing into marriage and fiancé visa fraud, describing how she was tricked by the love of my life into getting married.\n\nThen out of the blue, on the night of our second anniversary, he coldly announced we were divorcing. I assumed we were just having marriage problems, suggested counseling.\n\n\n\nHe flat out refused. And then came the cruelest words I've ever heard: … He said our marriage was nothing but a practicality so he could get a green card.\n\nLopez further testified that her ex-husband became violent after learning she had filed for separation and planned to withdraw her immigration sponsorship for his green card.\n\nHe tried to strangle me and threatened to kill me if I ever contacted immigration officials, she testified.\n\nShe also accused her husband of being involved in criminal activity in the Netherlands and claimed he never should have cleared Department of Homeland Security background checks and allowed into the United States.\n\n► Dec. 6:Illegal crossings at U.S.-Mexico border hit historic low\n\n► Nov. 30:Undocumented immigrant not guilty of murder in polarizing case\n\nAfter reporting the allegations to the VOICE hotline, she said she received a call from a caseworker who told her they could not do anything.\n\nThey concluded they couldn't get involved in order to protect his privacy rights, Lopez said, adding that the caseworker suggested she call a Department of Homeland Security tip line.\n\nReached in Pennsylvania, where he works selling cars at a luxury auto dealership, Niehof strongly disputed Lopez allegations. Now remarried, with a child, he accused Lopez of continuing to pursue false claims of marriage fraud and domestic violence against him and inventing stories about his nonexistent criminal past in the Netherlands out of vengeance after their marriage fell apart 16 years ago.\n\nBasically, this was just a marriage that ended up really bad, and, 'I am going to get back at you and I am going to do that through immigration service,'  Niehof said of Lopez. This is her vengeance.\n\nNiehof said originally he didn't want to move to the U.S. but agreed to apply for a visa and get married after his ex-wife visited him in the Netherlands when they were dating but didn't want to live there.\n\nHe said immigration authorities have sworn affidavits from mutual friends that their marriage was entered in good faith.\n\nHe also said immigration authorities have investigated Lopez's claims against him several times and concluded they were unfounded when he applied for permanent residency in 2002 and then to renew his green card 10 years later, pointing out that he was approved both times.\n\nIn 2016, Niehof said U.S. immigration officers briefly detained him upon returning from a vacation abroad with his family after his immigration record was flagged because of his ex-wife's allegations. While he waited, immigration officers looked into his record, then welcomed him back into the U.S., which he said would not have happened if any of her allegations were true.\n\nThat is probably why (immigration authorities) haven't made a case of this because there is no validity in any of it, he said. She is out for vengeance.\n\nRecords inadvertently released\n\nAmong the private information included in the database ICE released to The Republic was Niehof's personal immigration identification number, known as an A number, along with the name and address of the auto dealership where he works.\n\n• On July 31,The Republic filed a Freedom of Information Act request request for any and all criminal activity reported to the VOICE hotline.\n\n• On Sept. 8, in response, Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet via email containing ICE call logs of 643 people who called the VOICE hotline.\n\n• On Oct. 4,The Republic received a clawback response letter from Erin Clifford, chief of ICE's government information law division, alerting the newspaper that records released contained personally identifiable information of third parties, law enforcement sensitive information, and potentially deliberative information.\n\nThe letter concluded by asking the newspaper to confirm that you have returned, destroyed or sequestered all copies of the record and to provide ICE with a list of any disclosures that have been made.\n\nConfusion over hotline's purpose\n\nA review of the call logs released shows that many people contacted the hotline to turn in acquaintances, spouses, relatives, neighbors, and business owners they suspected of being in the country illegally or of having committed crimes.\n\nHowever, ICE's webpage describing the purpose of the VOICE program explicitly states that the hotline is not to report crime. It directs callers to report crimes to local police or ICE's designated crime hotline.\n\nSummaries of the call logs that ICE released included names of crime victims, addresses, and phone numbers as well as names, addresses, places of employment, phone numbers and A-numbers of immigrants being accused of crimes or of being in the country illegally.\n\nFor example, one summary reads: Caller requested to report a possible illegal immigrant who may have an order of deportation. Caller stated the illegal immigrant abuses her children. Caller stated the illegal immigrant is his neighbor and she lives at (street address), Perth Amboy, NJ.\n\nAnother summary reads: Caller requested to report business who hires undocumented aliens. Caller claims there are approximately eight undocumented aliens at this farm located at: (street address), North Olmstead, Ohio. 44138.\n\nThe call logs also show the hotline has received numerous prank calls such as this one: Caller requested to report an alien outside his house and has green skin color.\n\nAnd this one: Caller identified himself as a victim. Caller then requested assistance reporting an illegal alien. Caller provided the name Gabba Tha Hut and address as 1600 Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C. That is the address of the White House.\n\nDoes program have ulterior motive?\n\nBier of the Cato Institute said he supports government efforts to provide more information about cases to crime victims as well as informing them of other services available.\n\nI was torn about the program in general when it was first announced because I honestly believe we treat victims in the United States of crimes very poorly, he said. We give them very little information about what's happening in the case. As a general rule, we as a society need to treat victims much better than we do now.\n\n► Nov. 23:MS-13 gang member arrested after murder victim stabbed over 100 times\n\n► Nov. 3:Islamic State claims responsibility for NYC terror attack without evidence\n\nBut the program's problems and its narrow focus only on victims of crimes committed by immigrants suggests the program has ulterior motives, he said.\n\nThe administration says the motive of the program is to provide more information to crime victims, Bier said. I think if that was the case, it would apply to all crime victims, not just crime victims of immigrants. So I think the motivation is the effort to portray unauthorized immigrants, and immigrants more generally, as a threat or a potential threat to Americans rather than to actually provide meaningful aid to victims of crimes.\n\n► Oct. 30:Man deported by ICE after helping Detroit cops\n\n► Oct. 28:No Social Security number? No electricity\n\nFor her part, Lopez said she now completely has lost faith in ICE after the agency declined to look into her case and then released private information she provided.\n\nThis is just one more example of how dysfunctional the Department of Homeland Security is, Lopez said.\n\nContributing: Ryan Santistevan and Agnel Philip, The Arizona Republic.

Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCongratulations are in order for Mariah Carey, who's engaged to her Australian billionaire boyfriend, casino mogul James Packer, whom she met in 2014.\n\nHer representative in New York, Chris Chambers, confirmed the news.\n\nPeople, US Weekly, and E! were among those shouting about it late Thursday, apparently only minutes after Packer proposed to Carey, 45, in New York on Thursday.\n\nPacker, 48, is the son of the late Aussie media mogul Kerry Packer and the co-chairman of Melco Crown Entertainment, which develops, owns and operates casinos in Asia. Packer is listed as Australia's fourth-richest man, worth $3.8 billion, according to Forbes magazine.\n\nThe Daily Mail published paparazzi pictures of what Vogue reported is a whopping 35-carat diamond-and-platinum ring on her finger from Packer — bigger than even the 33-carat Krupp Diamond colossus that Elizabeth Taylor got from Richard Burton in 1968.\n\nThe design and construction took two weeks and an army of craftsman that included measurement specialists and an expert well versed in the handling of such a large stone, according to the ring's designer, Carey's friend and jeweler, Wilfredo Rosado, in an interview with Vogue.\n\nI took the standards super-high, and I wanted to create a ring that could not be measured up to, Rosado said.\n\nSo far, Carey has not posted about her engagement on her social media.\n\nBut there is no doubt that Carey and Packer have been an item for more than a year, although they haven't been seen in public that much.\n\nRecent pictures show them together on red carpets at the opening of a casino resort in Macau in October, and at a film premiere in New York in September.\n\nPics: Mariah Carey and her billionaire boyfriend make their (awkward) red carpet debut\n\nCarey, who's a millionaire in her own right, also featured a picture of the duo together on her Twitter feed in early January, after she celebrated the New Year with him in Australia.\n\nShe seems to like the Down Under lifestyle, featuring a past picture of herself with a cuddly friend.\n\nCarey and Packer met in Aspen and again in summer 2014 at the Hollywood premiere of a film. We hit it off, she said on The Steve Harvey Show in November 2015 when she was promoting her Christmas TV movie special.\n\nThis would be the third marriage for each of them. Carey has 4-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan, with second husband Nick Cannon.\n\nPacker, a friend of Tom Cruise and former Scientologist, has three children with his second wife, model and singer Erica Baxter, two daughters and one son, all under age 8.
Richard Wolf\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch says judges should focus backward, not forward when deciding cases by looking, among other things, to past court precedents. But through more than 20 hours of testimony before Congress, he only grudgingly endorsed the oldest and most popular of those precedents, refusing to offer his opinions on those decided in recent decades and by narrow majorities.\n\nHis refusal to take sides on cases decided by the Supreme Court involving abortion, gun control, campaign finance and gay rights added to the concerns of Democrats already inclined to oppose him for other reasons: Republicans' refusal to consider President Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, last year; President Trump's avowed use of a litmus test to ensure Gorsuch would be a staunch conservative; and a year-long, multimillion-dollar campaign financed by unknown donors.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, gave voice to those concerns Monday to illustrate why Democrats are in just a terrible position with confirmation votes scheduled for next week. She recalled how difficult it was to get Gorsuch even to address the unanimous Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954 striking down public school segregation.\n\nUnder questioning from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Gorsuch said the ruling vindicated the correct original meaning of the 14th Amendment. He called it one of the shining moments in constitutional history in the United States Supreme Court.\n\nBut getting Gorsuch to comment favorably on other high court precedents proved difficult, much to Democrats' dismay. He eventually said positive things about two decisions from the 1960s — Griswold v. Connecticut, which struck down state bans on contraceptives by a 7-2 vote, and Loving v. Virginia, a unanimous ruling that invalidated state laws against interracial marriage.\n\nThat's about as far as the 49-year-old federal appeals court judge from Colorado was willing to go. On more recent, controversial cases — notably Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal nationwide in 1973 and was upheld in a related case two decades later — he steadfastly refused to state his views.\n\nThe reliance interest considerations are important there, and all the other factors that go into analyzing precedent have to be considered, Gorsuch said. Pressed by Feinstein on whether Roe has become a super-precedent, he said only, It has been reaffirmed many times, I can say that.\n\nRead more:\n\nBig money behind Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch shows little payoff\n\nAnalysis: Neil Gorsuch could lead Supreme Court to a new conservative era\n\nNeil Gorsuch: Stellar résumé and Scalia-like legal philosophy\n\nWho is Neil Gorsuch? A guide to the Supreme Court nominee\n\nOn some of the court's most closely decided cases of the past decade, Gorsuch dodged repeated questions:\n\nOn Heller v. District of Columbia, the 5-4 decision in 2008 that protected the right to own firearms for self-defense, he said the dissent and the majority opinion were both very fine opinions, very thoughtful.\n\nOn Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the 5-4 ruling in 2010 that struck down limits on election campaign spending by corporations, he said Congress still can intercede. There's ample room in the area of campaign finance for further legislation, he said.\n\nOn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 5-4 decision in 2015 that legalized same-sex marriage, he blocked all efforts to solicit his views. There is ongoing litigation about its impact and its application right now, Gorsuch said.\n\nFor a judge to start tipping his or her hand about whether they like or dislike this or that precedent would send the wrong signal, he said. It would send a signal to the American people that the judge's personal views have something to do with the judge's job.\n\nDemocrats on the committees complained that the last two justices nominated by a Republican president, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, had been more specific. But more recently, Obama nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were equally evasive.\n\nIn 2009, Sotomayor told the panel that Roe v. Wade was settled law. On guns, she merely expressed support for the Second Amendment.\n\nIn 2010, Kagan used the same phrase to characterize Roe but added, The application of Roe to future cases, and even its continued validity, are issues likely to come before the court in the future.\n\nYale Law School professor Akhil Reed Amar, a constitutional expert, said Supreme Court nominees of both parties have been more evasive than required when addressing past precedents.\n\nThe ground rules for the Gorsuch hearings — what can be asked and what should be answered — are not exactly intellectually defensible on either side, he said. This has been the sad truth about past hearings as well, for nominees of both parties and senators of both parties.\n\nWhile Gorsuch would have preferred to remain a blank slate on all precedents, he did say which ones merit more or less deference. His definition was drawn in part from an 800-page tome he co-authored, The Law of Judicial Precedent, which he said makes a great doorstop.\n\nIt depends, Gorsuch said, on the age of the precedent, how often it's been reaffirmed, the reliance interests surrounding it, whether it was correctly decided, whether it was constitutional versus statutory, and a number of other things.\n\nSo in a case such as Griswold, he said to Blumenthal, more than 50 years of couples relying on the legal use of contraceptives makes it a strong precedent. States are not likely to try to pass new laws reversing that ruling, he said, and the Supreme Court would not take such efforts seriously.\n\nI don't know how clear I could be to you, senator, he added.\n\nYou could be much more clear about your personal beliefs, Blumenthal responded.\n\nRight, and my personal views have nothing to do with my job as a judge, Gorsuch shot back.
Brian Lyman\n\nMontgomery (Ala.) Advertiser\n\nMONTGOMERY — An Alabama lawmaker Tuesday filed articles of impeachment against the state's governor over what he called incompetency and an inability to lead after questions about his relationship with a former staffer.\n\nWe've never done this before, said Rep. Ed Henry, a Republican from Hartselle, Ala. We've never tried to impeach a governor. But he added the process begins today.\n\nGov. Robert Bentley, also a Republican, in a statement called the move political grandstanding meant to distract the state from pressing issues.\n\nThere are no grounds for impeachment, and I will vigorously defend myself and my administration from this political attack, according to Bentley's statement.\n\nLawmaker plans impeachment articles against Ala. gov\n\nOn March 23, former Secretary Spencer Collier of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency accused Bentley of having an affair with his senior political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason. Collier said he discovered the affair in 2014 when Bentley was married to his wife, Dianne.\n\nThe Bentleys divorced in the fall, ending their 50-year marriage. Audio of Bentley making suggestive comments in a phone conversation since has surfaced.\n\nBentley has acknowledged making suggestive comments to Mason, but both he and Mason denied having an affair. The governor also has denied a Collier accusation that he used state resources to pursue the affair.\n\nThe Alabama Ethics Commission has indicated that it will investigate the allegations.\n\nMason resigned as the governor's political adviser last week. Questions have arisen about how Mason, who has not been on the state payroll since 2013, was paid.\n\nMason said the Alabama Council for Excellent Government, a group formed to promote Bentley's agenda, paid her $15,000 last year. The group has not filed an IRS Form 990 and says it is a 501(c)(4) organization; those groups do not have to disclose donors.\n\nBentley fired Collier on March 22, saying an audit of law enforcement agency raised concerns, including possible misuse of state funds. Collier strongly denies any wrongdoing.\n\nAide to Ala. governor resigns in wake of affair scandal\n\nAlabama's Constitution allows for impeachment of constitutional officers for a broad range of actions, not all of them illegal. The state's governing document allows for the removal of officers for willful neglect of duty, corruption in office, incompetency, or intemperance in the use of intoxicating liquors or narcotics ... as unfits the officer for the discharge of such duties, or for any offense involving moral turpitude.\n\nThe state Constitution is less specific about the process of impeachment. Unlike the U.S. Constitution, the state constitution does not provide a margin for conviction of an impeached constitutional officer in the Senate. Rep. Mac McCutcheon, a Republican from Huntsville, Ala., said Tuesday the House would set up an investigatory committee to determine if any grounds for impeachment were apparent.\n\nOnce the commission is in place and we have heard the report, we will address the other resolution (of impeachment), McCutcheon said. He did not know if the commission would complete its work before the end of the legislative session next month.\n\nIf Bentley were impeached, Lt. Gov Kay Ivey, also a Republican, would serve as acting governor during his Senate trial. An acquittal would mean the governor could resume his duties.\n\nLegislative leaders have remained silent on Bentley's troubles. House Speaker Mike Hubbard, a Republican from Auburn, Ala., said in a brief statement that the Legislature would follow the impeachment process with great care and deliberation.\n\nHubbard, indicted on ethics violations, faces a trial scheduled next month.\n\nEthics report filed against Ala. gov. accused of affair\n\nBentley's relationship with the Legislature has been at best uneasy and at worst confrontational. The governor's attempts in 2012 to force changes in the state's controversial immigration law during a special session fell flat after he was unable to find a sponsor for his proposal in his own party; Bentley later signed amendments made by the Legislature.\n\nIn 2014, he shocked legislators by demanding a pay raise for teachers after working out an agreement to finance the education insurance program. The governor's moves were defeated.\n\nAlabama governor denies having affair with staffer\n\nLast year the governor, citing the need to bring stability to the long-troubled General Fund budget, proposed a $728 million tax and revenue package to shore up the budget. The move triggered a six-month battle with legislators.\n\nThe House leadership proposed a smaller package while the Senate resisted most revenue measures. In the end, a General Fund with about $166 million in new revenues was approved.\n\nFollow Brian Lyman on Twitter: @lyman_brian
Correction & clarifications: A graphic in a previous version of this story had an incorrect classification for Washington, D.C. The graphic has been updated.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — Gay-rights advocates ran a No Gay? No Way! campaign Thursday to pressure Amazon to avoid building its second headquarters in a state that does not protect its residents from discrimination for their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nOf the 20 cities on Amazon's list of finalists, nine are in states with no anti-gay-discrimination laws, according to the campaign. They are Austin; Dallas; Nashville; Atlanta; Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis; Miami; Raleigh, N.C.; and the Washington suburbs of Northern Virginia.\n\nAmazon launched a public search for a second headquarters site last year. It asked cities to send in proposals, saying it preferred candidates with a business-friendly environment, a highly educated labor pool, strong transportation options and a good quality of life. The company said it would spend $5 billion building the new headquarters and it expected to hire 50,000 well-paid workers.\n\nThat prize needs to go somewhere all workers are welcome, says the ad hoc group launching the campaign.\n\nWe were frankly just stunned that a company with such a great track record of equality and diversity had put all these states into the mix, said Conor Gaughan, the ad-hoc campaign's manager and communications consultant, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe group, which includes the executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights and a gay-rights activist and author, planned a demonstration near Amazon's headquarters in Seattle on Thursday as Amazon prepared to issue its fourth-quarter earnings. It also hired a plane to fly overhead trailing a No gay? No way! banner. It also put billboards on trucks driving through Seattle and online ads saying Hey, Alexa? Why would Amazon even consider HQ2 in a state that discriminates against LGBT people?, according to the organizers, who shared copies of the ads with USA TODAY.\n\nLike many tech companies, Amazon has long been a supporter of gay rights and anti-discrimination legislation. It has had a robust gay and lesbian employee group, GLAmazon, since 2005. Before it was common, advertisements for the e-tailer featured gay couples. And CEO Jeff Bezos contributed heavily to the push for gay marriage in Washington state. The company was one of the more than 50 tech firms that last year signed a friend of the court brief in a case involving a transgender high school student in Virginia.\n\nThe campaign comes as some conservatives accuse tech companies such as Google, Twitter and Facebook of a pro-liberal bias that censors their voices and ideas.\n\nHaving a state law that prohibits discrimination against gay workers is important, even if there's a law in place in the city, said Mary Bonauto, the civil rights project director at GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders in Boston.\n\nCities don't really have the ability to protect people. So you get this, 'Married on Friday, fired on Monday' situation where people lose their jobs because they married their same-sex partner, said Bonauto, who is not involved in the ad-hoc group.\n\nIn some cases, the states also have laws on the books that are outright hostile to LGBT people, the group says. In Texas, public schools are required to teach that homosexual conduct is not an acceptable lifestyle.\n\nIn Tennessee, state laws restrict counties and cities from passing laws protecting against discrimination against gay and lesbian people, and transgender people are prohibited from changing the gender on their birth certificates.\n\nThe idea of using corporate clout to move politicians is by no means new, but tech companies, seeking to attract and retain a young workforce that often skews liberal on social issues, have been particularly active on gay-rights issues.\n\nIn 2016, PayPal canceled plans to open a global operations center in Charlotte after the state passed a law that prevented cities from creating non-discrimination policies to protect transgender people. The center had been expected to employ 400 people. The state eventually repealed the law, but PayPal stayed away.\n\nMajor U.S. companies filed friends of the court briefs in October urging the Supreme Court to create federal protections for gay, lesbian and transgender employees.\n\nAmazon's request: A 'compatible' community\n\nWhile Amazon's request for proposals for its second headquarters does not mention the LGBTQ community, it does include a section saying that it requires a compatible cultural and community environment that includes the presence and support of a diverse population.\n\nRichard Florida, the author of The Rise of the Creative Class who studies talent migration, says historically there has been a correlation between centers of innovation and high rates of economic growth, and a thriving gay and lesbian community.\n\nIt's a signal of a community that's open to new thinking and new kinds of ideas. I don't think Amazon can attract talent to a city that's closed-minded, he said.\n\nThe activists say they want Amazon to use its economic power to assert its values of diversity, inclusion and tolerance. There's an edge of a threat to the campaign as well.\n\nWe want companies to know that if you're going to talk the talk when it comes to LGBT diversity, you need to walk the walk, Gaughan said.\n\nMore:Amazon's second headquarters: The pros and cons of the finalists\n\nMore:Amazon headquarters finalists: Some say winning would come at too high a price\n\nMore:Some cities are going to extraordinary lengths for Amazon HQ2\n\nThe group includes various activists, including Kate Kendall of the National Center for Lesbian Rights and activist and author David Mixner. The weekend after the Amazon finalist list was made public, emails began to fly among people who work for LGBT rights, and a loose coalition quickly formed.\n\nThey contend that cities and states that are hostile to LGBT people will also present a barrier to current Amazon staff, said Gaughan.\n\nThink about the implications for an existing employee who might be asked to transfer there. You move to one of these states and you're looking for an apartment and you could be denied a lease because you're gay, said Gaughan.\n\nOne activist said the campaign is not meant to harm the gay people who live in the nine cities.\n\nPutting HQ2 in a place with no non-discrimination protections seems contrary to Amazon's stated commitments, and puts both its employees and their families at far greater risk than is necessary in some other places, said Kate Kendall, director of the San Francisco-based National Center for Lesbian Rights.
TORONTO – Retirement isn't near for LeBron James.\n\nAsked he if could see the end of his career from where he is now in his 15th NBA season, James said, I do not. I do not.\n\nPlus, he added, I've got too many sneakers to sell still.\n\nAt 33 years old, he is having one of his best seasons and a fifth MVP award is a strong possibility: 27.2 points, nine assists, 8.2. rebounds, 1.7 steals and 1.1 blocks per game and shooting 55.8% from the field, 38.9% on three-pointers and 77.7% from the foul line.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he hasn't thought about retiring from basketball. He was contemplative about this future Thursday morning.\n\nThe only thing is with my kids getting older, that's the only thing that kind of stops me from going as long as I'd like to, James said before the Cavaliers played the Toronto Raptors. I've got a 13-year-old son now (LeBron Jr.). He's in the seventh grade. He's a damn good basket player, too. On this road trip, I've already missed four of his games. That's the thing that kind of sucks.\n\nI've got a 10-year-old boy (Bryce), 3-year-old girl (Zhuri). Daddy side kicks in sometimes. That will be a deciding factor in how long I want to play.\n\nJames told USA TODAY Sports that he's able to watch his sons' games on video, and his sister-in-law also records games. But that isn't the same as being there.\n\nNo TV: NBA commissioner Adam Silver opposed to televising All-Star Game draft\n\nTensions rising? NBA players, referees plan meeting at All-Star weekend\n\nEvolution of an All-Star: Raptors' DeRozan adds new wrinkle to offensive game\n\nWith the season he's having and championship aspirations still strong, James has several more high-quality seasons in him as long as he's healthy, which he has been for a majority of his career.\n\nRight now, I feel great. I don't feel 33, he said. I don't feel like I've been to (seven) straight finals in a row. I don't feel like I came in at 18 and I've played 79-80% of games. Just keep it going.\n\nI've already went further than I thought I would go. Every thing after this point is extra credit. Fifteen years. I don't know, I've been in this spotlight for half of my years. I'm 33 now. This thing started when I was 15. 18 years I've been in this light. I've already exceeded everything I've dreamed about. At this point, I'm just adding crazy toppings on the cake like my daughter would do. Throw all kinds of stuff on the cake and whatever happens happens.\n\nJames said he would just know when it's time to retire, just like he knew it was the right time to get engaged and get married.\n\nI don't know until you make that decision. The game will let you know when it's over with, James said. Retirement for me is like getting engaged. I didn't know if I was ready or not. I just felt it was the time. Timing was right. The vibe was right. Did I know I was ready for marriage? I don't know. I never had nobody in my family get married before. I never experienced it.\n\nI definitely never had nobody in my family play in the NBA and retire. So, we'll see. We'll see.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter.
Sandra Harwitt\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY Sports\n\nMELBOURNE — If Caroline Wozniacki is known for one particular trait it's that no matter what adversity she's facing she never gives up the fight. She believes that penchant for perseverance is a necessary survival tactic learned from being a member of the competitive Wozniacki family.\n\nIf you lose a game to anyone in my family, you're going to hear about it for at least a week, she said, smiling. That definitely helped me.\n\nThat talent certainly served the second-seeded Dane well on Wednesday when she was down 5-1 and facing two match points in her second-round match at the Australian Open.\n\nThe 119th-ranked Jana Fett, the Croatian player daring to challenge the former No. 1, was playing remarkable tennis, especially considering this was her first Grand Slam main draw. To add to the suspense, Fett had only once beaten a top-20 opponent, the then 15th-ranked Kristina Mladenovic of France at the 2017 Tokyo tournament.\n\nMore:Madison Keys represents U.S. as lone seeded player left in women's draw\n\nMore:Roger Federer breezes to first-round win\n\nTo all who were watching the match unfold, it appeared that Wozniacki would soon be booking her flight home. But she survived those two match points — at 40-15 and 40-30 in the seventh game — when a nervous Fett squelched the dream upset with back-to-back backhand errors.\n\nAnd just like that the comeback was on. Wozniacki would win 3-6, 6-2, 7-5.\n\nI was thinking at that point she still has to win four more balls to win this match, and don't make it easy for her, Wozniacki said. At 5-1, 40-15, I felt like I was one foot out of the tournament … then I felt her tighten up just slightly. I thought to myself, 'You know what, at this point, make her win it, don't give it to her.\n\nWhen I managed to win it to 5-2, I said, 'OK, I'm still alive.\n\nThe great escape executed in incredible fashion — Wozniacki won 24 of the final 31 points in stringing together six straight games for the victory — there was time to discuss an even more personal topic.\n\nWhat could be more exciting to talk about than an on-court recovery from 5-1? For Caroline Wozniacki the answer to that question revolves around love, engagement and pending marriage.\n\nAfter winning the most prestigious title of her career at the year-end WTA Finals in Singapore last October, Wozniacki began her off-season on a Bora, Bora, French Polynesian vacation with boyfriend, former NBA player David Lee.\n\nIt was at that exotic locale where Lee, who was in the stands watching on Wednesday, popped the question to Wozniacki. He enhanced the moment by placing a dazzling oval diamond on her ring finger.\n\nWozniacki announced their engagement on social media: Happiest day of my life yesterday saying yes to my soulmate. Lee posted a She said yes note as well.\n\nAll I'll say is it was a surprise, said Wozniacki, of the engagement. It was amazing. Very happy. It was great. Everything went really well. Had the best off-season. We had a great time traveling a little bit, exploring some new places. Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.\n\nI was really recharged when I finally got back on the court again, she added. I was ready to practice and prepare for here.\n\nAn Australian Open semifinalist in 2011, Wozniacki is in contention to return to the No. 1 ranking for the first time since January 2012. She will have to reach the semifinal to possibly occupy the top spot again following this Grand Slam.\n\nWozniacki ended the 2017 season by winning the year-end WTA Finals trophy, the biggest title of the 27 she's claimed in her career. She also defended her Tokyo title, and journeyed to six additional finals last year.\n\nAs for this season, she started it by reaching the Auckland final last week.\n\nExperience, as in coming through a previous broken engagement to golfer Rory McIlroy, has taught Wozniacki that finding off-court fulfillment translates to a positive on-court outlook.\n\nFor me, feeling happy, content off the court, everything is going great, helps me play better on the court, she said. I don't have any worries. I just kind of do my thing. All I think about is the yellow ball, the net, and the lines. It just makes everything much simpler.\n\nIt's great to know I have that amazing support, she said. It makes a huge difference to me.\n\nNeedless to say, Wozniacki has a little bit of wedding on her mind even while managing to focus on her tennis. Although the couple hasn't yet announced the date, she admits to already collecting ideas for the celebration.\n\nIn November, she had occasion to take notes when she attended the wedding of good friend, Serena Williams, to Alexis Ohanian in New Orleans.\n\nYeah, definitely. she said, when asked if Williams' wedding served as a research outing. I think once you're engaged, you start looking at things. You're like, 'Oh, I really like that, we'll steal that inspiration for our own wedding.'\n\nWe had a great time, she added. Had a lot of fun. She (Williams) looked beautiful. Little Olympia (Williams' infant daughter) was beautiful, too. Really a special moment.\n\nPHOTOS: Best of the early rounds

Not all callouts require name-calling, threats of violence or even serious self-confidence.\n\nJust ask Aga Niedzwiedz (10-1 MMA, 0-0 UFC), a 22-year-old Polish vet and Invicta FC fighter who's angling for a flyweight fight with UFC mainstay Paige VanZant (7-4 MMA, 4-3 UFC).\n\nRather than the tried-and-true methods of calling out opponents, Niedzwiedz, who's coming off a competitive title loss to Jennifer Maia at Invicta FC 26, used a little self-deprecation to target VanZant.\n\nHere it is (via Twitter):\n\nI really think that Paige VanZant should get a favourable matchup next. Someone even younger than she is, without UFC experience, coming off a loss and with similar amount of pro fights. I even know fighter just like that 😂 — Aga Niedzwiedz (@NiedzwiedzMMA) February 6, 2018\n\nI really think that Paige VanZant should get a favourable matchup next. Someone even younger than she is, without UFC experience, coming off a loss and with similar amount of pro fights. I even know fighter just like that 😂\n\nWhy VanZant? The former strawweight won three of her first UFC fights but has since suffered decisive losses to Michelle Waterson and Jessica-Rose Clark. Still, 12 Gauge is gets a bigger promotional push than most UFC fighters. Plus, Niedzwiedz just wants some fresh competition (via Twitter):\n\nI would call out someone else but I know like 3 flyweights that I didn't fight yet. — Aga Niedzwiedz (@NiedzwiedzMMA) February 7, 2018\n\nDespite her age, Niedzwiedz is clearly a UFC-caliber competitor, especially in the UFC's still-developing women's 125-pound division. The six-year pro has seven stoppages in 10 career wins and owns a May 2017 decision victory over multi-time Invicta FC title challenger Vanessa Porto.\n\nIt's not clear what's next for VanZant (besides a recent marriage proposal), though Jessica Eye recently expressed interest in rebooking their bout that fell apart in October.\n\nFor more on the UFC's upcoming schedule, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMAjunkie's official blog and is edited by Mike Bohn.

PHOENIX – When Arizonans buy a license plate displaying the words In God We Trust, they are told the money promotes the motto, First Amendment rights and the heritage of this state and nation.\n\nWhat they may not know is the money supports Alliance Defending Freedom, a controversial group based in Scottsdale whose mission statement is to keep the doors open for the Gospel by advocating for religious liberty, the sanctity of life, and marriage and family.\n\nBecause of that affiliation, one Democratic lawmaker now is proposing to get rid of the In God We Trust specialty license plates.\n\nADF is designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center because of its anti-LGBT views and claims that a homosexual agenda will destroy society.\n\nADF defended its mission and responded to the call to get rid of the Arizona license plate in a written statement.\n\nIt's disappointing to see elected officials become uncritical pawns in the Southern Poverty Law Center's ugly propaganda campaigns, said Jeremy Tedesco, Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel and vice president of U.S. Advocacy.\n\nTedesco said Southern Poverty Law Center mischaracterizes his group's work.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom advocates for the freedom of all Americans to peacefully live in accordance with their beliefs, including those with no belief, Tedesco said. We represent people from all walks of life and diverse backgrounds.\n\nADF has been involved in a host of culture-war court cases: a challenge to the Obama administration directive that public schools allow transgender students to use bathrooms of their choice; the Hobby Lobby case regarding businesses' right not to provide contraception coverage to their employees for religious reasons; and Arizona's law defining marriage as between only a man and a woman.\n\nMost recently, it has been involved in the state Supreme Court case challenging Phoenix's anti-discrimination ordinancefor gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, an anti-hate advocacy group based in Montgomery, Alabama, named the ADF a hate group in 2016 because of its demonization of LGBT people and support of criminalization of gay sex in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe center has written extensively about ADF and states that it does not name groups to its anti-LGBT hate list simply for having biblical objections to homosexuality or for opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nHow the plates fund ADF\n\nThe specialty In God We Trust license plates are among many in Arizona offered to drivers through the Department of Transportation. Like the others, the plates offer $17 of the $25 purchase price to particular causes.\n\nSecular Coalition for Arizona, a group that opposes religion in government, requested that Democratic state Sen. Juan Mendez obtain data regarding exactly where the money from the In God We Trust plates has been directed.\n\nADOT only says on its website that money from the specialty plate promotes the national motto In God We Trust, First Amendment rights, and the heritage of this state and nation.\n\nA few other plates, among dozens offered by the state through ADOT, don't include explicit statements about what organization gets the money, though the recipient is noted in statute.\n\nADOT records that Alliance Defending Freedom has received more than $900,000 from the specialty plates since 2014.\n\nWe were appalled by it, said Tory Roberg, the director of government affairs for the Secular Coalition for Arizona. People really need to know where their money is going.\n\nShe said she did not know anyone who has the plate on their vehicle.\n\nSecular Coalition for Arizona did not obtain, and ADOT could immediately provide, earlier records dating back to the plate's inception in 2008.\n\nA spreadsheet from ADOT indicates 53,205 sales or renewals of the plate since 2014.\n\nADF reported income of nearly $56 million in 2017, so the Arizona plates are a small part of its budget.\n\nThe plates were approved by the Legislature in 2008 following a floor amendment from former Republican Sen. Ron Gould, Roberg said.\n\nThe state law that resulted from Gould's amendment does not specify ADF as the recipient of the money. It says only that the money will go to the Arizona non-profit that gives ADOT $32,000 to implement the plate.\n\nOther plates, such as those supporting amateur radio, the environment and the military, were created with statutes that name specifically where the money goes in addition to the state highway fund.\n\nADOT spokesman Doug Nick confirmed Tuesday that group receiving the money from the In God We Trust plate is ADF.\n\nBills target license plates\n\nMendez has introduced one bill to require ADOT to more fully disclose where the money from specialty plates goes and another to eliminate the ADF plate.\n\nHopefully in the future we can put in place some commonsense guidelines that would bar hate groups from earning money through Arizona license plates, Mendez said in a press release.\n\nState dollars should not be funding an organization that works to strip residents of our state of their human rights and human dignity. It's appalling that we've already sent over a million dollars to this extremist hate group.\n\nTedesco, from ADF, said the plates are appropriate.\n\nArizona is well within its rights to offer its citizens an opportunity to voluntarily purchase license plates affirming the First Amendment and contributing to ADF's work on behalf of the freedom of all Americans to live and work according to their beliefs, he said.\n\nSecular Coalition for Arizona is planning a petition and billboard campaign regarding the ADF license plate and is recruiting like-minded churches and groups to the cause.\n\nWhat do people not understand about the inappropriateness of this kind of fundamentalist-inspired, state-sanctioned discrimination? said David Felten, a pastor at the Fountains, a United Methodist Church in Fountain Hills, in a press release from the coalition.\n\nThis is not just an abstract violation of church-state separation. It's a very real rejection of Arizona's LGBTQ people by the very government that is supposed to impartially support and protect all of its citizens.\n\nMore:Kansas recalls some license plates after complaints they contained ethnic slurs
Adam Schupak\n\nGolfweek\n\nIn December, when Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus played with their grandsons in the PNC Bank Father-Son Challenge in Orlando, the 5-foot, 6-inch, 150-pound Player launched a drive at 18 that trickled past that of Big Jack, who in his prime would often blow tee shots half a football field past his longtime foe. This didn't sit well with the Olden Bear.\n\nHe said, 'Will you stop outdriving me already?' Player recalls. I said, 'You outdrove me for the first 40 years. Let me have the last decade.' I never thought I'd outdrive Jack and I never thought I'd be taller than him either.\n\nNicklaus might have shrunk in stature, but he remains a giant in the game as he celebrates his 80th birthday today. Whether it is designing golf courses, passing on his wisdom to the current crop of PGA Tour stars, hosting PGA Tour events or his philanthropic work, Nicklaus is as relevant in the game as ever.\n\nTake the kids, as he calls them, including Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and just last week Patrick Rodgers, who have come to The Bears Club, the club Nicklaus founded in Jupiter, Florida, in 1999, for lunch with the 18-time major champion or to his house to drink from his fountain of knowledge as if it were ambrosia. Charl Schwartzel and Trevor Immelman both parlayed advice before the Masters into being fitted for green jackets, and Patrick Cantlay asked for some tips on how to play Muirfield Village Golf Club before winning The Memorial at Jack's Place in June.\n\nSUPER BOWL:Ranking every one from best to worst\n\nTYING THE KNOT:Tim Tebow, Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters announce their marriage\n\nHow many 22-year-olds come to an 80-year-old for advice? Not many. I say, 'You never listened to your dad, so why would you listen to your great grandfather?' They happen to listen to me, Nicklaus says. I impart my experience that you have to play within yourself. The whole idea is don't beat yourself.\n\nHe has been the best at giving advice on how to play golf. Not how to swing, but how to play the game. He's talked to me about his strategy and how to play the golf course and how to play the game and what he thought, says Rory McIlroy, who more than nine years ago was winless on the PGA Tour when he listened to Nicklaus preach patience. Soon after, McIlroy shot a final-round 62 at the Quail Hollow Championship to earn his first Tour title.\n\nThe common denominator for him and Tiger is they are the best thinkers in the game. Just to pick Jack's brain about that, and about preparation, and how he got himself around a golf course, that's the best advice you can get. He was a master at playing the game.\n\nMost people retire so they can play golf; Nicklaus retired as a competitor in 2005 and then ramped up his work building golf courses around the globe. Nicklaus is the first to concede that without his playing career, none of his design business happens.\n\nNobody would have listened to me. Golf has allowed me to actually discover something I didn't even know I had. It's allowed me to leave something beyond my game and my life, he says. Fifty years from now, no one's going to see me play golf. But they'll see several hundred golf courses, and they'll understand that they were expressions of how I felt.\n\nAge has also mellowed Nicklaus the designer, who used to be criticized for making courses that only he could play.\n\nAs you get older and don't play as much, you realize what a humbling game it is, Nicklaus says. I design a lot more for the members' tee. People of all walks of life and all skill levels want to play, and as an architect, you want them to enjoy it.\n\nNicklaus says he has nine or 10 golf courses he's working on right now in some stage of development. Chris Cochran, one of Nicklaus Design's longtime associates, tells a story of a course in Sweden that is on the drawing board that shows Nicklaus' passion for design is alive and well. Unhappy with the routing and with a sudden burst of inspiration, Nicklaus climbed out of bed, had flood lights turned on, and walked the site until he arrived at a solution.\n\nYou might have figured that Nicklaus was slowing down when he announced in February 2018 that he was stepping away from day-to-day operations of his companies. You'd have thought wrong. To hear Nicklaus tell it, he basically got rid of all the parts of the job he was tired of doing and maintained the public speaking engagements, occasional golf exhibitions, course design work and fundraising he enjoys.\n\nI think everybody would like to do that, he muses.\n\nIndeed, his calendar sure doesn't look like that of a man who is taking it easy. Nicklaus struck the opening tee shot at the Masters in April last year and teamed with Player in the Legends of Golf; hosted the PGA Tour's Memorial Tournament the month after that; and opened more golf courses, including one in Russia and his first in Latvia.\n\nHe has attached his name to products ranging from golf balls, wine, beverages and restaurants to lifestyle items such as apparel and footwear.\n\nPlayer calls retirement a death warrant, and Nicklaus still only operates at two speeds, says his longtime PR man Scott Tolley: go and giddy-up.\n\nI certainly don't have any reason to want to go curl up in a corner someplace, Nicklaus says.\n\nMost of his efforts are geared to raising money with wife, Barbara, chair and co-founder of the Nicklaus Children's Health Care Foundation, which was established in 2004 to support numerous pediatric healthcare services in South Florida and across the U.S.\n\nWe're just getting started, Nicklaus says. She's supported me for 50 years; now it's my turn and that's what I'm doing, and frankly I really enjoy it and it's been eye opening to me. We're getting ready to start a legacy fund – something that will last well beyond Barbara and I are gone.\n\nLast year, Jack and Barbara pledged to raise $100 million over the next five years for children's hospitals through the Play Yellow campaign.\n\nNicklaus lives in North Palm Beach, Florida, these days, but his signature tournament has another central purpose, and that is to enrich the community of his youth. The Memorial has generated more than $36 million for central Ohio charities since 1976, with more than $20 million given to the Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n\nIt's the greatest second act maybe in terms of a meaningfulness, what you do with your life to affect others, says CBS Sports commentator Jim Nantz. What Jack has done after arguably the greatest golf career of all time to now go to a stage in life, thanks to Barbara's leadership, all these children they are helping, all these hospitals that have popped up; it's an amazing thing.\n\nI'm in awe of them.\n\nNicklaus might be officially an octogenarian, but he won't let a bad back and a bum shoulder from tennis slow him down. He's far from done with his second act. Giddy-up.
Like the rest of us, Randy Newman is just trying to catch up on movies before Oscar night.\n\nFrom what he's seen so far, 'Parasite' is the best picture, along with 'Marriage Story,'  Newman, 76, says by phone last weekend. And I saw a bit of that Jennifer Lopez picture, 'Hustlers.' I'm surprised she wasn't nominated. What do you have to do? I mean, she was really good.\n\nIf anyone knows how to score a date with an Oscar, it's Newman. The beloved singer/composer is going into this year's ceremony with not one, but two nominations: best original score, for Noah Baumbach's poignant divorce drama Marriage Story and best original song, for the playful I Can't Let You Throw Yourself Away from Disney/Pixar's Toy Story 4. They're the 21st and 22nd nods for Newman, who's won two Oscars for songs written for Monsters, Inc. and Toy Story 3.\n\nUSA TODAY caught up with the music icon ahead of Sunday's show (ABC, 8 EST/5 PST).\n\nOscar nominations 2020:See the complete list of nominees\n\nOscar predictions: Who will win Academy Awards – and who should\n\nQuestion: Congratulations on your Oscar nominations this year. How did you hear the news?\n\nRandy Newman: My son, who's my agent also, sent me a text. I've been nominated a number of times and I always like it. I've never minded much, believe it or not, not winning for 10, 15 straight times. But when I finally did win (in 2002 for Monsters, Inc.), I was happy.\n\nQ: At your 21st and 22nd nominations, is there a point when you stop counting?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: No, it's special every single time. It's recognition by your peers – I like it, it's a nice feeling. But if you don't get nominated, it's not devastating. It's just the way it goes.\n\nQ: Most of your film score work the past two decades has been in animation. Did you miss doing a live-action drama?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: Yeah, I didn't have the opportunity to do it. Or if I got offered a picture, I was often doing something else. I think I do a good job on those animated pictures but they're difficult to do. Probably what I do best is drama or romance.\n\nQ: How did you approach Marriage Story differently than other scores you've done? I understand you used a chamber orchestra, for instance.\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: I did use a chamber orchestra, but cut down. It didn't seem like (Baumbach) wanted it to be overwhelmed with trumpets and trombones, so I didn't use any. There was no big stuff – there was no call for it, it wasn't X-Men. With (Scarlett Johansson's character), I used more piano and strings, whereas with (Adam Driver's), it was a little more forceful and we had a couple French horns in there. But it was different for me writing for that size orchestra. Toy Story orchestras are really big – like 100 guys, maybe more – and this was about 40. So when you write something for an oboe, you really hear it.\n\nQ: Your cousin, Thomas Newman, is also competing for best original score for 1917. How does that feel?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: If I don't win, I hope he wins, but I got a feeling neither one of us will. It's a pretty good field. I have a feeling (Hildur Gudnadottir for) Joker will.\n\nQ: Have you seen Joker?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: Yeah, I have. I liked it. It was all right.\n\nOscar nominations 2020:'Joker' leads with 11 nods, including best picture\n\nQ: The last time you and Thomas were nominated in the same year for original score was 1996. (Randy for Toy Story, Thomas for Unstrung Heroes) Is there some family rivalry between you guys?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: I think we're both competitive, but don't admit it. I love it when I see him and I love him, but we don't see each other a great deal. It's a funny family.\n\nQ: Along with Marriage Story, you're nominated for best original song for Toy Story 4. Did you have any initial reservations about coming back for another one?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: Yeah, I thought, Well, what are they going to do? They ended it when Andy went away (to college). But they came up with something, and it got better and better as they worked on it, and they made another good picture. They have every time. It has been all animated for me for years, but they're good pictures and they have everything: cowboy stuff, space stuff. Everything but a Woody and Buzz romance.\n\nQ: The song, I Can't Let You Throw Yourself Away, comes early in the movie when Forky is having an existential crisis about whether he's trash. Was that scene inherently funny on the page, or how did you go about writing a song for it?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: At that point, (the animators) just had drawings but they had the timings down, so I knew what was going to fall where. Often what I do is just very literal: You've got a friend in me, you've got a friend in me, you've got a friend in me. It's what they wanted in the first picture, to emphasize the friendship between Andy and Woody. And in this one, it was clear: Woody was trying to (stop) him from throwing himself away and that's what I wrote. I've written songs for pictures where they were all right, but I like this one. It's catchy.\n\nQ: What did you think of Forky, watching the movie for the first time?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: I thought he'd be a star, which I guess he is. I thought he was very funny. The sort of obstinate stupidity he showed really appealed to me.\n\nQ: Outside of your work in movies, many of your songs as a singer-songwriter are political and satirical. What do you get out of film scoring that's different? Is it like stretching another muscle?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: It's half of what I do. It's an opportunity to get out of myself, to not be writing in the style I'm usually writing, which is a character who's often a little bit off or wrong or doesn't know so much about himself. In these, sometimes it's straight ahead. I was happy to write that Sarah McLachlan song (When She Loved Me from Toy Story 2.) Somehow, I don't write those for myself very much, but I'm glad I wrote You've Got a Friend – I never would've written it just for myself. I also like working with an orchestra very much. Those four, five days recording are the best days I have in general.\n\nQ: Do you find much crossover between the fans who enjoy your solo work and Pixar music?\n\nNewman​​​​​​​: Most of them are all sort of familiar with the movie work, one way or another. There are definitely people who start with the movie stuff and then find the (solo work). But there's no way that I'm going to have a success that matches the success the Toy Story pictures have had. So inevitably, songs from these pictures are going to be the most popular stuff I have, which is fine with me.
Nick Cannon has had it with the institution of marriage.\n\nI don't believe in marriage anymore, the 39-year-old rapper, writer, producer, television host told Entertainment Tonight in an interview ahead of a blind date with a listener of his morning show Nick Cannon Mornings on Power 106.\n\nCannon was married to Mariah Carey, who will be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2020, for about eight years, from 2008 to 2016. After the couple's divorce, he is not repeating that romantic step: I have done that. I don't like doing things that I am not good at, he said.\n\nCarey and Cannon married in April 2008 and had their twins, Monroe and Moroccan, in 2011. The couple filed for divorce in 2014 and it was finalized two years later, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nHe told Entertainment Tonight that he hasn't gotten the hang of the relationship thing. Carey and Cannon maintain a friendly relationship, Entertainment Tonight reports.\n\nIf you jumped out of a plane on time and it did not work out — you would not do it again, would you? he said. I barely survived. Why would I jump out of the plane again?\n\nIn spite of his reluctance to marry again, Cannon called himself a hopeless romantic. He's dating but wants to make sure that his children don't think of him as a player — his kids have called him one before.\n\nI was like, 'Who taught you that word? he said in the interview. Who's been talking to you?' And (Moroccan was) like, 'Dad you can't be a player forever.' I'm like, this is the worst.\n\nFormer 'AGT' host Nick Cannon:Backs Gabrielle Union, doesn't let Terry Crews off the hook\n\nMariah Carey:Is the first artist to have a No. 1 song span four decades on Billboard's Hot 100
Rick Steves\n\nSometimes in travel, the journey is the reward. And that is particularly true in Europe, where travelers can enjoy special trains, buses and boats that link destinations near and far, high and low, urban and rural, often through spectacular scenery.\n\nOne of my favorite journeys is called Norway in a Nutshell, a series of coordinated bus, train and ferry rides that connects the cities of Oslo and Bergen — all while weaving its way through Norway's fjord country to show off the full tapestry of its scenic grandeur.\n\nThe journey starts with a five-hour train ride from Oslo to a high-mountain station called Myrdal. This is simply the most spectacular train ride in northern Europe. The scenery crescendos as you climb over the crest of Norway's mountainous midlands. After a mild three hours of deep woods and lakes, you're treated at last to the glaciers and barren tundra of the Norwegian highland. At Myrdal, a super-scenic tourist train takes you down to the fjordside hamlet of Flåm, winding past waterfalls and through 20 tunnels in 55 thrilling minutes.\n\nFlåm is the departure point for the two-hour ferry ride on two breathtaking fjords to the village of Gudvangen. As you cruise through the world's narrowest fjord, you'll feel the mist falling from black cliffs high above, and — especially on a sunny day — the hillsides appear to be within arm's reach. From Gudvangen, a bus zips you scenically through the mountains to the town of Voss, where you'll board a train to your destination, Bergen — a less impressive but still plenty picturesque finale to the Nutshell tour.\n\nMore:Trains, glorious trains: Best rail photos and galleries\n\nIf any country rivals Norway when it comes to the marriage of amazing scenery and efficient transportation, it's Switzerland. While most train rides in Switzerland are photogenic, four are aggressively marketed as the most spectacular. Of those rail journeys, my pick is the Golden Pass.\n\nThis route cuts a swath diagonally across the pristine center of the country, connecting Luzern with Lake Geneva. The five-hour journey has three segments, with two transfers. Some of the trains offer panoramic cars with huge windows that curve back into the roof of the train car, allowing for views of high mountains from a wider angle.\n\nMy favorite part is the two-hour trip between Zweisimmen and Montreux (the final stretch, if you're coming from Luzern). Those who reserve a VIP seat in the first car enjoy an unobstructed view of pristine alpine scenery coming right at you.\n\nLeaving Zweisimmen, the train rolls through varied landscapes, starting in the German-speaking region before entering French Switzerland. With the change in language comes a change in culture and architecture. French-style stone houses start to replace half-timbered, woodsy, German-style chalets.\n\nAt one point, the train surges through Jaman Tunnel, engulfing you in nearly 2 miles of darkness. When you emerge, you're in another world, leaving the feudal Middle Ages and entering the 19th-century belle époque. The train passes through a series of sharp bends as it descends from the mountains down to Lake Geneva. Palm trees, vineyards, gardens and many resort spas indicate that you've arrived in the warmer climate of the Swiss Riviera.\n\nAnother scenic journey that never gets old is along Germany's Rhine River. It's storybook Germany, a fairy-tale world of legends and robber-baron castles. After 30 years of cruising the Rhine gorge on nostalgic old riverboats, I still get a thrill.\n\nThe Rhine flows about 750 miles north from Switzerland to Holland, but the 36-mile stretch between Mainz and Koblenz hoards all the touristic charm. The whole section can be done by boat (about five hours downstream, eight hours up). With limited time, focus on the most scenic hour — from St. Goar to Bacharach. Sit on the top deck and enjoy the parade of castles, towns, boats and vineyards.\n\nWhile you'll glimpse many castles along the Rhine, several are particularly notable. Marksburg Castle, the best-looking of the bunch, stands bold and white, and is restored to look like most Rhine castles once did, with their slate stonework covered with stucco to look as if they were made from a richer stone. Perched above the pleasant town of St. Goar, the mighty ruins of Rheinfels Castle, which ruled the river for more than 500 years, still exude a hint of menace. Near Bingen, Rheinstein Castle has a medieval-as-can-be, 13th-century exterior with a 19th-century duke's hunting palace inside.\n\nThe shipshape Pfalz Castle (built in the middle of the river in the 1300s) worked effectively to tax medieval river traffic, raising its chains when boats came, and lowering them only when merchants had paid their duty. Those who didn't pay spent time touring its prison, on a raft at the bottom of its well. Along the Rhine, it seems each castle comes with a story.\n\nRick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.

Matt McCarthy\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nWhen we meet Lauren Slater at the beginning of her ambitious new book, Blue Dreams: The Science and the Story of Drugs That Changed Our Minds (Little, Brown, 399 pp., ★★★ out of four), her life is a mess.\n\nThe psychologist's marriage has dissolved, her kidneys are failing, and so is her memory. At fifty-four years old, she writes, my body is in the shape of an octogenarian with issues.\n\nAdversity breeds introspection, however, and she uses the turmoil as the launching point for a deep dive into her own remarkable battles with mental illness. Is it worth the bumpy ride?\n\nWe begin, as many memoirs do, with scenes from a difficult childhood: Slater's mother was abusive and by age 10 our narrator finds herself in psychotherapy. The revolving-door mental patient is hospitalized five times between the ages of 13 and 24, both for bipolar disorder as well as an eating disorder, and she has spent the better part of adulthood popping an array of mood-altering pills, including Geodon, Abilify and Risperdal.\n\nShe credits Prozac with rescuing her from decades of mental instability, confessing that the antidepressant gave her the ability to work and love and care for her two children. (Twenty years ago, Slater caused a sensation with her memoir Prozac Diary.)\n\nSlater has a doctorate in psychology and understands neuroscience in far greater detail than the average patient. This allows her to bounce between first-person narrative and historical survey, with middling results. We review seminal moments in drug discovery, including the development of Thorazine and lithium, but those tales have been told in greater depth and detail elsewhere. I found myself wanting less of those stories and far more of hers.\n\nSlater's depictions of madness are terrifying and fascinating — she vividly details her own mental breakdown with bracing candor — and she brings something new to a well-worn genre. We learn of the time she stayed up all night compulsively polishing rocks she believed were actually precious gems (they weren't) before tumbling into depression. It was like having the turf pulled out from under me; a whisk and a whoa and all of a sudden, in one terrible second, I recognized that I was a forty-something female standing amid stones that were scattered everywhere.\n\nIn the depths of despair, she has a recurring thought: the sun will never set. It will burn on and on, depriving us of darkness and the cold, drenching the world in hysterical white light. An image of the author staring powerlessly at the midday sky, quietly begging for a reprieve from suffering, is something I haven't been able to shake. It's how so many of us feel as we sleepwalk through life, bouncing from one forgettable task to the next.\n\nIn the course of any given day at the hospital, I see a handful of patients who are struggling with varying degrees of undiagnosed mental illness. Initiating a conversation about these conditions can be challenging, especially for people who are skeptical of doctors and our broken medical system.\n\nSlater's book provides a useful entry point for these patients and their families, and fills in many of the gaps that doctors fail to address in the course of a routine consultation — and she does so with uncommon honesty. Thanks to psychiatry's drugs, she admits, I have a mind that can appreciate the beauty around me, but on the other hand, thanks to psychiatry's drugs, I am dying faster than you are.\n\n—————\n\nMatt McCarthy, an internist at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, is the author of The Real Doctor Will See You Shortly.
AP\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina could end up atop the Southeastern Conference standings, if the Gamecocks can defend their homecourt this week.\n\nSouth Carolina (20-3, 7-3 SEC) hosts league-leader LSU (15-8, 8-2) on Wednesday night before playing No. 22 Kentucky, which is tied with the Gamecocks and No. 15 Texas A&M in second place, on Saturday.\n\nThe Gamecocks have already won 20 games for the first time since the 2008-09 season after grinding out a victory at the Aggies on Saturday — Texas A&M was 13-0 at home before South Carolina's 81-78 win.\n\nNot the Gamecocks are done.\n\nForward Sindarius Thornwell said it's important for the team to stay level headed, despite none of the players having been in this spot before.\n\nWe try not to get into it or too excited because it can always chance, said Thornwell, who had a season high 25 points against Texas A&M. We try and stay in the moment and do what we've been doing.\n\nSouth Carolina coach Frank Martin has also learned not to get too far ahead of himself in title chases. He recalled his first season as Kansas State's head coach in 2008 when his Wildcats were 8-2 in the Big 12 and in the thick of the league race.\n\nMartin looked harder at conference standings, checked in on games of other contenders and listened to more national analysts projecting his team's future.\n\nThen his squad suffered four straight defeats that took it out of the championship picture, the coach said with a rueful chuckle.\n\nI said, 'My God, this is all irrelevant,' Martin remembered.\n\nMartin has his attention now is solely on LSU, a message he'll try to drive home to his players this week.\n\nDo I know what if we win Wednesday, we're in first place? Yeah, of course, I do. And our players know that, too, he said. It's my job to get them ready to win the game.\n\nThe Gamecocks have used a blend of veterans and youth to win the most games in Martin's four seasons. Senior Michael Carrera leads South Carolina with 14.7 points and 7.2 rebounds a game. Thornwell, a junior, leads in assists and steals.\n\nMcDonald's All-American PJ Dozier has started every game in his debut season while 6-foot-9 freshman Chris Silva has started the past three games, supplanting senior Laimonas Chatkevicius in the lineup because of his athleticism and willingness to battle underneath in the rugged SEC. Silva and his frontcourt teammates will have their hands full Wednesday with LSU's Ben Simmons, the 6-10 freshman who's third in SEC scoring at 19.4 points a game.\n\nHe keeps you up night thinking of how to defend him, Martin said.\n\nSouth Carolina's only SEC basketball title — it shared the SEC Eastern Division crown with Tennessee in 2008-09 — came in 1996-97. The Gamecocks went 15-1 in the league, sweeping both games with SEC powerhouse and then defending national champion Kentucky.\n\nCarrera said the Gamecocks can't get caught up in scoreboard watching with a month left in the season.\n\nIt's one game at a time, he said. We can't even worry beyond that.\n\nIt continues a major basketball run at the school this week. It was a sold-out, 18,000-seat arena Monday night for the second-ranked Gamecocks 66-54 loss to No. 1 UConn in a women's basketball showdown. The men's game with Kentucky is also a sell out and only a few hundred tickets remain for LSU.\n\nThat's the big-game, home atmosphere Martin, in his fourth season, expected to bring the Gamecocks after leaving Kansas State after the 2011-12 season.\n\nWe're still early in the marriage, Martin said. We're starting to get a little more committed to each other.\n\nA winning week would speed up the bonding process.
Brian Lyman and Andrew J. Yawn\n\nMontgomery (Ala.) Advertiser\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama's governor, embroiled in impeachment proceedings that began Monday, resigned Monday afternoon amid a criminal probe into claims of misuse of state resources to pursue and later cover up his affair with a former staffer.\n\nAllegations of the affair with Rebekah Caldwell Mason, 45, which consumed his administration for more than a year, broke up GOP Gov. Robert Bentley's marriage of 50 years in 2015. Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey, 72, became Alabama's second female governor and its first female Republican governor when she was sworn in at 6 p.m. CT.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Bentley, 74, was booked into Montgomery County Jail on two misdemeanor campaign finance charges. He pleaded guilty to failing to file a major campaign finance report and converting campaign money for personal use, was sentenced to a 30-day suspended sentence and 12 months of unsupervised probation, ordered to surrender almost $37,000 in unused campaign money, fined about $16,000 additionally and told to serve 100 hours of community service.\n\n► More: Alabama's new governor, Kate Ivey, promises open administration\n\n► More: Robert Bentley, an unlikely governor ... an unexpected end\n\nBentley also gave up his right to seek public office again, his ability to appeal the sentence and all retirement benefits.\n\nThere have been times when I have let you and our people down, and I'm sorry for that, Bentley said in late afternoon in the Old House Chamber in the State Capitol after his guilty plea. The consequences of my mistakes have been grievously unfair to you, my dedicated staff and my Cabinet.\n\nThe misdemeanor sentence means that Bentley, a dermatologist since he left the U.S. Air Force, will be able to keep his medical license. He intends to serve his 100 hours of community service performing dermatological work in rural Alabama counties, but it wasn't immediately clear whether his plea would halt a further investigation.\n\n► More: Report: Alabama's governor misused vehicles, personnel for affair\n\n► More: Alabama governor seeks forgiveness in wake of ethics ruling\n\nBentley's governorship became increasingly overshadowed by allegations he pursued an affair with Mason, attempted to use state resources to aid it, and tried to persuade state law enforcement to cover it up. The allegations led to an unprecedented impeachment hearing, something not attempted in 102 years.\n\nRobert Bentley, governor of Alabama, directed law enforcement to advance his personal interests over those of the state, Jack Sharman, special counsel for the House Judiciary Committee, told state lawmakers Monday afternoon. In timelines characterized by increasingly desperate conduct, he subjected honest career law enforcement to tasks to protect his reputation, both political and personal.\n\nIt was the first-ever impeachment directed at an Alabama governor, and the first impeachment the chamber had considered since 1915.\n\nHouse Speaker Mac McCutcheon, a Republican from Monrovia, Ala., said Monday night that he was grateful that Governor Bentley has seen the writing on the wall.\n\nBentley's resignation cut short the proceedings to remove him from office. Throughout this past week he had maintained his innocence, denied doing anything illegal and insisted he would not resign.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Alabama Ethics Commission found probable cause that the governor had violated ethics and campaign finance laws and forwarded its conclusions to Montgomery County's district attorney, Daryl Bailey, for prosecution. Its report proved a major blow to Bentley and what little political capital he had remaining in the Legislature.\n\nBy Friday afternoon, Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh and McCutcheon — both Republicans who had previously steered clear of comments on impeachment or Bentley's legal woes — called on Bentley to resign and scheduled the impeachment hearing.\n\nLater the same afternoon, a damaging impeachment report prepared for the state House Judiciary Committee depicted Bentley as obsessed with recovering recordings of conversations between him and Mason that then-first lady Dianne Bentley had made. The governor threatened staffers who knew or whom he thought knew about the affair and sent law enforcement to recover the tapes or question those he thought might know about them.\n\nThe governor also was accused of using a member of his security team on at least two occasions to try to break up with Mason. She remains with her husband, according to her Facebook page.\n\nThe report alleges Bentley brought Mason with him in state vehicles and aircraft, at times overriding his security detail to do so. Sharman said he requested and received pre-edited flight logs for his investigation.\n\nThe report also depicted the governor becoming emotionally unstable over the relationship, wavering between tearful contrition and angry defiance, to the point of threatening staffers who knew or who he believed knew about the existence of the tapes.\n\nBentley's lawyers fought back against the impeachment hearing. The governor had a limited ability to ask questions of witnesses and mount a defense, but his defense team insisted that he should be able to confront and cross-examine witnesses before the state House Judiciary Committee. Montgomery County Circuit Judge Greg Griffin delayed the hearings Friday after the governor's lawyers made that argument in court.\n\nOn Saturday, the Alabama Supreme Court reversed that ruling.\n\nBy Monday, Bailey had sent the state Ethics Commission findings to Ellen Brooks, serving as acting attorney general in a probe that office is conducting into Bentley's conduct. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, appointed by the governor in February, recused himself from the Bentley investigation shortly afterward.\n\n► More: Alabama governor may face prosecution after ethics ruling\n\n► 2016: Scandal-plagued Ala. governor faces new impeachment articles\n\nIn the impeachment hearing, Sharman began his opening arguments against Bentley, mainly outlining the history of impeachment and the Alabama Constitution's somewhat hazy description of it.\n\nImpeachment is the people's check against political excess, Sharman told the committee. It is a remedy of the state as opposed to punishment for an individual as in a criminal case.\n\nBentley's lawyers had been expected to make their case Tuesday, now unnecessary.\n\nWhile the potential impeachment of a sitting governor was unprecedented, the governor's ordeal was only part of a larger leadership crisis in state government for more than 2½ years:\n\n• In June, House Speaker Mike Hubbard was convicted on 12 felony ethics charges and removed from office.\n\n• In September, Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore was suspended for the remainder of his term after instructing probate judges in the state, in defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, to not issue same-sex marriage licenses.\n\nRep. Mike Ball, a Republican from Madison, Ala., and a member of the House Judiciary Committee, recused himself from Bentley's hearing. Jones, who announced the recusal, did not provide a reason.\n\nBall had signed the articles of impeachment filed against Bentley in May. The governor's legal team had tried to get everyone on the committee who signed the articles of impeachment to recuse themselves.\n\nBentley took no questions at his Monday press conference and did not say what led him to change his mind about resigning. He did say he realized some things (were) more important than a political office and hoped to find a way to continue service in his state.\n\nFollow Brian Lyman and Andrew J.

White House staff secretary Rob Porter, known as a part of President Trump's inner circle, resigned from his position Wednesday following accusations of abuse from his ex-wives.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nWho is he?\n\nRob Porter, 40, is a White House staff secretary who worked closely with Trump, often accompanying him on official travel. He's even credited with helping craft Trump's State of the Union address. As staff secretary, Porter is responsible for the flow of presidential paperwork around the West Wing and to the president's desk. The job is an important gatekeeper to the Oval Office, ensuring that executive orders, decision memos, bills, nominations and other actions are thoroughly vetted before reaching the president.\n\nWhile he resigned from the position Wednesday, he isn't leaving immediately. He'll stay on to ensure a smooth transition, according to the White House.\n\nPorter joined the Trump administration in January 2017. He is a a Harvard Law School graduate and worked as chief of staff to Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch for almost three years. Porter also worked for Republican Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\nHere's what his ex-wives say\n\nOne ex-wife, Colbie Holderness, alleges Porter had choked, punched and emotionally abused her during their five-year marriage. Holderness told her story to the Daily Mail, providing photos that featured her with a black eye.\n\nAnother ex-wife, Jennifer Willoughby, told the same publication that Porter verbally abused her on their 2009 honeymoon and once dragged her out of the shower.\n\nHow Porter responded to the allegations\n\nPorter called the allegations outrageous and simply false.\n\nI took the photos given to the media nearly 15 years ago and the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described, Porter said in a statement. I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign.\n\nPorter said his commitment to public service speaks for itself.\n\nJohn Kelly was 'shocked' at the accusations\n\nWhite House chief of staff John Kelly said Wednesday night he was shocked by the new allegations, adding there is no place for domestic violence in our society. I stand by my previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming Chief of Staff, and believe every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation. I accepted his resignation earlier today, and will ensure a swift and orderly transition.\n\nEarlier, Kelly defended Porter, saying he had full confidence in Porter's abilities and performance. That remark drew criticism from a former director of the Office of Government Ethics. Walter Shaub tweeted Thursday that Kelly protected a wife beater.\n\nJessica Estepa, Gregory Korte and David Jackson contributed to this report. Follow Ashley May on Twitter: @AshleyMayTweets

Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThose crafty devils at PBS have come up with a plan to ameliorate viewer withdrawal symptoms when Downton Abbey ends soon: Queen Victoria.\n\nThe thinking goes: If American viewers loved the manners, costumes, settings and soapy plots of 1920s Downton, they'll love the real-history story of teen-queen Victoria from an era almost 100 years earlier. Won't they?\n\nPBS pooh-bahs announced Monday at the TV critics conference in Pasadena that the eight-part series Victoria, starring Jenna Coleman, will settle into the Masterpiece time slot on Sunday nights at 9 pm (ET) starting in January 2017.\n\nMasterpiece executive producer Rebecca Eaton has no doubts.\n\nDownton Abbey has proved that millions of viewers will turn up year after year for a beautifully crafted period drama, she said. Victoria has it all: a riveting script, brilliant cast, and spectacular locations. And it's a true story! This is exactly the kind of programming Masterpiece fans will love.\n\nWe shall see, but it's worth remembering that a movie on the same subject, The Young Victoria, starring Emily Blunt, didn't set movie-goers on fire in 2009.\n\nOn the other hand, this series will star Coleman as the 18-year-old queen, which should attract scores of Doctor Who fans. The Whovians mourned en masse in November when Coleman's beloved character on the long-running British series, companion Clara Oswald, shuffled off this mortal coil.\n\nThere's plenty of evidence American viewers do love the British royals on PBS, especially the current Windsors, who all descend from the imperial and imperious Victoria Regina, a short (just over 5 feet) woman with a long reign (63 years) and a long life (she died in 1901 at age 81). Until last September, when her great-great granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II, surpassed her, Victoria was Britain's longest-serving monarch.\n\nBut her early life was pathetic, even tragic. Held almost prisoner in a palace by her manipulative German-born widowed mother and her mother's devious majordomo, Victoria was a powerless pawn of her royal relatives and her feckless uncles-turned-kings. Then the last one died in 1837 and, as the next in line, suddenly she was queen of the world's then-most important country. She was barely 18.\n\nHer first royal decision: Good bye mom.\n\nThe series follows Victoria from the time she becomes queen, through her courtship (under protocol, she had to do the proposing) and passionate marriage to her German cousin, Prince Albert, her prince-consort and the father of her nine children.\n\nVictoria was by turns stubborn, spirited and flirty with her ministers, jealous of her power as sovereign and weary of its burdens, horrified about pregnancy and obsessive about running every detail of her children's lives.\n\nWhen Albert died young, she retreated into decades of grim, black-draped mourning, rarely seen by her subjects. But she never stopped scribbling in her journals and writing thousands of letters, pouring out her thoughts with a candor so striking that one of her daughters hastily burned some parts after her death.\n\nAnd regarding her heir, Prince Bertie, later Edward VII, Victoria was even more abusive of him than her mother was to her, blaming him unfairly for, among other things, Albert's death.\n\nAll in all, her early life has plenty of fodder for another epic PBS Brit-soap.\n\nIn addition to Coleman, the series cast will feature Rufus Sewell (The Man in the High Castle) as Lord Melbourne, her first prime minister whom she adored; Tom Hughes (Dancing on the Edge) as Prince Albert; Alex Jennings (The Lady in the Van) as King Leopold of Belgium, who was uncle to both Victoria and Albert; Paul Rhys (Borgia) as Sir John Conroy, overweening adviser to Victoria's mother; and Peter Firth (MI-5) as Victoria's conniving uncle, the Duke of Cumberland.\n\nThe series, a co-production with Mammoth Screen (Poldark) for ITV, was created and written by best-selling novelist Daisy Goodwin, who, PBS said, read up to 62 million words from Victoria's diaries as part of her research for the series.
Elysa Gardner\n\n@elysagardner, USA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK — Sugar, butter and flour are the first words we hear in the new Broadway musical Waitress (* * * ½ out of four) — simple ingredients that can produce scrumptious, and healing, results.\n\nThat's certainly the case with this delightful adaptation of Adrienne Shelly's 2007 film, which followed a small-town gal trapped in an unhappy marriage but blessed with a prodigious talent for making pies. Arriving in a season that has brought Hamilton and now the majestically unsettling American Psycho, the new musical may initially strike you as — pardon the inescapable food metaphors — a modest confection.\n\nBut Waitress, which opened Sunday at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre, rises and nourishes, thanks largely to the complementary contributions of a number of women artists. They begin with Shelly herself, who in a horrific twist was murdered shortly before the film's premiere.\n\nJessie Nelson's libretto retains the warm, gutsy spirit and earthy wit that marked the original screenplay, while pop singer/songwriter Sara Bareilles provides a folk-based score that shimmers and charms, never straining too hard for theatricality. Director Diane Paulus, currently represented on Broadway by the lush crowd-pleaser Finding Neverland — and earlier by exuberant, haunting revivals of Pippin and Hair — adapts to a smaller scale with compassion and insight. The struggles and yearnings of Waitress's working-class characters are represented without sentimentality or condescension.\n\nPaulus is also fortunate in having Jessie Mueller for her leading lady. A Tony Award winner for her uncanny portrait of the title character in 2014's Beautiful: The Carole King Musical, Mueller is a gifted actress with a singing voice that can stretch to a crystalline soprano, but also accommodated an uncanny simulation of King's quirky, nasal style. As Waitress's Jenna (who was introduced on screen by a wry, luminous Keri Russell), Mueller gets to reveal the textured beauty of her own lower register, and her emotional intuition and discretion as a singer.\n\nJenna is also another showcase for the gentle pluck and vulnerability Mueller has brought to various roles. The undervalued durability of female friendship is very much in focus in Waitress, and Mueller has supple support in the women who play her co-workers. Keala Settle serves up a juicy comedic performance as the feisty, seen-it-all Becky, while Kimiko Glenn is adorable and affecting as the blooming wallflower Dawn.\n\nThe men deliver as well, particularly Drew Gehling, masterfully goofy and deeply endearing as Dr. Pomatter, the obstetrician who enters Jenna's life when she discovers that her louse of a husband has gotten her pregnant. As Jenna's relationship with her doctor grows deeper and more complicated, and funnier, Dawn lands her own romantic interest: Ogie, a tax accountant (played by a hilarious Christopher Fitzgerald) with poetic aspirations and an early American history fetish.\n\nThese characters have learned, certainly, that life isn't as easy as pie. But as they remind us, we need to find the sweetness and savor it.
CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. – Imagine meeting the love of your life at a bar only to get deployed the next day, then seeing that person again months later. For Bret and Susan Fenske, that one night of instant chemistry turned into two children, daily love letters and 30 years of marriage.\n\nOn her 18th birthday, Susan ran away from her troubled East Tennessee home and moved to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to live with her sister. She started dancing at a club to earn money, and one night, she met the man of her dreams.\n\nIt was instant chemistry, she said.\n\nWhy do we celebrate Valentine's Day? In the early years, it was more goat blood than roses\n\nShe was working as a dancer at a cocktail bar...\n\nIn 1990, Bret, an Army Ranger, was stationed at Fort Bragg and enjoying a night out on the town before deployment.\n\nI went to a bar one evening and saw Susan and immediately fell in love, Bret said. We talked for a while, and I waited for her after she got off and met her out in the parking lot. We exchanged a kiss, and the very next day, I was deployed to Panama.\n\nWhile Bret was deployed, he wrote Susan love letters every day, but he never got a letter back. He found out they were piled up at the military postal office, never making their way to Susan.\n\nBret said he wrote so many letters to let Susan know he never lost interest, even though the two spent only one hour together. The letters were mostly about adventures Bret wanted to explore with Susan when he returned.\n\nAfter two months, Bret returned to Fort Bragg and went to the same bar Susan worked at, hoping to find her, but the bar was closed. I thought that I would never see her again because we hadn't exchanged any numbers.\n\nBret and his friends decided to go to another bar that night. As they parked their car, another car pulled up beside them.\n\nMiraculously, it was Susan.\n\nBret said he remembers yelling her name when he saw her face. It was literally like a sketch out of a movie.\n\n30 years later, love still going strong\n\nAfter Fort Bragg, Bret headed back to Cleveland, where he grew up, but said he wasn't going without Susan by his side.\n\nI took her back home with me, and it's been history ever since, Bret said.\n\nA year after their move, the Fenskes had their son Nick, now 29, and got married. Five years later, their daughter, Julia, now 24, was born.\n\nThe Fenskes said they're proud to have raised two kids in an environment surrounded by love. It makes me very happy that my daughter has an amazing dad and got to see that... Susan said, and Bret finished her sentence: ...and a son that could see how to treat a woman, to be faithful to her and care for her.\n\nThey agreed that being married is one of their biggest accomplishments as they never even thought about separating or divorce.\n\nIn October, the Fenskes will celebrate their 30th anniversary. They moved to Clarksville two years ago, and Bret works at the Google data center.\n\nThere's times where we may be upset with each other, but I wake up, and he's written me notes telling me he's sorry, Susan said.\n\nNotebooks full of daily love notes\n\nIn a closet at their Clarksville home is a stack of notebooks full of love letters from the past few years. Every night, Susan leaves Bret a note before bed, and she wakes up to one before he leaves for work the next morning.\n\nSusan's secret to marriage is to never give up on her significant other. The good times and bad times, you have to be there for them both, she said. The Fenskes go on weekly dates, and they take several trips a year to keep things going.\n\nBret said communication, honesty and being immersed in your partner are key.\n\nHe describes Susan as a free spirit, and he said he loves her spontaneity and passion for life.\n\nHe has never held me back, and he encourages every silly, crazy idea, Susan said.\n\nIn their home, there's a sign that reads, Don't get so busy living that you forget to make a life.\n\nSusan said its a motto they live by.\n\nSo many people get busy with their careers and raising kids ... that they forget that if you work and do so much, the next thing you know you're going to be like us – empty nesters – and your kids are gone. Life, if you blink it's gone, so don't get so busy living that you forget to make a life.\n\nSleeping with spouses:Why so many married couples sleep in separate beds\n\n'Massive':20-foot-long great white shark off Florida coast leaves scuba divers in awe
Andrea Mandell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nRolling Stone's new profile on Tracy Morgan, one of the first since a Walmart 18-wheeler crashed into his vehicle on June 7, 2014, putting the comedian in a coma and killing his best friend, Jimmy Mack McNair, is a mixture of everything you want it to be: warm, ridiculous and blunt. Here are five moments we had to share.\n\n1. Morgan says his father convinced him to live.\n\nDuring his eight-day coma (which many feared he would not wake from), Morgan says it was his late father who spoke to him, convincing him to go on.\n\nHe was the one who said, 'Go home, son. I ain't ready for you yet,'  says Morgan of his musician father, Jimmy Morgan who died of AIDS from contaminated-needle use when Tracy was 19. I don't think I cheated death. I think this was the plan. My room wasn't ready. He would have left behind Megan, Maven and his three kids from his first marriage, who range in age from 24 to 30. I still have (expletive) here to do, Morgan says. It's gonna take more than 18 wheels for me to get out of here. I have to raise my girl, raise my wife, raise my family.\n\n2. He's living for his 'Despicable Me'-style pets, too.\n\nMorgan continued: Gotta keep my octopus alive. Gotta keep my sharks alive. Those are God's creatures! I'm needed! Please note – these pets are not hyperbole. Writer Brian Hiatt recalled sitting in Morgan's living room near a cylindrical tank where his giant Pacific octopus lurks, waiting for its next meal of lobster. The piece comically notes the time Morgan shouted feeding instructions via Facetime to his wife, and ends after Morgan's latest comedy show at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. I gotta get home, says Morgan, and feed my sharks.\n\n3. Morgan recounts his darkest days.\n\nIn the wake of Morgan's injuries, writes Hiatt, it felt like his worst fears were coming true. After the crash (which he doesn't remember), Morgan had to learn to walk again, his left femur was shattered, his ribs were cracked and bones in his face were broken.\n\nI said, 'If my funny ever went away, I'd die,' he says. And I thought I was going to die for a long time. My thoughts – I was in a very dark place. I was sitting right here, contemplating suicide. I couldn't walk.\n\n\n\n4. Ladies, don't even try to hit on him.\n\nBecause it won't go well. The writer watched a woman try to cozy up to Morgan after a show in Michigan by plopping down next to him.\n\nA blond woman in her early forties sidles next to him on the couch and asks Morgan if he's gonna come hang out. His expression hardens. No, he says. My wife don't allow that bullsh**. She starts backtracking – You're taking this the wrong way! – but he plunges on. I'm 47 years old. I don't hang out. My oldest son is 30! I rock for my fans, I go home.\n\n\n\n5. He wants to play Louis Armstrong\n\nBut the 30 Rock and Saturday Night Live alum will never be too cool for comedy. Morgan would still like to be a real movie star, writes Hiatt, but he'll never abandon his comedy roots. Nobody wants to take the pie in the face no more, says Morgan. Everybody too cool. I'm willing to do that.\n\n\n\nRead the whole profile here.
HELL, Mich. — Those who think there is no love in Hell would be incorrect, at least when it comes to Hell, Mich.\n\nSeveral couples said I do in Hell on Wednesday, a quirky and kitschy unincorporated hamlet that features a small wedding chapel that holds about 12 people at a time.\n\nThe Rev. Yvonne Williams said people who get hitched in Hell often have quirky, tongue-in-cheek personalities, and that was no different on Valentine's Day 2018.\n\nTheir marriage license will say married in Hell, so that is why some of them do it, Williams, a resident of neighboring Pinckney, said. And marriage that begins in Hell has nowhere else to go but up.\n\nMore:Royal wedding: Will Prince Harry, Meghan Markle take a carriage ride for the crowds?\n\nMore:Barack and Michelle Obama post sweet tweets to each other for Valentine's Day\n\nMost people are looking for a unique venue ... that is tight, cozy and fun, she said. You know, something non-traditional that is not necessarily church-esque and want to create their own ceremony.\n\nOther couples who get hitched there want something more sinister, like a couple who planned to wear masks at a ceremony slated for later in the day, she said Wednesday morning. I've officiated weddings here where I dressed up as Maleficent or costumes because they wanted that.\n\nBride and groom Angi Soucie and Dan Koch, of Brighton, Mich., are of the quirky, humorous variety, they said, a few minutes before their wedding ceremony began. They kept it simple, dressing in matching blue sweatshirts labeled the bride and the groom, to get hitched in front of 11 guests.\n\nThey were possessed to get hitched there so we could have a marriage license in Hell, Soucie said.\n\nThe couple, who first met in junior high school and reconnected about a year and a half ago, will have a second, more traditional wedding at the Howell Opera House in May. However, they said they didn't want to wait for the marriage license to save on medical insurance right away.\n\nWe just wanted this one to be fun, Koch said. People rolled their eyes on the Valentine's Day thing, but when you say it's in Hell, they start laughing.\n\nSoucie's parents, Mary and Ron Soucie, of Dexter, enjoyed the experience.\n\nMy daughter doesn't do anything traditional. She always looks for something unusual, and she found someone to do it who is the same way, Mary Soucie said.\n\nSix couples signed up to get hitched and one couple planned to renew their vows in the tiny chapel on the day of love, and more would have if they could have. About 17 couples inquired about getting married there on Valentine's Day, which was more than John Colone, the unofficial mayor of Hell and business owner, could accommodate.\n\nWilliams's officiant fee was a devilish $106.66, and it costs $100 to rent the chapel for one hour.\n\nSome couples opted for short and sweet — and free — Valentine's Day ceremonies at Uptown Coffeehouse in downtown Howell.\n\nHowell Area Fire firefighter and wedding officiant Bill Fenton has been offering free Valentine's Day weddings at the cafe for the last two years. He said Wednesday morning he expected to marry about a dozen couples by the end of the day.\n\nHe said the couples he joins together often opt to save their money for other things, like household expenses or travel.\n\nI can understand where these couples are coming from, because we (he and his wife of 21 years, Lori) went with a frugal one by tying it into our honeymoon vacation to Antigua, he said. We were spending the money on the trip, so we said, why not just get married on the beach, and we booked it without any friends or family coming.\n\nNewlyweds Megan Patten and David Carroll of White Lake got hitched at the cafe before a small group of family and friends. They are expecting the birth of their daughter in May.\n\nHonestly, we couldn't really wait, and we couldn't afford to have an actual wedding, so we decided to come down here and have a nice little family get-together, Carroll said.\n\nGetting married in the middle of a coffeehouse with people they don't know was actually exciting and fun, Patten said.\n\nFollow Jennifer Eberbach Timar on Twitter: @JenEberbach
This is it. This is life, the one you get.\n\nNetflix's acclaimed One Day at a Time reboot returns this weekend for its delightful and emotional third season, reminding everyone else on TV how great the family sitcom could be.\n\nEven though we're not in the heyday of the family sitcom that was the 1970s and '80s, there are still quite a few excellent families to watch on the air. In honor of the return of One Day, here are our five favorite modern day family sitcoms for your binging pleasure this weekend (and you'll notice, it does not actually include Modern Family).\n\nIf you value joy: 'One Day at a Time'\n\nThere is no better family sitcom on the air right now than One Day. The reboot of the Norman Lear classic, centered around a Cuban-American family in Los Angeles, is essential viewing. The new third season is just as great as the first two, and features guest stars like Melissa Fumero and Stephanie Beatriz from Brooklyn Nine-Nine and the one and only Gloria Estefan.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\nIf you love big families and Tracee Ellis Ross: 'Black-ish'\n\nABC has had an amazing run of family sitcoms in recent years, especially this comedy about an upper-middle-class black family starring Tracee Ellis Ross and Anthony Anderson. The series has also launched the career of Yara Shahidi, who took her character, Zoey, to the spin-off Grown-ish on Freeform. Black-ish is a supremely funny show that also has something to say about the black experience in modern America, a delicate feat to balance.\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nIf you are obsessed with 'Crazy Rich Asians': 'Fresh Off the Boat'\n\nBefore she traveled to Singapore for the lux life in last year's Crazy Rich Asians, Constance Wu was already the queen of one-liners on ABC's Fresh Off the Boat, a sitcom set in the '90s about an Asian-American family in Orlando. It's a slightly different lifestyle (more mini-vans, fewer BMWs), but equally as hilarious, and Wu and her TV husband Randall Park are one of the great comedic teams.\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nIf you like a quirky sense of humor: 'Speechless'\n\nSpeechless is yet another ABC gem, starring Minnie Driver and John Ross Bowie about parents with a son with cerebral palsy. The show avoids becoming cliche at nearly every turn, and focuses not on how J.J. (Micah Fowler) overcomes his disability or inspires others with it, but how he lives his life and the unique stories and humor that results.\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nIf you want something more adult: 'Catastrophe'\n\nLet's be real, cute kids and their cute hijinx are not for everyone. If you want a series that nails truths about family and marriage, but is really just for adults, try Amazon's Catastrophe, a British import starring Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan. The series begins with a vacation romance that leads to pregnancy, that leads to the formation of a family that no one thought would happen. It evolves to be about so many other, very relatable marital realities, too.\n\nStream it on Amazon.
Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens admitted to having an extramarital affair with a woman before taking office, St. Louis TV station KMOV reported late Wednesday.\n\nThe accusations were published a year and a day after Greitens was inaugurated and hours after the Republican governor delivered his second State of the State address.\n\nA spokesman for Greitens told the News-Leader before the report was published that he did not plan to take questions from the media. Questions about KMOV's report were referred to attorney James Bennett, who provided the News-Leader with two statements, one of them a joint statement from Eric and Sheena Greitens.\n\nA few years ago, before Eric was elected Governor, there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage, the joint statement says. This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately. While we never would have wished for this pain in our marriage, or the pain that this has caused others, with God's mercy Sheena has forgiven and we have emerged stronger. We understand that there will be some people who cannot forgive – but for those who can find it in your heart, Eric asks for your forgiveness, and we are grateful for your love, your compassion, and your prayers.\n\nAnother statement is from the first lady, an assistant political science professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia.\n\nWe have a loving marriage and an awesome family; anything beyond that is between us and God, Sheena Greitens said. I want the media and those who wish to peddle gossip to stay away from me and my children.\n\nBennett said neither Eric nor Sheena Greitens would take questions about the matter Wednesday night. The News-Leader was not immediately able to independently confirm the allegations in the KMOV report, which did not name the woman involved nor her ex-husband, who spoke to KMOV.\n\nGreitens' statement did not address other allegations in KMOV's report, which includes a recorded phone conversation between the woman and her ex-husband.\n\nKMOV reports Greitens had a consensual sexual relationship with the man's ex-wife, who did not comment to the TV station for its story.\n\nKMOV, leaning on the recorded conversations, reported that Greitens invited the woman to his house and scared her by blindfolding her, photographing her and telling her not to talk about it.\n\nThe ex-husband described taking nude pictures of the woman as blackmail, and he and his attorney, Al Watkins, said they had been in contact with law enforcement recently, KMOV reported.\n\nThe woman told her ex-husband on the recording that Greitens apologized afterward and said he had deleted the photograph, KMOV reported.\n\nThe ex-husband's attorney, Watkins, released a statement after the News-Leader asked about KMOV's report.\n\nWhen a person in a position of power decides to belly up to the bar, it is always wise to belly all the way up, Watkins said in an email. Asked for clarification, he continued: I am strongly suggesting a fully forthcoming acknowledgment of his actions is a far more prudent course to pursue than a statement crafted to minimize his role and the ensuing devastation which inured to the detriment of innocents.\n\nAfter the story ran, Greitens' attorney provided a third statement denouncing the report.\n\nThe governor has now seen the TV report that ran tonight, said James Bennett in the statement. The station declined to provide the tape or transcript in advance of running their story, which contained multiple false allegations. The claim that this nearly three-year old story has generated or should generate law enforcement interest is completely false. There was no blackmail and that claim is false. This personal matter has been addressed by the Governor and Mrs. Greitens privately years ago when it happened. The outrageous claims of improper conduct regarding these almost three-year-ago events are false.\n\nGreitens is in his second year as governor and had been rumored as a potential presidential candidate. His top campaign adviser, Nick Ayers, is now Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff.\n\nThe reported affair is raised amid the backdrop of a national consciousness-raising about acts and accusations of sexual impropriety by men, usually involving or against women. Congressmen have resigned, entertainers have faced social backlash, and the anti-harassment #MeToo movement has gained steam over the past several months.\n\nEarlier this year, Greitens made a point of appointing 25 women in 25 days — including several Springfield women — to mark the 25th anniversary of the Women's Foundation. In announcing the slew of appointments, Sheena Greitens noted that her husband had installed a majority-female cabinet to compose his administration.\n\nIn 2015, Republican John Diehl resigned as Missouri House speaker after admitting to exchanging sexually suggestive text messages with an intern. Later that year, Democrat Paul LeVota left his state Senate seat while denying claims that he had sexually harassed interns.\n\nA New York Times wedding announcement from 2011 notes that Greitens' first marriage ended in divorce.
PHILADELPHIA – In what could only be described as a preview to the madness that will fill the streets of Philadelphia Thursday at the Super Bowl parade honoring the hometown Eagles, fans flocked to Philadelphia International Airport Monday afternoon to welcome the Lombardi Trophy to Philadelphia for the first time in franchise history.\n\nOnce owner Jeffrey Lurie stepped off the plane and hoisted the trophy in the air, fans yelled, chanted and lifted their phones in the air to try and capture the moment with photos and videos and even share with loved ones through Apple's FaceTime.\n\nThe savviest in attendance topped cars and news vans to get a better view.\n\nAnd the hysteria only heightened when Lurie, coach Doug Pederson and a few Eagles players brought the trophy from the runway to the fans scattered along the fences by Atlantic Aviation – just east of the main portion of the airport.\n\nLurie, Pederson and running back LeGarrette Blount, among others, all lifted the trophy in the air to cheers from the crowd. At one point, fans started shouting the name Howie, a nod to general manager Howie Roseman, the Pro Football Writers' executive of the year.\n\nMORE: Three generations of Delaware family kiss Lombardi Trophy\n\nThe atmosphere built up throughout the day.\n\nJust before 1 p.m. there were only a handful of people lined up along the fences, but hundreds followed in the next hour.\n\nNorth Philadelphia's Javier Sanchez was one of the first to arrive. Sanchez, who turns 30 Tuesday, said he thinks welcoming the team back after a Super Bowl win will become a regular occurrence.\n\nIt's like the ending of a dynasty and the beginning of a new one, he said, referring to the New England Patriots' run of success.\n\nSanchez said coming out Monday afternoon was never a question. He earlier was in Center City earlier in the day scoping out the route the team will parade on Thursday.\n\nThis is our team, Sanchez said. We bleed green.\n\nIt was a family affair, with many parents bringing their children.\n\nJohn McKenzie of Broomall, Pa., said he made an executive decision when the game ended Sunday night to cancel school. He called winning the Super Bowl a Top 5 moment in his family's history, right behind the birth of his four boys.\n\nAhead of the marriage, though, McKenzie joked.\n\nMcKenzie said the boys will all be at the parade Thursday, and they may have one of the best views available. McKenzie said the family had a room booked at The Windsor Suites and will have a balcony overlooking Benjamin Franklin Parkway.\n\nSpringfield, Pa.'s Mike Donlan made a similar parental decision, allowing his daughter, Cara, to stay home from school Monday. Donlan, who sells insurance, was working from home Monday and decided he and Cara would drive to the airport to celebrate.\n\nHere we are, Donlan said. It's absolutely fantastic.\n\nSunday night Donlan said he got to enjoy the Super Bowl with his family, including his 82 and 81-year old parents.\n\nMORE: Eagles fan, 87, finally pops 37-year-old champagne\n\nFANS HIT THE STREETS: Unruly Birds fans: Yo, Eagles ya did it!\n\nThe Eagles fight song was shouted out what seemed like every five minutes or so. A man waving an Eagles Super Bowl LII flag at one point wouldn't allow cars to pass on Island Avenue without honking their horns. They obliged, of course. So, too, did the honking tractor trailer drivers, airport shuttle drivers and even a few police cruisers.\n\nLater, when the team left on buses with a police escort back to the NovaCare Complex in South Philadelphia, many fans in the crowd rushed to their cars to follow.\n\nIt was only Monday.\n\nContact reporter Jeff Neiburg at (302) 983-6772, jneiburg@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @Jeff_Neiburg.
Who is Katherine Schwarzenegger, Chris Pratt's new fiancee? Doesn't her name ring a bell?\n\nWell, yes, she's the eldest child of ex-Terminator-turned-former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and his estranged wife, former NBC correspondent Maria Shriver, and is thus a Kennedy clan member.\n\nBut she's not an actor like Jurassic World star Pratt, 39, or her father, 71, (who has six movies in post-production, including a Terminator reboot), or her younger brother, Patrick, 25, who has played roles in TV series like Scream Queens and The Long Road Home.\n\nThe simple answer is how Schwarzenegger, 29, describes herself on Instagram: Author, blogger, lover&addict of all things lifestyle, it says, adding that she's also an ambassador for the American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.\n\nDogs and other critters are familiar images on her Instagram. Now Pratt has joined the pantheon, along with her family, with a picture of the two and a gushy caption. My sweet love. Wouldn't want to live this life with anyone but you, it read, followed by an engagement ring icon.\n\nAccording to her Amazon page, Schwarzenegger is the author of three books, two of them focused on self-help.\n\nHer latest, the 2017 children's book Maverick and Me, drew on her experience adopting a dog, Maverick, to create a picture book to introduce kids to the concept of adopt, don't shop when it comes to pets.\n\nEarlier, Rock What You've Got: Secrets to Loving Your Inner and Outer Beauty From Someone Who's Been There and Back, came out in 2010; it's an advice book for young women on how to develop a healthy body image. In grade school and middle school, Schwarzenegger suffered from body-image issues that she now controls with yoga and other exercise.\n\nAnd I Just Graduated ... Now What?: Honest Answers From Those Who Have Been There came out in 2014 and was targeted at recent college graduates uncertain about what to do next.\n\nHow did she meet Pratt? He was married for nine years, until 2018, to actress Anna Faris, 42, and they have a son, Jack, 6.\n\nThat's something of a mystery but interest in their relationship started last summer. They first showed up in photos together in June 2018, when TMZ photographers spotted them on a picnic date in Santa Barbara, California, tooling around in his big red truck.\n\nLater, in August, they were seen together at Sunday church service and a family dinner, and in September they visited a farm and winery in Napa Valley.\n\nFor Schwarzenegger's birthday in December, the actor shared a loving post to Instagram with a collection of photos of the two of them goofing around.\n\nHappy Birthday Chief! Your smile lights up the room, he said. I've cherished our time together. Thrilled God put you in my life. Thankful for the laughs, kisses, talks, hikes, love and care.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Schwarzenegger graduated from the University of Southern California in 2012. She was at loose ends and ended up interviewing a variety of people, including actors and entrepreneurs, about what to do next for a career. Her second book grew out of those interviews, compiled as a survival guide for new grads.\n\nNow she runs a lifestyle blog that covers health, beauty, home decor, animals, style and food.\n\nBesides Patrick, her siblings include Christina, 27, and Christopher Schwarzenegger, 21, plus a half-brother, Joseph Baena, 21.\n\nHer parents are legally separated but are not divorced. Their marriage fell apart in 2011 after it emerged that he had fathered a child with the family's housekeeper.
Jessica Simpson sat down with Today show host Hoda Kotb and spoke honestly about the struggles she faced with alcoholism, which she details in her upcoming memoir, Open Book.\n\nI had started a spiral and I couldn't catch up with myself, the former reality TV star said during the sit-down, airing in full on Wednesday. And that was with alcohol.\n\nShe told Kotb she recognized her drinking was getting out of hand, but it wasn't easy for her to dial it back.\n\nI would say it openly to everyone, 'I know. I know, I'll stop soon. I'll cut back,' Simpson said in the interview. For me to cut back, like I'm an all-or-nothing girl, and so I didn't know it was a problem until it was.\n\nShe added: I completely didn't recognize myself.\n\nThe pop-star-turned-entrepreneur said she used to have a special glitter cup on hand that was filled with alcohol.\n\nI just realized that I had to surrender. It was time, Simpson explained. I had to give it up and I was ready. I'm not going to miss another day.\n\nShe was tired of missing moments at holidays like Halloween and Christmas and wanted to be present.\n\nIn November 2017, she got sober. She details in the book about how therapy helped her heal.\n\nGiving up the alcohol was easy, she wrote. I was mad at that bottle. At how it allowed me to stay complacent and numb.\n\nEarlier released excerpts from Simpson's book, out Feb. 4, also reveal that she was sexually abused as a child.\n\nI wanted to tell my parents. I was the victim, but somehow I felt in the wrong, she wrote. She wrote that she shared the abuse with her parents when she was 12.\n\nSimpson's book also delves into the reason her marriage to Nick Lachey ended in divorce in 2006: We really got crushed by the media and by ourselves. Plus, the book explores her romance with John Mayer.\n\nShe said that despite her intense connection to Mayer, the singer made her feel insecure in their relationship, and she started drinking to control her nerves.\n\nTheir relationship ended after he detailed their sex life in a Playboy interview in 2010, when he referred to her as sexual napalm.\n\nI was floored and embarrassed that my grandmother was actually gonna read that, she said. A woman and how they are in bed is not something that is ever talked about.\n\nSimpson is currently married to NFL pro Eric Johnson.\n\nContributing: Hannah Yasharoff\n\nMore:Jessica Simpson reveals why her marriage to Nick Lachey ended, details John Mayer romance\n\nMore:Jessica Simpson reveals sexual abuse as a child, alcohol addiction in new memoir, 'Open Book'

The site includes King's birth home; his tomb; Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King was co-pastor with his father; and the Martin Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, established by King's family to continue his work.\n\nListen to U2's Pride (In the Name of Love)\n\nYou know the song. What you might not realize, however, is that the lead single from U2's 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire is about King. Just listen to the lyrics: Early morning, April Four/Shot rings out in the Memphis sky. Despite its historical error — King died in the evening — the song earned a special honor from the King Center in 2004.\n\nRead The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nAfter King's death, his estate commissioned Clayborne Carson, a professor at Stanford University, to assemble, edit and publish his papers, including previously unpublished letters and diaries. The result, The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr., is an absorbing account of King's life and philosophy — in his own words.\n\nWatch the TV miniseries King\n\nNBC's Emmy-winning King still feels relevant 40 years after it aired. Originally broadcast on three consecutive nights in 1978, it stars Paul Winfield as King, whose biography and ideas are vividly portrayed. Although there are some historical errors and omissions, overall it's an informative and compelling tribute.\n\nRead Coretta Scott King's My Life, My Love, My Legacy\n\nNo one knew King better than his wife, Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006. This book, published last year, is based on recorded interviews with journalist Barbara Reynolds. It tells stories from her life before and after King's death, including anecdotes about her marriage, the civil rights movement, and her work to carry on her husband's legacy.\n\nRead Martin's Big Words\n\nKing is an inspiration to Americans young and old. Doreen Rappaport's picture-book biography, Martin's Big Words: The Life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., is ideally for sharing his message with children. Featuring illustrations by Bryan Collier, it combines famous King quotes with original writing to tell his life story to young readers (and their parents, too).\n\nListen to the I Dream concept album\n\nKing wanted to unite people, and nothing unites like music. In that spirit, composer Douglas Tappin wrote I Dream, a rhythm-and-blues opera based on the last 36 hours of King's life. Featuring a fusion of musical styles, it's being staged this spring by Opera Carolina in Charlotte. Listeners nationwide can partake by downloading I Dream (The Concept Recording) from iTunes or Google Play Music.
DEARBORN, Mich. – With choruses of America the Beautiful, The Star Spangled Banner and Ave Maria filling the Church of the Divine Child in Dearborn, Mourners from across metro Detroit and the political spectrum gathered in Dearborn Tuesday to pay their respects to former U.S. Rep. John Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress, who was described as a man for the ages.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, in his eulogy, said Dingell, who died Thursday at the age of 92 after a battle with cancer, led with great moral courage and vision during his 59 years in Congress.\n\nAnd one word best describes Dingell, Biden said: dignity.\n\nI told my granddaughter that what I liked about John had nothing to do with the fights we were in together. I can sum it up in one word. He believed everyone without exception was entitled to be treated with dignity, he said. Dignity was how John, walked, how John talked, how he carried himself and how he treated everyone.\n\nObituary:Michigan's John Dingell, longest-serving member in Congress, dies at 92\n\nJohn Dingell recalled as icon: Here's what colleagues, friends are saying\n\nBiden added that one of his best qualities was understanding the problems facing his constituents.\n\nHe understood that health care was more than keeping you healthy. It was about peace of mind, Biden said. It was about people going to bed at night, staring at the ceiling and saying, 'My god, what happens if I get sick? We'll lose everything.' John got it. He got it to his core.\n\nHis eulogy was not all serious, though, starting out with Bless me father for what I'm about to say, before crossing myself and praising Dingell for knowing the difference between a a hot and cold mic, referring to gaffes that he has made over the years.\n\nHe called Dingell a man for the ages, recalling a famous quote about Abraham Lincoln and called upon Shakespeare's Hamlet to say I shall not look upon his like again.\n\nHail to John, God Bless you, buddy, Biden concluded.\n\nThe funeral, originally expected to start at 11 a.m., was delayed 30 minutes because of weather. And a military transport that was delivering members of Congress and two speakers for the service had to head back to Washington D.C. because of the icy weather conditions.\n\nDingell, known as Big John or the Truck because of his imposing stature, was being eulogized at Dearborn's Church of the Divine Child by a bi-partisan group of politicians. They included former Vice President Joe Biden and civil rights icon U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, both Democrats, and his long-time friend, Republican U.S. Rep. Fred Upton of Kalamazoo. But Lewis and Upton were on the plane that turned around after circling Detroit but unable to land because of slick runways.\n\nAlso on the plane: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and U.S. House Chaplain Pat Conroy, who was supposed to deliver the homily.\n\nFather Terrence Kerner filled in for the homily saying the congressional delegation and Conroy were scheduled to fly in today into paradise. But because of the weather, the plane turned around , they're back in DC. And right before Mass, I found out I had to preach, he noted, saying he had nothing prepared. And then I remembered that John had a sense of humor.\n\nKerner offered a touching tribute to Dingell, saying that his first priority was taking care of his constituents.\n\nEven though his district kept bouncing around, he told his staff, even though they're not in my district, take care of them, they're my people, Kerner said. That's what he was about.\n\nHe also told the story of an elderly woman who approached him this week at a Dearborn restaurant after overhearing Kerner talking about the funeral.\n\nShe said, 'what a great man, he did so much for us,' Kerner recalled, noting that the woman said she knew Dingell well, but had never met him. My husband said were it not for John Dingell, I would not have a job, been able to put food on the table or put my kids through school.\n\nOpinion:Former Michigan Congressman John Dingell: In love with his life, in awe of his luck\n\nOpinion:Flashback: Trump meets match in 'tweet king' John Dingell\n\nMembers of Dingell's family — his wife, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell; his son and daughter-in-law Christopher and Cindy Dingell; daughter Jennifer Dingell and grandchildren Garielle and Robin Dingell — participated in the funeral with readings and delivering the communion gifts to the priests celebrating the mass. Debbie Dingell's sister Kate Bartley also delivered a reading from Ecclesiastes.\n\nAfter the service, Dingell's casket, along with his wife, U.S. Rep, Debbie Dingell, were scheduled to be flown to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington by military transport. A motorcade was then scheduled to take them past the U.S. Capitol.\n\nIt was uncertain how weather would impact that.\n\nAs part of that motorcade, members of the House and Senate were expected to come outside to watch the motorcade and pay their respects.\n\nA bipartisan group of mourners are expected to gather Thursday for a second service in Washington, where former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, former Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner of Ohio and U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, will be the speakers at a funeral mass at Holy Trinity Catholic Church.\n\nDingell, who was a veteran, is expected to be interred at Arlington National Cemetery though there were no immediate details about that ceremony.\n\nIt was fitting that Dingell, who died Thursday at the age of 92 after a battle with cancer, had members of both political parties pay tribute to his nearly 60 years in Congress. He helped craft and pass some of the most consequential measures during his time in the U.S. House of Representatives, including Medicare, the Civil Rights Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Endangered Species Act and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHis colleague, U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Lansing Democrat, summed up Dingell's tenure as she made her way into the Dearborn church Tuesday morning.\n\nHe fought hard but was able to compromise. In order to work across the aisle, you have to be able trust the other person. People trusted his word, she said.\n\nDingell retired from the House in 2015 and his wife replaced him after winning his seat in a 2014 election.\n\nThroughout his career, he remained an advocate of Michigan manufacturing, its signature auto industry and its natural resources.\n\nBorn on July 8, 1926, in Colorado Springs, Colo., Dingell spent much of his formative years in Washington, D.C. His father, John Dingell Sr., who had ties to organized labor, moved the family back to Detroit and won election to a newly created congressional district in 1933.\n\nAfter the war, Dingell entered private practice in Detroit, before joining the staff of U.S. Circuit Judge Theodore Levin and then becoming an assistant prosecuting attorney for Wayne County. After his father died in 1955, Dingell was elected in a special election to replace him. He was 29.\n\nHis funeral service was filled with people who had worked with him over the years, from constituents of his western Wayne County district to politicians he had served with, including former U.S. Sen. Carl Levin, and his brother former U.S. Rep. Sander Levin, former Michigan Gov. Jim Blanchard and Stabenow. Ninety members of Congress were expected to attend the funeral.\n\nCatherine Daligga of Ypsilanti, a member of the Washtenaw County Democratic Party, came to the funeral despite a steady, icy rain that snarled traffic.\n\nHe was gracious and approachable, she said.\n\nJohn Dingell:Marriage to Debbie 'greatest love affair' of my life\n\nMore:John Dingell was a Twitter superstar.

Associated Press\n\nLAS VEGAS – Sheldon Adelson – the billionaire founder and CEO of Las Vegas Sands and one of President Donald Trump's largest donors – has died at the age of 87 of complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, the casino company announced Tuesday.\n\nAt one point the third-richest man in the world, Adelson brought singing gondoliers to the Las Vegas Strip and went all-in betting Asia would be a bigger jackpot than Sin City. In his later years, he became widely known for his political activism, including his donations to Trump and other Republicans as well as his support for Israel.\n\nIn March 2019, Adelson announced he was getting treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He recently resumed those treatments.\n\nLas Vegas Sands announced last week that Adelson had taken a leave of absence as his cancer worsened.\n\nWith an estimated net worth of $41.4 billion, Adelson was the wealthiest person in Nevada and one of the 20 wealthiest people in America.\n\nHis Las Vegas Sands is one of the largest casino and resort companies in the world, with the Venetian and Palazzo resorts on the Strip and lucrative casinos in Macau.\n\nAdelson and his wife, Miriam, had been the Republican Party's most prominent financial backers. They contributed more than $123 million to conservative politicians in the 2018 election cycle – more than any other U.S. citizen.\n\nOver a two-day period in September 2018, the Adelsons pumped $55 million into three conservative political action committees. Two months later, President Donald J. Trump awarded Miriam Adelson a Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nIn August, the couple donated $75 million into a super PAC launched to help Trump's re-election efforts.\n\nSheldon Adelson's life story\n\nSheldon Adelson was the son of Jewish immigrants, raised with two siblings in a Boston tenement, who over the second half of his life became one of the world's richest men. The chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. brought singing gondoliers to the Las Vegas Strip and foresaw correctly that Asia would be an even bigger market. In 2018, Forbes ranked him No. 15 in the U.S., worth an estimated $35.5 billion.\n\nIf you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow, he said during a 2014 talk to the gambling industry in Las Vegas.\n\nBlunt yet secretive, Adelson resembled an old-fashioned political boss and stood apart from most American Jews, who for decades have supported Democrats by wide margins. Adelson was considered the nation's most influential GOP donor over the final years of his life, at times setting records for individual contributions during a given election cycle.\n\nIn 2012, Politico called him the dominant pioneer of the super PAC era.\n\nAdelson regularly hosted the party's top strategists and most ambitious candidates at his modest office, wedged among the casinos on the Strip. Throughout, he helped ensure that uncritical support of Israel became a pillar of the GOP platform, never more visibly demonstrated than when the Trump administration relocated the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018.\n\nThe inflammatory move had been adamantly opposed by Palestinians and was long a priority for Adelson, who had even offered to help pay for it, and for the Republican Jewish Coalition, of which he was the primary benefactor. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, were front and center at the ceremony in Jerusalem.\n\nWhen asked at a gambling conference what he hoped his legacy would be, Adelson said it wasn't his glitzy casinos or hotels, it was his impact in Israel. He donated $25 million, a record sum for a private citizen, to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. He established a think tank in Jerusalem. He was closely aligned with the conservative Likud Party and funded a widely read free daily newspaper called Israel Hayom, or Israel Today, so supportive of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that some Israelis nicknamed it Bibi-ton.\n\nIn the U.S., Adelson helped underwrite congressional trips to Israel, helped build a new headquarters for the lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and later was a top supporter of the Israeli-American Council, whose conferences have attracted top Republicans (Vice President Mike Pence) and Democrats (House Speaker Nancy Pelosi). He sponsored Birthright trips to Israel for young Jewish adults that were criticized by some participants as intolerant of opposing views.\n\nHis attachment to Israel was lifelong and so deep that he once said he wished his military service had been in an Israeli uniform instead of an American one.\n\nAdelson was a late bloomer in business and in politics. He didn't become a casino owner, or a Republican, until well into middle age. Through the 1990s and after, his wealth soared and his engagement in politics intensified. He was a supporter of President George W. Bush and backed Republican Rudolph Giuliani for the 2008 presidential race, before turning to the eventual candidate, Sen. John McCain, who lost to Barack Obama.\n\nHis leverage grew considerably in 2010 after the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision lifted many restrictions on individual campaign contributions. He and his wife spent more than $90 million on the 2012 election, funding presidential candidate Newt Gingrich and later Mitt Romney, who also lost to Obama.\n\nI'm against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections, he told Forbes magazine in 2012. But as long as it's doable, I'm going to do it.\n\nAdelson came around slowly to Trump, who during the campaign had said he would be neutral in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Trump even ridiculed his initial liking for Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, tweeting in 2015, Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree! Adelson eventually endorsed Trump, but remained hesitant through much of 2016. He gave more than $20 million in the final weeks of the campaign after reports that he would contribute $100 million, and was more generous with congressional races.\n\nBut after Trump's surprise victory, the new president spoke often with Adelson and embraced his hardline views on the Middle East. He cut funding for Palestinian refugees and withdrew from the Obama administration's nuclear nonproliferation deal with Iran. He moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem even though earlier administrations – Democratic and Republican – avoided doing do because it directly challenged the Palestinian view that the ancient city should be part of any peace agreement.\n\nAdelson, in turn, aided Trump financially, including $5 million for his inauguration, and supported him through his media holdings. Late in 2015, Adelson secretly purchased the Las Vegas Review-Journal – the paper's own reporters revealed he was the new owner – and soon raised concerns he was imposing his own views. Some longtime staffers left in protest.\n\nIn what was widely seen as a mark of the Adelsons' influence with Trump, Miriam Adelson was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018.\n\nAdelson, who contributed more than $100 million to the 2018 off-year elections, held extraordinary power among Republicans even though he didn't always agree with them. In a 2012 interview with the Wall Street Journal, he called himself basically a social liberal, pro-choice on abortion and supportive of immigrant rights. He cited taxes and differences over Israel as major reasons for leaving the Democratic party.\n\nIn Nevada, his influence was such that even the state's most prominent Democrat, Sen. Harry Reid, hesitated to take him on. In a 2014 interview with MSNBC, the then-Senate majority leader differentiated between Adelson and fellow GOP billionaire donors Charles and David Koch. Reid had sharply criticized the Koch brothers as callous and greedy, while saying that he respected Adelson because he was not in it to make money, a widely challenged opinion.\n\nHe had previously told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that he remained friends with Adelson despite their political differences.\n\nSheldon Adelson and I still meet and have conversations. He has a problem, I try to help him, Reid said.\n\nAdelson was married twice. He and his first wife, Sandra, were divorced in 1988. Three years later, he married Miriam Farbstein-Ochshorn, an Israeli-born doctor he met on a blind date and whom many believe helped deepen his involvement with Israel. Their honeymoon trip to Venice inspired Adelson to raze the historic Sands hotel-casino, once a favorite hangout for Frank Sinatra among others, and replace them with a pair of massive complexes: The Venetian and The Palazzo, one of the city's tallest buildings.\n\nSheldon Adelson adopted his first wife's three children and had two children with his second wife. Among numerous philanthropic projects, he and Miriam Adelson were especially committed to the research and treatment of substance abuse, a personal cause for Sheldon Adelson. His son Mitchell, from his first marriage, died of an overdose in 2005. (Sheldon Adelson would spend millions opposing state efforts to legalize marijuana).\n\nSheldon Garry Adelson was born in 1933, in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. His father was a taxi driver, his mother the manager of a knitting store. A natural entrepreneur, he was selling newspapers by age 12 and running a vending machine business at 16. After dropping out of City College of New York and serving in the Army, he attempted to start dozens of businesses, from toiletries to de-icing windshields.\n\nAdelson, who said he disdained email, began to amass his fortune with a technology trade show, starting computer convention COMDEX in 1979 with partners before selling his stake in 1995 for more than $800 million.\n\nWhen he bought the Sands Hotel in 1989, he was thinking convention space, not just gambling, would make money. It did. He built a convention hall to keep his hotel rooms full on weekdays and others soon followed the business model. Meanwhile, his effort to replicate the Strip in Macau, the only Chinese province to allow gambling, made his wealth grow exponentially.\n\nWhen faced with water and marsh land, Adelson directed his company to build land where there wasn't any, piling sand up to create the Cotai Peninsula. Soon his Macau revenue outstripped that of his Las Vegas holdings. He later expanded his business to Singapore, where his Marina Bay Sands hotel and its infinity pool were featured in the hit film Crazy Rich Asians, and had been pressing to open a casino in Japan.\n\nHis Macau business also spawned a long-running wrongful termination lawsuit brought by a former chief of Sands China Ltd. who accused Adelson and the company of firing him for exposing a host of misdeeds. Adelson often clashed with attorneys while appearing on a Clark County courtroom's witness stand.\n\nThe Sands China lawsuit was among dozens involving Adelson, whose cases included his suing a Wall Street Journal reporter for calling him foul-mouthed (the parties settled, the words remained) to being sued by his sons from his first marriage for cheating them out of money (he won).\n\nA long-running feud with fellow casino tycoon Steve Wynn turned to friendship when Wynn joined Adelson's effort to end online gambling. Critics said Adelson was trying to stifle competition. Adelson countered that there was no way to ensure children and teenagers wouldn't gamble and said he was not in favor of it exploiting the world's most vulnerable people.\n\nTrump's election would again prove useful to Adelson. During the Obama administration, the Justice Department said online gambling that does not involve sporting events would not violate the Wire Act, a 1961 federal statute. In a legal opinion that became public early in 2019, the department reversed itself and decided the statute applies to any form of gambling.\n\nThe company has named Robert G. Goldstein – Las Vegas Sands' president and chief operating officer – as acting chairman while Adelson is on medical leave.\n\nThe Book of Trump\n\nTrump has delivered – both in policy and at the podium – on an issue very important to the Adelsons: Israel.\n\nThey like a place called Israel very much, Trump said of the couple at a Las Vegas event in February. Would you say that's correct? Maybe I have to use the word 'love' a place called Israel, right?\n\nIn a column last year published in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, a newspaper the Adelsons own, Miriam made a case to expand the Bible with a book named after the 45th president of the United States:\n\nWould it be too much to pray for a day when the Bible gets a 'Book of Trump,' much like it has a 'Book of Esther' celebrating the deliverance of the Jews from ancient Persia?
Nancy Trejos, USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES—Among the many items on display at the Museum of Broken Relationships here is something any person who has ever had his or her heart broken would appreciate: an apology card.\n\nI know I am entirely undeserving, but I hope one day you can forgive me, the card reads. I cannot express how sorry I am for the pain I've caused you.\n\nThe item was donated anonymously to the museum from a jilted lover. The museum, which opened last year, has more than 100 such remnants from similarly sad or bittersweet breakups.\n\nThe items run the gamut from weird—an ex-lover's belly button lint—to sweet—a promise ring. And they come from all over the USA and the world: Kentucky, Montreal, London, New York, Spain, Japan, Singapore and more. The scenarios also are diverse. There are heterosexual and gay couples represented.\n\nIt's important for us to put ourselves in other people's shoes and work those empathy muscles, says Alexis Hyde, director of the museum. It's reassuring to know you aren't alone when you are going through a difficult time in your life. It's nice to know that other people have the same issues across the world, that we are all stumbling when looking for human connection.\n\nThe apology card came from a woman who cheated on her girlfriend for two and a half months in Santa Barbara. She had put her ex-lover's belongings in a laundry basket. The ex-lover did not find the note in the bottom of the basket for months.\n\nI took most of my things out, but the basket stayed in my living room, the ex-lover writes.\n\nSan Diego, so close yet so far from L.A.\n\nThe idea for such a museum originated in Zagreb, Croatia. A Museum of Broken Relationships has been there six years, started by friendly ex-lovers.\n\nWhile on vacation in Zagreb with his family in April 2015, John Quinn, founder of the L.A. law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, stumbled upon the museum and was so moved by the museum and the universality of the experiences (that) he contacted them right away to see if they would like to open a second, Hyde says.\n\nThe L.A. outpost of the Museum of Broken Relationships now takes up coveted real estate on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with signs on its windows reading Once upon a time we weren't stalkers, and I miss the sound of our arguments.\n\nInside, the very modern tidy exhibit draws such visitors as USC students Hailey Kragelj and Natalia Dziekciowski.\n\nIt's making me think of all the stuff I can bring here, says Kragelj. It's happy and sad at the same time.\n\nTouching, sad and heartbreaking is how Dziekciowski describes the exhibit.\n\nAt the start of each story, they are sweet, she says. But sometimes it just doesn't work out.\n\nThe promise ring came from a donor in Pineville, Ky.\n\nWe were just two kids who couldn't keep a promise, the donor writes.\n\nThe belly button lint came from Montreal.\n\nOur relationship was tumultuous; as off again as it was ever on, the donor writes. From time to time, he would remind me that he wasn't really in love but I blithely ignored the warning. He gave me his lint, after all.\n\nThere are also fake breasts from Belgrade, Serbia. The donor's husband bought her fake breasts that were much bigger than her real ones and asked her to wear them during sex.\n\nBecause of those sculpted, fake breasts I left him for good, she writes.\n\nOthers have left flip flops, a used tube of toothpaste, a Brazilian Playboy collection, dreadlocks, and a nicotine patch to commemorate their former loved ones.\n\nOne woman donated her wedding dress in a pickle jar after the end of her seven-year marriage.\n\nI hate throwing perfectly functional items in landfills but would hate to see someone walking around in my once beautiful but now sadness infused dress, she says. I don't particularly enjoy looking at it either. So I have crammed it in this old dill pickle jar. Mostly for space reasons but any sort of appropriate pickle metaphors can also be invoked.\n\nNot all the relationships on display are traditional break-ups.\n\nThere is a pair of blue jeans from Hailey, Idaho. The woman's husband was hit by an elk on his motorcycle one summer evening. He sustained brain injuries that have kept him wheelchair-bound.\n\nHe is able to talk, although his reality is very different, she writes. He time travels to different decades of his life, locations and people. He is still here, but I have had to learn how to live with a broken relationship, a one-sided relationship.\n\nThere is a pair of lottery tickets in Zaragoza, Spain from four friends of 60 years who always played the lottery together until three of them decided to go off on their own. The three won and shut out the fourth.\n\nThey won the prize, but they lost a real friend, the fourth friend writes. Losing friends is hard when you are young, but losing them when you are living the last years of your life is even harder.\n\nThe museum accepts most donations and does not do much editing of their stories. It does reject any donations that are offensive or discriminatory on ethnic, religious, sexual, personal, or national grounds.\n\nPeople leave feeling profoundly connected and courageous to go out and try again, or be kinder to the people they are with, Hyde says. There are definitely tears and some down times for people, but they always follow up and say in a cathartic way, like how a good sad movie can be a release.
As a middle school basketball coach making $225 a month, LeVelle Moton could at least hold practice on the six hoops available in the gymnasium. He had 10 baskets at his disposal when he made the jump to high school.\n\nFor the past 11 seasons, Moton has been the men's basketball head coach at his alma mater, North Carolina Central University, where he is one of the most decorated players in program history and has led the Eagles to three consecutive NCAA Tournament berths.\n\nNorth Carolina Central has two basketball hoops to practice on.\n\nIt's one example of the inequalities that exist within college athletics and the dearth of resources – not to mention the lack of recognition – Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) face.\n\nWe do feel unsung, Moton told USA TODAY Sports by phone last week. We feel like we've accomplished far more, if not greater, than any other program in the country with far less resources.\n\nMoton and his team are the subjects of a new documentary that will debut on ESPN+ in two weeks as part of the network's launch of The Undefeated on its subscription platform. Why Not Us: North Carolina Central University Men's Basketball debuts on Feb. 12, with Chris Paul and Stephen A. Smith (a HBCU graduate himself) attached to the project as executive producers of the eight-part series. The new partnership between ESPN+ and The Undefeated will create a day-to-day home on the streaming platform for stories at the intersection of sports, race and culture, while doubling as a content creation engine for Black stories under the Disney umbrella.\n\nMore:Ad Meter 2021: Our favorite Super Bowl ads starring man's best friends\n\nMore:The 55 greatest teams to play in the Super Bowl – and not all won Lombardi Trophy\n\nThe Undefeated editor-in-chief and ESPN senior vice president Kevin Merida told USA TODAY Sports the venture is part of the site's experimental ethos.\n\nWe've done a lot about Black athletes and what they do off the court and how they think and what they care about, he said. We've showed that sports is culture and there are relationships between sports and culture. We've given people a lot of windows into what they may not be getting elsewhere. We're not the only people interested in that. Audiences everywhere are interested in those stories. So I think it starts with we try to do things that are not obvious and things that are differentiating.\n\nIt's really exciting for us because it gives us another distribution outlet for our work.\n\nHighlighting the Eagles is the first documentary project, but the Why Not Us series could become a running title with a focus on different programs. Merida said working with NC Central was a perfect marriage and made possible by the site's long track record of covering HBCUs.\n\nI was just happy that ESPN (took) the time to come shine a positive light on that, and keeping it authentic and true to who we are and what we actually do and how we go about our business, Moton said.\n\nThe reality is, the stories that are being told, aren't (told by) people that look like us, the coach added. There's not a lot of people who have the pen, or the power, or the net worth in control of the media outlets that look like us so they're not obligated to tell our stories. So when you have a story such as this, that's why I think it's so pure and genuine because we've been just as successful, if not more.\n\nMoton is quick to point out the dismal NFL hiring cycle for Black coaches this offseason, saying that even successful Black coaches across the sports landscape, from the Pittsburgh Steelers' Mike Tomlin to the late Georgetown Hoyas men's coach John Thompson, don't receive their due. He invokes a past NC Central coach, John McLendon, whose teachings from the 1940s of the fast-break and four corners offense are the building blocks for the modern game.\n\nHistory hardly remembers McLendon's impact, Moton lamented.\n\nThey always want to tag us as motivators or recruiters, he said. That has to stop. Yeah, we can motivate, but we can X and O with the best of them as well.\n\nMoton realizes it's on him to prepare his players for that harsh reality, which extends beyond the basketball court.\n\nBecause I really want these young men to go out and be successful citizens in this world, said Moton, who led the program's transition from Division II to the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. I want to prepare these young men to be not only good basketball players, but good students, good men, good husbands, good fathers, good head-of-households.\n\nOn Friday, the Eagles played for the first time in 50 days, a 94-61 victory over Carver. They had practiced for seven days as a complete team before that and missed 49 days due to COVID-19 issues. The differences in resources between a Power 5 conference program and those at an HBCU will be apparent in the documentary, although the standards of success aren't lessened.\n\nWe probably have to deal with some more issues that everyone else doesn't necessarily have to deal with because they can delegate it, Moton said. They have staff and they have people that's hired for those particular roles. You'll see that we're just as much of the academic coordinators as everybody else.\n\nMost of all, Moton hopes viewers will identify with his and the school's authenticity. He remembers the coaches who rescued him from a dysfunctional background – I was broken, he says now – and raised him. He's paying it forward to the young men passing through his program decades later.\n\nWe teach how we were taught. We coach how we were coached, Moton said. We always draw back and pull from our life experiences to coach and teach the next generation, and that's what I've done in some unique and creative forms.\n\nAs for the rest of The Undefeated's crossover to the streaming wars, other big projects are on the horizon. Another television special, in concert with National Geographic, will air on Feb. 18 (The March on Washington: Keepers of the Dream). The site is also planning its second album release.\n\nEven though February starts Black History Month, for us Black history always is about not just looking in the past, but the history we're creating now – beyond a month, Merida said. That's part of the branding. We're living history. It's Nia Dennis. It's Amanda Gorman. It's people in spaces helping to advance America in real time. So part of it for us as it relates to having this opportunity is it's really an extension of what we're doing.\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.'s words continue to resonate, decades later\n\nOn the third Monday of January every year, the federal government closes up shop for a day to honor civil rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr., who was assassinated on Apr. 4, 1968 in Memphis. The day, also celebrating King's birthday, honors his legacy and shines a light on civil rights. But the road to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day was fraught. It didn't become a federal holiday until 1986, nearly 20 years after it was introduced to Congress. Even then, it faced an upward battle for all states to recognize the holiday, only getting nationally recognized in 2000. Since then, many individuals and businesses have used today to give back through public service.\n\nThousands of gun owners plan to attend gun rights rally in Virginia\n\nThousands of gun owners, many of them armed and some members of out-of-state militias and hate groups, plan to descend on Richmond on Monday amid a fierce battle over Virginia's gun laws. Gov. Ralph Northam and Democrats in the state General Assembly have promised to pass a host of gun control measures, sparking far-reaching outcry and threats of violence. Northam declared a state of emergency in Richmond through Tuesday evening after he says law enforcement received credible threats of extremist groups with malicious plans. The Virginia Citizens Defense League, the group who organized the rally and challenged Northam's ban, has painted Democrat's gun proposals as draconian and urged for a mass, grassroots movement to fight back against tyranny.\n\nDay 1 of Australian Open features a big lineup\n\nThe first tennis Grand Slam tournament is underway as the Australian Open started competition late Sunday (Monday in Melbourne). First-round play continues Monday night with world No. 1 Rafael Nadal opening his quest for his first Aussie Open title in more than a decade against unseeded Hugo Dellien (9:30 p.m. ET on ESPN2). On the women's side, No. 2 Karolína Plíšková takes to the court at 7 p.m. ET as she opens play with hopes of capturing her first Grand Slam title.

Bong Joon-ho's Parasite took the top prize – best ensemble in a motion picture – an important stop on the way to the Academy Awards. The South Korean movie, which made history as the first foreign-language film ever to win the SAG category, upended other favorites such as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Irishman. Joker star Joaquin Phoenix took the SAG honor for best actor, Renee Zellweger won best actress for Judy, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood stalwart Brad Pitt conquered the supporting actor category, and Laura Dern received supporting actress for Marriage Story.\n\n'Bad Boys for Life' brings in $59 million at box office; 'Dolittle' falls short\n\nTwo Bad Boys were too good for one Dolittle at the box office. Bad Boys for Life starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence brought in $59 million in the U.S. and Canada to score a No. 1 debut entering the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, with final numbers expected Monday. The action-packed buddy comedy returned for the franchise's third installment after a 17-year hiatus to outlast Dolittle, starring Robert Downey Jr., which opened at second with a mediocre $22.5 million. Dolittle barely topped the World War I film 1917, which claimed the top spot last week.
PASADENA, Calif. – Amid a glut of comics-based superhero shows on TV, CW's Black Lightning stands out: It's no origin story, with a newbie discovering new powers.\n\nInstead, Jefferson Pierce (Cress Williams) is a retired superhero, whose former crime-fighting broke up his marriage. Now a high-school principal and dad in fictional Freeland, he's lured out of retirement when crime plagues the town.\n\nThe series (due Jan. 16, 9 ET/PT), created by the husband-and-wife team of Salim and Mara Brock Akil (Girlfriends, The Game), asks how do we become our own heroes? When do we fight?, Mara Akil told the Television Critics Association Sunday.\n\nLightning is not just notable for its largely African-American cast — Marvel's Luke Cage and the Black Panther film, out next month, also feature black leads — but its focus on character stories over crime-fighting and exploration of contemporary social issues, particularly those affecting the black community.\n\nPierce is stopped by suspicious cops, and his older daughter Anissa (Nafessa Williams), becomes a cornrow-sporting superhero sidekick, Thunder.\n\nThe Lightning comics were always socially conscious. The world that we created is an amalgamation of all three previous versions of the comics, Williams said. Even the (original) '70s version was socially relevant. One of the issues was all about illegal immigration and abusing these immigrants.\n\nMore:10 new TV shows you need to watch this winter\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge playing Black Lightning?\n\nPart of it is just learning the fight sequences, that was probably the hardest because it's the most foreign to me, Williams told USA TODAY. I stepped into this so excited about playing a superhero, that was my dream. But the easiest part of it is playing Jefferson, because there are so many similarities between me and Jefferson. He feels so much like me in terms of how he parents and what is important to him and his education and his family.\n\nAkil says the series hopes to glorify not just its onscreen crime-fighters, but the people they protect. Those fighting to improve their communities are heroes themselves, just by their own survival.
While Queen Elizabeth II is still enjoying her long-running reign, Netflix's The Crown is relinquishing its throne.\n\nThe streaming service confirmed the series centered on the British royals will end with its fifth season, with Imelda Staunton's portrayal of the matriarch. Fans hoping the show would tackle the modern era of the royals, including, Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's decision to step back from the royal family, will be disappointed.\n\nImelda is an astonishing talent and will be a fantastic successor to Claire Foy and Olivia Colman, series creator, writer and executive producer Peter Morgan said in a statement.\n\nMorgan shared that initially he saw the show completing an additional season, but had a change of heart.\n\nAt the outset I had imagined 'The Crown' running for six seasons, but now that we have begun work on the stories for Season 5 it has become clear to me that this is the perfect time and place to stop, he said. I'm grateful to Netflix and Sony for supporting me in this decision.\n\nFriday morning, the official Twitter account for the series shared a statement from Staunton conveying her enthusiasm to be part of the cast.\n\nI am genuinely honored to be joining such an exceptional creative team and to be taking the crown to its conclusion, she said.\n\nReview: 'The Crown' Season 3 is missing a lot of the Queen\n\nHow accurate is 'The Crown' Season 3? A historian fact-checks the Netflix series\n\nThe third installment of The Crown dropped in November.\n\nIt depicted Britain's rocky transition into the modern era, including Prime Minister Harold Wilson's tenure, the devaluation of the pound, the Aberfan disaster and the 1972 mining strike. The royal family also struggles to reckon with modernity, as Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones' marriage collapses, a documentary explores the Windsors' inner workings, and Prince Charles meets his first love, Camilla Shand.\n\nIn reviewing the season, USA TODAY's TV critic Kelly Lawler noted an absence of the queen.\n\nColman is conspicuously absent through much of the season, which focuses more heavily on Phillip, Margaret and Charles, and her role in her family members' stories is nominal at best, Lawler writes. Despite the marquee position of Colman in the opening credits, 'Crown' doesn't feel like her show.\n\nContributing: Kelly Lawler\n\n'Royal Divide': Prince Harry has 'suffered a lot,' 'trying to protect' Meghan and Archie\n\nPrince William gets new title from Queen Elizabeth amid Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan exit
Jane Carlson\n\nDaily Review Atlas\n\nMONMOUTH, Ill. — When Lois Estes Paulson turned 90 years old in 2004, her daughter Betty Goff threw her a party.\n\nI was sure glad she did that, because I wasn't sure I would be here at 100, Paulson said.\n\nBut in 2014, when she turned 100, there was another celebration.\n\nThis has got to be it, Paulson remembers thinking at the time. But here I am.\n\nPaulson turned 105 in September and still lives in her own home with plenty of help from neighbors, church friends and Goff, who lives in Cambridge and visits often.\n\nI'm being well taken care of, Paulson said.\n\nShe successfully renewed her driver's license in the fall, making her the fourth-oldest licensed driver in Illinois, according to the secretary of state's office. Drivers over the age of 87 must take vision and driving exams every year to keep their license, and Paulson passed easily this year.\n\nShe first learned to drive on a farm and drove area kids to their schoolhouse in her early teen years, before she ever needed a license to do so.\n\nThough she hasn't been driving in recent months due to some medical issues, she keeps active with church activities and her quilting group, and still has the good vision and dexterity to complete detailed cross-stitch pieces in her spare time.\n\nSometimes she will ask people how old they think she is, and the response is usually 75 or 80 years old.\n\nThat makes me feel pretty good, Paulson said.\n\nFrom her early years on the farm to raising a family and starting a career in her 40s, Paulson has always been on the go.\n\nI made up my mind I wasn't going to sit around, Paulson said. I've fought all my life to go and do things.\n\nPaulson was born in Fairfield, Iowa, in 1914. Her mother died when Paulson was 3, and she and her older sister, Ruth, went to live with an aunt and uncle who farmed in Smithshire.\n\nShe graduated from Kirkwood High School in 1933 and married Ernest Estes in 1936 at Ponema. They raised two daughters and farmed in rural Warren County until moving to Monmouth in the 1960s.\n\nThey bought a home in Monmouth for $10,000 in 1962, and nearly 58 years later, Paulson still lives there.\n\nLike many women of Paulson's generation, career options were limited. She dreamed of being a nurse — calling it her heart's desire — but she was always needed on the farm. When her eldest daughter graduated from high school and wanted to go to college, Paulson started looking for a job to help pay for it. She was around 40 years old at the time.\n\nI had never worked a job in public before, Paulson said.\n\nPaulson went to work as a nurse's aide at the Monmouth hospital for about five years, then went to work for doctors in Monmouth for 30 years. She continued filling in at the doctors' office for several years after that.\n\nShe then started working for the Monmouth Hospital Auxiliary, and was still showing up for shifts after she turned 100. Her last pin from the Auxiliary was for 5,000 hours of service.\n\nShe vividly recalls downtown Monmouth as a bustling place where there were iron posts around the square to tie up horses, and farmers gathered to socialize on the weekends, where you could buy just about anything you needed without leaving town.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, she wore a purple blazer to church and received several compliments about it. She told them she purchased the jacket at Spurgeon's, a downtown store that closed in 1993.\n\nIt's still good, she said with a smile.\n\nPaulson's life has not been without heartache.\n\nIn addition to losing her mother at a young age, her eldest daughter, Patricia LeGrand, died of cancer at age 57 in 1994. A grandson, Mark Goff, died in a motorcycle crash in 2008 when he was 37. After 42 years of marriage to the love of her life, Ernest Estes died in 1979. She later remarried, and lost her second husband in 1992.\n\nI've had a lot of sadness in my life, Paulson said. I've relied on God a lot, and he has brought me through all of it.\n\nAt 105, she's the last of her generation still here. Her sister, her cousins and her classmates are all gone. Her daughter turned 80 this year.\n\nPaulson said the highlights of her life are the birth of her two daughters, her 42-year marriage and the chance to serve the public through her jobs in the medical field.\n\nI've had a good life, she said.

Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK – For Grammy-nominated singer Joe, singing the hit song R. Kelly wrote and produced for him is out of the question.\n\nI've stopped performing the song, he said in a statement to The Associated Press, referring to More & More, a Top 20 R&B song released in 2003.\n\nNo music or intellectual property is worth being inconsiderate to the feelings or pain of others, 45-year-old Joe continued.\n\nIn the wake of multiple sexual abuse allegations against R. Kelly – which intensified this month with the release of the Lifetime documentary series Surviving R. Kelly – some performers are denouncing songs the R&B hitmaker created for them.\n\nSometime ago Jennifer Hudson removed two songs R. Kelly wrote for her from some streaming platforms, including YouTube and Apple Music: the Grammy-nominated It's Your World and Where You At, a Top 10 R&B hit. On Thursday, she removed Where You At from Spotify but It's Your World was still available.\n\nR&B star Fantasia told the AP she would no longer perform Sleeping With the One I Love, her Grammy-nominated 2016 single written by R. Kelly.\n\nI simply cannot, in good faith, continue to perform 'Sleeping With The One I Love.' In support of all of the survivors who so bravely came out, the track will no longer be a part of my setlist for all future performances, the former American Idol champion said.\n\nEarlier this month, Lady Gaga apologized for her 2013 duet with R. Kelly, Do What U Want, and removed the track from streaming services. Celine Dion followed Gaga's footsteps, removing her Grammy-nominated duet with the embattled singer, titled I'm Your Angel, from streaming platforms.\n\nLady Gaga pulls R. Kelly collaboration: 'Do What U Want' removed from streaming platforms\n\nAnd B2K, the boy band whose only song to the top the Billboard Hot 100 chart was the R. Kelly-produced Bump, Bump, Bump, said after their reunion tour, which kicks off in March, they will no longer perform that song, or the others R. Kelly crafted for them.\n\nAfter the tour, I am retiring those songs from my set list, lead singer Omarion tweeted. I too am raising a future queen.\n\nR. Kelly, who has denied all allegations of abuse against him, has written and produced his own hits like I Believe I Can Fly and Bump N Grind. He was once a white-hot hitmaker that most artists clamored to work with. R. Kelly was behind Michael Jackson's You Are Not Alone, which became the first song ever to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 when it did in 1995. He also worked on multiple songs for Whitney Houston's final album, 2009's I Look to You.\n\nHe produced Age Ain't Nothing But a Number, the 1994 debut album for Aaliyah, who was 15 when she married a 27-year-old R. Kelly the same year the album was released. The marriage was later annulled.\n\n'Surviving R. Kelly': Ex-assistant describes Aaliyah as 'worried, scared' duringalleged wedding\n\nDocumentary's impact: 'Surviving R. Kelly' reignites prosecutors' interest in Atlanta, Chicago\n\nAaliyah's album included Back & Forth, a Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; other Top 10 hits R. Kelly crafted for others included Stroke You Up and G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T. for R&B duo Changing Faces; 808 for the girl group Blaque; and Maxwell's Fortunate, the crowd favorite he performed at the last stop of his tour in New York in December.\n\nBut will he sing it again?\n\nSeveral artists, through their representatives, didn't return multiple email requests from the AP asking if they would continue to perform songs R. Kelly wrote for them, including Maxwell.\n\nA rep for Kelly Price, whom R. Kelly has worked with, declined to comment.\n\nR&B singer Syleena Johnson told the AP after looking closely at the lyrics of her debut song, the R. Kelly-penned I Am Your Woman, she can no longer perform the track. She said she got goosebumps just thinking about how she sang lyrics like Now I've been dealin' with you since sweet 16/Woman enough to let you raise me/You used to call me daddy's ghetto queen for roughly 20 years.\n\nToni Braxton is currently on tour but it's not clear if she's performing I Don't Want To, a hit song R. Kelly wrote for her multi-platinum sophomore 1996 album, Secrets. R. Kelly signed R&B singer Sparkle and produced her 1998 debut album, which included the hit Be Careful (Sparkle alleges Kelly sexually abused a young relative). And he even produced a mild hit for Britney Spears, 2004's Outrageous.\n\nKelly, RCA split ways: Controversial singer's label removes him from website\n\nWhy is that? R. Kelly may be under fire, but Chris Brown's career is flourishing\n\nR. Kelly also contributed to the careers of veteran acts like the Isley Brothers and Charlie Wilson, helping the seasoned performers find a home on contemporary radio alongside acts half their age (Wilson said last year he would not work with Kelly again).\n\nGospel singer Marvin Sapp's Listen was written and produced by R. Kelly and peaked at No. 2 on Billboard's Hot gospel songs chart last year. Though Listen was a success, Sapp has become an 11-time Grammy nominee thanks to his No. 1 hits like Never Would Have Made It, The Best In Me and My Testimony as well as Praise Him In Advance, a No. 2 hit.\n\nSapp said in a statement to The Associated Press he is praying for R. Kelly.\n\nBased on my biblical studies, I have always been an advocate that the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ is bigger than the messenger. This is a guiding principal for me. When I was recording my most recent album, I was presented with the song 'Listen,' written and produced by R. Kelly, he said.\n\nHe continued: It struck me immediately as a song with a powerful message that needed to be heard, and as a song that I needed to record. With the recent airing of the 'Surviving R. Kelly' docuseries (which I have not seen), the world is chiming in and taking sides. My sentiment remains the same: I am not called to cast stones or pass judgment on anyone involved. My responsibility, and my heart, is to pray – for everyone involved, he said.\n\nHe took pains to note that praying for someone does not equal supporting them and it does not equal defending them.\n\nMy prayer is that R. Kelly and everyone involved are restored and redeemed – body, mind and spirit.\n\nFantasia echoed some of Sapp's thoughts.\n\nI am a mom and I've had the chance to work with him and you know, I got to see a lot of things. I did. So, the best thing my mother always told me is – you have to pray for people. You have to pray for them and that's just what I'm doing now, she said in an interview with the AP. I'm praying for him and I hope that some things change because I am a mother and it breaks my heart.\n\nTimeline: Tracking R. Kelly's career of alleged sexual misconduct

Four days after Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos announced a divorce with his wife MacKenzie, a prominent figure took to Twitter to comment on the matter: Donald Trump.\n\nThe president appeared to mock the business giant and Washington Post owner in a tweet Sunday night, referring to Bezos as Jeff Bozo.\n\nSo sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post, Trump wrote. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox every morning\n\nTrump took note to what has been a tumultuous week for Bezos. A day after the announcement of the divorce between Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos – a marriage that had lasted for 25 years – the National Enquirer published what it called a four-month investigation tracking Bezos's time spent with former Fox L.A. TV anchor Lauren Sanchez.\n\nBeyond Bezos, Trump seems to be slamming the Post in this tweet, implying that supermarket tabloid the Enquirer is a more credible publication.\n\nNational Enquirer publisher, David Pecker, is a longtime friend of Trump. And American Media, which publishes the tabloid, has been linked in court papers to attempts to keep an alleged relationship between Trump and ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal more than a decade ago secret ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The Enquirer backed Trump for president, in its first-ever endorsement in the publication's history. And the Washington Post has reported that the Enquirer regularly sent stories for Trump to review before running, which the publication has denied.\n\nThis is not the president's first time attacking the Washington Post and Bezos's tie to Amazon.

PHOENIX – Police in Arizona announced the arrest of Nathan Sutherland, a 36-year-old nurse at Hacienda HealthCare facility, who they accuse of raping and impregnating an incapacitated woman in his care.\n\nThe woman gave birth to a baby Dec. 29. Staff members told a 911 operator that they had not known she was pregnant.\n\nPhoenix police tied Sutherland to the baby through a court-ordered DNA test administered to employees who had contact with the 29-year-old patient. He was booked into a Maricopa County jail on Wednesday on suspicion of sexual assault and vulnerable-adult abuse.\n\nHere's what we know about Sutherland so far:\n\nSutherland was adopted from Haiti\n\nSutherland was born in Haiti. Both he and his sister were adopted and brought to the U.S. in 1989.\n\nHis attorney, Dave Gregan, said he has lived in Arizona since 1993. Sutherland became a naturalized citizen in 2011.\n\nCourt records show he was living in Gilbert prior to his arrest.\n\nSutherland began working for Hacienda in 2012\n\nState nursing records show Sutherland completed his certified nursing-assistant training at the now-closed Seven HealthCare Academy in Tempe in 2005. He completed his licensed practical-nurse training at the for-profit Fortis College in Phoenix in 2011.\n\nHe passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Practical Nurses in October 2011. Records show his license allows him to practice in multiple states, and it's not due to expire until April 2020.\n\nIn his application to renew his nursing license in April 2016, Sutherland listed himself as married and said he had started at Hacienda HealthCare in January 2012.\n\nMore:Nurse arrested in sexual assault of incapacitated woman at Phoenix facility\n\nHis self-reported answers to background questions on the application listed no felony offenses, and no prior disciplinary actions.\n\nHacienda HealthCare officials say Sutherland went through an extensive background check when he was hired. They said he had been assigned to the Intermediate Care Facility-Intellectually Disabled since 2014.\n\nHe was primarily responsible for caring for the victim at the time of the assault, according to police.\n\nSutherland was fired Wednesday morning, the moment our leadership team learned of his arrest, according to a statement from the facility. Hacienda officials said his last shift was Sunday.\n\nMaricopa County Superior Court records show Sutherland has not been charged with any other major crimes.\n\nHis wife filed for divorce shortly before the victim gave birth\n\nSutherland's wife filed for divorce Dec. 5 – three weeks before the victim gave birth.\n\nShe requested that the court not disclose her address in the divorce petition because she was afraid Sutherland's ex-wife and former mother-in-law would harass her as they did before. She didn't provide any additional details.\n\nA copy of the summons was served to Sutherland while he was at work at Hacienda.\n\nMore:Rape victim who gave birth at nursing facility is not in a coma, lawyer says\n\nThe couple married in 2012, shortly after Sutherland's divorce from his first marriage was finalized.\n\nThe couple do not have any children together. Sutherland has two underage children from his first marriage.\n\nHe had a Christian rap duo with his sister\n\nSutherland was in a Christian rap duo known as Sleeplesssouljaz with his sister. A biography for the group states that the siblings were forced to learn the business side of society through the family business. They were forbidden to listen to rap and used music as an escape.\n\nMore:Nurse's 911 call details surprise birth\n\nThey released their first album in 2009, which is still available on Amazon.\n\nIt took many years to birth (record) our 1st album, but its finally here and it was worth every dime, sweat and tears, the group wrote.\n\nThey tweeted that a second album was in the works in 2011, but nothing was released. The Twitter and MySpace accounts have been inactive since 2014. Their last concert was apparently held that same year in Buckeye.
Dan Wolken\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nATLANTA — In public, the nicest guy in college basketball was putting up a good front. Josh Pastner was still returning every phone call, graciously responding to every e-mail, going about his under-the-radar charitable deeds as if he were still the most popular man in the city of Memphis.\n\nBut beneath a veneer of relentless positivity, the 39-year old Pastner was making himself sick. The stress of a program showing signs of decline, the burden of a contract fans didn't think he was living up to and the 24-7 scrutiny of a basketball-obsessed city had made Pastner wary of even leaving his house to go anywhere besides his office or the gym.\n\nYou won a game, and it was only relief, Pastner told USA TODAY Sports. I was depressed. It ate at me like you wouldn't believe. I wouldn't leave the house because I felt I let the entire city down. I would literally just sit on a chair in my house. I'd go to work when I had to go to work. I didn't sleep. I didn't eat. I was unhealthy.\n\nThat was 10 months ago, when it seemed like the wunderkind recruiting machine who came up under Lute Olson and John Calipari was stuck in a bad marriage with Memphis neither party could get out of.\n\nBut somehow, from the brink of personal breakdown and professional disaster, Pastner has suddenly emerged as one of the most surprising stories in college basketball. Restarting his career at Georgia Tech, which fired Brian Gregory after five mediocre seasons, Pastner has taken a team picked to finish 14th out of 15 in the Atlantic Coast Conference and improbably reeled off several impressive wins, positioning the Yellow Jackets (13-8, 5-4 ACC) to make their first NCAA tournament since 2010.\n\nMORE COLLEGE BASKETBALL\n\nFresh off another top-15 win, Georgia Tech looks tourney ready\n\nSwitch to zone paves way for Kansas comeback against Kentucky\n\nLuke Kennard's dagger three-pointer saves Duke for much-needed win\n\nNo. 3 Gonzaga rolls past Pepperdine, could be bumped up to top ranking\n\nWhat seemed like a fluke on Dec. 31 when Georgia Tech upset North Carolina, 75-63, now has a very different feeling after the last week in which the Yellow Jackets pummeled No. 8 Florida State, 78-56, then backed it up Saturday with a thrilling 62-60 win against No. 12 Notre Dame on freshman Josh Okogie's buzzer-beating layup.\n\nIt goes to show we can compete with anybody, said Okogie, whose emergence as a 15.2-points per game scorer is one reason the preseason evaluation of Georgia Tech's roster was laughably off the mark. We've been battle-tested. The ACC is crazy. We've played against the best teams in the country and beaten some of them, so why can't we be one of those teams?\n\nEven in the euphoria of Saturday's victory, which concluded with Pastner raising his arms and urging longtime coach Bobby Cremins to join the celebration on a court that bears his name, he does not deviate from the notion that Georgia Tech is in the midst of a massive rebuilding job.\n\nThough Pastner acknowledges that they have become a good team, the Yellow Jackets are not gifted offensively nor particularly deep, relying on a rotation that rarely goes beyond six or seven players. At every available opportunity, Pastner likes to remind people the same team that has built a strong NCAA tournament réesumé (including a non-conference win at Virginia Commonwealth in early December) also needed overtime to beat a Div. II team, Shorter College, in its debut this season.\n\nI have a sign in our locker room it says EPIP: Every possession is precious, Pastner said. That's who we are. We're a possession-by-possession team. If we don't play with the same energy and effort, we don't have a shot.\n\nAnd for those who have followed Pastner's career since the beginning, the level of execution and discipline Georgia Tech has displayed on a nightly basis is perhaps the biggest surprise of all. Though Pastner was widely praised for taking Memphis to the NCAA tournament four of his first five seasons, quickly restocking the program with highly ranked recruits and several McDonald's All-Americans in the wake of Calipari's departure, his reputation as a tactician and developer of talent had lagged far behind.\n\nWhile always athletic and deep, Pastner's Memphis teams too often relied on a helter-skelter, sometimes disorganized style of basketball that was routinely exposed against high-level opponents and experienced NCAA tournament coaches. Despite significant recruiting success early on, particularly with homegrown Memphis high school stars, Pastner didn't break through for a tournament win until his fourth season and didn't beat a top-25 ranked opponent until his fifth.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE WEEK IN COLLEGE HOOPS\n\nBy contrast, Pastner has Georgia Tech playing at a slower pace, relying on a defense that ranks among the nation's most efficient, and getting the most out of a well-coached offense that features relentless movement, some Princeton-style sets (assistant Tavares Hardy comes from the Bill Carmody/John Thompson III coaching tree) and hard cuts to create misdirection.\n\nPastner, in fact, said Georgia Tech spent more time in the offseason teaching players how to cut than anything else, an attribute that allows them to overcome a lack of outside shooting.\n\nThe first day I got the job and I had the guys for my first workout, I had them play three-on-three just so i could see them and after that I felt like we needed to spend time on cutting, both in and out, entrance and exit ball movement, Pastner said. We are so limited and our margin for error is zero, so if we don't cut with such great pace, violent cuts, we're not a real effective team.\n\nThat style has suited this roster, which had some hidden talent in the likes of Okogie and 6-10 junior Ben Lammers, who averaged just 15 minutes a game last season but has broken out as an NBA prospect (14.7 ppg, 9.7 rpg) who protects the rim, facilitates offense out of the high post and shoots effectively from mid-range.\n\nI feel like we have talent, said guard Tadric Jackson, who scored 25 off the bench against Notre Dame. We're a bad matchup (for other teams). The way we cut, the way we move the ball, our offense is hard to guard.\n\nTo Pastner's credit, Georgia Tech's players have bought in, which is perhaps the best evidence yet that a fresh start in coaching can cure many perceived problems.\n\nBy the time Pastner was finished at Memphis, after all, six out of seven recruits from his highly ranked 2013 class had transferred out, a clear sign of internal turmoil he was struggling to control. Though Pastner would argue that the unenviable task of following Calipari, who went 137-14 with a national championship game appearance in his final four seasons, unfairly diminished his accomplishments in the eyes of Memphis fans, there's no doubt tensions were rising the last two years as Pastner's teams missed the postseason entirely and were starting to struggle in recruiting.\n\nThe problem was his contract, signed following the 2014 season amid heavy interest from Southern California, which guaranteed him $10.6 million through the 2020 season. Despite an inferno of negativity from the fan base and an unhappy administration, Pastner was too expensive for Memphis to fire and locked into too good of a contract to walk away from. Compounding the misery was Pastner's penchant for consuming the daily menu of criticism directed at him in newspapers and talk radio, where the Tigers are a year-round topic.\n\nThough his financial future may have been secure, his well-being and the happiness of those around him was eroding quickly. That's why, when Georgia Tech became an option early last April, it made all the sense in the world for Pastner and Memphis, which sweetened the deal for him to leave by paying $1.255 million as a settlement.\n\nThough Pastner was far from Georgia Tech's top choice — the school was turned down by a series of coaches before the job fell to him — he was unintimidated by taking over a program that didn't return a single player who averaged more than 5.0 points last year. If he didn't win a single ACC game this season, as some experts predicted, that was fine.\n\nAt least Pastner had a fresh start and a chance to breathe in a larger sports market where Georgia Tech basketball only draws significant attention if its winning, as it did for years under Cremins and briefly under Paul Hewitt.\n\nThe situation probably scared some people away, but I was on the other end, Pastner said. The culture here wasn't screwed up. We've got great kids. They just needed an infusion of energy and enthusiasm. The boosters, the city, everyone needed a shot in the arm and it's a different situation. In Memphis, it's the DNA of the city. I wanted to win so bad because I knew what it meant. Here there's other things going on, which is great, and it allowed me maybe to have a little more freedom in some areas that maybe I didn't have. I can disappear a little bit. If I lose a game, I can go to a restaurant. I probably could in Memphis, but internally, I felt like I let the entire city down.\n\nInstead, Pastner has gotten Atlanta's attention and the nation's, too, as Georgia Tech pushed past the toughest part of its schedule and moves into a stretch where it can solidify a highly improbable NCAA tournament bid. And for Pastner, still as relentless in recruiting as ever, it may just be the beginning as he has some tangible results to show off in the talent-rich Atlanta area.\n\nI'm more clear on my vision and plan of how I want to get to where I want to get to than I've ever been, he said. When we got the job, Georgia Tech wasn't cool. These wins have given us a vision to sell to recruits. People can feel it and see it and touch it, so that will help us. I don't know what it will do for us late in 2017 but it'll do wonders for us down the road.\n\nRANKING THE 10 BEST COLLEGE BASKETBALL PLAYERS
Bryan Alexander\n\nUSA TODAY\n\n\n\n\n\nBurr Steers had his fears bringing his re-imagining of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice to the country's most ardent Austen fans.\n\nAfter all, he had directed Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, adapted from Seth Grahame-Smith's parody book, which plops the undead directly into the classic 19th-century novel of genteel manners.\n\nBut that didn't stop him from showing off his corpse-filled tale (in theaters Friday) — with Lily James as beloved heroine Elizabeth Bennet — to the Jane Austen Society of North America, which hosted a series of pre-release screenings.\n\nSteers just didn't want to be there when it happened.\n\nI was too scared to go, says Steers. I thought I would have been pummeled by a bunch of Jane Austen fans. You almost feel like you're walking over, or maybe shambling over, hallowed ground here.\n\nBut Janeites have taken to the undead insurgence. PPZ even earned a rave review in the New York branch's newsletter, which begins: It is a truth universally acknowledged that Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is funny.\n\nJASNA life member Devoney Looser, an English professor at Arizona State University, says she was caught by surprise.\n\nOops! Lily James really stomped a zombie extra's head on the 'PPZ' set\n\nI wouldn't describe myself as the target audience for a zombie film, but I really enjoyed Austen's characters mixing it up with the undead, says Looser. If I had gone in expecting accuracy or historical insight, I wouldn't have been pleased. But you don't go into a Jane Austen zombie film thinking you're going to learn something about Regency-era England.\n\nThere was plenty to learn about zombie slaying. It's the Bennet sisters who do the best zombie fighting in PPZ, fitting with the novel's more understated view of self-determination in marriage.\n\nThis is a girl-power feminist vehicle — I love the fierceness, says Looser, who has competed in roller derby under the name Stone Cold Jane Austen. And it was lighthearted fun.\n\nLooser's only criticism was a scene in which Elizabeth Bennet cries after overhearing Mr. Darcy (Sam Riley) call her only tolerable.\n\nThat was the only thing that bummed me out, says Looser. It wasn't in keeping with Austen's novels or what you'd expect from a zombie slayer.\n\nKerri Spennicchia of the JASNA-New York Metropolitan Region chapter was pleased there was enough actual Austen dialogue in the movie to keep it in the zombie-surrounded ballpark of the original.\n\nIt maintained the humor and the cast played it straight, says Spennicchia, who didn't even need the scarf she brought for eye cover in case of zombie gore. And there's a reasonable explanation of the zombie apocalypse.\n\nDeborah Yaffe, who wrote the book Among the Janeites: A Journey Through the World of Jane Austen Fandom, says the feedback that she has received from the faithful has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nWe have high standards for verbal wit, that's a good thing, says Yaffe. But if someone does something playful and interesting with Jane Austen, we don't have objection in principle. It just has to be well-executed.\n\nYaffe plans to find out for herself when PPZ opens.\n\nI'll see anything with Jane Austen in the title, she says. I'm prepared to be pleasantly surprised.
TRENTON, N.J. – Cory Booker, once mayor of New Jersey's largest city and now one of the most high-profile, media savvy U.S. senators, declared his candidacy for president Friday, joining an already crowded field of Democrats looking to be President Trump's 2020 challenger.\n\nBooker announced his long-anticipated decision the same way many Americans have come to know him, on Twitter, presenting himself as a healer of the country's deep divisions and stressing the importance of collective action.\n\nI believe that we can build a country where no one is forgotten, no one is left behind, Booker, 49, told his supporters in a rousing, 2-minute-and-25-second video. It is not a matter of can we, it's a matter of do we have the collective will, the American will? I believe we do.\n\nComing to prominence as mayor of Newark, then becoming New Jersey's first African-American senator after winning a special election in 2013 to fill the remainder of the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg's term, Booker can point to a record of backing liberal policies, from marriage equality and abortion rights to marijuana legalization and criminal-justice reform.\n\nIn December, Booker was central to a bipartisan effort to pass historic changes to tough-on-crime prison and sentencing laws that then gained Trump's signature.\n\nBut Democrats are wary of Booker's ties to Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry, relationships Booker has tried to downplay in recent months by, for example, renouncing contributions from corporate PACs but ones that could hurt him among progressive voters.\n\nBooker at one point was the top recipient of Wall Street money in Congress and, in 2017, voted against a proposal aimed at lowering prescription drug prices, earning him the ire of many in his own party.\n\nJan. 27:Who is running for president? Here's a list of the candidates who have declared so far\n\nJan. 21:California Sen. Kamala Harris announces 2020 presidential bid on 'Good Morning America'\n\nBooker joins a diverse field of candidates that probably will swell into one of the most crowded primary contests in Democratic Party history.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, 69, announced in December she was forming an exploratory committee, the first step a presidential hopeful takes before formally declaring. The two-term Massachusetts senator came into the national spotlight for her passionate criticism of Wall Street, the banking industry and large corporations after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nTwo other prominent senators, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Kamala Harris of California, launched campaigns soon thereafter.\n\nOther candidates include Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nBooker's first day on the campaign trail is expected to start with three call-in interviews on morning radio and TV programs and then an in-person appearance on ABC's The View.\n\nLater Friday, Booker is scheduled to hold a news conference outside his home in Newark's Central Ward, where he has lived for more than 20 years, first as a councilman and then as mayor for two terms.\n\nIn the video announcing his candidacy, Booker recounts his family's experience breaking the race barrier to buy a home in the New Jersey suburb where he grew up, Harrington Park, and credited that move with setting the stage for the rest of his life — from high school football star to scholarship athlete at Stanford, followed by a Rhodes scholarship, a Yale law degree and his political career.\n\nBooker frames his move to Newark as a way to pay forward the sacrifices made by his parents and notes that he is the only senator who goes home to a low-income inner-city community.\n\nJan. 12:Julian Castro, a Texas Democrat and former Obama Cabinet member, announces 2020 bid for president\n\nJan. 11:Democrat Tulsi Gabbard announces 2020 run for president to take on Trump\n\nOver archival footage of soldiers marching into battle that blend into images of modern-day protests, Booker intones that we are better when we help each other.\n\nThe history of our nation is defined by collective action, by interwoven destinies of slaves and abolitionists, of those born here and those who chose America as home, of those who took up arms to defend our country, and those who linked arms to challenge and change it, Booker says.\n\nTogether, we will channel our common pain back into our common purpose, he adds. Together, America, we will rise.\n\nFollow Nicholas Pugliese on Twitter: @nickpugz
Robert Powell\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ: In March of 2018, I will turn 66. I plan to continue working until age 70. According to my most recent Social Security statement, my payment would be about $1,729 per month at full retirement age; at age 70, I will be eligible for about $2,644 each month. I hope to defer collecting until age 70.\n\nI was divorced in 2010 after 30-plus years of marriage. My ex-husband is collecting Social Security benefits and, I believe, is receiving between $1,600 to $1,800 per month. He will not share with me the exact amount, but I assume that information is available.\n\nIn a conversation with Social Security last year, I was advised that, at my full retirement age of 66, I am eligible to collect one-half of my ex-spouse's benefits, continue to work full time, and continue to accrue my own benefits until I retire at age 70, and then collect the full amount ($2,644).\n\nThe Social Security Administration's publication, Retirement Planner: If You Are Divorced, states the following: If you were born before January 2,1954, and have already reached full retirement age, you can choose to receive only the divorced spouse's benefit and delay receiving your retirement until a later date.\n\nIn a telephone conversation with Social Security representative, I was told that this is not true. Apparently, my full retirement benefit is higher than the amount he is collecting. I know that recent rules have changed eligibility requirements, but I suspect that my birthdate before 1954 will allow me to begin to collect this coming March. Your input and clarification would be so much appreciated. – B.H.\n\nA: The person that you spoke to in your recent telephone conversation with Social Security is incorrect, says Jim Blankenship, a financial planner with Blankenship Financial Planning and author of Social Security for the Suddenly Single.\n\nSince you were born before 1954, Blankenship says you are eligible at your full retirement age or FRA to file what's called a restricted application for spousal benefits only. This provides you with the spousal benefit — one-half of your ex's benefit, essentially — and you can continue delaying your own benefit up to age 70, says Blankenship. You can also continue to work full time and this will not reduce your benefits.\n\nThis also assumes, he says, that you continue to be unmarried at this point. If you have remarried, you are not eligible for the spousal benefit based on your ex-spouse as long as the current marriage lasts, says Blankenship.\n\nQ: I am 84 and my wife is 83. I retired at 67 and began drawing Social Security. My wife did not work enough hours to qualify for Social Security. I currently receive $2,150 monthly and she receives $959. If I pre-decease her, what would she then receive? R.W.\n\nA: Whoever survives the first death, whether you or your wife, will get the higher of the two Social Security payments — $2,150 in your case, according to Andy Landis, author of Social Security: The Inside Story.\n\nThe Social Security Administration covers this topic at https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10084.pdf, on page 6.\n\nIncidentally, if your wife is the survivor, there won't even be any SSA paperwork; they'll automatically convert her to the survivor payment if and when they are notified of your death, says Landis.\n\nQ: I started collecting Social Security at full retirement age. My wife and I also have a dependent age 14 in the house who will be collecting half my Social Security for four years. Are there any restrictions on that benefit? Can I use that money to fund her 529 college savings plan, for instance? F.M.\n\nA: According to Darren Lutz, a public affairs specialist for the Social Security Administration, a person should use benefits for current needs such as food, clothing, shelter, utilities, dental and medical care, and personal comfort items, or for reasonably foreseeable needs.\n\nIf not needed for these purposes, he or she must conserve or invest the benefits for the beneficiary such as college savings or other savings, he says. He or she must use benefits in the best interests of the beneficiary, according to his or her best judgment.\n\nMore:How to prepare financially for being a widow/widower\n\nMore:Seven tips on becoming a 'financial' caregiver\n\nMore:Robert Powell: How to deal with debt in retirement\n\nRobert Powell contributes regularly to USA TODAY, TheStreet and The Wall Street Journal.

Brian Lyman\n\nMontgomery (Ala.) Advertiser\n\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. — The husband of a consultant whose relationship with now-former Gov. Robert Bentley led to his resignation was dismissed Tuesday from state government.\n\nIn her first full day on the job, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey accepted the resignation of Jon Mason, Bentley's director of faith-based services.\n\nMason's Cabinet-level agency coordinates volunteers and donations for disaster aid and is the liaison for faith- and community-based nonprofits. In the most recent fiscal year ending Sept. 30, Mason was paid $91,000, according to the state Comptroller's Office; he received almost $550,000 in salary and expenses since he first was appointed.\n\nHis agency, called ServeAlabama, was established in 2004 during President George W. Bush's administration. Mason, previously a meteorologist at WVUA-TV, Tuscaloosa, Ala., was hired in January 2011 as director after Bentley was inaugurated.\n\n► Related: How Bentley stacks up to famous political mugshots\n\n► Related: Robert Bentley resigns as Alabama governor\n\nThe newly installed governor is evaluating all staff, and all Cabinet members who will stay, (and) who will go, said Eileen Jones, Ivey's spokeswoman. The governor has asked members of the staff to turn in letters of resignation; his was accepted.\n\nShe spent much of her first day in office talking to staff.\n\nShe knows there are going to be many people asking her for stuff right now. She is smart enough to hear both sides before making a decision, said Retirement Systems of Alabama head David Bronner, who worked with Ivey in the James administration.\n\nNo other resignations of Bentley's staff and Cabinet were announced, and Jones did not say whether Mason's role in the scandal played a role in Ivey's decision. Mason did not return a message Tuesday seeking comment.\n\nBentley's relationship with Mason's wife, Rebekah Caldwell Mason, 45, brought the end of his 50-year marriage in 2015 and ultimately brought down his six-year administration.\n\nBentley, 74, resigned Monday after being arrested on two campaign-finance charges and becoming the subject of impeachment proceedings. He pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors, which resulted in a 30-day suspended jail sentence and 12 months of unsupervised probation, his giving up more than $50,000 to the state and 100 hours of community service.\n\nHe also gave up his right to seek public office again, his ability to appeal the sentence and all retirement benefits.\n\nAt the time of Bentley's resignation, Rebekah Mason was not a state employee, but her role as a consultant to Bentley and how she was paid were under state scrutiny.\n\nRebekah Mason served as press secretary for Bentley's 2010 gubernatorial campaign as well as communications director during part of his first term in office. She resigned from state employment in mid-2013 — she was paid $66,000 in her last full fiscal year in office — to work on Bentley's 2014 re-election campaign, and the governor reportedly became enamored with her then.\n\n► More: Alabama's new governor, Kate Ivey, promises open administration\n\n► Related: Robert Bentley, an unlikely governor ... an unexpected end\n\nThe Masons traveled with Bentley to President Trump's inauguration in January, about 10 months after former Secretary Spencer Collier of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency first accused Bentley of having an affair with Rebekah Mason, by then the governor's senior political adviser. Bentley and Jon Mason said the ServeAlabama director was meeting with directors of faith-based agencies in other states.\n\nThe Masons attended Bentley's State of the State speech in February, the first time in months that Bentley and Rebekah Mason were publicly seen in the same room.\n\nThough Ivey, 72, is Alabama's first GOP woman governor and only its second female governor — Democrat Lurleen Wallace, wife of controversial Gov. George Wallace, was the first — she is no stranger to politics.\n\n► Related: Report: Alabama's governor misused vehicles, personnel for affair\n\n► Related: Alabama governor seeks forgiveness in wake of ethics ruling\n\nShe started working for the state as a Democrat under then-Gov. Fob James in early 1980s, serving as first as executive assistant for social services and then as assistant director of the Alabama Development Office. In 1982, she ran for state auditor as a Democrat but was defeated.\n\nIn 2002, she ran as a Republican for state treasurer and was elected. She served two terms before running for governor in 2010 and then switching to the lieutenant governor's race.\n\nIvey is the country's fifth female governor now serving — joining Susana Martinez of New Mexico, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma, Gina Raimondo of Rhode Island and Kate Brown of Oregon. Martinez and Fallin are Republicans; Raimondo and Brown are Democrats.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press. Follow Brian Lyman on Twitter: @lyman_brian
AP\n\nMONTMELO, Spain (AP) — Troubled Formula One team McLaren has gotten off to a wretched start in preseason testing.\n\nFernando Alonso spent most of the first day waiting to get back out of the garage after his car broke down following just one lap at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya on Monday.\n\nWhat the team identified as an oil system malfunction to its Honda-made engine kept the two-time world champion out of action until after the lunch break. Back behind the wheel, his 29 total laps was the lowest amount of the 11 drivers who participated.\n\nAlonso also posted the second-slowest time, more than three seconds off the leading pace set by Lewis Hamilton in his Mercedes. Only Sauber's Marcus Ericsson was slower.\n\nIt's disappointing, Alonso said. You work for three months . and at the track on the installation lap something breaks down and you lose the day.\n\nThis misstep is the latest technical hiccup to plague McLaren since it paired up with Honda.\n\nOne of F1's most successful teams with eight constructor titles and 12 driver titles, the British outfit has struggled since it switched from Mercedes to the Japanese automaker before the 2015 season.\n\nAfter earning just a combined 27 points from Alonso and Jenson Button in the first year with Honda, the team showed some growth last season with 76 points and two fifth-place finishes. But that is still a far cry from the glory days of the Woking-based team whose last race win was in Brazil in 2012.\n\nFor his part, Alonso hasn't won a race since he claimed his 32nd victory back in 2013 at the Spanish Grand Prix while with Ferrari.\n\nIt is fair to say that after the difficulties we had the last three seasons, it's a nice temptation for the media, Alonso said.\n\nFrom the point of view of the team, we are disappointed and sad to arrive to the first day of testing and not run.\n\nWe are focused on what we have to do to make up the lost time. We know that we have four days for each driver and now one day is gone to prepare for the world championship.\n\nStoffel Vandoorne, who has replaced Button, will get his turn for McLaren on Tuesday.\n\nMcLaren team chief Eric Boullier acknowledged that the relationship with Honda is far from perfect.\n\nIt is like any marriage, you can have some ups and downs, Boullier said. We went through a lot of stress through the last couple of years, but we have a positive and constructive relationship and I don't expect this to change in the future.\n\nThe opening test will run through Thursday.\n\nThe track near Barcelona will host a second round of testing from March 7-10 before the season starts at the Australian GP on March 26.
This April marks the three-year anniversary of Michael Strahan and Kelly Ripa's messy morning-show breakup, when Strahan announced he would be departing Live With Kelly and Michael to join Good Morning America in 2016, followed by Ripa's sudden several-day disappearance from the show.\n\nWhile both stars are still morning-show fixtures, with Strahan hosting GMA and Ripa leading Live With Kelly and Ryan alongside Ryan Seacrest, Strahan revealed in a new Time interview that his personal friendship with Ripa never recovered from the ordeal.\n\nI learned through all that went down with that, you can't convince people to like you, he said. I haven't spoken to her in a long time.\n\nStrahan announced he'd be leaving Live With Kelly and Michael for GMA on April 19, 2016, with Ripa taking a previously unannounced week off from the show, prompting speculation that she was retaliating to Strahan's announcement. When she returned to the show on April 25, she delivered a speech alluding to Strahan's departure and her reaction to the news.\n\nI needed a couple of days to gather my thoughts; after 26 years with this company, I earned the right, she told the audience. (This) started a much greater conversation about communication, and consideration, and most importantly respect in the workplace ... apologies have been made.\n\nStrahan officially departed Live With Kelly and Michael on May 13, three months earlier than originally announced. One year later, Ryan Seacrest officially signed on to co-host with Ripa in May 2017.
William Cummings\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThere is nothing new about comments on how kids these days are different from the generations that came before them. In the case of Millennials, the U.S. Census Bureau has some data to back those observations up.\n\nToday's young adults look different from prior generations in almost every regard: how much education they have, their work experiences, when they start a family, and even who they live with while growing up, says a report from the Census Bureau released Wednesday.\n\nThe report looks at changes in social, economic and demographic trends among young American adults, defined as ages 18 to 34, over the past 40 years.\n\nIt found they increasingly live at home and delay starting a family. According to the report, that trend reflects a wider shift in attitudes about the importance of work and education over family. For example, more than half of all Americans think marriage and children are not important steps in becoming an adult, while more than 9 in 10 Americans believe that finishing school and being gainfully employed are important milestones of adulthood.\n\nThe report's author, Jonathan Vespa, a demographer at the Census Bureau, looked at four common milestones of adulthood: Getting married, having kids, getting a job and living on your own. He found the percentage of Americans achieving all four of those milestones by age 34 dropped from 45% in 1975 to 24% in 2016.\n\nVespa also found that while living on your own and holding a job was the fourth most common scenario in 1975, being a single worker was the second most common scenario by 2016 (a rise from 6% to 23%).\n\nThe report also found young women are pulling ahead in employment and wages, while those numbers on are the decline for young men.\n\nHere are some of the report's highlights:\n\nIn 1975, 25% of men between 25 and 34 had incomes of less than $30,000 (adjusted for inflation) per year. By 2016, it was 41%.\n\nThe number of young women ages 25 to 34 in the workforce jumped more than 40% between 1975 and 2016.\n\nThose young women saw their median income rise from $23,000 to $29,000 in the same time period, although men's remains $11,000 higher.\n\nBetween 1975 and 2016, the number of young female homemakers dropped from 43% to 14%.\n\n1 in 3 young Americans lives with a parent or parents. Of those, 1 in 4 does not work or go to school.\n\nIn 1975, far more young adults lived with a spouse than a parent. By 2016, more young adults lived with their parents than a husband or wife.\n\n41% of young families had a student debt in 2013, up from 17% in 1989 and the amount owed on those loans has almost tripled.\n\nYoung adults are increasingly putting off children and marriage.\n\nVespa cautioned against drawing broad assumptions about young Americans based on this data. For example, living with their parents may now be the most common living arrangement among young adults, but we want to be careful and not say that one experience describes all of the young adults who are living in their parents' home.\n\nMany assume those young Americans are in the basement playing video games, but most of the more than 8.3 million young people living with their parents are either working or in school. Roughly 25% of those young people are not employed or going to school, but out of that group 28% have a disability and another 21% have a child.\n\nIt is also important to note these trends fluctuate among different demographic groups. For example, 37% of black Americans between ages 18 and 34 live at home, compared with 26% of young Asians and 21% of young black Americans live with a spouse or unmarried partner, compared with 44% of whites.\n\nThere are also dramatic differences depending on where young Americans live. In many Midwestern states, the increase in young adults living at home has grown far more gradually than in other regions. North Dakota actually had 3.5% fewer young adults living with their parents in 2015 than 2005. Florida, on the other hand, saw that group grow 11% in the same time period.\n\nAs the report concludes: If one theme describes how adulthood has changed over the last 40 years, it is growing complexity.
Jonathan Merritt\n\nReligion News Service\n\nGospel singer Kim Burrell was uninvited from Ellen after a video surfaced of Burrell preaching against the perverted homosexual spirit at Houston's Love & Liberty Fellowship Church. According to Billboard, the singer posted a Facebook Live explaining her sermon, claiming her enemies only filmed part of her comments. I love you and God loves you, she said. But God hates the sin.\n\nHate the sin, love the sinner. It's a Christian cliché that has been used with increased frequency in recent years because it is often invoked by conservative Christians in debates about homosexuality and gay marriage. Many who use this phrase don't intend to harm others but wish to express love for another at some level.\n\nBut the scriptural reasoning behind this phrase is unclear. Jesus never asked us to Love the sinner, hate the sin and neither did any other Biblical writer. The closest phrases to this in Christian history — as pastor and Bible scholar Adam Hamilton writes in Half Truths: God Helps Those Who Help Themselves and Other Things the Bible Doesn't Say — are a letter from St. Augustine to a group of nuns (encouraging them to have love for mankind and hatred of sins).\n\nThe clearest use of this phrase actually derives from Mahatma Gandhi in his 1929 autobiography: Hate the sin and not the sinner. But Gandhi's full statement has a bit different flavor: Hate the sin and not the sinner is a precept which, though easy enough to understand, is rarely practiced, and that is why the poison of hatred spreads in the world. Gandhi rightly observed that it is difficult — perhaps impossible — to see someone else firstly as a sinner and to focus on hating their sin without developing some level of disdain for the person. Perhaps this is why Jesus did not ask us to love sinners but to love neighbors and enemies.\n\nAs Hamilton writes:\n\nI think Jesus knew that if he commanded his disciples to 'love the sinner,' they would begin looking at other people more as sinners than neighbors. And that, inevitably, would lead to judgment. If I love you more as a sinner than as my neighbor, then I am bound to focus more on your sin. I will start looking for all the things that are wrong with you. And perhaps, without intending it, I will being thinking about our relationship like this: You are a sinner, but I graciously choose to love you anyway. If that sounds a little puffed up, self-righteous, and even prideful to you, then you have perceived accurately.\n\nBurrell's use of the argument has prompted others to repeat it on Twitter, with many Christians supporting her, many gay allies condemning the logic of the phrase and its application to seemingly only the LGBT community, and relatively few in between.\n\n3 Untrue Christian cliches you've probably used (but shouldn't)\n\nFrank Ocean's mom wants to remove Kim Burrell from his album

Tarantino ended up running up onstage, saying I agree with the critics for the very first time! The film also won for original screenplay and production design.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix gave an emotional toast to his mom\n\nAfter winning the best-actor prize for Joker, Phoenix took the stage with one person top of mind. I need to thank my mom. Mom, you've always been my greatest inspiration, even when self-pity led me astray, Phoenix said. You've never given up on me and I deeply appreciate your support. Phoenix appeared on 60 Minutes Sunday, opening up about how vulnerable his family felt in the media glare after his brother, River, died in 1993.\n\nOscar nominations 2020:Who's in for sure – and who may get snubbed\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge says 'Fleabag' was inspired by … J.Lo\n\nFleabag creator Waller-Bridge made a the surprise admission after winning best actress in a comedy TV series Sunday night.

I'll let you know when I meet an old man,'  said Lear, laughing. He then strode triumphantly off the stage, promising, I may not stop.
Maeve McDermott\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNot only did the actresses of Big Little Lies sweep their Golden Globes categories, they also used their acceptance speeches at Sunday night's ceremony to make statements about the power of women to speak out against harassment and intimidation.\n\nIn her acceptance speech for best supporting actress in a series, limited series or TV movie, Laura Dern linked her character's struggles with her daughter's bullying to the current cultural conversation about harassment.\n\nDern described how her character Renata Klein was terrified because her little girl was being abused and bullied by a classmate, and she was too afraid to speak up.\n\nMany of us were taught not to tattle, she continued. It was a culture of silence and that was normalized. I urge all of us to not only support survivors and bystanders who are brave enough to tell their truths, but to promote restorative justice. May we also please protect and employ them. May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture's new North Star.\n\nGolden Globes 2018:The winners' list\n\nMore Golden Globes:Minute-by-minute updates from the awards\n\nSeveral categories earlier, Nicole Kidman won the Golden Globe for best actress in a limited series for her portrayal of Celeste Wright, a woman trapped in an abusive marriage.\n\nThis character that I played represents something that is the center of our conversation right now: abuse, she said. I do believe and I hope that we can elicit change through the stories we tell and the way we tell them.\n\nAlexander Skarsgård, who played Celeste's husband Perry Wright, also won the Globe for best supporting actor in a limited series, thanking his female co-stars, producers and the author of the original Big Little Lies novel, Liane Moriarty.\n\nI am here tonight because I had a privilege of working with a group of extraordinarily talented women, he said. Most of them are in this room tonight.\n\nSpeaking backstage, Big Little Lies star/producer Reese Witherspoon told reporters that following the Harvey Weinstein revelations and other stories of harassment across various industries, there was a collective feeling it wouldn't be business as usual.\n\nWe are more united in the industry, men and women, determined to change our own industry but also to shine a light on other industries, she said. (There are) a lot of people in other industries who don't get the opportunity to speak up.\n\nWitherspoon also made the case for more female-led shows, saying they make Hollywood look like the world really looks. When women are the architects, stories change...The same people have been telling stories over and over again. It feels like it's changing.\n\n\n\nContributing: Bill Keveney
Harriet Baskas\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nA pop-up license bureau is being set up at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas to accommodate all the lovebirds with marriage plans who flock to the city around Valentine's Day.\n\nGetting married in Las Vegas is popular year-round. But each year around Valentine's Day and the Presidents Day weekend, the Clark County Clerk's office in downtown Las Vegas office reports issuing more than 1,500 marriage licenses, about twice the number they do during other times of the year.\n\nThis year the Chinese New Year, considered by many to be a lucky day to tie the knot, falls on Feb. 16, and marriage license requests in Las Vegas are expected to surge. So to make it easier for couples flying to Sin City to get legally hitched this year, the County Clerk's office will issue marriage licenses from Feb. 9 to 17 from a pop-up office in the airport's Terminal 1 baggage claim area.\n\nThe pop-up shop hours will run daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and credit cards will be accepted for the $77 license fee. That will help streamline the process a bit, but to make sure there are no glitches on the way to getting hitched, the clerk's office encourages those planning to get licenses to fill out a license pre-application form online. Couples will need to bring the reference number issued with them to the marriage license pop-up, along with proper identification.\n\nKeep in mind that getting a marriage license doesn't mean you'll be legally married. You'll still need to find Elvis or another legally authorized person to perform a proper marriage ceremony.\n\nFor those in a hurry to get married, McCarran International Airport offers several other useful amenities, including a to-go liquor store in the Terminal 1 baggage claim.\n\nWe have 24-hour flower vending machines in baggage claim, said McCarran airport spokeswoman Christine Crews. And I suppose if you add a stop or two in the terminal to visit our apparel retailers and/or one of the purveyors of jewelry, you could get everything you need before getting your marriage license in baggage claim. Then hop into a limousine on the curb and be off to the chapel.\n\nHarriet Baskas is a Seattle-based airports and aviation writer and USA TODAY Travel's At the Airport columnist.

From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Transgender students would be required to play sports under their gender assignment at birth instead of how they live under a bill approved Wednesday by a committee in the state House of Representatives. The House State Government Committee voted 8-4 for the Gender Is Real Legislative Act, or GIRL Act, by Republican Rep. Chris Pringle. The bill, which awaits input from the full House, would ban K-12 schools from allowing trans athletes to compete under their gender identity. It would instead require students to participate under the gender listed on their original birth certificate. Opponents criticized the measure as motivated by fear and discrimination toward trans people. Pringle said the bill is designed to ensure a level playing field in girls' sporting events. Pringle acknowledged he knew of no competition problems in Alabama but said disputes have arisen in other states.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state Department of Fish and Game will conduct its fourth survey of moose in the Anchorage area with the help of citizen scientists. The three-day survey relies on citizens to call or text in sightings of moose. The 2020 survey begins at 8 a.m. Friday and runs through 5 p.m. Sunday. Biologists in less populated areas conduct moose surveys from the air. Pilots fly paths close to the ground and circle when they spot moose. Anchorage air traffic and flight restrictions make that impossible, said Dave Battle, area biologist. It's just not something that can be done in the Anchorage Bowl, he said. Anchorage spans 1,963 square miles, an area the size of the state of Delaware, with a population as of July 2018 of 291,500. Residents embrace moose as part of the landscape, and the animals at times can be seen in the busiest parts of the city.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The City Council has voted to oppose controversial state legislation that would seek voter approval to enshrine a statewide ban on sanctuary cities in the Arizona Constitution. The Republican-led Legislature already has taken the first steps to pass the legislation for a constitutional ban on sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The state already has an existing ban on sanctuary cities, implemented in 2011. The Arizona Daily Star reports that while no local jurisdictions in Arizona meet the definition of a sanctuary city, and the city of Tucson overwhelmingly rejected a ballot proposition to become one in November, law enforcement agencies in Tucson have adopted immigrant-friendly policies.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Supreme Court on Thursday said it won't reconsider its ruling rejecting a death row inmate's request for new DNA testing of evidence that his attorneys say could exonerate him. In a 5-2 decision, justices rejected Stacey Johnson's petition for rehearing over the court's decision last year that he wasn't entitled to the additional testing of evidence from the 1993 killing of Carol Heath. Johnson was one of eight inmates Arkansas sought to execute over an 11-day period in 2017 before its supply of a lethal injection drug expired. Johnson and three other inmates were spared by the courts, and Arkansas ultimately put the other four men to death. Arkansas doesn't have any executions scheduled, but Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in December said the court's ruling cleared the way for Johnson's. Arkansas doesn't currently have any execution drugs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: In an unusual reversal, federal regulators this week agreed to cover about $300 million in repair costs at the Oroville Dam, where a spillway collapse three years ago prompted the evacuation of nearly 190,000 people in Northern California. The Federal Emergency Management Agency said last March that it wouldn't pay for repairs involving damage regulators said existed at the Sierra Nevada dam before the collapse. But after an appeal, FEMA agreed to cover the repairs, the Sacramento Bee reports. The state now expects to be reimbursed for about $750 million of the $1.1 billion in repair costs, Erin Mellon, spokeswoman for the state Department of Water Resources, said in an email to the Bee. This is pretty rare, and for California it's huge money, Jerry Quinn, a Sacramento consultant who helps government agencies recover money from FEMA, told the paper.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Graduates from the U.S. Air Force Academy in the state are expected to cross-commission into the Space Force this spring, military officials said. About 60 cadets would be commissioned into the new armed service branch, which formed in December with the signing of the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act, the Gazette reports. They're doing Air Force Academy curriculum, and they'll just be directly commissioned into the Space Force, academy Vice Superintendent Col. Houston Cantwell said. Academy leaders and members of the Colorado's congressional delegation announced the cross-commission plan at an oversight Board of Visitors meeting Wednesday. The plan would be similar to how the U.S. Naval Academy commissions Marine officers. It is unclear how exactly academy leaders plan to commission cadets into the Space Force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont says he is dropping his plan for highway tolls for trucks, expressing frustration with legislative leaders who have delayed a vote on the issue. The General Assembly had planned to vote Thursday on the tolls, which were under consideration to fund a wide-ranging transportation improvement plan. But Lamont, a Democrat, said Wednesday that the Senate needed more time. I think it's time to take a pause, Lamont said at a news conference. Tolls for trucks had been projected to raise an estimated $200 million. Lamont said he plans for now to generate that money instead through state borrowing.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Some lawmakers want the state to start compensating people who were put in prison and then later found to be not guilty. A bill waiting on a vote in the state House would compensate people as much as $50,000 per year they were incarcerated, as well as some attorney's fees. Emeka Igwe, an attorney, said his client Elmer Daniels was the catalyst for the legislation. After Daniels served 39 years for a rape he says he didn't commit, he was basically released with just a T-shirt on his back and left to fend for himself. Under the proposed bill, if someone were imprisoned in Delaware for one or more crimes that they didn't commit, they could file a complaint in Superior Court within three years of the wrongful conviction being reversed or vacated. If an eligible person had been in prison for less than a year, their compensation would be $137 for each day they were incarcerated.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: What country music is to Nashville and jazz is to New Orleans, go-go is to D.C. And on Wednesday, the living legends of go-go music came out to the Culture House DC art center to witness history, WUSA-TV reports. Gregory Sugar Bear Elliot, lead singer of Experience Unlimited; Big G of BackYard Band; and the oldest daughter of Chuck Brown – the godfather of go-go – were all present to see Mayor Muriel Bowser sign a bill designating go-go as the official music of D.C. The creative arts performance space was packed with people wearing green Don't Mute DC hats and T-shirts, and the crowd was pumped up. Before signing the official document, in true call-and-repeat go-go fashion, Bowser asked the crowd to chant with her. When I say go-go, you say 'is D.C.,'  she shouted. The crowd enthusiastically chanted it three times.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: An algae toxin 1,000 times deadlier than cyanide lingers at trace levels in the livers of bottlenose dolphins in the Indian River Lagoon, a new study shows, remaining there even when the algae is not blooming. The long-term health implications for the lagoon's top predator and other marine life remain uncertain. We're not making any conclusions about what it's doing to them, said Spencer Fire, an assistant professor at Florida Tech. The study for the first time establishes a baseline level of the toxin in lagoon dolphins by which to compare future toxin levels during dolphin strandings or die-offs. This is what we expect to be sort of background levels, Fire said. The poison, called saxitoxin, comes from the same algae that glows like fairy dust at night in the lagoon. The study, led by Florida Tech, is the first report of saxitoxin being detected in marine mammals absent an algae bloom.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Lawmakers are considering raising the state's minimum dropout age from 16 to 17. But a Wednesday hearing on Senate Bill 343 revealed concerns about how much additional students would cost the state, as well as whether it's worthwhile for the state to try to force uninterested teens to remain in school. The Senate Education and Youth Committee didn't vote on the bill. Chairman P.K. Martin, a Lawrenceville Republican, promised another hearing, but it's unclear if the measure will move forward. Some Democrats have been seeking for years to raise past 16 the age for students choosing to leave school. If we allow young people to leave our schools at 16, there are no jobs for them, said the bill's sponsor, Democrat Lester Jackson of Savannah. He argues the 16-year-old age was set when unskilled jobs such as being a farmhand were widely available.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A paddleboarder earned the Maui Police Department's highest civilian honor for fighting off an attack by a tiger shark to protect members of a tour group he was leading. The department awarded its Civilian Medal of Valor to Triston Kahookele-Santos on Tuesday, The Maui News reports. The 20-year-old employee of the Andaz Beach Crew, part of the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, was leading five stand-up paddle-boarders about a quarter-mile offshore about 9:30 a.m. Feb. 5. The group was watching whales and following fish and a manta ray, Maui police spokeswoman Lt. Audra Sellers said. A 10-foot tiger shark appeared and launched an attack at a Washington man in the group, violently thrashing his board, Sellers said. Kahookele-Santos used the blade of his paddle to strike the shark, which let go of the board and turned on Kahookele-Santos. The others paddled safely to shore as he fought off the shark with the paddle while it circled him three times. No injuries were reported as a result of the attack.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A bill that would reduce the number of people required to report suspected child abuse narrowly won approval from a panel of state lawmakers. The House Judiciary and Rules Committee approved the bill 9-8, The Times-News reports. Currently, anyone in the state who sees evidence of child abuse, abandonment or neglect is required to report that evidence to law enforcement, and those who don't can be charged with a misdemeanor. The legislation approved Wednesday would remove that requirement for most residents, leaving only teachers, doctors, law enforcement officials and social workers as mandatory reporters. Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, says unfounded child abuse claims cost taxpayers money. But Rep. John McCrostie, D-Boise, and Rep. Linda Hartgen, R-Twin Falls, both opposed the legislation, saying it could lead to underreporting of child abuse, causing real harm to Idaho kids. The bill now heads to the full House.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city's former police chief has been receiving a pension of more than $15,800 a month since the mayor fired him in December for allegedly lying about a night he was found asleep in his city-issued SUV, according to a newspaper report. Eddie Johnson was awarded the pension by the Policemen's Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago, the Chicago Tribune reports, citing records it obtained under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act. The pension adds up to nearly $190,000 annually, or 75% of his average salary of just over $253,000 per year during his final four years with the Chicago Police Department. Johnson, 59, blamed medication for making him drowsy before he was found asleep in his SUV, but media reports disclosed that the married superintendent had been drinking for hours and kissing a woman on his security detail and that the responding officers took steps to keep it secret.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor has told state agencies to calculate the damage along the Lake Michigan shoreline that's been caused by high water ahead of possibly seeking federal assistance. The order announced Thursday comes as several lakeshore communities have already declared local beach erosion emergencies with waves damaging property and threatening roads. The Indiana Department of Homeland Security has declined to declare a state emergency, but Gov. Eric Holcomb said he wanted a new review after viewing the shoreline by helicopter Sunday. The erosion is happening as Lake Michigan approaches its highest levels in recorded history, and forecasters expect the Great Lakes to remain high well into 2020. State Sen. Karen Tallian, an Ogden Dunes Democrat, called Holcomb's action long overdue, as she asked the governor for an emergency declaration almost two months ago.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: Those hoping to visit the Field of Dreams movie site the week of Major League Baseball's game between the New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox had better have a ticket. Go the Distance, which runs the site of the iconic baseball movie, announced the grounds would be inaccessible to fans Aug. 8-16. The White Sox and Yankees will play Aug. 13 on a specially made field located next to the field and on the grounds. A spokesperson for MLB says information about ticket plans for the game will be made available in March or April. The site has been a hot-spot tourist attraction for baseball fans who have flocked to the iconic diamond built in the middle of a Dyersville cornfield, made famous by Kevin Costner's 1989 blockbuster. There will be plenty of other activities around town before the game, including exhibits, games, a Fan Fest and a movie showing.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Legislature's auditing division says state agencies have significant information technology security weaknesses and haven't made progress since previous reports showed the same problems. More than half of 19 state agencies studied failed to comply with IT security practices that protect sensitive information against data loss or theft. The findings were presented to the Legislative Post Audit Committee in an executive session and published online. The audit division studied IT functions at agencies from January 2017 to December 2019. Most agencies failed to scan and patch computers to keep them secure. They didn't have adequate response plans and didn't encrypt, back up or destroy electronic data. The report blamed a lack of management attention and inadequate resources for the failures.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear spoke at an LGBTQ-rights rally in the Capitol on Wednesday, advocating for a statewide fairness law and a bill banning conversion therapy. Kentucky cannot reach its full potential if all of our people don't feel supported to be themselves, Beshear said. Discrimination against our LGBTQ brothers and sisters is absolutely unacceptable in this commonwealth. The rally, held by the Louisville-based Fairness Campaign every legislative session, featured activists and legislators advocating for those bills and against a slew of bills targeting transgender youth. Beshear threw his support behind legislation banning discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, which has failed to pass either chamber in each legislative session over the past decade.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A month after delaying a decision, the state's higher education policy-making board voted Wednesday to bolster its minimum admission standards for public universities by adding the threat of financial penalties for campuses that disobey the requirements. The Board of Regents approved the adjustments to the state's existing, 15-year-old admissions standards without objection, after weeks of behind-the-scenes negotiations to get board members comfortable with the changes. Most of the rewrites were modest. But the penalty provisions represent the first real effort to force compliance with the policy. The board has never penalized schools for not complying with admissions criteria. Still, financial penalties won't be automatic for campuses that violate the admissions criteria, and the threat of reduced funding doesn't come unless a school has breached the policy for two consecutive years.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Lobsters have long delighted tourists as the state's most beloved seafood. But one company thinks the crustaceans can save human lives by providing their blood for use in new drugs. The company working on the lobster blood project, Lobster Unlimited of Orono, is investigating whether lobster blood can be used as a potential weapon against viruses and cancer. Representatives with the company said results are promising – the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued them a patent in late October related to their work. The blood is easy to come by because it's a byproduct of lobster processing, company head Robert Bayer said. Lobster blood is likely a long way from playing a role in new drugs, Bayer said, but there's no question it has antiviral and anticancer properties based on research needed to apply for the patent. Right now, this blood is literally thrown out on the floor and goes down the drain, said Bayer, a professor emeritus of Animal and Veterinary Sciences at University of Maine.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030, under an ambitious measure outlined Wednesday as the coastal state grapples with increasing concerns about sea-level rise. The legislation would increase the state's current goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, based on 2006 levels. It also would set the state on a path toward achieving net-zero statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. Supporters of the Climate Solutions Act of 2020 say Maryland, which has about 3,100 miles of tidal shoreline, must be a leader in addressing rising sea levels. Environmentalists say the measure is the the most comprehensive approach to addressing greenhouse gas emissions before lawmakers this session in a Legislature controlled by Democrats. The measure's goals include planting 1 million trees a year in the state for a decade. It also calls for requiring new commercial buildings with 25,000 square feet of rooftop to use solar panels.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nChicopee: A former police sergeant accused of lying about his role in sharing pictures of a homicide victim has been reinstated to the department. The state Civil Service Commission voted to allow Jeffrey Godere to return to the Chicopee Police Department at a lower rank after winning an appeal of his termination, MassLive.com reports. Godere was fired by then-Mayor Richard Kos in November 2018 after he and three other officers were implicated in sharing images of a victim's body and the crime scene in the 2011 killing of 20-year-old Amanda Plasse. The commission ruled last week that Godere would be demoted to patrolman because of his misconduct and prior disciplinary record. City officials and the police department are reviewing the commission's decision with lawyers and exploring options to appeal it in superior court, according to Michael Wilk, public information officer.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Marijuana will have to carry labels warning pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers about the health risks for their fetuses and infants under newly enacted state laws. Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist signed the two bills Wednesday because Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was out of the state. The labels must be placed on legal recreational and medical marijuana products and warn that use by pregnant or breastfeeding women may result in fetal injury, preterm birth, low birth weight or development problems for children. The laws also require that an informational pamphlet be made available at every point of sale. It must include safety information related to use by minors and include the poison control hotline number – in case children accidentally eat candy or brownies that contain marijuana.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBecker: Firefighters battled a stubborn fire at a metal recycling plant in this small community for a third consecutive day Thursday. The fire at the Northern Metals plant in Becker was unleashing noxious, billowing smoke, and the wind had shifted direction, prompting school officials to cancel classes for the day. Firefighters from around the region continued to work the blaze in the Sherburne County city about 50 miles northwest of Minneapolis. In a Facebook update late Wednesday, the Becker Police Department said the fire could last several more days. Firefighting crews were using heavy equipment to separate a portion of a burning stack of vehicles in hopes that the blaze would eventually die out. The strategy was intended to protect nearby buildings.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Replicas of Christopher Columbus' Nina and Pinta have arrived along Mississippi's Gulf Coast, sailing into a Biloxi harbor as spectators aimed their phones out to the horizon. About a dozen spectators lined a pier Wednesday as the ships arrived. Christopher Columbus sailed across the Atlantic on the Nina on his three voyages of discovery to the New World beginning in 1492. He was long celebrated in the U.S., but in recent years a reckoning has been held with the brutal aspects of his legacy. Columbus' arrival brought violence, disease, enslavement, racism and exploitation to the native people. The original Nina was last heard from in 1501, but this replica, finished in 1991, serves as a floating museum. It was built entirely by hand, without the use of power tools, and is considered the most historically accurate Columbus ship replica ever built. The Pinta replica was built in Brazil and launched in 2005 to accompany the Nina on travels. While in port, the ships will be open for public tours. They are scheduled to leave Biloxi on March 2.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The St. Louis Zoo announced Thursday that it has a new resident in Teak, a black and white colobus monkey born Feb. 3. Colobus monkeys are born white with a pink face. By age 6 months, the little monkey will get his adult coloration – mostly black hair but with white hair around the face and part of the tail, though adults also have a distinctive mantle of long white hair from their shoulders around the edge of their backs. Colobus monkeys live in families with several females sharing in the care of newborns, a behavior called allomothering. Teak's mother, Cecelia, has raised five babies of her own along with three other babies in the family, the zoo said. Teak's father, Kima, watches over the family and often interacts with the youngsters, the zoo said. Teak's sister and his half-sister also interact with and help care for Teak. The monkeys, also known as Guereza colobus, are native to east and central Africa.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame officials say they are saddling up with the C.M. Russell Museum on an inaugural exhibit within the internationally known museum in Great Falls that will add to the celebration of the American West. The exhibit, a two-year pilot project planned to open in September, would be a blend of Cowboy Hall of Fame honorees and their history. Efforts are underway to curate the specific content for the initial exhibit, Cowboy Hall of Fame board member Mike Gurnett said at a Feb. 7-8 meeting. The exhibit in Great Falls gives something of a foothold for the hall of fame. The Montana Cowboy Hall of Fame, established by the Legislature, has spent nearly 17 years looking for a permanent home after an effort failed in Big Timber. Earlier attempts in Wolf Point and other communities never came to fruition.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A state senator who is pushing the Legislature's main bill to lower property taxes says she hopes to reach a deal with opponents who are trying to derail it out of concern that it could hurt the state's K-12 public schools. Sen. Lou Ann Linehan, of Omaha, said Thursday that she and other senators will try to find an agreement with school officials who are lobbying against the measure. The bill has won support from farm and business groups and Gov. Pete Ricketts because it would lower taxes that have risen over the past decade. But school administrators, school boards and the state teachers' union argue it would hinder their long-term spending flexibility. This bill is bad for Nebraska, and it's bad for our kids, said Sen. Wendy DeBoer, of Bennington, who opposed the measure. The bill would boost state aid to schools by about $520 million over three years and redistribute it so that smaller, rural schools get a larger increase.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Virgin Trains Las Vegas has released plans to build a proposed train station near the South Premium Outlets mall south of the Strip. The $4.8 billion high-speed rail link with Southern California would be two stories tall and span more than 273,000 square feet, with a seven-story-tall parking garage, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Construction is scheduled to begin later this year, according to planning documents submitted to Clark County. Operations are scheduled to begin in 2023. Plans call for the two-story station to include a self-ticketing area, departure lobby, retail space, baggage claim, office space, passenger waiting areas and security. Plans also include a parking garage that would connect to the train terminal and have more than 2,600 parking spaces. The project would be designed to provide easier access to California, while also providing thousands of jobs and opportunities in the area, company officials said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nCroydon: The police chief took it literally when he was stripped of his duties at a local board meeting, disrobing to his underwear and walking out into a snowstorm. Richard Lee has been chief in the small town of Croydon for 20 years. On Tuesday night, the three-member selectboard voted to eliminate the one-man department and move to 100% coverage by the New Hampshire State Police. Lee, who was at the meeting, was told to turn in the key to his cruiser, his guns and his uniform – immediately. He went into an office he shared with town officials and took off his clothes before the board chairman. I gave them my uniform shirt. I gave them my turtleneck. I gave them my ballistic vest. … I sat down in the chair, took off my boots, took off my pants, put those in the chair and put my boots back on, and walked out the door, Lee said. He didn't have spare clothes or a ride home. He walked nearly a mile before his wife picked him up.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEgg Harbor Township: A Superior Court judge has denied a neighborhood's attempt to leave the township and join a neighboring borough. Judge Julio Mendez ruled that Egg Harbor Township's refusal to allow Seaview Harbor residents to join Longport was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The township argued against the move, declaring that it would harm the township economically and socially and benefit the homeowners only economically, the Press of Atlantic City reports. The homeowners stood to pay significantly less in property taxes in Longport, which does not have a school system. Mendez said court decisions have not favored de-annexation for tax shopping. Mendez's opinion said the township stood to lose over $500,000 a year in municipal tax revenue and $1.8 million in revenue to township schools. The average homeowner would save almost $18,000 a year in property taxes, based on 2015 numbers.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: A conservation group is calling on members of the state's congressional delegation to rethink proposed legislation that would change the designation of Bandelier National Monument to a national park. While one of the goals is to attract more tourists to the region with the national park brand, the nonprofit group Caldera Action said Bandelier would not be able to cope with additional crowding because of inadequate and crumbling infrastructure and limited staffing. The group also is worried about opening up part of Bandelier to hunting and trapping, saying there are other locations throughout the Jemez Mountains that already allow for hunting, and doing so at Bandelier would complicate management for the National Park Service. Tucked into northern New Mexico's ancient canyons, Bandelier has a long history that stretches back more than 11,000 years to the days when nomadic hunters and gatherers tracked wildlife across the region's mesas and canyons. Grand multistory structures were built into the walls of Frijoles Canyon and along Frijoles Creek centuries ago, but all that remains are stone and mortar outlines of the settlements.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Animal rights advocates have lost a bid to get a Bronx Zoo elephant declared to have human-like rights and transferred to a sanctuary, though a judge said the case for sending the pachyderm to a sanctuary was extremely persuasive. Bronx Judge Alison Tuitt on Tuesday dismissed the Nonhuman Rights Project's petition arguing that Happy the elephant is unlawfully imprisoned at the zoo where she has lived since 1977. She has been kept separate from other elephants for more than a decade. New York courts have previously said animals aren't legally considered persons, and Tuitt said those rulings applied to Happy, too. But the judge said she was extremely sympathetic to Happy's plight. This court agrees that Happy is more than just a legal thing, or property. She is an intelligent, autonomous being who should be treated with respect and dignity, and who may be entitled to liberty, the judge wrote, calling the arguments for transferring Happy from her lonely exhibit to a sprawling elephant sanctuary extremely persuasive.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A free downtown music and arts festival that organizers say draws 30,000 locals and tourists may be canceled this summer. LEAF Downtown AVL official Ehren Cruz has said the sixth annual festival scheduled for Aug. 7-8 until 10 p.m. at Pack Square Park may not happen, after organizers were asked to have equipment and gear removed by early Aug. 9, Cruz said. The downtown event is different from LEAF's main festival, which happens at Lake Eden outside Black Mountain. LEAF, a nonprofit focused on arts and cultural enrichment, would have to pay subcontractors to work overtime overnight, including the staging company, tent suppliers and an environmental green team, Cruz said. That would cost $6,000-$10,000 and isn't possible considering the limited revenue the festival brings in, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State regulators on Wednesday unanimously approved expanded capacity for the Dakota Access pipeline, saying they believed the project had met exhaustive state and federal requirements. The 3-0 vote by the all-Republican Public Service Commission came after the body signaled last month that it was likely to approve a permit to expand the capacity of the pipeline, despite objections from opponents who said it would increase the probability of a disastrous oil spill. Commissioners said they expect their decision to be challenged in state court. Commissioner Julie Fedorchak said she welcomed such a review. Texas-based Energy Transfer proposed doubling the capacity of the pipeline last year to meet growing demand for oil shipments from North Dakota, without the need for additional pipelines or rail shipments. Commissioner Brian Kroshus said Wednesday that he believes the project would help take oil trucks off the road, reducing traffic fatalities.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine on Thursday presented the state's highest non-combat decoration for service to a retired fighter pilot and astronaut. Col. Guion Bluford of Westlake in suburban Cleveland flew 144 combat missions in South Vietnam with the U.S. Air Force and later earned a doctorate in aerospace engineering at the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. In 1983, Bluford became the first black astronaut to fly in space on a shuttle mission. DeWine presented the 77-year-old Bluford with the Ohio Distinguished Service Medal at a Statehouse ceremony. Bluford, who was honored on the 58th anniversary of fellow Ohioan John Glenn becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, attributed his success to chasing his dreams and advised others to do the same by figuring out what gets you excited.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state House committee overwhelmingly rejected a bill Thursday to repeal a new law that allows most adults to carry firearms without a background check or training. Despite the 11-1 vote against his bill by the House Public Safety Committee, Rep. Jason Lowe, an Oklahoma City Democrat, vowed to continue fighting the law with a signature-gathering effort to put a question on the ballot to repeal it. I believe this law is absolutely dangerous, Lowe said. It's a ticking time bomb, and it's been an absolute disaster. Dubbed permitless carry by its opponents, the new law allows most adults to carry firearms, concealed or openly, without a license. It was the first measure signed into law by Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt and took effect in November. Oklahoma's Republican-led Legislature has embraced numerous bills that expand gun rights in the state. The committee on Thursday approved a bill to expand the state's Stand Your Ground law. Last week, the Senate approved a bill that would allow more public school teachers to carry firearms in their classrooms.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Department of Land Conservation and Development says a proposed liquefied natural gas export terminal in Coos Bay would have significant adverse effects on the state's coastal scenic and aesthetic resources, endangered species and critical habitat. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that in a letter Wednesday to backers of the Jordan Cove Energy Project, agency director Jim Rue said that neither the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission nor the Army Corps of Engineers can grant a license or permit for this project unless the U.S. Secretary of Commerce overrides this objection on appeal. The decision on one of the key state permits for the project is a rebuke that comes just before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to issue a final environmental analysis on the project, approving or denying its primary federal license.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As many of the state's counties adopt new hand-marked ballot voting systems, a persistent criticism is a perceived loss of privacy in polling places when filling them out and scanning them. The criticism, raised again Wednesday by state lawmakers, has emerged repeatedly ahead of the presidential elections, after a two-year push by Gov. Tom Wolf to get counties to switch to paper-based voting systems as an election security bulwark against hacking. Some lawmakers say they have heard from unhappy voters accustomed to electronic touchscreen voting machines that, in the past, had been screened off or arranged to allow voters to make selections unseen. Now, other voters or poll workers may be able to see how someone voted while they are filling out their ballot or while they feed their ballot into an electronic scanner that reads it. I think we're disenfranchising so many voters who don't like the new system, Rep. Doyle Heffley, R-Carbon, told top state election officials at an Appropriations Committee hearing Wednesday. It's not a secret ballot. Other people can see how they vote.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The University of Rhode Island is using a $1 million federal grant to offer education and training about opioids to residents in rural areas of the state. Officials with the university in South Kingstown say health professionals and students have been preparing to start the outreach campaign. Funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will be used to send students and staff to farmers markets, fairs, festivals and other events to discuss issues related to opioids, hand out information about how to obtain overdose-reversal medication and offer related health counseling. Deborah Sheely, of URI's Cooperative Extension, says the goal is to remove the stigma associated with opioid misuse and ensure that residents in rural areas have the information and technical assistance they need.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The Columbia Housing Authority was fined just under $11,000 after pleading guilty Wednesday to 24 safety violations found after two residents died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a poorly maintained heater. One code violation was dropped as city officials appeared in court, and they asked for a jury trial on one other violation, WLTX-TV reports. The violations included broken smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors and fire extinguishers, as well as failing to do routine maintenance. Calvin Witherspoon Jr., 62, and Derrick Roper, 31, died in separate units in the same building in January 2019 at Allen Benedict Court in Columbia. Investigators immediately inspected all 244 of the units at the 80-year-old complex and found hundreds of problems missed as employees in the Housing Authority's maintenance department either retired or left and weren't replaced, authorities said. Prosecutors said they could not file criminal charges because South Carolina lacks a criminal negligence law.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Legislation to prevent the spread of zebra mussels is headed for the state Senate after it received unanimous approval from the Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee on Tuesday. The bill, which has already passed the House, requires people to decontaminate their boats by cleaning and draining them after leaving the water. It also creates inspection stations. Senators were told the invasive species has now been found in four South Dakota lakes. Zebra mussels can cause a foul taste and smell in drinking water, increase algae and alter aquatic food chains. The widespread invasive species wasn't found in South Dakota until 2016, when the zebra mussels were discovered in Lewis and Clark Lake and McCook Lake. It was found to have spread to Sharpe and Francis Case lakes last year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A state panel won't vote on whether to remove or add context to a bust of a Confederate general and early Ku Klux Klan leader in the Capitol until a board vacancy is filled, the board's chairman said at a meeting Thursday. Finance Commissioner and Capitol Commission Chairman Stuart McWhorter said he's unsure when Gov. Bill Lee will replace Tyreece Miller, who recently left the commission as the nominee for U.S. marshal in western Tennessee. McWhorter said he doesn't want to act on Nathan Bedford Forrest's bust before Miller is replaced. The Tennessee Heritage Protection Act also requires the state Historical Commission's approval to remove the bust. Forrest amassed a fortune before the Civil War as a plantation owner and slave trader in Memphis. After the war, he was a leader of the Klan, which terrorized black people as it sought to reverse Reconstruction efforts and restore white supremacy.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The state will close two of its more than 100 state prisons amid a years­long decline in the incarcerated population and serious understaffing at some facilities, officials said Thursday. The closures of a prison in South Texas and another in suburban Houston will result in annual savings of about $20 million, according to the office of state Sen. John Whitmire, who heads the Senate Criminal Justice Committee. The Garza East Transfer Facility in Beeville, 100 miles southeast of San Antonio, is set to close in May, but a date has not been set for the closure of the Jester I Unit in Sugar Land, according to Whitmire's chief of staff, Lara Wendler. She said both prisons were at more than 90% population capacity as of Thursday, and those inmates will be transferred to other prisons.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Brigham Young University has revised its strict code of conduct to strip a rule that banned any behavior that reflected homosexual feelings, which LGBTQ students and their allies felt created an unfair double standard not imposed on heterosexual couples. The university is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which teaches its members that being gay isn't a sin, but engaging in same-sex intimacy is. BYU's revisions to what the college calls its honor code don't change the faith's opposition to same-sex relationships or gay marriage. The changes were discovered by media outlets Wednesday. BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins said in an email that the updated version of the code aligns with a new handbook of rules unveiled by the faith, widely known as the Mormon church.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A panel formed to review community policing practices in the city has recommended changes to the police department's use-of-force policy, with a focus on de-escalating potential physical confrontations. The 15-member committee, which released its report this month, also advises improving civilian oversight of police, Vermont Public Radio reports. The City Council formed the panel in June following several interactions in which officers allegedly used excessive force. The council told the committee to focus on the police department's use-of-force policy and the police commission. Committee Chair Randall Harp told the council Tuesday that the panel advises making de-escalation a priority in the use-of-force policy. And emphasize that officer behavior can escalate the level of force required, and it sanctions officers that do so, he said.\n\nVirginia\n\nMount Vernon: George Washington's Mount Vernon estate says it will no longer sell a souvenir depicting the founding father's false teeth amid criticism that Washington's dentures were made with teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves. Critics said selling a souvenir magnet depicting Washington's famous false teeth trivialized the fact that Washington's slaves had to give up their own teeth. On Wednesday, Mount Vernon said on Twitter that it would remove the magnet from its online store. The webpage on which the magnet had been offered for sale was disabled as of Wednesday afternoon. The old story that Washington's dentures were made of wood has long been known to be false. It has been known for years that Washington paid about six pounds for nine teeth that were pulled from slaves' mouths. The payment is recorded in a 1784 ledger. The fact has received renewed attention following publication of a revisionist biography.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Bills that would have limited how many rounds can be stored in gun magazines and what guns can be sold failed to make their way through the Legislature. KING-TV reports neither bill was approved before Wednesday's 5 p.m. deadline. Lawmakers knew earlier this month that the proposed ban on firearms defined as assault weapons did not have the votes to proceed. The high-capacity limit bill passed out of House and Senate committees but never came up on the floor for debate. Republicans opposed to the bill filed an unusually high number of amendments on the bill, meaning debate could last a day or more, according to Democratic staffers. Aberdeen Republican Rep. Jim Walsh, who submitted six amendments, was asked if the long list of amendments was a political ploy to prevent debate. That's part of it, said Walsh. But it's also a very bad policy.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Foster parents may soon get more money for adopting children under a measure passed by the House of Delegates this week aimed at alleviating the state's overburdened foster care system. Delegates voted 96-1 to approve the bill, with Republican Del. Pat McGeehan as the lone no vote after he was told the measure would cost the state about $17 million. Great emphasis has been placed on the projected cost of this bill, but we must acknowledge that this is an investment, an investment in West Virginia children, said Del. Jason Barrett, a Berkeley County Democrat. The proposal, sent to the Senate, would give families at least $900 a month for each child adopted. Child placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption. The bill also establishes a foster care bill of rights, which would ensure children and parents understand their rights in the state's foster system.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A group monitoring a legal settlement over the Milwaukee Police Department's stop-and-frisk practices reports officers failed to document a justification in 80% of such incidents in the first half of 2019. The Crime and Justice Institute found many of the officers' report narratives lacked the details necessary to establish reasonable suspicion that the people being frisked were armed or dangerous to others around them. The Boston-based institute is monitoring the police department's compliance as part of a $3.4 million settlement with the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin in 2018 over stop-and-frisk practices. The ACLU had argued in its lawsuit that over the past decade, tens of thousands of minority residents in Milwaukee have been stopped by police without reasonable suspicion of a crime.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Environmental groups are suing over plans for a potentially huge gas field they say would endanger antelope in Grand Teton National Park by hindering a migration route between the park and a basin. The Upper Green River Alliance, Western Watersheds Project and the Center for Biological Diversity sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne on Wednesday. The groups say the agency insufficiently took into account a 170-mile pronghorn antelope migration corridor between Grand Teton and the Upper Green River Basin before approving a plan to develop the Normally Pressured Lance gas field in the basin in 2018. The Jonah Energy project would potentially add 350 gas wells a year to the gas field over a decade. With 3,500 wells, the Normally Pressured Lance field could become one of the biggest onshore gas fields in the U.S.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Tim Henderson\n\nPew/Stateline Staff Writer\n\nJason and Rebecca Petersen's lives are in flux, just as they are for many young families. They like life as renters in the urban neighborhood in Denver called LoHi, where apartments are steadily replacing single-family houses, and crowds of millennials flock to trendy shops and restaurants.\n\nBut will they buy a house in the suburbs as their son, 3-year-old Lucas, nears school age? It's a possibility, if jobs lead them there, or they go in search of better schools. But they would miss the lively neighborhood and its short walk downtown, through a scenic park where Lucas loves to ride his bicycle.\n\nWe'd like to stay here. It's just more vibrant, said Jason, 30, a stay-at-home dad who develops software while wife Rebecca finishes her medical residency.\n\nThe Petersens, like other millennials — who were born after 1980, have a taste for city life, and are willing to move in search of work — have helped fuel a boom in apartment construction unlike anything in recent decades. They tend to have careers that were delayed by the recession, and to lack the job security or savings to settle down and buy a home.\n\nConstruction started on 386,000 new apartments last year, according to census data, the highest number since 1987. Apartments, defined as housing units in buildings with five or more units, made up 35 percent of all home construction last year, the highest share since 1973.\n\nForty-seven states saw construction shift from houses toward apartments, as measured by approval of permits, between 2005 and 2014, the most recent complete year of census data. The shift was especially dramatic in western states such as Colorado, where multifamily units made up 38 percent of new construction permits in 2014, up from just 10 percent in 2005.\n\nOther states where the share rose more than 25 percentage points were California, Oregon, Arizona, New Jersey, Washington, North Dakota and Nebraska. The only states to buck the trend were Wyoming and Rhode Island, where apartment-construction permits dropped by more than half since 2005.\n\nWhen Is the Turning Point?\n\nDebate rages over whether a turning point has been reached as millennials begin to enter their late 20s and early 30s. Will they stay in the urban spots they've come to love or will many move to the suburbs to have children, just as their boomer parents did, for more space, better schools and less crime?\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders predicts little growth in multifamily construction this year, with renewed emphasis on single-family homes, said economist Robert Dietz.\n\nBut Jonathan Spader, a research associate at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, said the need for new urban apartments is likely to continue. The center released a study of rental housing in December.\n\nRents are rising and vacancy rates for apartments are near 30-year lows, Spader said, and if some older millennials are buying houses, younger ones are still waiting for a chance to move out on their own.\n\nThe annual share of first-time homebuyers is at its lowest ebb in three decades, according to a National Association of Realtors report, and a new 3-percent-down program had little effect in 2015. Buyers have been discouraged by higher home prices and mortgage rates, and rising rents are making it harder for them to save, the report said.\n\nThose things together suggest a bull market at the national level, for apartments, Spader said. Growth in demand is rising and new multifamily construction, at least in the short term, is here to stay.\n\nThe Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) also predicts continued growth in apartments this year, saying the key drivers of the boom are still in place: rising incomes and more young people setting out on their own.\n\nSome of the cities where construction increased the most in 2015 — Dallas, Nashville and Salt Lake City — still have low vacancy rates, the report said. An exception is the District of Columbia, where construction has slowed and vacancy rates are likely to rise.\n\nRents are projected to rise fastest in San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Seattle and Denver, and to increase moderately in the District of Columbia and Minneapolis, according to the forecast. Most renters still see buying a house as unaffordable, according to a survey this month by Freddie Mac.\n\nWhile millennials are the most important factor in demand for new apartments, according to a Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) report this month, a significant number of their boomer parents are also renting, especially in large buildings.\n\nBaltimore apartment developer Tom Bozzuto wrote last year about the experience of renting an apartment for the first time in 42 years, in the District. Boomers like him want the same urban amenities as millennials, he said.\n\nThis is not a generation looking to rest in their retirement, he wrote. This is the generation that invented rock 'n' roll. ... They will want to continue to party until the very end.\n\nChris Porter, chief demographer for John Burns Real Estate Consulting, in California, said boomers still prefer buying to renting, but their sheer numbers are so large that even a small share of renters will have an effect on apartment construction.\n\nThe last 10 years have seen an increase of almost 5 million people in the 20-29 age group, the most likely to want urban rentals. The number of empty-nesters, ages 55-64, has gone up by more than 10 million.\n\nGiven their relative affluence, empty-nesters would be more aligned with the increase in luxury rental living, Porter said. I don't think we're going to see a massive shift in their homeownership habits. But given their size, we are likely to see a higher number of older renters.\n\nCities, Suburbs Seek Families\n\nCities may find themselves trying to compete with suburbs to hold on to residents as millennials age, Spader said, by improving services like parks and schools that make life more amenable to young parents.\n\nFor instance, Growing up Boulder focuses on getting children's input for designing neighborhood amenities like parks and downtown public areas, using UNICEF guidelines for child-friendly cities. It's a partnership between the city, the local school district and the University of Colorado.\n\nAnother concept gaining traction is the adventure playground, meant as an antidote to the extreme parental supervision most children experience in big cities. The playgrounds spend more money on employees to watch children than on fancy-looking amenities, and encourage children to decide by themselves how to play.\n\nIf you're a kid in the city, your parents want to watch you all the time. What you need is more unstructured play. You don't get to do a thing like draw on the wall or build a fort, said Reilly Bergin Wilson, a director at Playground NYC, an adventure playground set to open on Governor's Island in New York City. New playgrounds have already opened in places such asMercer Island, Washington; and Berkeley and Irvine, California.\n\nNot everyone sees raising children as a barrier to staying in dense, inner-city neighborhoods. Sarah Lenti, a political consultant, moved to Denver when she wanted to have children, in her late 30s, knowing the cost of living would be more manageable than in the District of Columbia, where she'd been living three years earlier.\n\nNow the mother of twin baby boys, Lenti doesn't see herself moving away. She did buy a car for the first time when the babies were born, because it's illegal here to take them in a cab or car service without a car seat.\n\nWe would be really isolated out there in the suburbs, Lenti said. For a modern family, urban living is the way to go. Everything we need is right here.\n\nPorter, the demographer, said more millennials may choose a more suburban life and a single-family home, but it's hard to say when. Many millennials found their early career plans postponed by the recession, making it hard to move up to homeownership.\n\nThe delays in life events — marriage, children — for the younger population have allowed them to live in more urban-type environments longer, Porter said. But, as they do get married and have children, I believe they will start migrating to more suburban areas, with schools and affordability among the many factors in that decision. It will just be at a later age than their parents or grandparents.\n\nOwnership: Good for Society\n\nDenver's urban neighborhoods like LoHi — short for Lower Highland — have seen an influx of young people and scrapes, or single-family homes and duplexes torn down to make room for rental apartments, in recent years, said Colorado state demographer Elizabeth Garner.\n\nGarner doesn't see the trend stopping any time soon, because the influx caught the construction industry flat-footed after the housing bust in 2007. Some people might consider it a boom. I consider it making up lost ground, Garner said.\n\nBut it may be time to build more single-family units, she said. Ownership is good for society because there's more investment. People feel more invested in the community and more invested in the schools.\n\nStateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.
Walt Heyer\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nI started my transgender journey as a 4-year-old boy when my grandmother repeatedly, over several years, cross-dressed me in a full-length purple dress she made especially for me and told me how pretty I was as a girl. This planted the seed of gender confusion and led to my transitioning at age 42 to transgender female.\n\nI lived as Laura for eight years, but, as I now know, transitioning doesn't fix the underlying ailments.\n\nStudies show that most people who want to live as the opposite sex have other psychological issues, such as depression or anxiety. In my case, I was diagnosed at age 40 with gender dysphoria and at age 50 with psychological issues due to childhood trauma.\n\nEventually, my parents found out, and my unsupervised visits to Grandma's house ended. I thought my secret was safe, but my teenage uncle heard about it and felt I was fair game for taunting and sexual abuse. I wasn't even 10 years old. If not for the purple dress, I believe I would not have been abused by my uncle.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTrump's anti-transgender memo would hurt teens like me. I'm hoping my state protects me.\n\nMy high school's transgender bathroom policies violate the privacy of the rest of us\n\nHigh school could have been hell for my transgender son. Don't make it hell for the next kid.\n\nThat abuse caused me to not want to be male any longer. Cross-dressing gave me an escape. I lay awake at night, secretly begging God to change me into a girl. In my childlike thinking, if I could only be a girl, then I would be accepted and affirmed by the adults in my life. I would be safe.\n\nMaking the decision to transition\n\nGender dysphoria is about identity, not sexual orientation. I was never homosexual; I was interested in dating girls. In my early 20s and engaged to be married, I confided to my fiancée about my cross-dressing. She figured we could work it out. We got married and had two children.\n\nIn my work life I was successful, but the girl persona still occupied my thoughts. With weekly travel away from home, I easily indulged in cross-dressing, fueling the desire to be a woman.\n\nBy the time I was 40, I couldn't take the pressure of living two separate lives. I felt torn apart, wanting to be a good husband and father, but in severe torment about needing to be a woman.\n\nI sought out the top gender specialist at the time, Dr. Paul Walker, who had co-authored the 1979 standards of care for transgender health. He diagnosed me with gender identity disorder (now gender dysphoria) and recommended cross-sex hormones and sex change genital surgery. He told me that the childhood events were not related to my current gender distress, and that sex change was the only solution. I started taking female hormones and scheduled the surgery for April 1983 in Trinidad, Colorado. I was 42.\n\nMy marriage ended shortly before surgery. In addition to genital reconfiguration, I had breast implants and other feminizing procedures and changed my birth certificate to Laura Jensen, female. My childhood dream was realized, and my life as a woman began.\n\nA fresh start, then a harder fall\n\nAt first, I was giddy with excitement. It seemed like a fresh start. I could sever ties with my former life as Walt and my painful past. But reality soon hit. My children and former wife were devastated. When I told my employer, my career was over.\n\nAs Laura, I decided to pursue being a counselor and started courses at the University of California-Santa Cruz in the late 1980s. There, a crack in my carefully crafted female persona opened, and I began to question my transition.\n\n\n\nThe reprieve I experienced through surgery was only temporary. Hidden underneath the makeup and female clothing was the little boy hurt by childhood trauma. I was once again experiencing gender dysphoria, but this time I felt like a male inside a body refashioned to look like a woman. I was living my dream, but still I was deeply suicidal.\n\nA gender specialist told me to give it more time. Eight years seemed like an awfully long time to me. Nothing made sense. Why hadn't the recommended hormones and surgery worked? Why was I still distressed about my gender identity? Why wasn't I happy being Laura? Why did I have strong desires to be Walt again?\n\nEmotionally, I was a mess. But with grit and determination, and the love and support of several families and counselors, I pursued healing on a psychological level. With expert guidance, I dared to revisit the emotional trauma of my youth. It wasn't easy, but it was the only way to address the underlying conditions driving my gender dysphoria.\n\nI was 50 when I had the breast implants removed, but the next few years were spent in confusion and counseling. In 1996, at the age of 55, I was finally free from the desire to live as a woman and changed my legal documents back to Walt, my biologically correct male sex. I still have scars on my chest, reminders of the gender detour that cost me 13 years of my life. I am on a hormone regimen to try to regulate a system that is permanently altered.\n\nRegret is real\n\nEventually, I met a wonderful woman who didn't care about the changes to my body, and we've been married for 21 years. Now we help others whose lives have been derailed by sex change. Measured by the human benefit to a hurting population, it's a priceless way to spend our time.\n\nHad I not been misled by media stories of sex change success and by medical practitioners who said transitioning was the answer to my problems, I wouldn't have suffered as I have. Genetics can't be changed. Feelings, however, can and do change. Underlying issues often drive the desire to escape one's life into another, and they need to be addressed before taking the radical step of transition.\n\nYou will hear the media say, Regret is rare. But they are not reading my inbox, which is full of messages from transgender individuals who want the life and body back that was taken from them by cross-sex hormones, surgery and living under a new identity.\n\nAfter de-transitioning, I know the truth: Hormones and surgery may alter appearances, but nothing changes the immutable fact of your sex.\n\n\n\nWalt Heyer is a former transgender woman who provides support to others who regret gender change at SexChangeRegret.com. He is the author of Trans Life Survivors.
President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden are grinning on the cover of People magazine in their first post-inauguration joint interview.\n\nAfter more than four decades of marriage, the couple look as gooey as newlyweds in the photos, released Wednesday with an accompanying Q&A and video interview.\n\nFrom the Blue Room of the White House, the Bidens detailed their feelings on their marriage and adjusting to living in the White House, a little over one week after the president was sworn in on Jan. 20.\n\nIn the interview, on newsstands nationwide on Friday, the president thinks he could not do his job as well without the first lady, revealing she tapes inspiring messages to him in his shaving mirror.\n\nShe's the glue that held (my family) together, and I knew that I wanted to marry her shortly after I met her, the president said. It's not that we don't fight and argue sometimes. I'm just lucky.\n\nWell, after 43 years of marriage there's really not that much more to fight about, the first lady said, laughing.\n\nOn the secret to their long-lasting marriage, the president, 78, said his wife has a backbone like a ramrod.\n\nHe continued: Everybody says marriage is 50/50. Well, sometimes you have to be 70/30. Thank God that when I'm really down, she steps in, and when she's really down, I'm able to step in.\n\nAll that we've been through together — the highs, the lows and certainly tragedy and loss — there's that quote that says sometimes you become stronger in the fractured places. That's what we try to achieve, Jill Biden, 69, said.\n\nAlong with her first lady duties, Jill Biden is returning to teaching writing at Northern Virginia Community College, by Zoom for now. Known as Dr. B to her students, including during the eight years she was second lady, she says teaching remains her passion.\n\nIt's been busy, she said. And so we have a lot to do — but we have a lot ahead of us and we feel good about it. We feel like people have hope that we're moving the country forward.\n\nHe's inspired by her energy but knows it's a lot of work.\n\nI'm glad she kept her profession, he said. It's important that she has the things that she cares a great deal about, her independence. And yet we share each other's dreams.\n\nThe president said living in the White House is surreal … but it's comfortable, noting that the upstairs residence is new to them.\n\nThe residence staff has been so great, trying to make it feel like home for us, the first lady said. We have family pictures all around, our books, some furniture we brought from home.\n\nThe only potentially touchy question focused on the new ethics rules for administration appointees the president signed. Are they guardrails for family and friends, too? The Bidens' son, Hunter, has denied accusations of improper business dealings.\n\nWe're going to run this like the Obama-Biden administration, the president said. No one in our family and extended family is going to be involved in any government undertaking or foreign policy. And nobody has an office in this place.\n\nA more light-hearted similarity to the Obama-Biden administration: Former first lady Michelle Obama's White House kitchen garden is still producing, even in mid-winter.\n\nThe garden is going strong! Jill Biden said. Her close friend Obama confirmed that with an Instagram post showing a vegetable basket from the Bidens.\n\nThe magazine also asked about his faith. The president says he doesn't want to proselytize (he's only the second Roman Catholic president ever) but his religion is his safe place and prayer gives me hope, centers me.\n\nHis wife, he says, has an unusual way of focusing his attention.\n\nJill, when she wants me to get a real message, she tapes it on the mirror above the sink where I shave, she said. And she put up a great quote from Kierkegaard saying, 'Faith sees best in the dark.' 
In one of Tiger Woods' crowning career moments – winning his 15th major at the 2019 Masters – the legendary golfer talked about how having his two children see him win made his victory special.\n\nWoods' family life has been chronicled throughout his career, and now has been renewed after he was injured in a single-car, rollover accident in Southern California on Tuesday, sustaining injuries to his right leg.\n\nAfter first responders freed the 45-year-old from the mangled vehicle, Woods underwent emergency surgery to repair significant damage and insert a rod in his right leg, his team released in a statement posted on his Twitter account late Tuesday night.\n\nWoods had two children with ex-wife Elin Nordegren, a Swedish former model. Woods and Nordegren divorced in 2010 after nearly six years of marriage. He started dating Erica Herman, a restaurant manager, in 2017.\n\nHerman frequently travels with Woods to golf events and was by his side, along with his children, at the 2019 Masters. In 2020, Woods, Herman and his children posted a photo together when the 2020 Masters champions dinner would have been.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED:How first responders found and freed a 'trapped,' injured Tiger Woods\n\nMAP OF CRASH SITE:Updates and location of accident\n\nWoods' oldest child is daughter Sam Alexis Woods, who was born in 2007 and is 13 years old now. Woods' youngest is son Charlie Axel Woods, who was born in 2009 and is 12 now.\n\nOn his social media channels, Woods has posted photos of Sam attending professional soccer matches and meeting stars of the U.S. women's national team. Charlie Woods has taken up golf and won a junior golf tournament in 2020 by five strokes. In that tournament, Woods caddied for his son. They even competed together in the PNC Championship in December.\n\nBefore Charlie played with Tiger in December, both children had largely stayed out of the public spotlight. But they have been seen with Woods at various moments of his career, including in 2019 when former President Donald Trump awarded Woods with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Woods' mother Kultida Tida Woods, was also present that day.\n\nWoods' father, Earl, died in 2006. Woods has two half-brothers, Earl Jr. and Kevin, and a half-sister, Royce, from his father's first marriage.\n\nIn a 2007 news conference for the AT&T National, Woods explained his daughter Sam's name and how it tied to his late father: We wanted to have a name that would be meaningful to either side of the family, my side or Elin's side, because she was born (the day after) Father's Day. It just happened to fit. My father had always called me Sam since the day I was born. He rarely ever called me Tiger. I would ask him, 'Why don't you ever call me Tiger?' He says,'Well, you look more like a Sam.\n\nWoods also has a niece, Cheyenne Woods, who played for the Wake Forest University golf team and turned professional in 2012 when she made her pro debut in the LPGA Championship.
Auburn paid Gus Malzahn $21.45 million to pack up his stuff and never coach the Tigers again. Tennessee owes Central Florida $6 million in combined buyouts for new athletics director Danny White and coach Josh Heupel.\n\nAvailability and increased financial flexibility on both sides allowed UCF and Malzahn to connect on a five-year deal worth $2.3 million annually. It's a bargain-basement deal relative to Malzahn's ample SEC experience and the program's goals of reaching the College Football Playoff and aligning itself for the next round of conference expansion.\n\nOn paper, Malzahn and UCF are the dream marriage of the 2020-21 coaching cycle, which was expected to barely make a whisper amid the COVID-19 pandemic but still yielded 15 changes, down from 24 moves a year ago.\n\nThat says something about Malzahn and UCF — though you can find flaws in the new pairing if you look close enough — and about the uninspiring series of coaching hires, which featured a handful of big names but largely involved Group of Five and second-level Power Five programs.\n\nThe hires can't be fully judged until three or four years down the road. For now, let's rank the new names by best fit and the best chance for immediate and long-term success.\n\n1. Gus Malzahn, UCF\n\nMalzahn will inherit one of the top teams in the Group of Five, including one of the nation's best quarterbacks in Dillon Gabriel, and for the first time in his coaching career have the luxury of holding a talent advantage against nearly every opponent. First off, he'll have to show how his hurry-up offense can be tailored to fit Gabriel. But to reel in a coach who won 66% of his games at Auburn (2012-20), beat Alabama three times and played for a national championship is an enormous victory for UCF.\n\n2. Bryan Harsin, Auburn\n\nHarsin had options over the years but waited patiently for the right opportunity, following the trajectory of a career that has always taken a calculated approach to the next move. His program at Boise State (2014-20), where he won 78% of his games but never fully escaped Chris Petersen's shadow, developed the most important positions on the field: quarterbacks, offensive tackles and edge rushers. As long as the standard for success isn't unseating Nick Saban and Alabama from atop the SEC, Harsin is a very good fit.\n\n3. Steve Sarkisian, Texas\n\nThe latest coach to refurbish his reputation with the Crimson Tide, Sarkisian takes over a program fresh off three consecutive top-ranked recruiting classes but in need of a new voice and an established identity on offense. Sarkisian will immediately deliver the latter and make the Longhorns a popular destination for regional and national recruits.\n\n4. Andy Avalos, Boise State\n\nA former Boise State linebacker and defensive coordinator, Avalos is more than ready for a return to his alma mater after spending the last two seasons under Mario Cristobal at Oregon. While former Boise quarterback Kellen Moore was the popular choice to replace Harsin before deciding to stay in the NFL, Avalos is a rising star in the profession and the next possible long-term fit for the Broncos.\n\n5. Butch Jones, Arkansas State\n\nJones is back in more comfortable surroundings at Arkansas State, one of the most consistently successful programs in the Group of Five. Before being hammered on his way out of the SEC at Tennessee and learning new tricks in his three years as an off-field assistant at Alabama, Jones won 50 games in six seasons at Central Michigan (2007-09) and Cincinnati (2010-12).\n\n6. Clark Lea, Vanderbilt\n\nLea made his national reputation by putting together three top-15 defenses in a row as the coordinator at Notre Dame. The question of how serving as an assistant at Notre Dame prepares you for running the show with the Commodores — a genuinely important question to ask — is tempered by Lea's time as a Vanderbilt linebacker (2002-04), giving him a taste of how the program has operated in the past and what can be done to bring the team back into SEC contention.\n\n7. Charles Huff, Marshall\n\nHuff brings an outstanding résumé as an assistant — led by recent stints at Penn State, Mississippi State and Alabama — to a program with expectations of always being in the driver's seat for the Conference USA championship. Learning under Saban and James Franklin (Penn State) gives Huff an edge over most first-time Group of Five head coaches.\n\n8. Bret Bielema, Illinois\n\nBielema has a history of success in the Big Ten that bodes well for Illinois. But with a substantial project ahead as the Illini aim for the top half of the West division, Bielema must show he has the energy to recruit and develop talent after the collapse of his tenure at Arkansas (2013-17).\n\n9. Blake Anderson, Utah State\n\nAnderson gets a fresh start after seven strong seasons at Arkansas State (2014-20), where his teams won or shared three Sun Belt championships. Much like Harsin, his predecessor with the Red Wolves, Anderson develops skill talent and has an established blueprint for success in the Group of Five ranks.\n\n10. Josh Heupel, Tennessee\n\nHeupel accepts the toughest job of any new hire: taking the mess that is Tennessee and slowly bringing the Volunteers back into the mix for the division championship and New Year's Six bowls. That's a multiple-year process, if it happens at all. If not the name most UT fans were expecting, Heupel will update an underwhelming offense and make Knoxville an appealing destination for skill talent.\n\n11. Shane Beamer, South Carolina\n\nBeamer has worked for Steve Spurrier at South Carolina (2007-10); for his father, Frank, at Virginia Tech (2011-15); for Kirby Smart at Georgia (2016); and most recently for Lincoln Riley at Oklahoma (2017-20), helping the Sooners to three playoff berths. The résumé speaks for itself. But there are unanswered questions about how Beamer and his staff will fare in a crowded recruiting scene and what the offense will look like in 2021 and beyond.\n\n12. Will Hall, Southern Mississippi\n\nSpeaking of offenses: Hall's up-tempo philosophy has been a success on almost every level of NCAA competition, from his time as a Division II head coach at West Alabama (2011-13) and West Georgia (2014-16) through his stints as an assistant at Louisiana-Lafayette (2017), Memphis (2018) and Tulane (2019-20).\n\n13. Kane Wommack, South Alabama\n\nWommack's age — at just 33, he's the youngest coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision — is not the concern it would've been made out to be a decade ago, when few schools had the nerve to hand over the keys to a coach little more than a decade removed from his own college experience. He's also coached at South Alabama (2016-17) and was recently the defensive coordinator for Indiana's breakthrough 2020 season. In all, Wommack represents a slight gamble for a program in need of a rebuild and an example of a Group of Five team buying low on a young coach viewed as one of the up-and-coming defensive minds in the sport.\n\n14. Jedd Fisch, Arizona\n\nArizona is banking on a coaching vagabond with one year of Pac-12 experience (UCLA in 2017) having the chops needed to bring the Wildcats out of the conference basement and into the mix for bowl bids, let alone a division title. Fisch has hired well, including the addition of former Michigan assistant Don Brown as his defensive coordinator, but does not seem to match the qualities Arizona initially laid out as prerequisites for its next coach.\n\n15. Terry Bowden, Louisiana-Monroe\n\nBowden's time at Akron (2012-18) should give him a taste of what's to come at ULM, which never led for a single second during the 2020 season. Is the 64-year-old former Auburn coach the right fit for a program that needs a complete reboot? In good news, you have to like Bowden's addition of former West Virginia coach Rich Rodriguez as offensive coordinator.\n\nFollow colleges reporter Paul Myerberg on Twitter @PaulMyerberg
This grand estate makes the perfect backdrop for a fairy tale\n\nThe stunning Biltmore, located in Asheville, N.C., is majestic all on its own and worth a visit at any time of year. The largest private residence in the U.S. offers house tours, an onsite winery and thousands of acres to ramble. Not to mention, there's enough history to keep you fascinated for years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we happened to notice that many of its characteristics bear a striking resemblance to a certain fairy tale. So we've highlighted 10 things about Biltmore that'll make you feel like you've left the real world and stepped into the magical land of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nThe village\n\nA post shared by Maggie Tyner (@m210t) on Feb 27, 2017 at 10:32am PST\n\nAntler Hill Village looks just like a quaint French town, similar to the one where Belle lives. Filled with restaurants, shops and an onsite winery, it's a home away from home while staying on the estate. There's even a fountain in the center.\n\nThe horses\n\nA post shared by Biltmore (@biltmoreestate) on Mar 28, 2016 at 9:01am PDT\n\nIf you choose, you can have plenty of interaction with the horses that call the estate home while visiting. From horseback riding to carriage rides, exploring the grounds in this way might make you feel like Belle riding through the forest.\n\nThe house\n\nA post shared by Biltmore (@biltmoreestate) on Jan 1, 2017 at 7:13pm PST\n\nThe Beast's castle was modeled after Chateau de Chambord in France and, coincidentally, so was the Biltmore (in addition to other French chateaus)! It's really easy to imagine yourself as Belle or Prince Adam when you stroll the stately corridors.\n\nThe grotesques\n\nA post shared by Biltmore (@biltmoreestate) on Oct 30, 2016 at 2:16pm PDT\n\nThe many grotesques and carvings that adorn the expansive house might remind you of the frightening gargoyles in the film. Don't worry, these are friendly.\n\nThe roses\n\nA post shared by Biltmore (@biltmoreestate) on Feb 8, 2017 at 5:18pm PST\n\nAlmost everywhere you look at The Inn on Biltmore, there's a glass vase with a single rose. These might not be charmed like the one in Beauty and the Beast, but they're just as mesmerizing.\n\nThe beasts\n\nA post shared by Biltmore (@biltmoreestate) on Sep 29, 2016 at 1:23pm PDT\n\nIn addition to the intricate grotesques, you'll find Italian rose marble lions guarding the home. These creatures are much friendlier than the Beast and have been welcoming guests since 1895.\n\nThe many places to get lost\n\nA post shared by Biltmore (@biltmoreestate) on Aug 19, 2016 at 5:06am PDT\n\nAcross the estate's 8,000 acres, there are plenty of nooks and crannies where you can get lost and even hide away. It's kind of like a giant West Wing, except it's outdoors and many places are open to guests.\n\nThe library\n\nA post shared by Biltmore (@biltmoreestate) on Feb 1, 2017 at 8:56am PST\n\nGeorge Vanderbilt's library is truly enchanting, from the perfectly organized shelves to the ceiling graced by the painting, The Chariot of Aurora. There's even a hidden door leading into a hallway. We think Belle would be quite happy here.\n\nThe magical views\n\nA post shared by Maggie Tyner (@m210t) on Feb 27, 2017 at 10:42am PST\n\nEvery time I see this view, I think of Belle clad in her fur-lined cape romping in the snow with the Beast. This terrace is just as beautiful during spring, summer and fall, if not more so.\n\nThe gardens\n\nA post shared by Biltmore (@biltmoreestate) on Nov 7, 2016 at 5:58pm PST\n\nSpeaking of gorgeous views, Biltmore boasts several gardens and a conservatory – often serving as the sites for marriage proposals. The award-winning rose garden might be your favorite.
ALBANY - From an Emmy award for his COVID-19 briefings to a spoof on Saturday Night Live.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo's star turn for his perceived frank and informative nationally broadcast COVID-19 briefings through the early months of the pandemic has taken a deep fall in recent weeks.\n\nThe state's admitted undercounting of nursing home deaths due to coronavirus and the ongoing scrutiny over a March 25 order to allow nursing home residents in hospitals to return home with COVID has put the Democratic governor in the most precarious position since he took office a decade ago.\n\nCuomo has had his share of scandals as governor.\n\nHe was accused of meddling in a corruption-busting commission that led to an investigation by then-U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who ultimately found no criminal wrongdoing. And his ex-top aide, Joseph Percoco, is in prison for kickbacks.\n\nBut now Cuomo is facing something deeper: the raw anger and deep anguish of New Yorkers after more than 13,000 nursing home residents died — a figure the state didn't reveal until a damning state Attorney General's report was released last month.\n\nAnd lawmakers, who relinquished power to Cuomo during the pandemic, are looking to rein in Cuomo's control, and some are even talking further action: an impeachment trial.\n\nPlus, there is a federal probe into Cuomo's handling of the nursing home situation.\n\nAnd per capita, only New Jersey has had more overall deaths than New York, where it has exceeded 40,000 since COVID hit the Northeast first nearly a year ago.\n\nThe tough-talking Cuomo has sought to beat back the criticism, but that too has come with pitfalls: It revived his image among distractors as a bully after he was accused of threatening Queens Assemblyman Ron Kim for his condemnation of the state's nursing home policies.\n\nAnd that was the image portrayed on Saturday Night Live last weekend as cast member Pete Davidson lampooned Cuomo for not apologizing for the COVID-19 miscount and quickly snapping at the mention of his foe, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nSome of the people who died in the nursing homes were not counted as nursing home deaths. They were counted as hospital deaths, Davidson said as Cuomo in the governor's patented thick New York accent. Or just basically what happens at Disney World, OK. People die, and they move the bodies. They say, 'Oh, I guess Brenda died in the parking lot, not on the tea cups.'\n\nThe audience roared.\n\nMore:NY assemblyman Ron Kim says Cuomo impeachment should be discussed over nursing home deaths\n\nCuomo in a third term\n\nThird terms are always tricky for governors, and Cuomo knows it all too well: His late father, Mario, won three terms, but was upended in 1994 by a little-known Hudson Valley Republican senator, George Pataki — who himself struggled in his third term and didn't run again.\n\nState Democratic Chairman Jay Jacobs said Cuomo, 63, facing backlash in a third term and after a year of navigating the most difficult year in modern history is not surprising.\n\nIn California, there's an effort to make Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom only the second governor in the state to be recalled after his handling of the pandemic.\n\nI think at the end of the day he gets through it pretty fine, Jacobs said Sunday of Cuomo. I think to some degree there was an inevitability in the governor running into difficulty as COVID began to run its course.\n\nHaving the kind of authority he has and the responsibility he has has a shelf life with elected officials.\n\nPolls have yet to show a dip for Cuomo, who is expected to seek a fourth term in 2022.\n\nA Siena College poll last week said voters approved of the job Cuomo was doing to address the coronavirus pandemic, 61% to 34%.\n\nYet voters were split on his handling of the vaccine rollout, which had a bumpy rollout, and 55% disapproved of how he didn't initially make public all data about COVID deaths of nursing home patients.\n\nVoters — especially Democrats — continue to give Cuomo strong marks for his overall handling of the pandemic, Steven Greenburg, the Siena College poll spokesman, said.\n\nBut Cuomo's national role as the counter to then-President Donald Trump widely panned handling of the pandemic is clearly over. Headlines are now all about Cuomo's fall from grace since the start of the pandemic.\n\nIn particular, last week's front pages in the New York Post blared, Inexcusable, Tailspin and even Corrupt.\n\nEven the friendly banter of Cuomo's appearances on his younger brother's primetime CNN news show seems over, for now.\n\nCNN said in a statement last week that it broke its policy of not having Andrew Cuomo on Chris Cuomo's Prime Time early in the pandemic due to the significant human interest.\n\nAs a result, we made an exception to a rule that we have had in place since 2013 which prevents Chris from interviewing and covering his brother, and that rule remains in place today, CNN said in a statement, according to The Washington Post.\n\nCNN has covered the news surrounding Governor Cuomo extensively.\n\nMore:And the Emmy goes to ... Andrew Cuomo? Governor gets award for COVID briefings\n\nMore:New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo accused of angrily threatening a vocal critic. He denies it.\n\nFacing backlash in the Legislature\n\nThe Legislature and Cuomo have had a love-hate relationship throughout his tenure, just as any governor and the separate branch of government might. He applauds them when he sees fit and coaxes them to score major victories, then knocks them when plans falter.\n\nHe cajoled members of the then Republican-controlled Senate to legalize same-sex marriage in 2011, then landed a $15 minimum wage, paid family leave, the Child Victims Act and a host of progressive measures with Democrats now in charge.\n\nBut with a growing group of younger, progressive lawmakers in Albany, their disdain for Cuomo's heavy-handed approach has increasingly grown.\n\nSo when the nursing-home scandal broke, a bevy of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were ready to pounce — publicly vetting their long-held contempt for Cuomo's ability to dominate state government policy.\n\n.⁦@NYGovCuomo has a terribly toxic leadership style that does NOT lead to good governance, Sen. Gustavo Rivera, D-Bronx, one of Cuomo's chief critics, wrote Sunday on Twitter.\n\nAt the least, they are now looking to strip him of those executive COVID powers, which expire in this spring. The Senate is poised to do so, but it is unclear whether the Assembly will as well.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are in the minority in the Legislature, but they are pushing their Democratic colleagues to get tough on Cuomo, vowing to hold them accountable when all 213 seats in the Legislature are on the ballot next year.\n\nIt had an impact.\n\nSen. Rachel May, D-Syracuse, expressed dismay on a call with Cuomo aides earlier this month at how the nursing home issue became an albatross for her during her re-election bid last year.\n\nIn a pandemic when you want the public to trust the public health officials and there is clear feeling that they're not being forthcoming with you, that is really hard, May said on the call, according to a transcript released by Cuomo's office.\n\nSo lawmakers are weighing both the drastic step of moving forward with impeachment, which seems like it would be difficult to win a majority to do so, or at least hosting hearings on the nursing home scandal.\n\nWhat is the truth? Who told what at what point, and what are we going to do about it? said Kim, who was on the receiving end of Cuomo's ire for his yearlong criticism of the nursing home situation. Because right now, we're not doing anything to check this executive office.\n\nForget the individuals. That is institutions. We are normalizing forever a system that no longer has a proper check and balance.\n\nMore:How Cuomo's COVID-19 nursing home scandal unraveled over the past year: Timeline, analysis\n\nMore:New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo accused of angrily threatening a vocal critic. He denies it.\n\nCuomo vows to fight back\n\nThe Queens-born governor has prided himself on being a blue-collar bruiser who battles lawmakers, the federal government, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio or anyone else who gets in the way of his policy initiatives that he believes are in the best interests of the state.\n\nI said to the people of the state of New York when I was first elected, I'm here to fight for you. That's my job, Cuomo said Friday.\n\nOne of the most succinct and memorable lines from his administration came early on his tenure, displaying their bare-knuckles politics.\n\nIn late 2011, then top aide Steven Cohen was reported telling former Connecticut Gov.

AP\n\nPONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — To see him now, it's hard to believe Jason Day had only one victory in his first six years on the PGA Tour.\n\nThen again, consider the start of the year.\n\nDay finished a combined 35 shots out of the lead in the three tournaments he finished. The other was Torrey Pines, where he was defending champion and missed the cut while coping with a nasty virus.\n\nSince then, he has gone wire-to-wire against strong fields twice in the last two months, and he effectively did the same at the Dell Match Play when only one of the seven matches he won reached the 18th hole. He has seven victories in his last 17 tournaments. He is No. 1 in the world with the highest points average since Tiger Woods.\n\nFor Day, it's all about the long haul.\n\nTo measure his career to date, he is different from Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth in one respect. Everyone knew McIlroy and Spieth had exceptional talent, and it didn't take long for them to get on the fast track. McIlroy locked up his European Tour card in two events, won in his second full season and was a U.S. Open champion at 22. Spieth had no status when he turned pro, won on the PGA Tour, was the youngest American to play in the Presidents Cup and had two majors at 21.\n\nDay had every bit as much talent.\n\nJason Day wins Players Championship by four shots\n\nHe turned heads when he came to America to play the Web.com Tour and won a tournament at 18. What followed were marriage, nagging injuries, his first child, finding a balance between home and golf and questions about why he wasn't winning more.\n\nThe answer was a hard look at who he was and motivated him.\n\nColin Swatton, his longtime coach and caddie, recalls a conversation they had early in his career.\n\nHe said, 'When do you think I'll win on tour?' And I said, 'You'll win when you want to win. You'll dominate when you want to dominate.' He never understood that, Swatton said Tuesday. And then at the British Open he was like, 'Gosh, I let another one slip through my fingers. Enough is enough. This is my time. This is when I want to make my mark in golf.'\n\nMotivation for any player has to come from within.\n\nDay looks back at that British Open last summer as a turning point in his career. He came up short on a 30-foot birdie putt to get into a playoff at St. Andrews, and he walked away more determined than ever to make it his time.\n\nThere was another moment this year at Doral that reminded the 28-year-old Australian what it took.\n\nSwatton prefers data over emotion because that's what gets through to Day, so he keeps files of information. One reason Day started off the year so slowly is because he stayed away from the game for three months, mainly because wife Ellie gave birth to their second child.\n\nDay was disappointed at Doral, where he tied for 23rd and was never in the picture.\n\nSwatton was realistic. He knew that Day couldn't expect to have the same form after sitting out three months. Hours lost meant more hours required to reformulate the swing and the feel. So he kept a log of the hours Day had put in and showed it to him after Doral.\n\nWhen he walks off and he's disappointed, you have to present him with facts. You can't present him with emotion, Swatton said. I said, 'The fact is, this is all the practice you've done.' He looked at it and said, 'Oh my goodness.' I said, 'Exactly.'\n\nHe just had to be patient.\n\nDay is diligent when it comes to work. He thought winning would come easier when he showed up on the PGA Tour in 2008. He doesn't want to make that mistake again. So he kept working. And he started winning. And here he is, No. 1 by a margin that suggests he might be there for some time.\n\nHe found what motivates him to work hard, Swatton said. And right now he's motivated to do something similar to Greg Norman, to Tiger Woods. I think he just loves winning. Walking down 18 on Sunday, people are yelling and screaming, and he said, 'This is why I work hard. This walk.'\n\nAfter win, Jason Day says Tiger has taken him under his wing\n\nIt's not about the $1.8 million or whatever, Swatton said. He just loves winning.\n\nIt doesn't come as easily as he can make it look.\n\nDay said he has been building to this moment, even during the lean years, finding something that will make him a little better each year.\n\nLook, I'm in it for the long haul, he said after his most recent victory. It's not like I'm here for five years and someone younger than me is going to be a half-step quicker or I'm going to be an old, slow man. At the end of my career, I want to be able to look back and know that I incrementally got better as the years went on. And if I can focus on that, then I will.\n\nAs long as I want it, and if I do the work, then I'll get better.
Jaleesa M. Jones\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAfter six years of marriage, David Schwimmer and Zoe Buckman are taking their space.\n\nThe People v. O. J. Simpson actor and British photographer first crossed paths in 2007 when Schwimmer was doing principal photography in London for his romantic comedy Run, Fatboy, Run, starring Simon Pegg and Thandie Newton. The two confirmed their engagement in March 2010, wedding in a private ceremony that summer.\n\nUs Weekly was the first to report on their break.\n\nThis is the first marriage for Schwimmer and Buckman, who share a five-year-old daughter, Cleo Buckman Schwimmer.\n\nIt is with great love, respect and friendship that we have decided to take some time apart while we determine the future of our relationship, the pair said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY. Our priority is, of course, our daughter's happiness and well being during this challenging time, and so we ask for your support and respect for our privacy as we continue to raise her together and navigate this new chapter for our family.
Hailey Bieber wants people to know marriage is very hard.\n\nThat is the sentence you should lead with, she suggests in a new Vogue article that provides an intimate look into their young union. It's really effing hard.\n\nThe model and TV personality and her husband, Justin Bieber, cover the magazine's March issue, as revealed Thursday. The duo, who wed in September after a whirlwind romance, reignited their love affair in June. They had a brief relationship three years ago, which had a sour ending.\n\nFizzled would not be the right word – it was more like a very dramatic excommunication, Hailey, 22, said. There was a period where if I walked into a room, he would walk out.\n\nLast June, they crossed paths in Miami at a conference held by Pastor Rich Wilkerson Jr.\n\nThe common denominator, I promise you, is always church, Hailey said. By then we were past the drama. I just gave him a hug.\n\nShe adds that towards the conference's end, her soon-to-be husband, foreshadowing their future, told her: We're not going to be friends.\n\nWhen I saw her last June, I just forgot how much I loved her and how much I missed her and how much of a positive impact she made on my life, Justin, 24, said. I was like, 'Holy cow, this is what I've been looking for.'\n\nDiving into their issues, Hailey explains it's a struggle to be in touch with my emotions. (Justin) gets there immediately.\n\nWe don't want to say the wrong thing, and so we've been struggling with not expressing our emotions, which has been driving me absolutely crazy because I just need to express myself, Justin shared, and it's been really difficult to get her to say what she feels.\n\nJustin admits his time in the spotlight has made it difficult to trust people, including his wife.\n\nI've struggled with the feeling that people are using me or aren't really there for me, and that writers are looking to get something out of me and then use it against me, he said. One of the big things for me is trusting myself. I've made some bad decisions personally, and in relationships. Those mistakes have affected my confidence in my judgment. It's been difficult for me even to trust Hailey. (Turning to Hailey) We've been working through stuff. And it's great, right?\n\nMore:Justin Bieber's mom calls daughter-in-law Hailey Baldwin 'a gift' in sweet selfie\n\nMore:Hailey Baldwin opens up about anxiety and insecurity: 'Every single day is a confidence battle'\n\nJustin also opened up to the publication about a darker time in his life, and getting really depressed on the tour for his album Purpose in 2017. I haven't talked about this, and I'm still processing so much stuff that I haven't talked about, he shared. I was lonely. I needed some time.\n\nJustin recalled what it was like to be idolized and obsessed over at 16.\n\nI started really feeling myself too much, he said. People love me, I'm the (expletive) – that's honestly what I thought. I got very arrogant and cocky. I was wearing sunglasses inside.\n\nHe also recalled a time when he was relying on Xanax to distance himself from his reality.\n\nI found myself doing things that I was so ashamed of, being super-promiscuous and stuff, and I think I used Xanax because I was so ashamed, he shared. My mom always said to treat women with respect. For me that was always in my head while I was doing it, so I could never enjoy it. Drugs put a screen between me and what I was doing.\n\nIt got pretty dark, he added. I think there were times when my security was coming in late at night to check my pulse and see if I was still breathing.\n\nToday, Justin is happier with a wife who speaks candidly about the difficulties of marriage but is determined not to throw in the towel.\n\nI'm not going to sit here and lie and say it's all a magical fantasy. It's always going to be hard. It's a choice, she said. You don't feel it every single day. You don't wake up every day saying, 'I'm absolutely so in love and you are perfect.' That's not what being married is. But there's something beautiful about it anyway—about wanting to fight for something, commit to building with someone.\n\nWe're really young, and that's a scary aspect, she continued. We're going to change a lot. But we're committed to growing together and supporting each other in those changes. That's how I look at it. At the end of the day, too, he's my best friend. I never get sick of him.\n\nMore:Justin Bieber is selling smiley faces, corduroy and lethargy in new clothing line\n\nMore:Justin Bieber has a new face tattoo, here's what it says
Arthur Levine\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nMegawatt signs, a jet-black pyramid, a faux Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty, an erupting volcano, dancing fountains: There are countless distractions along Las Vegas' legendary Strip. When Caesars Entertainment, which operates a number of the city's casino resorts, wanted to create an attention-commanding anchor for a new project it was developing between the Flamingo and Harrah's, it settled on an observation wheel. But not just any wheel. It built the world's tallest observation wheel.\n\nThe 550-foot High Roller beckons the 20 million visitors that walk Las Vegas Boulevard every year to make their way to The Linq, Caesars' hotel, casino, and shopping/dining/entertainment district. Opened in 2014, the imposing attraction has staked its place in the city's skyline and already earned iconic status.\n\nTraveling at one foot per second, the slow-moving wheel makes one revolution in 30 minutes. It doesn't stop for riders to load or unload, so they have to hop on and off its climate-controlled, 40-passenger cabins. From its perch about halfway down the Strip, the High Roller affords dramatic, panoramic views of the glitzy cityscape and the mountains that ring Vegas, particularly as the cabins reach the 550-foot apex.\n\nDuring the day, a recorded spiel and overhead video monitors that display info about the famed city accompany the ride. At night, there is more of a party atmosphere in the cabins. Perhaps the best time to take a spin is at dusk, when the sun sets and the Strip's electric- and neon-soaked cloak kicks into hyperdrive, bathing Vegas in an ethereal glow. Tickets for nighttime rides cost more than daytime ones.\n\nWhile the High Roller shares the same basic concept with the Ferris wheel that first spun at the 1893 Chicago World's Columbian Exposition, it is classified as an observation wheel. That's because instead of relying on gravity, its vehicles use mechanical drives to keep them level as the wheel rotates. Unlike George Ferris' groundbreaking attraction, the Vegas wheel's cabins are positioned on the outside of its rim, according to Eric Eberhart, the High Roller's general manager. Our design avoids visual intrusion, says Eberhart. You get the sensation of floating as you go around.\n\nIn addition to being the tallest wheel of its kind (it is more than 100 feet taller than the London Eye and tops the Singapore Flyer by a few feet), the High Roller distinguishes itself from its counterparts in other ways. Most giant wheels have two rims. Ours is like one big bicycle wheel, notes Eberhart. Like a bike's wheel, it has spokes, which are actually 3-inch-thick cables that emanate from the hub. Mechanics periodically adjust the tension of the cables almost as if they are piano or guitar strings.\n\nIt takes 32 truck tires, powered by hydraulic motors, to keep the 550-foot monster turning. The 2000 lights embedded in the wheel, which can display a rainbow of colors and a variety of patterns, paint the night sky. Every few minutes during the evening hours, a light show on the massive wheel syncs with lights and music in the Linq's street-level promenade of shops, restaurants, and attractions. Offerings include an outpost of the LA staple, Canter's Deli, a Ghirardelli Ice Cream & Chocolate Shop, and the concert venue and ten-pin mashup, Brooklyn Bowl.\n\nA zipline experience, Fly Linq, is set to debut later this year at the complex. Starting from a 122-foot launch tower, up to 10 passengers will soar above the promenade from the Strip towards the High Roller. A similar zipline attraction, Slot Zilla, is offered at Freemont Street in downtown Las Vegas.\n\nProposed wheels in New York City, Dubai, and elsewhere threaten to steal the High Roller's record as the world's tallest. Eberhart says that the ride's developers originally wanted to go even higher, but because of the site's proximity to McCarran Airport, the FAA imposed height restrictions. Caesars also considered building an enormous roller coaster at the site, but went with a wheel because of its widespread appeal and accessibility (interestingly, there used to be a roller coaster atop the Strip's Stratosphere Tower that also used the Vegas-ready name, High Roller).\n\nThe ride may be suitable for all ages and thrill-tolerance levels, but it might give pause to some visitors who are afraid of heights. They might want to consider booking a Happy Half Hour ride and downing some liquid courage. The experience includes an onboard chatty bartender who can share anecdotes about the High Roller and Las Vegas, take photos of riders, and pour unlimited drinks (for those tempted to chug as many beers as possible during the 30-minute ride, it should be noted that there are no restrooms in the cabins).\n\nIt's one thing to have a highball high in the sky. It's quite another to strike a mountain pose while ogling the Las Vegas Valley from a lofty vantage point. On selected mornings and early evenings, the High Roller offers yoga sessions for up to six participants. Instructors conduct the one-hour classes using wireless headphones. If yoga isn't your thing, perhaps a chocolate-tasting experience at 550 feet might do the trick. A representative from local chocolatier, Ethel M, talks about the treats while sharing samples paired with a glass of wine.\n\nHigh Roller cabins are also available for private events including weddings (a natural in the marriage hotspot), engagement proposals, parties, corporate functions, and virtually anything else. Ironically, there is one thing you can't do aboard the Las Vegas wheel: gamble. State law prevents it. But there are plenty of opportunities to hit the casino tables after you return to terra firma.
Ryan T. Anderson and Robert P. George\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nA decade ago, President Barack Obama affirmed that marriage unites a man and woman. So did 45 states and the federal government. The only states to redefine marriage had done so through activist court rulings or, in 2009, legislative action. At the ballot box, citizens had uniformly voted against redefinition. A majority agreed with Obama.\n\nThen, in 2012, Obama evolved, and the Supreme Court took cases involving marriage law. Nothing in the Constitution answered the actual question at hand: What is marriage? The court should have left the issue to the people. But in 2013, it struck down the federal definition of marriage as a male-female union in a 5-4 ruling.\n\nThe court also punted on a challenge to a state definition of marriage adopted in a 2008 constitutional referendum by which a majority of Californians — yes, Californians — overturned an activist court. Only in 2015 did the Supreme Court, breaking 5-4 again, redefine marriage for the nation, provoking four irrefutable dissents.\n\nSame-sex marriage advocates told the public that they sought only the freedom to marry. Same-sex couples were already free to live as they chose, but legal recognition was about the definition of marriage for all of society. It was about affirmation — by the government and everyone else.\n\nIt's unsurprising that once a campaign that used to cry live and let live prevailed, it began working to shut down Catholic adoption agencies and harass evangelical bakers and florists. This shows it was never really about live and let live — that was a merely tactical stance.\n\nFamily, marriage — redefined\n\nWhile these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. Law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action. The law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. This undermines the truth that children deserve a mother and a father — one of each.\n\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board:Baker's case is not about the First Amendment\n\nJack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop:Here's why I can't custom-design cakes for same-sex weddings\n\nIt also undercuts any reasonable justification for marital norms. After all, if marriage is about romantic connection, why require monogamy? There's nothing magical about the number two, as defenders of polyamory point out. If marriage isn't a conjugal union uniting a man and a woman as one flesh, why should it involve or imply sexual exclusivity? If it isn't a comprehensive union inherently ordered to childbearing and rearing, why should it be pledged to permanence?\n\nMarriage redefiners could not answer these questions when challenged to show that the elimination of sexual complementarity did not undermine other marital norms. Today, they increasingly admit that they have no stake in upholding norms of monogamy, exclusivity and permanence.\n\nSame-sex marriage didn't create these problems. Many in America had unwisely already gone along with the erosion of marital norms in the wake of the sexual revolution — with the rise of cohabitation, nonmarital childbearing, no-fault divorce and the hookup culture. It was no surprise that many would then question the relevance of the male-female norm. Legal redefinition is a consequence of the cultural breakdown of marriage.\n\nMonogamy is old news\n\nBut same-sex marriage is a catalyst for further erosion. Already, we see respectable opinion-makers mainstreaming throuples, ethical nonmonogamy and open relationships. This was predictable; we and others predicted it.\n\nSomething we didn't predict are the headlines about transgender and nonbinary identities. A decade ago, few Americans had given much thought to the T in LGBT. Today, transgender identity seems to dominate the discussion of sexuality and sexual morality.\n\nA sex change couldn't solve the underlying issues:I was a transgender woman for 8 years — time I can't get back\n\nLiving your truth is hard — but right:High school could have been hell for my transgender son. Don't make it hell for the next kid.\n\nThere's a logic here. If we can't see the point of our sexual embodiment where it matters most — in marriage — we'll question whether it matters at all. Hence the push to see gender as fluid and existing along a spectrum of nonbinary options.\n\nThere's a deeper logic, too. Implicit in the push for same-sex marriage was body-self dualism — the idea that we're actually nonphysical entities inhabiting physical bodies, or ghosts in machines. That's why the plumbing in sexual acts seemed not to matter.\n\nTrue one-flesh union, the foundation of conjugal marriage, was thought illusory. What mattered was emotional union and partners' use of their bodies to induce desirable sensations and feelings. Of course, two men or two women (or throuples or even larger sexual ensembles) could do that. But the logic didn't stay with marriage. If the body is mere plumbing, then sex matters less than identity.\n\nThis has had tragic consequences, especially for children.\n\nChildren burdened by our mistakes\n\nNearly unthinkable a decade ago, certain medical professionals tell children experiencing gender dysphoria that they are trapped in the wrong body, even that their bodies are merely like Pop-Tarts foil packets, as one expert explained.\n\nSome doctors now prescribe puberty-blocking drugs to otherwise healthy children struggling to accept their bodies. They prescribe cross-sex hormones for young teens to transform their bodies to align with their gender identities.\n\nAs part of a government grant-supported study, doctors even performed double mastectomies on adolescent girls — including two 13-year-olds.\n\nDiscrimination isn't dead:Trump's anti-transgender memo would hurt teens like me. I'm hoping my state protects me.\n\nA national policy epidemic:My daughter thinks she's transgender. Her public school undermined my efforts to help her.\n\nThese changes weren't grassroots movements. They've come from people wielding political, economic and cultural power to advance sexual-liberationist ideology. The change has been top down — from Hollywood's portrayal of LGBT characters to business executives boycotting states over religious-freedom laws. Having lost at the ballot box over and over — even in California — activists found new avenues: ideologically friendly courts, federal agencies, big corporations.\n\nHaving secured a judicial redefinition of marriage, they pivoted to the T, with the Obama administration redefining sex to mean gender identity and imposing a new policy on all schools.\n\nAnd having won government support, activists turned to eliminating private dissent. Former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke wants to yank the tax-exemption of noncompliant churches. Megadonor Tim Gill vows to spend his fortunes to punish the wicked. Who are the wicked? Those who refuse to accept the new sexual orthodoxy.\n\nAll of us, including those identifying as LGBT, are made in God's image, are endowed with profound dignity and thus deserve respect. It's because of this dignity and out of such respect that the institutions serving the human good — like the marriage-based family — should be supported, not undermined or redefined. That basic rights like religious freedom ought to be upheld, not infringed. That a healthy moral and physical ecology — especially for children — must be preserved.\n\nThe progress of the past decade has exacted steep costs.\n\nRyan T. Anderson is the William E.

SANTA MONICA, Calif. – Even if you watched CW Network's three-hour Critics' Choice Awards on Sunday night, you couldn't see everything that happened at Barker Hangar.\n\nYes, you saw Fleabag score, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood win big and Parasite director Bong Joon-ho share the honor with 1917 director Sam Mendes.\n\nBut the cameras don't let television viewers hear the bleeped words, see table-side hugs and watch speeches that are cut off for commercial breaks. That's where we come in.\n\nSince we had ticketed seats, we can share all of the Critics' Choice Awards gossip with you, dear readers. Here's what you missed:\n\nMore:Everything you missed (including some backstage gossip) at the Critics' Choice Awards\n\n'The Irishman' speech got cut off\n\nWhen the cast of The Irishman won best acting ensemble, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Harvey Keitel all went onstage to accept the award. But there apparently wasn't enough time for them all to say their thank yous on the show, because after Pacino said a few words, the men were played off.\n\nThat is, until the crowed booed and Keitel decided he would keep talking.\n\nThe great Stanislavski ... said there are no small parts, only small actors. And I tried to convince Al of this, but he wouldn't switch parts with me, Keitel joked. Before he left, Keitel, a former Marine, acknowledged Marriage Story story actor Adam Driver when he announced, Semper fi, Adam!\n\nDe Niro also decided, long after the show had cut to commercial, to keep the speechmaking going and thank Netflix for making this happen for us.\n\nLater in the show, Keitel got an acceptance speech shout-out from best-picture winner Quentin Tarantino. The Once Upon a Time director thanked Keitel for giving this kid a chance.\n\nEddie Murphy didn't use a teleprompter\n\nThough presenters tend to read their prewritten scripts, Murphy did no such thing, despite being honored with a previously announced lifetime achievement award. Instead, he spoke off the cuff about how he's gotten to play all sorts of roles in his career, from a donkey in Shrek to a spaceship in the critically panned Dave.\n\nHe went on, in language that isn't suitable for TV: That (expletive) didn't go too well. … Never play a spaceship.\n\nBy the time Murphy accepted the award for best comedy Dolemite is My Name, he said he was at a loss for words.\n\nCritics' Choice Awards 2020: The complete winners list\n\nPart of Phoebe Waller-Bridge's speech was NSFW\n\nThe Fleabag creator and star accepted two Critics' Choice awards, for actress and comedy series. Her co-star Andrew Scott (aka Hot Priest) also won. So by the time Waller-Bridge accepted her show's third honor of the night, she was feeling good, and not so concerned with her language. We can't repeat what she said here, but she did express gratitude that her show, whose main character says lewd things to the cameras all the time, was well received.\n\nWaller-Bridge has said that Season 2 is the last for her critically acclaimed Fleabag, but that doesn't mean it's the last time she's collaborating with Scott. On the Critics' Choice red carpet, Scott told USA TODAY that the two are working on something now. He added: We'll make it spicy!\n\nSome winners got standing ovations\n\nThere are so many winners, since the Critics' Choice recognizes both TV and movies, that there's not enough time to present an award to every winner let alone stand for each one. However, there are a few stars who received standing ovations when their names were called. Among them: Murphy, Joon-ho, the winning cast of limited series When They See Us, and comedy special winner Norman Lear.\n\nCritics' Choice Awards 2020: Best-dressed stars, from Lupita Nyong'o to Rachel Brosnahan\n\nThe stars were huggers\n\nWhether they were saying hello or offering congratulations, stars shared plenty of hugs and handshakes. What loving embraces did we try not to look at for too long, in an effort to avoid being creepy?\n\nLittle Women filmmaker Greta Gerwig was held by her partner, Marriage Story director Noah Baumbach, after she won best adapted screenplay.\n\nThe Farewell star Awkwafina got a warm welcome from When They See Us director Ava DuVernay, and also from Glow lead Alison Brie (who was in a similar canary-yellow dress).\n\nLittle Women star Saoirse Ronan also shared a long embrace that lasted well past commercial break with Booksmart actress Beanie Feldstein.\n\nAnd there were also compliments tossed around: Henry Winkler (Barry) told John Lithgow (The Crown), You were fantastic! Much like her character does in biopic Judy, Critics' Choice Award winner Renée Zellweger was approached by a fan, who is also a critic, who told her: I love you so much!A meat-free meal was served\n\nJust like the Golden Globes, the Critics' Choice Awards served a vegetarian meal. That meant that there were chips, bread and pieces of lettuce on the table. For entrees, vegetarian burgers and burritos were passed out. However, if you happened to be away from your table during the single commercial break where the food was served (like we were), you didn't get a meal. (They were individually wrapped in paper, so not exactly environmentally friendly.)\n\nBut Joaquin Phoenix was excited about the veggie meal, which he noted in his best-actor acceptance speech (as he did at the Golden Globes). And Joon-ho joked that after accepting his award, he was going to go back and finish his food.\n\nI definitely did not expect this award so I did not prepare a speech. Today I was just enjoying the vegan burger and trying to enjoy the ceremony, Joon-ho told the crowd with the help of his translator.\n\nCritics' Choice Awards: Billy Porter's butterfly tattoos honored 'transgender community'\n\nJennifer Lopez thanked by Phoebe Waller-Bridge for inspiring TV's 'Fleabag' at Critics' Choice Awards
Jenn Gidman\n\nNewser staff\n\n(NEWSER) – A 6-year-old California girl whose birth parents were plagued by substance abuse and criminal infractions was taken in at age 2 by a foster family.\n\nBut Alexandria (aka Lexi) is also 1/64th Choctaw Native American, which means where she ends up is dictated by 1978's Indian Child Welfare Act — a law that seeks to keep American Indian children with American Indian families.\n\nRusty and Summer Page had long fought to retain custody of Lexi, but on Monday the girl was removed from their home by the Los Angeles Department of Child & Family Services, NBC News reports. Our family is so incredibly devastated, the Pages said in a statement, but nobody could possibly be more devastated than our 6-year-old daughter. By court order, the Pages weren't allowed to tell Lexi beforehand she'd be taken, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nLexi is now with a Utah couple related by marriage to Lexi's biological dad, who has Choctaw blood but has never lived on a reservation himself.\n\nThe move came after reunification efforts with Lexi's biological dad went south, and he, the tribe, and DCFS recommended Lexi go to Utah — even though that couple is non-Indian and Summer Page actually does have American Indian heritage, per the Pages' Change.org petition.\n\nThe National Indian Child Welfare Association says in a statement that foster care is meant to be temporary, not to fast-track the creation of new families when there is extended family available; a Choctaw Nation statement says the Pages always knew the goal was to place Lexi with family.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Pages appealed to California's highest court to reverse the decision, reports the AP.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Newser:\n\n6-Year-Old Lexi Lived and Bonded With a Foster Family for 4 Years.

Health care is one of the most divisive issues of the 2020 presidential campaign, with candidates disparaging insurers and polarizing labels creating deep divisions even among Democrats. But remove the buzzwords from the policies, and voters who will decide the election aren't so far apart in their own positions, new research shows.\n\nRegardless of party affiliation, nearly everyone wants to see the nation's health care system improved, and a majority want big changes. That includes people for whom the system is working well, and those who may be political opposites.\n\nThat's the big picture finding of a new Public Agenda/USA TODAY/Ipsos survey of Americans' attitudes on health care. The survey is part of the Hidden Common Ground 2020 Initiative, which seeks to explore areas of agreement on major issues facing the nation.\n\nRepublican and Democratic voters actually agree on many climate change fixes. So why no action?\n\nThe nationally representative survey of 1,020 adult Americans 18 years and older was conducted December 19-26, 2019. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.\n\nThe survey removed politically charged language such as Medicare for All and Obamacare and simply explained the basics of health care approaches in an effort to capture voters' true opinions.\n\nThere's the making of a public conversation about this and it does not need to be around ideology, said Will Friedman, president of Public Agenda, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research and public engagement organization. People just aren't so set on what they want.\n\nThe sharpest divides were on the size of government and taxes.\n\nIn general, Democrats were more comfortable with a larger role for the federal government, such as the single-payer government insurance program also called Medicare for All, or a public option.\n\nInstead of saying public option though, pollsters asked respondents how strongly they agreed with the concept of a new federal health insurance program that gives people a new choice beyond the current private insurance market.\n\nAny adult could buy into the program on a sliding scale, they were told, and 48% were in favor. A survey released last week by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found similar support, with the same percentage of Americans favoring such an option.\n\nWhen described in general terms, 46% of respondents said they would support market-based plans and 45% could back Medicare for All-type plans.\n\nFive goals were rated by more than 90% of those surveyed as very or somewhat important: making health care more affordable for ordinary Americans; lowering the cost of prescription drugs; making sure people with preexisting medical conditions can get affordable health insurance; covering long-term care for the elderly and disabled; and making sure all communities have access to enough doctors and hospitals.\n\nSo why the gridlock?\n\nThere are these sort of flashpoints with politicized terminology that send people to their partisan corners, said former Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas, a Republican who is on the board of the bipartisan, nonprofit United States of Care. If we avoid them, we're going to be more successful.\n\nJohn Greifzu, a survey respondent and school janitor in Fulton, Illinois, used to be a Democrat and almost middle of the road. Now, after being a single father of three children until his recent marriage, health insurance costs have made him distrust his party.\n\nHis wife is paying an arm and a leg — up to a third of a paycheck — for bottom of the barrel insurance that comes with a $2,000 deductible through her retail job. And even on the Medicaid plans that cover his children, there are things that aren't covered, he said.\n\nGreifzu watched his insurance costs rise as it became offered to the unemployed.\n\nI work hard for what I've got, said Greifzu. I'm not going to give up more money for people who don't do anything.\n\nEmily Barson, United States of Care's executive director, said the survey validates our worldview ... that people agree more than the current political rhetoric would have you believe.\n\nIt also shows success at the state level is particularly promising, Barson added.\n\nBefore the midterm congressional elections, some Republican members of Congress avoided unscripted town halls with voters as concerns rose about the fate of the Affordable Care Act and protections for people with preexisting conditions. In states, Douglas said governors and state officials can't avoid voters — or each other.\n\nState officials need to get elected too, but more importantly, we (states) have to balance our budgets every year, said Douglas, now a political science professor at Middlebury College.\n\nFriedman noted, however, that voters made it clear in their responses that they don't want policymakers to leave health care issues to the states. When queried on the specifics, respondents said they didn't want moving from state to state to make health care any more complicated.\n\nIn terms of the overarching solution, the public would like to see it solved nationally, he said.\n\nLarry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said most of all it's clear voters want something done about the prices they pay.\n\nAmericans across the political spectrum desperately want relief from health care costs, Levitt said, and at some point they're going to hold political leaders to account for not delivering.\n\nObamacare, Medicare and more\n\n'Medicare for All is really missing the point': Experts say program needs work\n\nTrump says he'd take 'take a look' at changing entitlements such as Medicare\n\nSupreme Court refuses for now to hear appeal of decision threatening Affordable Care Act\n\n---\n\nThe findings from the Public Agenda/USA TODAY/Ipsos poll are part of an election-year project by USA TODAY and Public Agenda. The Hidden Common Ground initiative explores areas of agreement on major issues facing the nation.\n\nThe survey of 1,020 adult Americans 18 years and older was taken December 19-26, 2019. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5.7 percentage points for Democrats, plus or minus 6.2 percentage points for Republicans and plus or minus 5.7 percentage points for independents.\n\nThe Hidden Common Ground project is supported by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Charles Koch Foundation and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. The Kettering Foundation serves as a research partner to the Hidden Common Ground initiative.
Paul Myerberg\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nCLEMSON, S.C. — As a young teen-ager, Clemson co-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott sat nestled inside Charlie Ward's locker as former Florida State coach Bobby Bowden prepared his Seminoles to face rival Miami (Fla.), storing away Bowden's message and approach for future reference.\n\nEven as a kid, the son of then-Florida State offensive line coach Brad Scott knew he wanted to be a coach — and not just a coach but a college football coach, just like the two he admired most: Bowden and his dad.\n\nI caught the bug very early, said Scott. At an early age I had an interest in learning the game. Not just learning it from a player's perspective but from a coach's perspective. I was really thinking as a potential coach.\n\nEvery moment was a potential learning experience. His elementary school was located roughly 500 yards behind the Seminoles' practice field, so Scott would wait for the end-of-day bell before sprinting the distance to watch the Seminoles conduct drills. Afterward, he'd park himself in the corner of the coaches' room and watch as the staff studied film of their upcoming opponent.\n\nClemson sees Alabama as gold standard on way to golden finish\n\nScott would sit in his family's living room as his dad made hour-long recruiting calls, and afterward offer a barrage of questions: What did you say? Why did you say that? What was the response? When it comes to recruiting, be the first and last coach a prospect sees, Brad Scott advised his son.\n\nScott carried headset cords during his dad's stint as the head coach at South Carolina from 1994-98, allowing him to listen and follow the decision-making process at every sideline huddle. That position also allowed Scott to keep tabs on the opposing coaching staff, and he grew adept at tracking defensive signals: In a game against Arkansas, for example, Scott deciphered the Razorbacks' blitz schemes by watching then-defensive coordinator Joe Lee Dunn.\n\nHe always had that plan, said Brad Scott, now Clemson's assistant athletic director of football player development. He was a goal-setter.\n\nPart determination, part hard work, part luck but always by design, Scott's road was mapped out long before the No. 1 Tigers' unbeaten push to Monday night's College Football Playoff championship game against No. 2 Alabama — and it has gone according to this script at every step along the way, paired with a handful of fortuitous moments crucial to his burgeoning career.\n\nEver since I was 10 years old, I knew I was going to be a college football coach, he said. Without a doubt, I knew that was what I was going to do.\n\nCommon theme for Alabama, Clemson: Dominant defensive lines\n\nSo he planned accordingly. Begin your career on the high-school ranks, his dad said, so in the spring semester of his freshman year as a walk-on wide receiver at Clemson — where his dad was hired as an assistant in 1999 — Scott began pursuing a degree in secondary education, specializing in mathematics; he knew this would make him more readily employable after graduation.\n\nThough he held a scholarship offer to Furman University, Scott chose to walk on at Clemson largely because of the presence of Tigers offensive coordinator, Rich Rodriguez, who ran the tempo-based spread offense then gaining in popularity on college football's highest level. I want to learn this system, Scott thought, and then use it myself.\n\nHe's always prepared, said Clemson co-offensive coordinator Tony Elliott. You can always tell that he's thinking outside the box, big-picture.\n\nThe offense Scott learned while playing under Rodriguez served him well at Blythewood (S.C.) High School, which won the state championship in his one season as head coach — and did so in its initial season of existence as a program altogether, becoming the first school in state history to achieve that feat.\n\nAs did a decision to leave Presbyterian College, where he spent the 2007 season as the wide receivers coach, to become a Clemson graduate assistant. Scott researched current head coaches and found that nearly all had served as graduate assistants on the Football Bowl Subdivision level, and felt guilty that he had missed that step in his career.\n\nI didn't want to look like anybody had given anything to me, or that I was trying to take shortcuts, he said. It was very important to me that I earn everything that I get. I wanted to have to grind as a (graduate assistant) like most coaches did.\n\nClemson will now practice as much as Alabama before title game thanks to NCAA waiver\n\nIt was in July 2008, after serving as the co-director of the Tigers' summer football camp, when Scott sat down with then-receivers coach Dabo Swinney, who was so impressed with Scott's work to date that he made a promise: When I become a head coach, I'm going to hire you.\n\nThat happened sooner than expected, after Clemson fired Tommy Bowden midway through the 2008 season and named Swinney as his interim replacement — and months later handed the permanent job to Swinney, who made Scott the Tigers' receivers coach and recruiting coordinator.\n\nThose recruiting talks he overheard and discussed as a teen-ager now pay dividends: Scott has excelled as the driver of Clemson's recruiting efforts, earning individual accolades as the Tigers compiled the talent needed to charge toward the national championship.\n\nWhat makes him an unbelievable recruiter is that he's persistent, Brad Scott said. He works at it. He can create a relationship with anybody.\n\nThe introduction to spread-offense concepts under Rodriguez was joined by an apprenticeship under former Clemson coordinator Chad Morris, now the head coach at SMU. Behind Scott and Elliott, the Tigers' offense resembles a marriage of both systems, rooted in speed, tempo and an unexpected degree of physicality.\n\nYou've got to be at the right place at the right time doing the right thing, and have a little luck go your way, Scott said. I was in the right place at the right time.\n\nIn the right place at the right time but always prepared, which should come as no surprise. Scott has been piecing together his approach since the start of his career, one that has only recently taken full flight yet began more than two decades ago — beginning as a young coach's son who mapped out his professional course.\n\nWhatever I've been given, I wanted to do it the very best I possibly can do, he said. That's one thing that's really helped me move up in the profession.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS: CLEMSON'S PATH TO THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
The combo you didn't know you needed in your life\n\nWe live in a time when comfort food mashups are a dime a dozen. Just look at the ramen burger. Or the cronut. Or, if you must, the Twinkie dog. But chefs have been assembling unlikely ingredients since way before Instagram provided extra inspiration – centuries before, even, as evidenced by Croatia's medieval dessert, stonska torta (stone cake).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis marriage of chocolate and pasta has centuries of history. Some say it graced the tables of Dubrovnik nobility, back when the city was the center of the Republic of Ragusa, from the 14th to 19th century. Others describe it, conversely, as a peasant dish.\n\nStone cake or stonska torta — Photo courtesy of Chelle Koster Walton\n\nStone cake – an anglicized translation of stonska torta, as it's called in local Hrvatski language – is called such because it hails from the port of Ston, part of Croatia's Pelješac peninsula, along the country's famed Dalmatian Coast of the Adriatic Sea. Regardless of who originally invented it, stone cake was typically eaten at special occasions such as weddings, Easter and Christmas, and that tradition remains today.\n\nIt's for a celebration when family had the chance to get together, says Hamo Ovcina, who grew up in Dubrovnik, 50 kilometers from Ston. Today, a few restaurants [in Dubrovnik] will make it, but not many anymore.\n\nPupo's patisserie in Old Town is one place where you can still order this unique dessert made of chocolate and pasta. Traditionally, makaruli, or Croatian macaroni, filled the cake's pie-like crust, about four inches thick and 10 inches in diameter. These days, within the 1.2 miles of medieval walls in Dubrovnik's Old Town, penne is more commonly used.\n\nCinnamon is the key spice used to flavor the cake, according to Andrea Pisac, who wrote the e-cookbook, Croatian Desserts, and ingredients like almonds, walnuts, vanilla and even pear liqueur round out the cake's dynamic flavor and texture. Pastry and home chefs alike often top the cake with a dusting of powdered sugar and seasonal fruit, and all add their own secret touches.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by @danjadanja\n\nBoth rustic and modern, authentic and foreign, this cake is like a coming-of-age girl that just turned up for her first ball dance, Pisac says. Although she lives in the Croatian capital of Zagreb to the north, Pisac learned to love the Dalmatian specialty at an early age.\n\nMy personal story with this cake comes from spending summers on Pelješac, where there is a family summer house in a small fishing village of Trstenik, she says. I tasted it in several restaurants and immediately fell for it. By that time, the cake was already having a comeback, so I knew there had to be a much older story connected to it. I investigated further, I spoke to the locals, and the pieces slowly came together.\n\nThroughout the past 400 years, Pelješac was home to a robust population of sea captains and sailors who brought home exotic spices and flavors from the East ­– ingredients such as the cinnamon, vanilla and cocoa – that define today's stone cake.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Irena (@travelfromkitchen)\n\nWhen I was in Dubrovnik, I sampled a homemade stone cake made for gallery owner Tea Batinić, who explained another side of stone cake's legacy: It was an invention for people who didn't have enough money [for other desserts]. It was done because they were saving money. Sometimes they used carob instead of chocolate.\n\nBatinić served the torta in thick wedges, striking honeycombed visions. The penne was cemented with finely crushed nuts and laced with chocolate, putting me in mind of the enduring walled fortress city, rising from the sea and cliffs.\n\nThe sweetness of the chocolate and nuts balanced the savory starch of crust and pasta. Then the cinnamon tones chimed in like the city's hourly bells, and finally citrus nuances completed this harmony of unlikely flavor pairings.
Wayne Bledsoe\n\nKnoxville (Tenn.) News Sentinel\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. — Dolly Parton plans to renew her vows to husband Carl Dean on the couple's 50th wedding anniversary in the kind of ceremony the two couldn't afford the first time around.\n\nAccording to an interview with Parton in People magazine, the ceremony will take place May 30.\n\nParton, now a country music superstar and an accomplished businesswoman, met Dean in a Wishy Washy Laundromat on the day that Parton moved to Nashville in 1964. The two were married in Ringgold, Ga., on May 30, 1966, with only Parton's mother as a witness.\n\nDolly Parton on Dollywood, the new resort and her fear of coasters\n\nDean and Parton rarely have been photographed together through the years and there has been much speculation about their relationship. Parton, however, always has maintained that the two have a good marriage and Dean is simply a private person with no interest in the spotlight. Dean ran his own asphalt paving business in Nashville and rarely attended Parton's public events.\n\nIn the upcoming ceremony, Parton said in People that she will have a beautiful wedding dress and take a bunch of pictures.\n\nParton, who turned 70 in January, plans to sell the photos as part of a benefit for her charity, the Imagination Library, which gives books to children each month.\n\nAccording to the interview, Parton was shocked that Dean agreed to the idea.\n\nMy husband is a loner, she said of Dean. He doesn't particularly care about being around anybody but me. He's just always asked me to leave him out of all this. He does not like all the hullabaloo. And yet, she adds, he's always been supportive. He's like a brother and a father and a friend and a husband and a lover — all of those things to me. I think he's kind of proud that we've been in it this long!\n\nFollow Wayne Bledsoe on Twitter: @KnoxvilleDotcom\n\nRelated:\n\nCeleb superlatives: Audiences 'roar' for Katy Perry and Dolly Parton\n\nDollywood hopes to capture lightning in a coaster in 2016\n\nIs Dolly Parton the 'Trump of country music?'

Ryan W. Miller\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nStep aside, Mr. Smith. Mrs. Smith may be going by Mrs. Johnson, or Mrs. Johnson-Smith. And new research shows what she prefers to be called probably doesn't really matter, except to men who are less educated.\n\nIn a recent study published in Gender Issues, a researcher from Portland State University found that most Americans don't think women who take their husbands' last names are any more committed to their husbands, nor do they hold women with their own surnames to a different standard. However, lower educated men on all measures seem to have more of an issue with women who kept their maiden name.\n\nThe study builds on existing research around perceptions of surname choice for women. A survey conducted in 2006 found that 50% of Americans think women should be legally obligated to take their husbands' last names, and 70% said it would be better if a woman changed her name.\n\nWomen have made a lot of inroads in terms of employment, but what is more stalled in terms of gender inequality is in terms of what goes on in the home, said Emily Fitzgibbons Shafer, the study's author. Shafer said, though, that the results of her study did surprise her.\n\nZoe Saldana's husband takes her last name, does not care about your gender norms\n\nThe survey, conducted in 2010, presented respondents with a fictitious scenario: Carol has spent extra time in the office working toward a promotion while her husband, Bill Cook, is having to do more around the house. Respondents were then randomly assigned to situations where Carol took Bill's last name, kept her maiden name, Sherman, or hyphenated to Sherman-Cook.\n\nThe survey asked how committed Carol was to her husband, how many days each week Bill should be OK with Carol working late and how justified Bill would be in divorcing Carol. On all three questions, Shafer found that almost all respondents did not think differently of the woman regardless of surname choice. Yet men with low education did think that Carol was less committed if she kept her name and that Bill would be more justified in divorcing her.\n\nShafer said she included information about Carol's job as a way to eliminate bias for people who may think they were supposed to say that they do not care whether the woman changed her name.\n\nJapan makes it hard for women to keep last name\n\nThe results highlight how women could still receive backlash in their personal lives if they are perceived as putting themselves before their marriage or their family, Shafer said. While people may not judge a woman who keeps her surname, they might have strong opinions as to what is best for a woman, Shafer added.\n\nThe issue extends outside of people's homes, too. Hillary Clinton once went by her maiden name Hillary Rodham, but she changed it after her husband lost a 1980 gubernatorial re-election, in part because she was seen by many as a bad wife for sticking with Rodham, the study noted.\n\nWhile Shafer's overall findings indicate these perceptions around surname are changing somewhat, she still thinks the issue is here to stay.\n\nSurname choice is one of those things that has really stuck, she said. The changes in women's personal lives are behind those in their professional lives.\n\nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter @MILLERdfillmore
For many Americans who watched the violence engulf the U.S. Capitol last week, the treatment of the rioters came down to a matter of Black and white.\n\nLaw enforcement officers responded slowly, and in some cases passively, as a largely white crowd that supported President Donald Trump trashed the seat of Congress in a fit of violence that led to five deaths.\n\nThe images loomed in stark contrast to last year's Black Lives Matter demonstrations, when mostly peaceful protesters decrying the constant killings of African Americans by police were frequently met with rubber bullets, tear gas and a significant show of force by law enforcement.\n\nNo one can tell me that if that had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol, President-elect Joe Biden said, addressing the nation a day after last week's riot.\n\nRacism is the Achilles heel of the United States, and the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer; the death of Breonna Taylor who was shot in her apartment by Louisville Metro police officers; and a pandemic that is having a disproportionate impact on people of color, has vividly illustrated the vast economic and social inequalities woven into the American system.\n\nRace, particularly the hardened notions around Black and white identity, is not rooted in biology. Rather, scholars say, this stratification that has riven virtually every aspect of American life was a social construct that allowed an elite few to hoard wealth and power, justified the subjugation of those being exploited, and created a color divide that prevented the working class from uniting.\n\nResearch shows that the racial wealth gap wasn't created because of something that individuals or families of color did wrong,'' says Kilolo Kijakazi, an Institute Fellow with the Urban Institute, a think tank focused on economic and social policy. It is driven by these structural barriers … policies, programs and institutional practices that facilitate the creation of wealth for white families while creating barriers to wealth accumulation by or stripping wealth from families of color.''\n\nIn the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, those long-standing racial and economic disparities are putting African Americans at greater risk of losing their jobs, their businesses, their homes, and their lives.\n\nAs a result of the downturn caused by the health crisis, 9.9% of African Americans were out of work in December, in contrast to 6% of whites, 9.3% of Latinos and 5.9% of Asians.\n\nAfrican American entrepreneurs, long denied equal access to credit and capital, struggled to access the federal paycheck protection loans that kept some businesses afloat during the early months of the pandemic.\n\nBlack- and brown-owned small businesses had less access to that relief,'' Biden said on Jan. 8 when announcing his economic and jobs team. He added that one-third of Black-owned small businesses, as well as one-fifth of those owned by Latinos and more than one-quarter of Native American-owned businesses had less than a month of cash in reserve to handle expenses without more relief.\n\nAnd the median wages paid to Black workers, whether they lack a high school diploma or have a graduate degree, are less than whites at every level of education, according to Kijakazi, citing analysis by the Center for Economic and Policy Research. That makes it harder to save and build a financial cushion to fall back on during hard times.\n\nBlack people are striving for the American dream, but they're simply not getting the return on their investment,'' says Andre Perry, a Brookings fellow who is the author of Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America's Black Cities.\n\nWe're working, Perry adds. We're going to school. We're buying homes. But predatory lending, job discrimination ... and racism is throttling economic mobility.''\n\nBlack and white: The beginnings\n\nHuman beings, whether they're from Senegal or Syria, Australia or the United States, share 99.9% of the same DNA, and most of the differences represented by that fraction of a percent have no biologic relevance,'' says Lawrence Brody, director of the Division of Genomics and Society at the National Human Genome Research Institute.\n\nBut in the past few hundred years, the development of the concept of race, and the assigning of status according to such distinctions, became a way to serve the self-interests of those who had, and wanted to maintain, power.\n\nClearly, in modern times, it was just an excuse for domination,'' Brody says.\n\nAnti-racism scholar Ibram X. Kendi traces the start of documented anti-Black racist ideas to The Chronicle of the Discovery and Conquest of Guinea.'' The work, published in 1453, sought to justify exclusive trading in enslaved African captives by Portugal's Prince Henry as an endeavor to expose them to Christianity rather than as a way for him to build wealth.\n\nThe author, Gomes Eanes de Zurara, essentially created the idea of multi-ethnic Blackness that is inferior in the minds of racist thinkers, Kendi said in an email. The captives had varying skin tones and represented several different peoples, but Zurara deemed them a single group that was lesser and in need of salvation.\n\nSo, Kendi says, racist notions became a way to justify the exploitation of African peoples.\n\nA similar scenario would play out two centuries later across the Atlantic, where wealthy British colonists would protect their power by creating a society that granted and denied opportunities, protections and basic rights along color lines. But those divisions, ultimately codified by law, were carved out over time.\n\nThough terms like Negroe,' and Indian'' were used during the early 17th century, the first time a law uses the word white'' to refer to a category of people in the English-speaking colonies that became the U.S. appears to have occurred in April 1691, according to Terrance MacMullan, professor of philosophy at Eastern Washington University and author of Habits of Whiteness: A Pragmatist Reconstruction, citing research by the historian Theodore Allen.\n\nThe law, passed by the colonial Virginia legislature known as the House of Burgesses, threatened banishment for any free white man or woman who married a negroe, mulatto, or Indian man or woman bond or free,'' and essentially outlawed English women having sex with any man who was not white.\n\nBut disparate treatment for those who would be defined as white, and those who were deemed Black, had begun decades before.\n\nIn 1640, John Punch, an African man, ran off with two other servants, a Dutchman and a Scotsman. When the three men were caught, they were punished quite differently.\n\nWhile the two Europeans with white skin had to fulfill their period of indentured servitude and then spend another three years as servants to the colony, Punch, a Black man, was sentenced to bondage for the rest of his life.\n\nThey do the same thing, commit the same offense ... but the 'negro' will be in perpetual servitude,'' says Deena Hayes-Greene, co-founder of the Racial Equity Institute in Greensboro, North Carolina. That's beginning to create this wedge.''\n\nThe Virginia colony's wealthy planters became focused on keeping laborers from uniting and the Virginia Slave Codes of 1705 were pivotal and onerous. They created white slave patrols, criminalized marriage between whites and people who were Black or of mixed heritage, and expanded the rights of those who owned enslaved people, including giving them permission to kill those workers without consequence.\n\nThese poor white people who had been seeing themselves similarly oppressed with indigenous people and kidnapped and enslaved Black people are now aligned with land-owning whites,'' Hayes-Greene says. The message was, 'You're not going to get what we get, but you'll get more than them. You can police them, you can oversee them, you can harm them in any way, and you'll be acquitted.'\n\nIn 1790, after the United States had become a nation, whiteness officially became a requirement to vote, own land and to have other rights when the country's first rule of naturalization declared that only a free white person'' could be a citizen.\n\nThose early laws had long-ranging ramifications.\n\nOne of the continual questions about American politics is why Americans across what we call race lines don't make common cause according to class,'' says Nell Irvin Painter, author of The History of White People.'' And a lot of that is because of the really gut-level impossibilities for poor white people and working-class whites to see themselves together with poor and working-class nonwhite people.''\n\nThe cost\n\nThe economic disadvantages Black people face began most glaringly when those who were enslaved were denied the ability to profit from their own work, Kijakazi says.\n\nFor Black families, these policies began with human trafficking and bondage of people of African descent to build wealth for white people, while denying Black people wealth from their own labor, she says.\n\nLong after the Civil War, the ability of Black Americans to build and hold on to wealth continued to be hindered, whether it was discrimination that blocked them from getting more than menial jobs, the destruction of Black businesses and homes by white mobs in cities like Tulsa, Oklahoma, or restrictive covenants and redlining that prevented Black buyers from moving to white areas or getting loans to buy and build in neighborhoods of color.\n\nMany whites, however, do not believe discrimination has been an impediment to Black Americans getting ahead, according to a USA TODAY analysis of a Pew Research Center survey from early 2019. Among those earning between $30,000 to $74,999 a year, 33% of whites believed racial bias was a significant reason African Americans might have a harder time progressing than whites, compared with 79% of Black Americans who felt that way.\n\nThe wedge of race has made it more difficult to enact economic policies that could broadly benefit Americans, regardless of background, particularly those who are lower income or part of the working and middle class, scholars and social justice experts say.\n\nIt's a part of the American ethos,'' says Bishop William Barber II, co-chairman of the Poor Peoples Campaign, regarding the use of race to divide people who he says should otherwise be allies.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson, a Texan who shepherded the most significant civil rights legislation of the past century, spoke of this dichotomy as well. According to a 1988 article in The Washington Post written by journalist and former Johnson staff member Bill Moyers, Johnson told him that, If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.\n\nActivists and scholars note that working-class Americans broadly agree on policies that could lead to greater economic equity.\n\nDavid Madland, a senior fellow with the Center for American Progress, says his research found working-class Americans, regardless of race, backed progressive economic policies and when given the opportunity to vote directly on ballot initiatives, supported changes like raising the minimum wage.\n\nBut the working class do not often get a direct say on economic issues,'' Madland says. Most often they are choosing between candidates .... Some candidates seek to divide the working class along racial lines, often to avoid having to deal with the common economic issues that the working class of all races deal with.''\n\nAn emphasis on those issues however could erase those divisions.\n\nRace can be a wedge,'' Madland says. But a focus on progressive economic policies can help unify the working class.\n\nUnity in place of division\n\nCross-racial alliances have existed throughout U.S. history, from the abolitionists who fought to end slavery, through the early days of the labor movement, and up to the recent protests against police brutality and systemic racism that filled the nation's streets.\n\nAnn Beeson, the former CEO of Every Texan, an Austin, Texas-based social justice advocacy group, says that while some politicians have resorted to racist dog whistles to argue against the Affordable Care Act, both white Texans and people of color have been united in demanding health care access.\n\nThere is no question that the conservative political resistance to Medicaid expansion in the South is rooted in racism, Beeson said. But It's important to distinguish between politicians and the grassroots ... because there is broad support from both people of color and rural and other white Americans in actually pushing for Medicaid expansion.''\n\nMultiracial coalitions are also working to boost wages and secure job protections and benefits for the working class.\n\nThe labor movement has embodied both alliances and division. Black and white workers in the South drew together during the Reconstruction period that followed the end of the Civil War, but were purposely divided when laws were passed to reinforce white supremacy, says Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union.\n\nEven without government intervention or politicians influence, parts of the labor movement excluded workers of color from joining. That's why I think this is a moment for our union and the rest of the labor movement to embrace the fight for racial justice and to integrate into it how we bargain on behalf of workers.''\n\nOne recent union victory involved an agreement with Swedish Health Services, a health system with multiple hospitals in Washington State. Workers bargained together and got management to agree to stand with nurses of color if a patient says they'd prefer a white nurse instead, the SEIU says.\n\nThe Poor Peoples Campaign has focused on mobilizing poor people of all backgrounds, organizing ... from Alabama to Appalachia,'' Bishop Barber says. He says that when campaign workers have told white coal miners in Kentucky, for instance, that the same politicians who are supporting voter suppression laws have also voted against legislation that would raise wages, or allow them to unionize, invariably, in room after room, people see we're being played against each other.''\n\nIn June, he says, a virtual Moral March on Washington'' was attended by over 3 million people of every race, creed and color.''\n\nThat is meaningful, he says.\n\nIf Black and white people get together,'' Barber says, it's a new day.''\n\nContributing: Jayme Fraser
Doug Emhoff was the dutiful political spouse when wife Kamala Harris was seeking the Democratic nomination. He plans on playing much the same role when she takes the oath of office as vice president Wednesday.\n\nEmhoff, a 56-year-old entertainment lawyer at international firm DLA Piper, has quit his law practice to avoid a conflict of interest. And by leaving corporate America – where the careers of white men like him often take priority – to take on the duties of second gentleman, he's flipping gender norms at a level the nation has never before seen. What's more, he'll be playing a supporting role to the nation's first Black and South Asian woman vice president.\n\nThis gives us a model, and it is a fabulous model, Ella L.J. Bell Smith, a professor of business administration at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, told USA TODAY.\n\nMr. Harris, she said, referring to Emhoff, is totally comfortable stepping back so his wife can show her brilliance, grace, grit and power because he wants her to succeed.\n\nJoe Biden pledges to address pay:'Black and Latino unemployment gap remains too large'\n\nCostco curbside pickup:Could the service expand to more locations?\n\nAs such, he could set a powerful example for workplaces and executive suites across America, says Michael Useem, director of the Wharton Center for Leadership and Change Management at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHis position is going to be extremely visible and his behavior is going to send a message, Useem said.\n\nEmhoff seems to have heeded the advice President-elect Joe Biden gave him during the first joint appearance with Harris as his running mate: Doug, you're going to have to learn what it means to be a barrier-breaker yourself.\n\nThe second gentleman is not the only White House spouse making history: New first lady Jill Biden has said she plans to continue teaching at a community college after her husband is sworn in as the 46th president, just as she did during his eight years as vice president.\n\nBoth are making history at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has set back the careers of working mothers.\n\nAccording to the National Women's Law Center, roughly 156,000 women exited the labor force in December while men gained 16,000jobs, meaning all of the jobs lost were held by women. By that point, therewere nearly 2.1 million fewer women in the labor force than there were in February 2020, just before the pandemic started.\n\nWomen who remained employed were more than three times as likely as their male partners to be handling the bulk of household and child care duties, according to a report by LeanIn.org that looked at over 40,000 workers.\n\nParticularly at a time when Americans are having really difficult discussions about a division of ... chores, of child care duties in their home because of the pandemic, I think this example is so important, said Andy Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement company which helps with job searches, executive coaching and corporate restructuring.\n\nHarris and Emhoff will also be a high-profile example of a relationship dynamic that is more typical than some may realize.\n\nThere are so many couples where the woman is the breadwinner today, but you don't see it in public life that often, particularly in our political life, Challenger said. Seeing that day in and day out over the next four years or more, it's just going to normalize that version of a relationship.''\n\nEmhoff and Harris met on a blind date in 2013 after being set up by a friend and married the following year. Harris became Momala to his two adult children, Cole and Ella from his first marriage.\n\nSo what will the country's first-ever second gentleman focus on during his time in Washington?\n\nEveryone's got an opinion on this, which is nice to hear, Emhoff said during a September fundraiser. Which means people are actually excited about the prospect of someone like me in this role – and I get that.\n\nMyPillow CEO:Kohl's and Bed Bath & Beyond to stop selling his brand\n\nPossible merger?:Office Depot rejects Staples acquisition offer but would consider merger of retail operations\n\nDuring the fundraiser, Emhoff expressed interest in using his platform to expand access to justice.\n\nHe recalled being shocked, as a young lawyer going to Los Angeles' Superior Court, by all the people lining the halls in need of legal help.\n\nJust tugging at my – at that time, double-breasted jacket – to say, 'Help. Help,'  he said. It was just so impactful.\n\nBut his main focus seems to be that of second gentleman.\n\nJust before the election, when asked by a 9-year-old in Fatherly's online Ask a Grown-up session what he would do if Biden and Harris won, Emhoff replied: Well, first I'd say 'Yay!' And then I'm just gonna do what I always do, Atticus. I'm going to support her because it's really important for men and even young boys to support the strong and wonderful women in their lives, and I'm going to do that, and I hope you do that, too.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe
Paola Boivin\n\nazcentral sports\n\nIt is hard to take your eyes off John Peterson's wedding video. The tuxedoed golfer performs a solo dance that is half Charleston, half magician trying to bust out of a straitjacket. He cradles a Whataburger bag, french fry dangling from his mouth.\n\nIt is a portrait of a man who oozes confidence.\n\nIt is what made his comments after shooting a 5-under 66 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open on Thursday a bit surprising.\n\nIn my opinion, I have severely underachieved, and I think a lot of people that are around the PGA Tour who have been here for a while would agree with me, he said.\n\nMORE:Ex-Sun Devil wears 'Rahmbo' Pat Tillman jersey\n\nThis is not a sport that often reveals such public ego dismantling. False bravado? Check. Self-reflection? Sure. But not such brutal honesty.\n\nI just kind of treaded water, he said.\n\nIs this the year where it all clicks for the 27-year-old from Fort Worth, Texas? His performance Thursday, which included four birdies on the TPC Stadium Course back nine, left him in a tie for third.\n\nHe missed three of five cuts this season coming into the tournament, but his Dec. 30 marriage and subsequent honeymoon slowed his preparation, he said. He hopes the responsibility of having a wife, two dogs and a mortgage will shift his focus.\n\nMORE: Phoenix Open section | Leaderboard | Friday tee times\n\nHe showed promise in 2015, his second pro season, with seven top-25 finishes, but missed most of 2016 recovering from hand surgery.\n\nHis recent struggles have had to do with more than an injury.\n\nI guess I just let college carry over into my professional career, honestly, he said. That's what I did. I didn't care if I missed a cut. I didn't care if I hit a bad shot. It didn't bother me.\n\nBut it's starting to bother me more now, and I'm putting in a lot more work, much like I did in school. It's starting to pay off.\n\nIt can be hard to reconcile the game with the career, especially early on. Social media has provided a timeline of Peterson's zest for life.\n\nBefore the crazy wedding dance there was a flip off a giant cliff during his bachelor party in Cabo, Mexico, that ended with a less-than-graceful flop on his left side.\n\nA year earlier, on a Sunday at the CIMB Classic, he stepped to the first tee in last place and pulled a Happy Gilmore, which is basically walking to the tee and smacking the ball, no pause, no practice swing.\n\nMany thought he would be fined, but the PGA proved to have a sense of humor, which is a good thing because Peterson mused on Twitter he was prepared to start a GoFundMe account.\n\nHis zaniness is fun for the game and its fans but probably not for advancing his career.\n\nNot only was being married a wake-up call, but so, too, was his injury.\n\nI started missing (golf), and I really didn't think I would, he said. But after three, four months on the couch, I said, 'You know, when I get back out there, I'm going to give it a go. I'm going to work like it's my job again and stop being a such a mediocre player out there.' \n\n• Phoenix Open fan guide | Bird's Nest concert guide | Transportation tips\n\nThe recent work is paying off. He drove out to Scottsdale on Saturday so he could grind until the tournament started.\n\nHe started strong with four birdies on his first eight holes including No. 16, which is the ultimate adrenaline rush, and concluded with a bogey-free round.\n\nIt was a heck of an opening-day performance for a guy playing in this tournament for only the second time.\n\nIt's a tricky line he is trying to walk, taking the sport more seriously while keeping his personality a part of it.\n\nLast year, Jason Day lamented to reporters how difficult the dance can be.\n\nYou go from a junior, an amateur, playing for toasters, he said. You're really playing for nothing other than pride and toasters. And you're playing for so much fun.\n\nYou're always having fun and you're playing to win, because there's no money involved. But once you turn professional, everything is based on results. You get nit‑picked in the media. Stats are always up saying he doesn't drive it straight enough or hit enough greens, or whatever it is. Then you have to perform because if you don't perform, then you're off the Tour.\n\nOdds are good Peterson won't change who he is. He hunts for deer in the fall. He is not afraid to share his often entertaining opinions on social media. When Johnny Manziel was benched by the Cleveland Browns in 2015 after video surfaced of him partying, Peterson tweeted, Hey @JManziel2, keep your head up. If the PGA tour monitored me on my off weeks, I'd be digging ditches.\n\nHe has had social media fun this week, observing there were parking lot and practice range signs for Carl Pettersson, a more experienced and accomplished player from Sweden with five wins on the Tour, but none for him.\n\nOf course, when someone suggested he steal the parking spot of a player he didn't like, he responded that he did and had parked in Pat Perez's spot\n\nPerfect, Perez tweeted. The feeling couldn't be more mutual.\n\nThis sport can be fun.

Jane Onyanga-Omara\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nA video released Wednesday appears to show some of the Nigerian schoolgirls who were kidnapped by the Boko Haram militant group two years ago alive.\n\nThe video, obtained by CNN, was sent to negotiators by the Islamist militants as proof that the girls were alive, according to the broadcaster.\n\nCNN showed the video, which is believed to have been made in December, to Rifkatu Ayuba, whose 17-year-old daughter Saratu was among those taken.\n\nMy Saratu! she cried. I felt like removing her from the screen, she added. If I could, I would have removed her from the screen.\n\nNigerian Information Minister Lai Mohammed told CNN the government was reviewing the video.\n\nWorld marks one year since Nigerian girls' abduction\n\nBoko Haram kidnapped 276 girls from their school in Chibok, northeastern Nigeria, on the night of April 14, 2014. A number later escaped the militants, but 219 remain missing, prompting the launch of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign, which captured the world's attention.\n\nAmnesty International said its activists were joining demonstrations in the Nigerian capital of Abuja on Thursday to call for the return of the girls, and thousands of other people abducted by Boko Haram. Last week, the Nigerian military said its soldiers rescued 11,595 civilians from the militants since Feb. 26.\n\nFew of us can begin to comprehend the suffering of parents who have not seen their daughters for two years, said M.K. Ibrahim, director of Amnesty International Nigeria.\n\nIn addition to the Chibok schoolgirls, today we also remember all those abducted, killed and displaced. Two years on, the Chibok girls have come to symbolize all the civilians whose lives have been devastated by Boko Haram.\n\nIbrahim called on the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to do more to bring back the girls, protect civilians in northeastern Nigeria and ensure that children in the region can go to school.\n\nThose guilty of inflicting this unspeakable suffering must be brought to justice, once and for all, he said.\n\nBoko Haram, whose attacks on schools have forced thousands out of education, loosely translates as Western education is forbidden in the Hausa language that is spoken by millions of people in Nigeria and neighboring Niger.
Katrina Trinko\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nPrince Harry and Duchess Meghan Markle's decision to step down as senior royals isn't just roiling the House of Windsor. It's also shaking up Americans long accustomed to seeing becoming a princess as a fairy tale ending.\n\nSure, the British royals haven't, strictly speaking, been relevant to Americans' lives since 1783, but we've long had a fascination with them. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, American heiresses married cash-strapped British nobles. In the past century, we chatted about Wallis Simpson, a Baltimore-raised socialite whose love affair with the British king led to a constitutional crisis. We watched Princess Diana twirl with John Travolta in the Reagan White House, and mourned the early death of a princess who seemed to care so much for the vulnerable.\n\nAnd now we're facing the revelation that this American princess wants out.\n\nLook, I'm as guilty as the next American woman: Like an estimated 29 million Americans in 2018, I watched the wedding of Meghan and Harry — a beautiful ceremony that poignantly referenced her African American heritage. As a teen, I viewed Princess Diaries, the 2001 Julie Andrews-Anne Hathaway hit movie that told the tale of an ordinary San Francisco high schooler finding out she was a princess, and had a crush on Prince William. Even now, I curl up with Hallmark Christmas movies featuring romances with random European princes.\n\nBut maybe it's time to move on.\n\nLet's reassess our princess fixation\n\nNow that I'm an adult with a career, I can empathize with Meghan and Harry's frustration, as they suggested on their Sussex Royal site, that they can't earn their own money — or have financial independence. And while I think their son, Archie, is adorable, I can understand their desire to have privacy.\n\nOf course, we're still not clear about exactly how much financial independence (For instance, will the couple now pay rent or give up their United Kingdom home, which was renovated at British taxpayer expense?) and privacy Meghan and Harry will ultimately possess. Negotiations appear to be ongoing.\n\nRegardless of the final arrangements, Meghan's thanks, but no thanks princess rejection should cause us to reexamine our cultural fixation with princesses — no matter what heartstrings Disney has so effectively yanked.\n\nAfter all, with all the options available to women in 2020, does it really sound so fun to spend a lifetime shaking hands and smiling politely for photos? Yes, royalty can — and in many cases, does — promote charitable causes and advance international goodwill. But you don't need to be royalty to do either of those things.\n\nA royal wedding outlier:Enjoy it. Harry and Meghan seem nice, but I have better things to do.\n\nA princess fantasy may seem harmless. But while our dreams are not real, exactly, they are not entirely fake, either. What we want and desire shape us, influence our choices, and in doing so, change us. What we move toward determines, in a very real way, who we are.\n\nOf course, most of us never tried to engineer a meeting with a prince, or expected to set foot in Buckingham Palace as anything but a tourist. But one look at the average cost of a wedding in the United States — $38,700, according to WeddingWire — and it's fair to speculate our royal wedding obsession could be bleeding into real life, at least slightly.\n\nMegxit rewrites the happy ending\n\nMaybe we're sometimes picking the guy who looks more like a Prince Charming than the one who is actually most likely to make us happy. Maybe we're more fixated on what an engagement ring, or wedding, looks like than the financial future for our families. Maybe we think that being a celebrity — or at least racking up more Instagram likes than anyone else in our social circle — is what would finally make us happy.\n\nAnd maybe sometimes we're missing out on the very real joys of our own lives because we're stuck on the what-if.\n\nI told you so:Prince Charles at 70 finally getting the attention and respect he deserves\n\nAt the same time, I have no doubt that for some women, royalty obsession is just a socially acceptable way of expressing certain desires that may be looked down upon in our modern world: wanting to be cherished by a good guy, having a beautiful family and being celebrated for one's role as a wife and a mother.\n\nRather than force women to pretend they love the idea of a tiara, what if we pointed out that true feminism is celebrating women's desires and choices, not bullying any woman who prioritizes marriage and kids over becoming the next whiz scientist or engineer? At the same time, of course, we should continue to work toward helping both women and men who want careers and families to have options to be able to do both.\n\nLook, I'm not a total Grinch: I think the hordes of Frozen-obsessed toddlers, tripping over their long princess gowns, are adorable. But as the rest of us put away childish things, we might reflect a little on #Megxit, and consider whether the happiest ending of all just might be not marrying a prince.\n\nKatrina Trinko, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is editor-in-chief of The Daily Signal.

William N. Eskridge Jr.\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nAs Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said, accountability for the Jan. 6 invasion of the Capitol to disrupt Congress's Electoral College count rests not only with President Donald Trump, but also with those who object(ed) to the results of a legitimate, democratic election. Romney was referring to, among others, Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), both alumni of my Legislation classes at Yale and Harvard Law Schools.\n\nThe Ivy Leaguers irresponsibly magnified the president's baseless claims of widespread voter fraud — but they tried to deepen that bogus indictment by pandering to those who believe the election that just occurred, quote, was rigged, as Cruz put it, and with smart-sounding legal arguments criticizing judges and the legal process. They know the process worked normally because I taught them how the process works. Neither had a single constitutional or statutory point that had not been examined and rejected by a bipartisan bevy of judges and administrators.\n\nPennsylvania law under siege\n\nThe keystone state was Pennsylvania, where Hawley and Cruz were two of seven senators (along with 138 House members) voting to sustain objections to the lawfully chosen Electors. The congressional objectors largely avoided claims of fraud. Instead, they maintained that the rules followed in the Pennsylvania election were legally invalid. Their arguments disrespected the legal process established by the Constitution and statutes and interpreted responsibly by judges.\n\nSen. Hawley maintained that Congress was the proper forum for registering concerns about whether the Pennsylvania legislature's 2019 law expanding mail-in voting violated the state constitution. Adopted by the GOP-dominated legislature, the law had never been challenged until after the 2020 election.\n\nTrump's Twitter ban:Trump can't be silenced, even by Facebook and Twitter, but we can prevent another Trump\n\nOn Nov. 28, 2020, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Kelly v. Commonwealth that the post-election challenge came too late. Permitting the challenge would disenfranchise millions of voters who had relied on the law, a point also made by Trump-appointed Judge Stephanos Bibas in a related federal lawsuit. At no point in American history has a state or federal appellate court retroactively disenfranchised a state's electorate in a presidential election for such a reason.\n\nThe Constitution does not vest Congress with authority to adjudicate state elections for compliance with state law. Article I, section 4 vests state legislatures with authority to prescribe the Times, Places and Manner for conducting congressional elections, with Congress only empowered to regulate by passing statutes. Article II, section 1 says that presidential electors in in each state are chosen in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, not as Congress would have preferred.\n\nPhony legitimacy to fraud claims\n\nRepublican House members picked up where Hawley's argument collapsed: They claimed that the Pennsylvania secretary of State and Supreme Court had usurp(ed), as Rep. Fred Keller (R-Pa.) put it, the role of the legislature when they interpreted the 2019 law to allow three days for mail-in ballots to arrive.\n\nIn Pennsylvania Democratic Party v. Boockvar, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court applied the statutory timetable for mail-in ballots to a COVID-saturated environment and in light of the Post Office's announcement that mail deliveries would be delayed. Following legislatively enacted canons of statutory interpretation, including an admonition that courts should apply statutes to avoid constitutional problems, the Court found a legislative intent to allow flexibility under emergency circumstances.\n\nImpeach and convict:Trump doesn't deserve post-presidential benefits. Remove him and ensure he won't get them.\n\nAs my former students Cruz and Hawley know, statutory interpretation following the established rules is not an example of usurpation. Led by Chief Justice John Roberts, for whom Hawley clerked, the U.S. Supreme Court twice rebuffed Republicans in Boockvar.\n\nWhat point was served by the congressional rehash of frequently litigated and universally unsuccessful legal objections to Pennsylvania's process? Sens. Hawley and Cruz made virtually no constitutional or statutory arguments that had not been rejected by Republican as well as Democratic judges. Neither they nor the House objectors revealed any literacy in the state constitution or its statutory interpretation code. Their press releases and speeches lent phony legitimacy to the president's incendiary claims — claims that resulted in bombs near Capitol Hill and a historic insurrection that may be connected to at least five deaths.\n\nTheir bad behavior set a bad precedent for Congress, which has never second-guessed state electoral procedures so thoroughly vetted by the judicial process.\n\nHenceforth, sore losers in future elections may feel free to relitigate election-year lawsuits. Congress's presidential vote-counting, which was once a ritual marking the peaceful transition of authority, might become another trench in hyperpartisan warfare or, worse, a quadrennial opportunity to delegitimize our democracy.\n\nWilliam N.

FKA Twigs refused to answer it, the dangerous question we can't seem to stop asking survivors of domestic violence: Why didn't you leave?\n\nWhen Gayle King posed the question during a CBS interview with Twigs on Thursday, her first television interview since filing a lawsuit against ex-boyfriend Shia LaBeouf alleging severe abuse, it seemed she knew it was wrong, though it ultimately did not stop her: I often wonder if it's even appropriate to ask, King said.\n\nDomestic violence experts say not only is the question inappropriate, it harms survivors by shifting attention away from their abusers. Experts say many survivors don't leave when the abuse begins, and people are often quick to judge them which is a factor in why many survivors stay silent.\n\nWhen we ask, 'why didn't you leave?' we're making the victim responsible for the harm that's been done to them, said Ruth Glenn, president of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.\n\nIn the interview, Twigs (born Tahliah Debrett Barnett) attempts to shift focus back to LaBeouf.\n\nFKA Twigs:Details physical, emotional abuse allegations against Shia LaBeouf\n\nI think we have to stop asking that question, she told King. The question should really be to the abuser: 'Why are you holding someone hostage with abuse?' People say it can't have been that bad, because else you would've left. But it's like, no, it's because it was that bad, I couldn't leave.\n\nDomestic violence is a pervasive social problem that cuts across race, age, income, sexual orientation, religion and gender — in terms of both victims and perpetrators. One in 3 women has experienced intimate partner violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMental health issues often emerge after repeated, escalating, abuses. Victims of emotional abuse are at higher risk for developing mental health disorders, including depression and PTSD.\n\nThis question so often comes from a place of concern, as FKA twigs pointed out in the interview with Gayle King, but it so often makes survivors feel like it is their responsibility to make the abuse stop, said Deborah Vagins, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. Abuse is an intentional pattern of controlling behavior, and the only person who can make the abuse stop is the person responsible for choosing to abuse in the first place.\n\nWhy we can't stop asking the question\n\nExperts say the question keeps coming up because culturally we do not understand domestic violence. We ask because we are curious, and because most perpetrators don't admit to abuse, we can't ask them why they harmed.\n\nAbusers don't come forward and say, 'I abused my partner.' We don't have the opportunities to question them, Glenn said. The only person we have to question is the person who has been harmed, and so often we end up ... blaming the victim. We can't help ourselves and that's really unfortunate.\n\nExperts said King could have asked the question differently. Instead of saying why didn't you leave, something more productive could have been, Can you explain to our audience the tactics perpetrators use that make it is so difficult to get out of an abusive relationship?\n\nReps for King and CBS did not immediately return USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\nWhy survivors stay\n\nThe reasons women choose to stay with an abusive partner are complex, domestic violence advocates say, such as fearing for their lives or believing the abuser will go back to the way things were. Domestic violence advocates also say abuse often does not begin right away.\n\nCOVID-19:Violence against women surges\n\nDomestic violence:'Code of silence' contributes to prevalence across races, classes\n\nIn her allegations against LaBeouf, twigs described a switch from an intense honeymoon period to something setting her partner off, which would then prompt LaBeouf to start an argument with me, berate me for hours, make me feel like the worst person ever, she said.\n\nIn 2018, actress and activist Evan Rachel Wood shared her experience with domestic violence, saying it was toxic mental, physical and sexual abuse which started slow but escalated over time.\n\nAbusers are skilled at normalizing abuse, and often use gaslighting – manipulating a victim to make them question their reality – to convince victims the abuse isn't that bad, or that they are actually the ones provoking it.\n\nSome survivors rely on their abuser for income, housing, healthcare, and other essentials. Many worry they aren't prepared to leave. Some hold out hope the abuse may eventually stop. No one, experts say, gets into a relationship to be harmed.\n\nMany of us know what it's like to be in a relationship we thought was healthy, only to later on ask ourselves, 'why did I stay for so long?' she said.\n\nDomestic violence myths:Time to debunk them\n\n#MeToo:Should survivors of domestic violence get their own movement?\n\nThe danger in leaving\n\nExperts say domestic abuse is about power. When a survivor leaves an abusive relationship, the perpetrator loses power, which can cause them to retaliate in even more violent ways. When a survivor does leave, many of them fear for their lives and the lives of their children and loved ones.\n\nIn 1992, months after Glenn left her abusive husband after 13 years of marriage, he tracked her down and shot her three times.\n\nLeaving often does not cause the abuse to stop. In fact, many abusive partners choose to escalate their abusive behaviors in response to what they perceive as a loss of power and control, Vagins said. For many survivors, leaving is not a safe or reasonable option, and in fact, can often be increasingly dangerous.\n\nAccording to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, 72% of murder-suicides involve an intimate partner and 94% of the victims are female.\n\nTwigs said she never thought something like this would happen to me. Part of the reason she said she's speaking out is to show that even someone like herself – successful, financially independent – can become the victim of abuse.\n\nMy second worst nightmare is being forced to share with the world that i am a survivor of domestic violence, Twigs wrote on Instagram in December. My first worst nightmare is not telling anyone and knowing that i could have helped even just one person by sharing my story.\n\nIf you are a victim of domestic violence, The National Domestic Violence Hotline allows you to speak confidentially with trained advocates online or by the phone, which they recommend for those who think their online activity is being monitored by their abuser (800-799-7233). They can help survivors develop a plan to achieve safety for themselves and their children.
On Dec. 31, 1967, the Green Bay Packers played the Dallas Cowboys. It was a game so cold it was dubbed the Ice Bowl as temperatures dropped to 13 degrees below zero as the two teams fought for the NFL championship and the right to play in Super Bowl II.\n\nStanding on the sidelines, wearing tennis shoes, jackets, skirts and tights were the Golden Girls — the Green Bay Packers cheerleaders.\n\nFrostbitten faces, frostbitten toes! They have heaters on the sidelines for the players, and we were able to use those heaters to warm up a bit, Dana Berns, a Golden Girl in the 1960s, said. We never considered not being on the field.\n\nMary Jane Sorgel, the team's founder, wanted to pull her girls off the sidelines and send them home. They wouldn't hear of it.\n\nI tried to get the girls off the field sooner, because it was getting really bad. The band director said if anybody wants to go, they could, but they were just so into the game, Sorgel said.\n\nFrostbitten faces, frostbitten toes! They have heaters on the sidelines for the players, and we were able to use those heaters to warm up a bit. Dana Berns\n\nThe Packers won 21-17, and went to win the Super Bowl in Miami. The Golden Girls' season was over after the Ice Bowl though. As a group of mostly high school-aged girls, they didn't travel with the team.\n\nSorgel first started with the Packers as a baton twirler with the band. She co-hosted The Curly Lambeau Show. When Lambeau, the Packers' founder, gave her an engagement ring, she couldn't say yes. He was thrice-divorced, and she said her religion wouldn't allow the marriage.\n\nHe said, 'Look. We'll wait until we can straighten this out. Keep the ring I gave you.' That's what I did, Sorgel said.\n\nHe was mowing the lawn at her parents' home in Sturgeon Bay, Wis., when he had a heart attack and died in her father's arms in 1965.\n\nHe just fell over into my dad's arms. It was the saddest day of my life, Sorgel said. I ran out and tried to give him as much help as I could. My mom called the ambulance and she called the doctor. The doctor was a friend of mine and he said, 'There's no hope.'\n\nIt was Vince Lombardi, the man who led the Packers back to winning, who first envisioned a group of cheerleaders for the sidelines at Lambeau Field. He asked Sorgel to get a group of girls together. In 1961, the Golden Girls were born.\n\nFrom the beginning, Lombardi and his wife Marie had strong opinions on what the Golden Girls. He wanted the Golden Girls to be wholesome and represent the team as ladies. He weighed in on the women's costumes and sometimes gave them notes on performances.\n\nHe was very strict, and he didn't like the girls with the little outfits that are just too racy. He liked good, wholesome girls. I had rules for my girls to make sure they would meet whatever he wanted. It worked, Sorgel said.\n\nThe Golden Girls were not allowed to smoke in uniform and they were not to talk to the players.\n\nMany of the traditions they started continue at Lambeau Field until today. Lombardi worried when fans weren't cheering enough. He gave Sorgel a microphone and asked her and the cheerleaders to come up with a chant the crowd could quickly learn and repeat. If you've watched a Packers game on television — or been around a group of Packers fans anywhere in the world — you've heard it.\n\nGO! PACK! GO!\n\nEvery time I hear it, I remember that! I'm so proud. Sorgel said.\n\nThe women who cheer NFL teams today are quite different from the Golden Girls. They're older, and usually have more of a dance background than cheerleading. The Packers no longer have the Golden Girls. Instead, they are cheered on by collegiate squads from nearby St. Norbert and UW-Green Bay.\n\nIf people realized how much time and effort goes into preparing for the routines that we did, and they're currently doing now, they would be quite surprised. The effort and the energy that is involved and the dedication, Berns said. Every time I see these people on the sidelines, and they get a little blurb or a flash on the camera on the sidelines, I think, 'Great!' That's basically what you receive as appreciation for what you're doing.\n\nBerns and teammate Michele Ozkan both said being a Golden Girl gave them a wide array of opportunities. Ozkan took over Sorgel's studio when she retired from teaching baton twirling, where she first learned of her love of working with children. Now, she teaches kindergarten.\n\nFor Berns, dancing and cheerleading helped her stay active in a time before Title IX and school-sponsored sports teams for girls. She is now a physical education teacher at a parochial school in Wisconsin.\n\nWe have a lot of history, more so than just on the field. It's opened so many doors for us. It's fun to have in your back pocket, especially as I'm getting older. It's fun to go back and think about that time on the field with the Packers, Berns said.\n\nIn 2007, the Packers added a permanent installation commemorating the Golden Girls to the Packers Hall of Fame. 67 of the Golden Girls returned to Green Bay for the night the installation was unveiled. Both Berns and Ozkan brought their adult sons.\n\nMy sons didn't believe I was a cheerleader! Ozkan said. Finally, when we went to the Hall of Fame, and he saw the pictures, he believed me.\n\nMy sons didn't believe I was a cheerleader! Finally, when we went to the Hall of Fame, and he saw the pictures, he believed me. Michele Ozkan\n\nThey all are still devoted to the Packers. Sorgel does shows at senior centers near Green Bay, teaching cheers and showing her memorabilia. When the Packers make it deep into the playoffs — this season didn't make the cut — Berns does a pep rally with her students.\n\nWhat still sticks out in Ozkan's mind is how the Packers united people at a time when the country was severely divided. She cheered with Green Bay from 1967-71.\n\nThere was the Vietnam War, and people were protesting against it, and people for it. We were so divided, but on Sunday afternoons, we were all together, she said. We were all Packers fans.
Elysa Gardner\n\n@elysagardner, USA TODAY\n\nWhen Michael Jackson released Off the Wall in 1979, 19 days shy of his 21st birthday, he was already a showbiz veteran. Having risen to fame as a preternaturally gifted child in the Jackson 5, he saw his solo projects shaped largely by songwriters and producers appointed by the group's label, Motown Records.\n\nOff the Wall — the subject of a new Spike Lee documentary — introduced Michael Jackson, at this point signed to Epic, as a creatively autonomous artist whose charisma could attract wide audiences. With the war between rock and disco still raging, dance-friendly classics Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough and Rock With You reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100.\n\nSpike Lee: Lack of Hollywood diversity is 'ridiculous'\n\nSpike Lee remembers first hearing Don't Stop as a summer intern at Columbia Pictures. That was the song, everywhere, says Lee, who would later direct videos for Jackson's 1996 single They Don't Care About Us and 2009's posthumous This Is It.\n\nMichael Jackson's Journey From Motown to 'Off the Wall,' set to premiere Sunday at Sundance Film Festival and Feb. 5 on Showtime, marks the second time Lee has turned his attention to the making of a Jackson album. With 2012's Bad 25, Lee commemorated the silver anniversary of the follow-up to Jackson's blockbuster Thriller.\n\nJust as Bad was informed by Jackson's yearning to outdo himself, Off the Wall was driven by a joyful sense of emancipation.\n\nThe synergy that developed between Jackson and producer Quincy Jones proved magical.\n\nIt was a marriage made in heaven, Lee says. They complemented each other's strengths.\n\nAdds veteran music journalist and author Alan Light, This incredibly layered sound they came up with, with these complicated but undeniable grooves that Quincy was constructing ... that were unlike anything people had heard before.\n\n11 times The Weeknd channeled Michael Jackson in his 'I Can't Feel My Face' video\n\nIn Lee's new documentary — also available in CD/DVD/Blu-ray packages with the reissued album, out Feb. 26 — latter-day stars and innovators such as Pharrell Williams, The Weeknd, Questlove, John Legend and ballet dancer Misty Copeland testify to Jackson's multifaceted performance skills and enduring influence. The archival footage includes admirers such as Gene Kelly and Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nMichael Jackson was a scholar of art, Lee says. He would study everyone.\n\nBut if Off the Wall heralded the student's arrival as an artist who would be emulated himself, Lee posits it also began a cycle of frustrated aspiration, rooted at least partly in race: Race is woven into everything in the United States of America. Did you not see the Academy Award nominations?\n\nSpike Lee, Jada Pinkett Smith to boycott this year's Oscars\n\nWhile the album won Jackson a Grammy Award for best R&B vocal performance (for Don't Stop), it was ignored in the major categories. After he got snubbed by the Grammys, he told his mother, 'I'm coming back next year,'  Lee says. When you see those dollar signs, it can influence what you're doing. An ultimately successful struggle to have his videos air on MTV (inhospitable to black artists in its early days) followed, as did darker and more personal challenges.\n\nBut Off the Wall arrived, as Lee puts it, before things started turning around — when you could still hear Michael Jackson's joy.
Eleven months after Major League Baseball told its players, fans and executives to scatter, they have returned to Florida and Arizona – tentatively hopeful, relieved there is any baseball at all, wisened by several months of living through pandemic protocols.\n\nSpring training has arrived, and while there is a bit less uncertainty than on March 12, 2020, when the novel coronavirus compelled MLB to shutter for four months, the league will convene at its 30 training camps for a spring like no other.\n\nPerhaps most regrettably, fans will be kept at a distance, reduced to around 20% capacity in most stadiums and discouraged, or barred, from congregating in groups as they otherwise would – on a sunny berm, around a friendly player signing autographs, at a lemonade or beer stand.\n\nThe game itself? It's always changing, particularly in Pandemic Season II. With that, a look at what to watch as pitchers and catchers trickle in, beginning Wednesday:\n\nCan't have too much pitching – really\n\nIn recent years, veteran players have lingered on the market well into March, even April. This year, if you're upright and your elbow's intact, you probably have a contract.\n\nThat's because teams are hyper-concerned about managing pitchers' workloads as they ramp up from no more than 13 starts or 84 innings pitched (Lance Lynn led the majors in both categories in 2020) over the 60-game season to the more standard 30-plus starts and, hopefully, 200 innings. What's more, younger pitchers who might make the big-league roster had no minor-league season, save for time spent at alternate training sites or instructional camps.\n\nMLB 2021:Record projections for the new season\n\nLIAM HENDRIKS: How baseball's best closer landed with White Sox\n\nA majority of teams will likely deploy a six-man rotation, the better to cut down on both starter and reliever workload. It's not the most freakish alignment – the six-man look is still standard in Japan – and can also dovetail with other, more progressive pitching alignments, such as the opener, piggybacked starters and other ways to creatively cover nine innings.\n\nThis year, the 26-man roster will have no restrictions on the number of pitchers carried, which means a deep and constant shuffle of pitchers. That's why starters like James Paxton (Mariners), Matt Shoemaker (Twins) and Rich Hill (Rays) all found homes in the hours before camps opened. Relievers Yusmeiro Petit and Sergio Romo (Athletics), Justin Wilson (Yankees), Brad Boxberger (Brewers), Blake Parker (Indians), Keone Kela (Padres), and Jake McGee (Giants) only now learned they're headed for Phoenix or Florida.\n\nAnd keep a locker ready for Taijuan Walker, Jake Odorizzi, Brett Anderson, Tony Watson, Shane Greene, Tyler Clippard and others. They may have their bags packed by the time you read this.\n\nHow will the new-look Dodgers mesh?\n\nThe naked eye can't quickly discern the differences between the Dodgers club that walked out of Globe Life Field in Arlington as World Series champs and the one that will assemble in Phoenix's Camelback Ranch this week.\n\nJustin Turner is back – but not after the Dodgers waited him out and retained him on a two-year deal, while he flirted with the Brewers and Mets.\n\nFranchise stalwarts Clayton Kershaw, Corey Seager, Kenley Jansen all return – yet face the specter that this could be their final year with the club.\n\nTrevor Bauer has checked in – as the game's highest-paid player in 2021 and the reigning NL Cy Young Award winner, but also the new guy in a rotation headed by Clayton Kershaw and Walker Buehler. Not to mention the return of David Price, who opted out of the 2020 season.\n\nJoc Pederson and Kiké Hernandez are gone – guys who never started every single day but left their mark on the franchise for nearly a decade, all the way to the end.\n\nIn their place, Edwin Rios, Zach McKinstry, Sheldon Neuse, Gavin Lux and perhaps D.J. Peters will aim to recreate the platoon magic that Pederson and Hernandez – who saved the season with a Game 7 NLCS homer – brought to the club.\n\nTo be certain, these are all first-world baseball problems – goodness, what are we to do with our seven potentially dominant starters?! – yet will also create interesting camp conditions.\n\nSubtle changes are usually good for championship clubs. The Dodgers are professional enough to handle them. Yet the balancing act of building upon the game's ultimate achievement while transitioning to a new era begins almost immediately.\n\nBig bucks for a superstar shortstop?\n\nA quintet of All-Star shortstops hitting the free-agent market in one winter is certainly an aberration. And if any of Seager, Francisco Lindor, Javy Baez, Carlos Correa or Trevor Story are to take themselves off the market, spring is the time to do it.\n\nTypically, pending free agents set an Opening Day (or shortly thereafter) deadline for contract negotiations. While all five have come this far that they might as well test the market, there's a chance at least one of them re-ups early.\n\nStart with Lindor. He indicated an interest in re-signing with the Mets after they acquired him in December, a point in time when new owner Steve Cohen was riding high. Alas, the $14 billion Man struck out on free-agent targets George Springer and Trevor Bauer while enduring the embarrassing resignation of GM Jared Porter after revelations of Porter's lewd harassment of a woman reporter.\n\nCohen suddenly has money to spend and goodwill to earn. Signing Lindor would help.\n\nCorrea has indicated a desire to return to the Houston Astros, while Story would seem a longshot to extend his marriage with the Colorado Rockies after the Nolan Arenado trade. Seager and Baez seem likeliest to play out the string.\n\nOne potential upside of signing early for any of them: Pocketing a large signing bonus now, in advance of any pandemic-related lost wages this year, or a labor-related industry shutdown in 2022.\n\nSpeaking of which…\n\nCan MLB and the union play nicely?\n\nIt's been a nice couple weeks of silence after the union passed on MLB's offer to delay the season, prompting the league to fire off a statement that made it appear pitchers and catchers reporting on time was a bad thing.\n\nAll this before whisper campaigns over collective bargaining talks begin.\n\nThe league's desire for expanded playoffs and the players' hope for a universal DH won't go away soon, though the latter's appeal has diminished now that free agency has largely wrapped up. That doesn't mean the sides won't discuss both matters all the way to April 1's Opening Day, even if it's likelier they punt the issues to next winter.\n\nThe public jousting over pandemic pay and protocols last year was an ugly, unplanned prelude to the main event – the CBA's expiration in December. Tranquility in 2021 is probably too much to ask for, but we can all hope.\n\nThat's what spring training is typically for, anyway.
FRANKFORT, Ky. — Choked and knocked unconscious, Jeanette McCue said a her husband's violent attack in 2016 left her bruised and battered with black eyes, a split lip and marks around her neck.\n\nMcCue of Springfield, Ky., figures she would have been killed except her husband was too drunk to aim when he fired a gun at her.\n\nThe attack that sent her then-husband to prison for 10 years was shocking enough, she said. But she was shocked further when she sought to divorce him and discovered that an obscure provision of Kentucky law required her to pay for his lawyer because as an inmate he had no means to hire an attorney.\n\nThis is crazy, McCue recalled telling her lawyer. You want me to pay for him so I can divorce him?\n\nOthers, including state Sen. Morgan McGarvey, a Louisville Democrat, think it's crazy too, and they are seeking to change the law in cases where a victim of domestic violence is seeking to divorce a spouse who has been convicted and incarcerated for the abuse.\n\n► Nov. 16:Senators make bipartisan breakthrough on gun background check bill\n\n► March 8:Russia decriminalized domestic violence. Problems came next\n\n► November 2015:LifeLock used to secretly track ex-wife's financial moves\n\nWe have to change this immediately so it doesn't happen to anyone else, said McGarvey, who last week filed Senate Bill 68, a simple, one-sentence measure that would require the state to pay the legal costs of the abuser in such divorce cases. This is the kind of problem we want to fix.\n\nThree Republican and two Democratic state senators are co-sponsoring the bill. One is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nCosts to the state would be minimal because such cases are infrequent, McGarvey said. But he said the change would be a tremendous help to victims of brutal attacks who must then pay for a state-appointed lawyer for their abuser.\n\nTo me that's not justice, he said.\n\nSherry Currens, executive director of the Kentucky Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said she was surprised to discover such a provision is in the law. She said her organization, which includes a network of domestic violence shelters across Kentucky, fully supports it.\n\nIt is just a travesty, Currens said. I'm really glad someone is taking the lead on this. Of course we will provide any assistance that we can.\n\nThe matter came to light through the work of Cassie Chambers with the Kentucky Equal Justice Center, who as a legal aid lawyer was appointed to help Jeanette McCue with her divorce from her ex-husband, Michael McCue. He pleaded guilty last year to charges related to the attack.\n\nJeanette McCue said she was left impoverished because her ex-husband cleaned out their bank account before he left Washington County while she was being treated in the emergency room for her injuries. He was later arrested hundreds of miles away.\n\n► July 2015:N.J. cop suspended for domestic abuse before ex-wife's slaying\n\n► December 2014:Domestic violence treatment method shows promise\n\nChambers said she helped Jeanette McCue file for divorce and then had to explain to her that, in such cases where the spouse is in prison, the court is required to appoint a lawyer for the inmate and that the person seeking the divorce must pay the costs.\n\nWhile the costs are limited by what the court deems reasonable — in Jeanette McCue's case, the bill was $160 — it seems unfair to victims, usually women, whose spouses have brutalized them and who often have lived under their control for many years, Chambers said.\n\nIt's like he was still in control, getting the court system to work for him and against her, Chambers said.\n\nFurther, for some impoverished women even a modest legal fee might be out of reach, causing them to give up on efforts to divorce an abusive spouse, she said.\n\nSome may go back to an abuser, she said. I think there's a lot of ways the courts put barriers in the way of poor people who just don't have access to resources.\n\nSituations such as Jeanette McCue's are unusual, but after Chambers came across two more such situations where she represented women who had suffered domestic violence and were seeking divorces from incarcerated spouses, she decided to write an opinion piece about the law requiring them to pay legal costs of their abusers.\n\nIt ran Jan. 2 in the Lexington (Ky.) Herald-Leader and caught the eye of McGarvey, who said he was shocked to learn of the provision and was unaware of it although he is a lawyer and has done some work in domestic-violence cases.\n\nI read it and couldn't believe it's in the system, he said.\n\n► September 2014:NFL sends mixed messages on domestic violence response\n\n► August 2014:Judge arrested for domestic violence seeks treatment\n\nIt wasn't immediately known how many states have similar laws.\n\nUntil 2016 when Virginia legislators passed a law requiring that state's judges to consider domestic violence and sexual assault convictions to determine spousal support, alimony generally was awarded on length of marriage and financial needs, according to the nonprofit domesticshelters.org. At least one battered wife had been forced to pay alimony to her convicted ex-husband before any action was taken.\n\nMcGarvey credits Chambers with bringing Kentucky's problem to light and Jeanette McCue for being willing to speak out about her experience.\n\n► June 2014:Tragedy highlights holes in supervised visits system\n\n► March 2013:Woman plays dead after beating to save her life\n\nShe and Cassie are the story here, the power of peoples' voices, he said.\n\nJeanette McCue, a nurse and single parent, said she has been willing to speak out about her experience as she rebuilds her life in hopes of helping others. Her divorce became final in April.\n\nJeanette McCue said she wants the public to understand that domestic violence can happen to anyone and she wants to make the system easier for spouses who have survived it and are seeking to divorce their abusers.\n\nDomestic violence is one of those things you don't like to admit to people, she said. If something I say can help someone else, I'd much rather help someone.\n\nFollow Deborah Yetter on Twitter: @d_yetter\n\nKentucky Senate Bill 68
Susan Page\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLisa Blunt Rochester's cramped congressional office in a back corner of the Longworth House Office Building doesn't exactly have a lived-in look yet. The walls are unadorned, the book shelves all but empty. She's still getting unpacked after her January swearing-in as Delaware's sole representative in the House.\n\nDelaware may boast that it is the First State — the first state of the original 13 to ratify the Constitution in 1787 — but only last November did it elect a woman to Congress for the first time, the 48th state to do so. (Now, only Mississippi and Vermont have never elected a woman to Congress.) Blunt Rochester, 55, also became the first African American elected to Congress from the state. She had worked in state government, including as Labor secretary.\n\nQuestions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: Race or gender: Which was the greater electoral hurdle for you?\n\nBlunt Rochester: I can't really answer that question because I'm not sure. I just know that at this time in our history it was such a good feeling for so many people across the state to accomplish this. ... It took all of us to make this happen – 230 years.\n\nQ: Even now, just 20% of Congress is female. Why is increasing that number so hard?\n\nBlunt Rochester: It's hard to run. When I talk to some of my colleagues, some of them had young children and any working parent questions, 'am I doing the right thing?' ... Number two, it's a financial decision. For a lot of people the finances of it, even raising money depends on your circle and your spheres of connections. ... And even for ourselves, sometimes if you're not given leadership opportunities or other exposure, you're not prepared for that moment when that moment comes.\n\nAnd there are other areas where you feel like there's a double standard.\n\nRead more:\n\nCapital Download - Conversations with Washington's biggest newsmakers\n\nDelaware congresswoman makes history — twice — with oath of office\n\nQ: Did you feel there was a double standard for you?\n\nBlunt Rochester: It was six of us in the (Democratic) primary ... One area where I really did push back was even (to get) media coverage, to say, 'I'm here.'\n\nIt was grass roots, every day, plug away. Every day I would get up and I would talk to people. I would even videotape myself (to see how I was doing). I was debating lawyers. I had never even been in a debate in my entire life.\n\nQ: In the videotape of your first debate, what did you say — I need to do that differently next time?\n\nBlunt Rochester: One of the biggest things was my own confidence in myself and realizing, I don't have to be somebody else. I am who I am. I already brought experiences with me, life experiences, so I don't have to debate like a lawyer. I just had to be honest, authentic and be myself. Once that sunk in, it shifted everything for me. It allowed me to really see and be with other Delawareans who had gone through so many of the things that I had gone though. ...\n\nI would put on my mirror: You can do it!\n\nRELATED:\n\nWomen's History Month: Women of color whose names you should know\n\nNo, equal rights for women aren't in the Constitution.

Tell us about it.\n\nBlunt Rochester: My sister has been doing research on our family history, and she actually found this document (now imprinted on the scarf). It is from Reconstruction. It was the ability for our great-grandfather three times back to be able to vote. But he couldn't write, so he signed this X. For my swearing-in, I carried this with me. Part of this was to remember how far we've come, that a former slave's great-great-granddaughter is now a congresswoman.\n\nQ: What made you think, 'I'm going to run for office'?\n\nBlunt Rochester: I actually started as an intern in a congressional office back in 1989 for our senator, Tom Carper. I was an intern and then a caseworker, and worked my way up to secretary of Labor (in Delaware). ... I ended up getting divorced after a 20-year marriage and then found love again. Quit my job, sold my house, moved to China for a while where my new husband was working.\n\nWe came back home to the States and he ended up rupturing his Achilles tendon, blood clots traveled to his heart and lungs, and he died (in 2014). Unexpected. 52 years old. And that changed everything for me. It changed my outlook on things. It made me question, why am I here? What is my purpose?\n\nIt was one day on auto-pilot going to a supermarket and seeing a dad and three kids in front of me, and the father had to put back a bunch of grapes because it was $9. That moment made me realize how blessed I was, but I saw a lot of other people were just kind of hurting and not living to the potential that we want to as a country. I also heard negativity, a lot of negative discourse in that campaign, that election, and I just felt that's not us. That's not America.\n\nI just decided, I'm going to run. Instead of sit back and complain, I'm going to step up.\n\nQ: I realize that Republicans control Congress, but do Democrats have an obligation to reach out and try to engage on an issue like health care?\n\nBlunt Rochester: As a freshman class, we have come together in a bipartisan way on many things. During our first orientation, we asked the staff to all leave the room so that we could understand and bond and see where we had common ground ... and we signed a pledge of civility.\n\nI spent my Valentine's Day with Republicans standing on the floor, giving two-minute speeches about the fact that we might not agree on everything, but let's agree to be civil. Let's agree to try to find common ground. In fact, we're hosting a bipartisan March Madness game tonight, because we're trying to find those opportunities to know each other as people. ...\n\nWe were right there this past year, running for office and hearing from people, the American people, that they just want to see things get done.\n\nQ: Did fellow Delawarian Joe Biden give you any advice?\n\nBlunt Rochester: I actually was fortunate to ride the train home with him the day of the swearing-in. It was the best train ride ever. I was sitting across from the vice president; his wife Jill was on the other side of him. Our senators Chris Coons and Tom Carper were there, and our governor. ...\n\nThis is Joe Biden's favorite Obama-Biden meme\n\nAnd I'm doing the Joe Biden Hybrid.\n\nQ: What's the Joe Biden Hybrid?\n\nBlunt Rochester: I'm actually taking the train (back and forth to Wilmington almost every day), which I do, but I also have a place to lay my head when we have late nights here.\n\nMeet more groundbreakers at women.usatoday.com
Oprah Winfrey on Tuesday announced her latest book club selection: An American Marriage by Tayari Jones.\n\nThe novel, published by Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, is intriguing, Winfrey said, making the announcement on CBS This Morning.\n\nIt's a love story that also has a huge layer of suspense, she continued, and it's also so current and so really now that I could not put it down and have already passed it on to lots of my friends.\n\nReview: New Oprah pick 'An American Marriage'\n\nIn An American Marriage, newlyweds Celestial and Roy, professional African-Americans who live in Atlanta, find their lives shattered when Roy is accused of a crime he didn't commit and is incarcerated.\n\nPeople magazine named the novel its Book of the Week (prior to the Oprah announcement) and said: Packed with brave questions about race and class, An American Marriage is the perfect book-club book – one the whole group will finish and discuss with conviction.\n\nAppearing on CBS This Morning, Jones, whose previous novels include Silver Sparrow and Leaving Atlanta, said she got the idea for the novel from watching a couple arguing in an Atlanta mall.\n\nI was trying to write a novel. I wanted to write a novel that was more timely, dealing with the issues of the day, but I couldn't find the people for the story, Jones told the morning show hosts. I went to the mall, and I saw a couple. They were obviously in love and in trouble.\n\nShe was so put together. He just looked like he had had a long day, perhaps even a long life even though they were the same age, she continued, adding that what inspired her story was the woman's comment. She said, 'Roy you know you wouldn't have waited on me for seven years.' And I was intrigued because I didn't know Roy, but I felt fairly confident that he wouldn't wait on her for seven years, but he said, 'What are you talking about? This wouldn't have happened to you in the first place.'\n\nThe last selection of Oprah's Book Club, announced in June 2017, was the novel Behold the Dreamers by Imbolo Mbue, which peaked at No. 17 on USA TODAY's Best-Selling Books list.\n\nIn 2016, Winfrey's anointment of Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad gave the novel a huge boost. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.\n\nWinfrey's original book club started in 1996 and regularly created No. 1 best sellers. Since ending her talk show and launching Oprah's Book Club 2.0 in 2012, Winfrey has made many fewer selections, sometimes only one a year.
Erin Jensen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhen the episode titled Queen for Two Days begins, we see Hannah in a car road trippin' with her madre, Loreen, to a place where they can connect with their innate goddess qualities at a retreat called Spring Queening. Can we just pause and say how much we love that name?\n\nLoreen needs to get away so she can contemplate if she really wants to divorce Hannah's out father, Tad. She's on the brink of 60 and not sure that she wants to spend the rest of her life alone. Though Hannah is not on board with the retreat, or its no cell phone policy, she is grateful to be away from Fran since things have been so tense lately. When Loreen offers to give Hannah some privacy so she can call her boyfriend, Hannah declines, though still acknowledges how sweet he is in true Hannah fashion. If we were in Hollywood, people would be like Tom Hanks is such a (bleep). It's Fran who's the nice guy.\n\nThis line is especially hilarious because yes, Tom Hanks is awesome, but also because his wife, Rita Wilson, plays Marnie's mom.\n\nBut Hannah's mom enjoys the line a lot less than we do, and it actually raises concerns for her. You are incapable of loving someone who is kind to you. she tells Hannah. Your father and I were no example. Hannah denies that Loreen and Tad's marriage had any negative effect on her whatsoever and they turn in for the evening.\n\nThe next day, when Hannah tries to sneak some time on her phone, a man sternly reminds her about the retreat's policy. Thankfully a female yoga instructor comes to Hannah's rescue. She encourages Hannah to just do what feels right at the retreat. She also calls Hannah luscious, which Hannah really seems to really be into.\n\nLater we see Hannah breaking it down in a dance class, which makes us think perhaps Hannah has changed her mind about the retreat.\n\nBut no. Hannah is back to her irritable self when someone in Loreen's clique starts talking about the six different types of yogurt offered at a breakfast buffet.\n\nWhen Hannah excuses herself, she meets the yoga teacher from before who offers to help Hannah relieve some stress by doing AcroYoga in a sauna. While in the air, Hannah slips and falls on top of the woman, and they kiss. While they're having fun, Loreen is listening to her new friends' horrifying accounts of the single life. When Loreen mentions that her husband is gay, a woman says that's sounds like a non-issue. And if that's what Loreen really wants, then fine. But 60 is young, and she deserves a lifetime of true happiness!\n\nBack in the sauna, Hannah realizes that she isn't actually into hooking up with the yoga teacher. When she and her mom go back to her room, Hannah tells her mom that she made a terrible decision, and Loreen reveals that she's going to stay with Tad. She paints a pretty bleak alternative of draining catheters for people she barely knows after a few good years of passion.\n\nAll right, I know it sounds sad to you, but I like our house, and your father's very nice, she says. And, he makes me laugh when he does that Chris Rock, and he plays Scrabble really well. These things count for a lot. And then she continues, If I had known 20 years ago... Oh, Loreen, there's still so much time to live!\n\nInstead of talking through the situation with her mom, Hannah brings the point of focus back to her. I think you guys really did (bleep) me up, she says.\n\nHannah, you honestly couldn't think of some CliffsNotes of an Oprah episode to insert right there?\n\nShoshanna on the other hand, seems to be making the most out of her situation--at least at first. She is now the Assistant Manager at a cat cafe in Tokyo, where her boyfriend, Yoshi, comes to dine during his lunch.\n\nTo Shosh's surprise, her former boss Abigail (Aidy Bryant) made the trek from America to visit. Shosh takes her all around Japan, including a spot where they can get fish pedicures. When they hook up with Yoshi for a meal, he lays out some rather surprising plans for him and Shosh. Soon, we will travel to Kamakura--that's my place, he says. And, Shoshanna can meet my grandmother. Then, we will lose our virginities to each other. Right, except Shosh isn't a virgin...\n\nWhen Yoshi excuses himself, Shosh begins to cry. I'm really sad, and I'm really (bleeping) lonely, she says. I'm so homesick, and I swear to God if one more person that I bump into bows and says, 'I'm sorry,' I'm gonna, like, (bleeping) cut somebody. She tells Abigail that she has to go home and leaves the restaurant.\n\nThings are on the up-and-up for Jessa and Adam. They've found their groove in the bedroom, and really seem to share a strong connection. That's great for them and all, but we still don't like this relationship. When Jessa mentions that her sister is in town, Adam says that he would love to meet her. Of course he would.\n\nOn their way to dinner with her sister, Jessa casually mentions that she and her sis have a number of sexual partners in common. She also tells Adam that if he wants to hook up with her sister, she won't care, but Adam is completely uncomfortable with this idea.\n\nAt dinner, Jessa asks her sister for money so she can go back to school and become a therapist. Apparently, Jessa's cash cow, her grandmother, cut her off, and she's not eligible for financial aid. Jessa's sister says she won't because Jessa doesn't follow through with anything. You can't expect me to sink my money into another whim, she says. Ouch!\n\nAdam leaps to Jessa's defense because they've been dating all of 2.5 seconds, and of course he would. He also offers to pay for Jessa's schooling since he's sitting on a pile of money that he doesn't need to do anything with. Sure, he's only living in New York City, right?\n\nDespite our feelings about Jessa and Adam, this episode did a really great job of setting up some big conflicts. When Hannah returns to her apartment where Fran happens to be cohabiting, will she tell him about her affair? Will they finally put an end to their relationship? We're also wondering if Shosh will soon break Yoshi's heart and make her way back to America. And, with Jessa and Adam becoming more serious, it seems like only a matter of time before Hannah is aware of their relationship.\n\nSee how things develop for these Girls Sunday at 10 p.m. ET on HBO.
Jennifer Lopez know why her very public relationships failed in the past and she isn't afraid to admit it.\n\nFor me, the relationship journey has been very up and down, she said in an interview with Harper's Bazaar. But it didn't have to do with anybody else but me — it was about me figuring out me.\n\nShe continued: Until you learn to love yourself, you can't completely love [someone else] in a way that is pure and true. Once you do that, you can have relationships that are based on love and respect, that are supportive and nourishing. There's an evolution there that had to happen for me. I feel like I'm in a better place now.\n\nThe actress and singer, 49, made her red carpet debut with former Yankees star Alex Rodriguez in May 2017 at the Met Gala and the two have been together since. Though engagement speculation pops up from time to time, Lopez says you won't be hearing wedding bells for a little while.\n\nI've got two amazing kids and a great boyfriend, she said. I don't have everything figured out, and everything isn't perfect. But I feel very proud that with all the things I've gone through in my personal life, I'm still optimistic and hopeful.\n\nLast month, she told USA TODAY she understands why her fans want to see her walk down the aisle.\n\nEveryone wants a fairy tale. They all want a romantic comedy, a happy ending. We all do, she said. But it's not a movie, even if you see us on Instagram or on the shows.\n\nMore:Jennifer Lopez totally gets the Alex Rodriguez marriage talk: 'Everyone wants a fairy tale'\n\nMore:Jennifer Lopez vows her 'Second Act' with career, kids and Alex Rodriguez will 'rock hard'\n\nLopez has two kids with ex Marc Anthony: 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. Prior to her 10 year marriage to Anthony, she was married to actor/choreographer Cris Judd for two years and Ojani Noa for one year -- so she's no stranger to her relationships facing public scrutiny.\n\nWe're happy. We're taking it day-by-day. And it's great, she added.

AP\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge has dismissed a $600 million antitrust lawsuit filed by former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling against the NBA and his wife Shelly Sterling.\n\nIn the Tuesday order, U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin said he was skeptical Sterling suffered any injury at all, let alone an antitrust injury by the sale of the team for $2 billion to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and called other parts of the lawsuit implausible.\n\nDonald Sterling, 81, had claimed in the lawsuit that he could have gotten more than that for the team but the circumstances of the sale markedly reduced the price.\n\nShelly Sterling's attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement that the dismissal puts a merciful end to his quixotic litigation campaign over the sale for the record-shattering price of $2 billion.\n\nO'Donnell added that, Ironically, Donald, in defeat, is the beneficiary of $2 billion, secured by Shelley in her courageous battle in doing the right thing to protect her family and ensure that her beloved team would be sold to a conscientious owner who would take the team to the next level of excellence.\n\nDonald Sterling's attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The NBA declined to comment.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling from the league for life in 2014 and fined him $2.5 million over recorded racist remarks that he made to a friend.\n\nThe dismissed lawsuit had also named Silver, his predecessor as commissioner David Stern, and two doctors who examined Donald Sterling and determined that he had symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, leading his wife to remove him from a family trust that owned the Clippers at the time.\n\nEarlier this month, Sterling and long-estranged wife Shelly decided to remain in their marriage of 60 years, backing out of a divorce he had filed for in August.
Brian Amaral and Katherine Gregg\n\nThe Providence Journal\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. – A West Warwick parish priest said he could have expressed himself more clearly when he said in a television interview that unlike abortion, pedophilia doesn't kill anyone.\n\nThe Rev. Richard Bucci of Sacred Heart Church said Tuesday that he's well aware that victims of sexual abuse suffer immensely. He knows about the toll of child sexual abuse, he said, because he has supported victims and because he was the first one to blow the whistle on an abusive priest.\n\nI should have made it clearer that I wasn't saying there was no suffering to the person who is abused physically, Father Bucci said Tuesday. Especially a child who puts their trust in faith, whether it be a priest, a rabbi, an uncle, a parent. That's absolute.\n\nThe outspoken Bucci has made multiple rounds of headlines since he barred Rhode Island lawmakers who voted to codify abortion rights in the state from receiving Communion. Bucci said in a letter that they were also barred from acting as witnesses to marriage, godparents, or lectors at weddings, funerals or any other church function.\n\nFather Bucci issued the flier to his parishioners last Sunday, and mailed them to the state legislators who voted for the law. The Roman Catholic Diocese did not explicitly condemn the flier, which Father Bucci also mailed to the homes of several legislators.\n\nIn an interview on Sunday with WJAR-TV, Bucci said: We're not talking about any other moral issue, where some may make a comparison between pedophilia and abortion. Well, pedophilia doesn't kill anyone, and this does.\n\nBut Bucci said he did not mean to suggest that pedophilia was not a grave offense against children. He also acknowledged Tuesday that sexual abuse of children can be fatal: He knows of one victim personally who died by suicide after suffering abuse, he said.\n\nIt kills the spirit, it kills childhood, Bucci said. I was focusing on the fact that there is no future at all for an unborn child who is aborted, whereas a child who is molested, with a great deal of effort and prayer and therapy and medicine, can at least lead a life that can accomplish things.\n\n'The tongue is a fire'::Southern Baptist church fractures over secrets and spiritual abuse\n\nBucci said he was the first person to report the Rev. William O'Connell to the state police when they served together as priests in Bristol in the early 1980s. He did so anonymously, he said, but nothing was done about it. O'Connell, now dead, was eventually arrested and charged, but only after other victims came forward, Bucci said.\n\nAfter he spoke out about O'Connell, Bucci said, the diocese at the time ostracized him for doing so. The retaliation lasted for years, he said.\n\nNow, though, he said he is thankful for the leadership of Bishop Thomas Tobin.\n\nBucci said he stands by his decision to deny Communion to lawmakers who voted to codify abortion rights in the state, and stood by the general proposition that abortion is worse than pedophilia.\n\nI do believe killing an innocent child is the worst possible sin, Bucci said.\n\nA dozen state lawmakers called on Rhode Island's Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin to suspend Bucci, including state Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, whose sister, Ann Hagan Webb, was a victim of childhood abuse at that parish.\n\nFather Bucci's statements, they are unacceptable to all of us. They are horrible, said McEntee. They have inflicted pain upon the victims and the survivors that have already endured so much at their hands.\n\nMcEntee was on the list of people no longer allowed to receive Communion at Sacred Heart.
Justin Timberlake is apologizing to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson a week after documentary Framing Britney Spears released on Hulu and got fans criticizing his past behavior.\n\nI have seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right, Timberlake wrote in a statement posted on Instagram.\n\nI specifically want to apologize to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed.\n\nHe continued, The industry is flawed. It sets men, especially white men, up for success. As a man in a privileged position I have to be vocal about this. Because of my ignorance, I didn't recognize it for all that it was while it was happening in my own life but I do not want to ever benefit from others being pulled down again.\n\nNew York Times' revelatory new documentary, which first aired Feb. 5, highlights the rise of Spears' career, her mental health challenges, inappropriate treatment by unrelenting media and the discord over her conservatorship, controlled largely by her father, Jamie.\n\nFraming Britney also got fans fired up about how some people treated Spears, including Timberlake.\n\nThe two dated for a few years before splitting in 2002. There is speculation they broke up because Spears was unfaithful, which Timberlake appeared to fuel with the release of the music video for his 2002 single Cry Me A River.\n\nInterview clips in the documentary depict Timberlake lacking compassion for Spears, who at one point said she desired to remain a virgin until marriage. Asked if he slept with Spears, he playfully responds, OK, I did it! but seems to backtrack, though the audio is unclear.\n\nThe criticism ensued on social media.\n\nToday's a great day for @jtimberlake to publicly own up to his misogyny and apologize to Britney Spears, one user wrote. #FramingBritneySpears #FreeBritney\n\nI don't care that it's been well over a decade, another posted, Justin Timberlake still owes Britney Spears an apology for framing her as a cheater in the public eye and pouring gasoline on the paparazzi fire send tweet.\n\nFollowing a week of backlash, Timberlake spoke out.\n\nI have not been perfect in navigating this throughout my career. I know this apology is a first step and does not absolve the past, Timberlake wrote.\n\nStill, some fans are not accepting the singer's first step.\n\nOne user quoted a screenshot of the apology with, lol, justin timberlake take your trolls song money and cry me a river\n\nJustin Timberlake thinks a short notes app apology is accountability for the pain he caused Britney and Janet......the audacity of men, another tweeted.\n\nTimberlake's wife Jessica Biel, though, showed support for his message, commenting I love you.\n\nFellow singer Brandi Carlile also showed support writing, I can't wait to see how you get involved with elevating women and marginalized people. you're an inspiring dude to me.\n\nTimberlake's apology extended to Janet Jackson, who co-headlined the XXXVIII Super Bowl Halftime show with him.\n\nAt the end of the performance in 2004, Timberlake tugged on part of Jackson's outfit, leading to a wardrobe malfunction briefly exposing her right breast in front of a TV audience of 140 million viewers.\n\nThe incident negatively affected Jackson's career she was forced to apologize and spent the tour promoting her album that year answering questions about the incident. Timberlake went without expressing a public apology until now.\n\nI understand that I fell short in these moments, Timberlake continued on Friday's post, ...and in many others and benefitted from a system that condones misogyny and racism.\n\nContributing: Erin Jensen, Carly Mallenbaum, David Oliver, Nina Mandell and Josh Peter
Mesfin Fekadu\n\nAssociated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Grammy-winning electronic music pioneers Daft Punk have announced that they are breaking up after 28 years.\n\nThe helmet-wearing French duo shared the news Monday in an 8-minute video called Epilogue. Kathryn Frazier, the band's longtime publicist, confirmed the break up for The Associated Press.\n\nDaft Punk, comprised of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, have had major success over the years, winning six Grammy Awards and launching international hits with One More Time, Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger and Get Lucky.\n\nBangalter and de Homem-Christo met at a Paris school in 1987. Prior to Daft Punk, they formed an indie rock band named Darling.\n\nThey officially formed Daft Punk in 1993, and the helmeted, mute and mysterious musicians released their debut album, Homework, in 1997. They first found success with the international hit Da Funk, which topped the Billboard dance charts and earned them their first Grammy nomination. A second No. 1 hit and Grammy nomination followed with Around the World.\n\nDaft Punk spent time touring around the world and reached greater heights with their sophomore album, 2001′s Discovery. It included the infectious smash One More Time and Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, which Kanye West famously flipped into his own hit Stronger, released in 2007. It won West the best rap solo performance Grammy at the 2008 show, where West and Daft Punk performed together onstage.\n\nMore:Kim Kardashian West officially files for divorce from Kanye West after almost 7 years of marriage\n\nA year later, a live version of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger won Daft Punk the best dance recording Grammy — their first win — and their Alive 2007 album picked up best electronic/dance album.\n\nBut it was the 2014 Grammys where Daft Punk really took the spotlight, winning album of the year for Random Access Memories and making history as the first electronic act to win the highest honor at the Grammys. The duo won four awards that night, including record of the year for their bombshell hit Get Lucky, featuring Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers.\n\nMore:Pharrell Williams pens essay on racism in America, releases song 'Entrepreneur' with Jay-Z\n\nRandom Access Memories was regarded as a genre-bending album highlighted by its mix of live instrumentation, disco sounds, funk, rock, R&B and more. Rolling Stone ranked it No. 295 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time last year.
Deutsche Welle\n\nSame-sex couples in Australia tied the knot in midnight ceremonies as the last legal obstacles to gay marriage expired. Parliament passed marriage reform last month after a postal ballot supported marriage equality.\n\nAmong the first united in matrimony were track athletes Craig Burns and Luke Sullivan, who said their vows Tuesday after the clock struck midnight.\n\nIt's another way to show your love and appreciation of your partner in front of the people in your life, said Burns, who will compete in the Commonwealth Games in in April.\n\nGay marriage became legal on December 9 after parliament overwhelmingly supported the change following a postal ballot that showed 62% of respondents supported marriage equality.\n\nThe same as heterosexual couples, gay and lesbian couples in Australia are usually required to give one month's notice ahead of their planned nuptials.\n\nThat means Tuesday was the first day same-sex couples could marry, although several married in the past few weeks under exceptional circumstances because they were granted a waiver due to illness or travel requirements.\n\nAustralia joins more than 20 countries, including Germany, that recognize same-sex marriage.
PHOENIX – Citing concerns about the proliferation of erotic images online and their toxic effect on behavior, Arizona lawmakers are pushing to declare pornography a public health crisis.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Michelle Udall introduced a measure that declares the crisis and states that porn perpetuates a sexually toxic environment that damages all areas of our society.\n\nLike the tobacco industry, the pornography industry has created a public health crisis, Udall told lawmakers. Pornography is used pervasively, even by minors.\n\nUdall's proposal is largely symbolic and has no legal effect, but supporters say they hope it opens the door to new restrictions on porn.\n\nSimilar measures declaring a crisis have passed in at least 11 states, using similar text from model legislation written by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. The group, formerly known as Morality in Media, contends porn is directly connected to other acts of exploitation.\n\nDems: Science lacking to show crisis\n\nArizona's resolution cleared its first hurdle in the state House of Representatives on Thursday, passing out of the House Committee on Health & Human Services on a 5-3-1 vote, with Republicans in support.\n\nDemocrats said while porn addiction is a problem, supporters don't have the scientific evidence necessary to show it has risen to the level of a public health crisis.\n\nThere are statements in here that seem hyperbolic and unproven, said Rep. Kelli Butler.I just don't think there's necessarily the science to back up those claims.\n\nShe questioned why, if proponents are concerned about the sexual exploitation and health of minors, they aren't calling for better sex education in schools.\n\nArizona ranks fourth-lowest in the country for offering comprehensive sexual education in middle school, according to a 2016 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBill supporters say women, kids at risk\n\nSupporters contend that research shows pornography can be biologically addictive and can lead to extreme and violent sexual behaviors, as well as interest in child pornography.\n\nPotential detrimental effects on pornography users include toxic sexual behaviors, emotional, mental and medical illnesses and difficulty forming or maintaining intimate relationships, the measure states.\n\nThere are numerous conflicting studies about the affects of pornography viewership. Some studies document negative affects on relationships and addictive behavior.\n\nBut other researchers say there isn't evidence to show porn is addictive in the same way as alcohol or tobacco, though the perception of addiction can lead to psychological distress.\n\nIn some countries, instances of sexual assault declined after porn was legalized, leading some to hypothesize that it provides a safe outlet for sexual expression.\n\nUdall's resolution outlines what she describes as the negative impacts of increasing pornography viewership:\n\nChildren are being exposed to porn at an alarming rate given its widespread availability on the internet,  leading to low self-esteem, eating disorders and an increase in problematic sexual activity at ever-younger ages.\n\nIt normalizes violence and the abuse of women and children by treating them as objects, increasing the demand for sex trafficking, prostitution and child porn.\n\nPornography has an adverse effect on the family as it is correlated with decreased desire in young men to marry, dissatisfaction in marriage and infidelity.\n\nAre more regulations next?\n\nBut a few lawmakers at Thursday's hearing questioned what the measure would do to address those problems given it's non-binding and wouldn't impose any new regulations.\n\nI don't know how this bill can control the evils that it portrays, said GOP Rep. Jay Lawrence, who ultimately voted for the measure.\n\nSupporters said the move alerts parents and educators to the gravity of the problem. They said the issue – unlike the morals-driven debate of decades past – has become a health crisis due to its availability online.\n\nDan Oakes, a Mesa-based therapist who treats porn addiction, testified that the bill might also open the door to new laws.\n\nI don't disagree that the bill needs more teeth, he responded to Lawrence. That is our goal.\n\nBill supporters didn't elaborate about what kinds of regulation they hope lawmakers will consider next. Courts in the United States have consistently held that its legal to consume porn; child pornography is already illegal.\n\nThe measure now faces a vote in the full House, where Republicans have a narrow majority. If it passes there, it must also be approved by the Senate. Resolutions do not require approval of the governor.\n\nMore:Iowa inmates sue to overturn state law banning pornography in prison
Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story misstated the early tax filing date.\n\nTax refunds will go out even if the government shutdown extends into filing season, the Internal Revenue Service said late Monday, and the agency will start accepting tax returns on Jan. 28.\n\nThe announcement comes after the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget on Monday said refunds would still be sent out during a shutdown.\n\nThe IRS plans to recall a significant portion of workers who have been furloughed during the shutdown to process tax returns. The agency will offer more details when it releases its shutdown contingency plan, expected in the coming days.\n\nThe shutdown could complicate what already will be a unique filing year that incorporates for the first time major changes to the tax code. Here's what you should know.\n\nMore Money:Once nation's top retailer, Sears may soon be shutdown. A timeline of its rise and fall.\n\nMore Money:CES 2019: The robot revolution (for real) and untearable pantyhose are finally here\n\n3 big changes this year\n\nThis will be first year taxpayers will see how the tax law passed in December 2017 will affect their federal returns. The most significant changes are to the standard deduction, the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and the child tax credit.\n\nBigger standard deduction: The standard deduction will nearly double for every filer from 2017: $12,000 for single and married taxpayers filing separately, up from $6,350; $18,000 for heads of households, up from $9,350; and $24,000 for married couples filing jointly, up from $12,700.\n\nCapped SALT deduction: The new tax law limits how much you can deduct in state and local taxes to $10,000. Before, taxpayers could deduct all income, property and sales taxes they paid during the tax year to their state or municipality.\n\nMore credit for children: Another substantial change is the doubling of the child tax credit to $2,000 per child from $1,000. Taxpayers also can claim a new $500 credit for adult dependents. These credits phase out when a married couple's income exceeds $400,000, up from $110,000 before.\n\n3 ways to get ready\n\nGather documents: Print out a tax checklist and gather the documents as you receive them, such as W-2s from your employer and 1099s from your bank. Collect any receipts you plan to use to claim deductions for charitable contributions.\n\nPull out old returns: Take out a copy of last year's tax return to help jog your memory on what credits you claimed and deductions you made. This will help you note key changes in your life that may affect your taxes, such as marriage, divorce, a new house, a new baby or retirement.\n\nAnticipate changes: Use online calculators to help you anticipate your tax situation post-tax reform law. If you estimate you may owe Uncle Sam, you can still fund your IRA — until April 15 — to lower your 2018 taxable income.\n\nKey tax dates\n\nThe tax deadline for filing will return to the traditional April 15 after falling on later dates in the past three years because of weekends and local holidays. Because of state holidays, Maine and Massachusetts taxpayers have until April 17 to file their returns.\n\nHere are other important tax dates:\n\nJan. 15: If you're self-employed, fourth-quarter 2018 estimated tax payments are due.\n\nJan. 31: Deadline for employers to mail out W-2 forms and for businesses to send 1099 statements, which report non-employee compensation, bank interest, dividends and distributions from a retirement plan, and help calculate your total taxable income.\n\nMarch 15: Heads up, incorporated gig workers! Tax returns for LLCs and S-corporations are due.\n\nApril 15: This is the last day you can file your taxes electronically or postmark your paper taxes.
It wasn't a stretch for Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth to play a married couple.\n\nThe two have been close ever since they co-starred in TV movie Conspiracy in 2001: supporting each other through Firth's separation from wife Livia Giuggioli in 2019 and the death of Tucci's first wife, Kate, from breast cancer in 2009. They both live in London and their kids are friends, so they already had a palpable connection when it came time to shoot romantic drama Supernova (in theaters Friday, available digitally Feb. 16).\n\nWhen you're great friends with someone, and you've been through so much and shared so much, you start to feel like a married couple, Tucci says. As actors, you're catapulted into these relationships where you must be intimate with people, emotionally or physically. When that's a person you've known for 20 years, it just makes that a little bit easier.\n\n'Little Things':Denzel Washington battles Jared Leto, Rami Malek\n\nThat lived-in affection was imperative for Supernova, a quietly heartbreaking story about life partners Tusker (Tucci) and Sam (Firth), who embark on a final road trip. We soon learn that Tusker has been diagnosed with early onset dementia, and the couple is faced with tough decisions about how best to care for him while maintaining his quality of life.\n\nIt was interesting to me how dementia changed relationships and love, writer/director Harry Macqueen says. You go from being an equal party with that person to their carer. That transition was not something I'd seen on screen before.\n\nTucci, 60, is a dark horse supporting actor Oscar contender for the well-reviewed Supernova (88% positive on Rotten Tomatoes). He calls USA TODAY from his home in England, where he's been finding a sense of sanity in the kitchen and finishing his new book Taste: My Life Through Food, out this fall.\n\n2021 horror preview:15 movies that'll scare your pants off, including 'Saint Maud'\n\nQuestion: You initially signed on to play Colin's character but wound up switching roles. Whose choice was that?\n\nStanley Tucci: Colin suggested it and I was thinking the same thing. Every time I read it, I was like, Something's wrong. Both characters are so complex, but there was something rhythmically about the writing (of Tusker) that seemed more right to me. The way he deflects emotion with humor, and then also his sudden straightforwardness.\n\nQ: How did your own experiences with marriage and grief inform your performance? (Tucci married Felicity Blunt, sister of actress Emily, in 2012, and they share two young children: Matteo, 6, and Emilia, 2.)\n\nTucci: Those things are just a part of you. You can't help but tap into them, whether you want to or not. Particularly when you reach my age and you've had a lot of friends who passed away, and a wife who's passed away, you're very well aware of grief.\n\nQ: You're hosting a culinary travel show, Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy, on CNN (premiering Feb. 14). Has that been a lifelong dream of yours?\n\nTucci: I thought about this idea maybe a dozen years ago now: breaking down Italy region to region, focusing on the cuisine and the forces that created that cuisine, whether they're geographical, political, religious, socioeconomic. Italy has been invaded over the last 2,000 years by so many different people that they have influenced the cuisine.\n\nQ: A video of you making a Negroni went viral in lockdown, and you've shared similar how-tos since. How does it feel to be the internet's go-to cocktail guy?\n\nTucci: I'm sure there are a lot of bartenders who are just shaking their heads, even though I was trained as a bartender 40 years ago. I love making cocktails. I think it's really fun. It's not a lost art – it's an art that's really coming into its own now, and I think that's great. I like that bit of elegance in life.\n\nQ: When the world opens back up, and you're finally able to sit back down at a bar: What's the first drink you order and where?\n\nTucci:There's a place on the Upper West Side of Manhattan called Cafe Luxembourg. It's really great and it's where I started drinking martinis. I would love to be able to go back there and have a martini.\n\nQ: Lady Gaga's inauguration dress reminded many people of The Hunger Games fashion. (Tucci played the eccentric Caesar Flickerman in the young adult film franchise.) Did you have to do a double take?\n\nTucci: A little bit! I looked at it and I couldn't quite figure out what it was that it was reminding me of. Then (one of my older daughters) said, Oh, my gosh, like 'The Hunger Games!'  And I was like, Oh, yeah, that's what it is. On a larger scale, of course.\n\nQ: Speaking of your other films, The Devil Wears Prada turns 15 this year. What do fans ask or quote back to you most from that?\n\nTucci: People love Gird your loins, of course. And they just ask what it was like and was it fun. Of course, it was fun – it was a great group of people. (Meryl Streep's iconic cerulean blue scene, in particular) was beautifully written. And her delivery of it? Nobody could do that except her.
Jack Markell\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nTV reflects and shapes how we think about each other, including our family and neighbors with disabilities. Born This Way, The Good Doctor and Speechless offer role models with high expectations for inclusion and success.\n\nThese positive TV depictions parallel a hopeful trend in our country — as new statistics show 343,483 more people with disabilities joined the American workforce in 2016. This was four times the rate of the previous year. It's a combination of fighting stigmas, supporting strong public policies and using best practices to lift up the talents of people with disabilities.\n\nMore:Hollywood is talking about inclusion more than ever, but not for disabled actors\n\nMore:The 'Pro-Life' movement is a joke and Trumpcare proves it\n\nDuring my eight years as Delaware's governor, I learned that every chief executive wants to be known as a Jobs Governor. It's critical that they play that role for everybody in their states.\n\nSome of the most talented people in history had disabilities. Beethoven was deaf and Harriet Tubman lived with epilepsy. Selena Gomez has lupus, Steven Hawking uses a mobility device, and Stevie Wonder is blind. Richard Branson, Whoopi Goldberg, Daymond John, Charles Schwab and Harry Belafonte have dyslexia. Yet our nation has long failed people with disabilities and left them among the poorest of the poor.\n\nOne in five Americans have a disability. That adds up to 56 million people. Many people have a loved one with an intellectual or physical disability. Millions more have learning differences or attention issues. Those of us who don't have a disability today may acquire one due to an accident, aging or disease.\n\nOnly 65% of students born with disabilities complete high school, and 7% complete college. Key barriers include low expectations and the fact that many school systems either fail to diagnose our kids early enough or address their issues at all. This often pushes children with disabilities into the school-to-prison pipeline. Appropriate early intervention, positive supports and basic training for educators, parents and guardians is vital.\n\nWhen I chaired the National Governors Association and led the Council of State Governments, we built on work done by former Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. We spoke with hundreds of governments, businesses, educators and disability groups including RespectAbility, self-advocates and local leaders. We found that states and society at large should look to major companies that have made a commitment to employing people with disabilities to see what is possible.\n\nCompanies including JP Morgan Chase, Pepsi, UPS, Ernst & Young,IBM, Walgreen's, Starbucks, Walgreen's and the software corporation SAP are case studies that show people with disabilities are successful employees. They also show that these workers improve businesses' bottom lines. More employers must be educated about the skill sets that so many of our neighbors with disabilities bring to the workplace.\n\nMore:Gayle Myrick gay marriage case: Don't pick and choose which employee to accommodate\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nTechnology is critical to workplace success and inclusion. Apple, Microsoft, Google and others are making communication devices more accessible. For example, devices like iPads and tools like Microsoft's Disability Answer Desk help promote accessibility. Google is investing heavily in emerging technologies to empower people living with disabilities.\n\nWhile our country has a long way to go, we should be optimistic that the tide is turning.\n\nThis momentum provides opportunities to make greater strides on behalf of the millions of working-age people with disabilities. Under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, states largely control $17 billion in annual federal funding to help people with employment barriers get jobs. States can also blend funding from different federal programs to enable people with disabilities to work.\n\nGovernors across the political spectrum are succeeding at this work. In Alaska, Independent Bill Walker has expanded Project SEARCH to help young people with intellectual and other disabilities find jobs. Republican Brian Sandoval of Nevada has worked with employers such as Starbucks on innovative employment strategies. Also in Nevada, Pepsi has expanded successful disability inclusion strategies. Minnesota Democrat Mark Dayton's Employment First policies and collaborative approach have resulted in thousands of new jobs for his constituents with disabilities.\n\nGiving people with disabilities a shot at employment is one surefire solution to building economic opportunity, improving the outlooks of businesses looking for qualified employees, and reducing dependence on taxpayer-funded benefits.\n\nAt a time when the political parties can agree on little else, we all ought to be united on this.\n\nJack Markell is a former governor of Delaware and former chairman of the National Governors Association.

Brigham Young University removed a ban on homosexual behavior from its honor code, the Mormon institution said Wednesday, in an effort to match church policy.\n\nThe announcement came the same day the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints released its new handbook, but did not specify what displays of affection same-gender couples are allowed to do.\n\nUntil now, the code defined homosexual behavior as all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings, such as kissing, holding hands and sex. Any of those actions had violated BYU's honor code, which students must follow on and off campus in order to graduate and take classes.\n\nBisexual at BYU:For Emma Gee, being the only out LGBTQ athlete at BYU is complicated\n\nThe Honor Code Office will handle questions that arise on a case by case basis, the university said Wednesday. For example, since dating means different things to different people, the Honor Code Office will work with students individually.\n\nThe previous policy said a student's stated same-gender attraction was not an issue, but a BYU valedictorian made national headlines when he came out as gay during a graduation speech last year, and one student said other LGBTQ athletes stay closeted to avoid abuse.\n\nAddison Jenkins, a former BYU student, told The Salt Lake Tribune the change will improve the lives of LGBTQ students at the Mormon institution.\n\nWe've been vulnerable and authentic and persistently asked for the university to treat us queer students the same as our straight peers, Jenkins told the paper. Today, that work finally paid off.\n\nSame-sex marriage:Mormons to allow baptisms for children of LGBTQ parents\n\nThe church does not support same-sex marriage and its handbook says sex between people of the same gender undermines the divinely created institution of the family. Gay Mormons are allowed to be part of the church, however, and their children can be baptized without special permission.\n\nMore than 2 million Mormons live in Utah, which BYU calls home, accounting for about one-third of all Mormons in the nation.
Mike Hembree\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nLAS VEGAS — Graham Rahal has unique perspectives on the phenomenon that is John Force.\n\nRahal not only is Force's son-in-law (he's married to Force's youngest daughter, Courtney), but he also knows a thing or two about auto racing. Rahal drives Indy cars for a team partially owned by his father, Bobby, a former IndyCar champion.\n\nCourtney and Graham were married in November 2015, ending months of speed dating and tossing Rahal into the maelstrom of the extended Force family and its all-consuming devotion to racing.\n\nI'm the outsider, Rahal told USA TODAY Sports. I'm the one person in this family who doesn't require John to sign my paycheck. It's a little different, but I also grew up around a guy (his father) who was the class of his field for his career.\n\nPHOTOS: At home with the Force family\n\nForce and Rahal have a long-distance marriage. Courtney lives near her parents, John and Laurie, in Yorba Linda. Rahal lives near Indianapolis, home to his Verizon IndyCar Series team. But they are together often, either at a track or, quite often, at the Force family big house in Yorba Linda.\n\nAll of the Force family members live within a few miles of John and Laurie.\n\nIt's not like you get a whole lot of space, Rahal said, smiling. It's probably the way John likes it. Everything they do, they're always together — at the track or at home.\n\nJohn Force's rise from poverty to NHRA superstardom\n\nJohn Force interrupted an interview with Rahal to remind him, Hey, all you have to worry about is protecting my baby. Then he was off to harass someone else.\n\nEarlier, Force had told Rahal, If you ever split up with my daughter, there will be a hundred men lined up to marry her.\n\nRahal's response: Not after they meet you.\n\nFollow Hembree on Twitter @mikehembree\n\nPHOTOS: Behind the wheel with Courtney Force
Anthony McCartney\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES — Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt have reached an agreement to handle their divorce in a private forum and will work together to reunify their family, the actors announced in a joint statement Monday.\n\nTheir statement released Monday night to the Associated Press said that they will keep future details of their divorce confidential by using a private judge.\n\nThe parties and their counsel have signed agreements to preserve the privacy rights of their children and family by keeping all court documents confidential and engaging a private judge to make any necessary legal decisions and to facilitate the expeditious resolution of any remaining issues, their statement read. The parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification.\n\nWill 'Allied' help Brad Pitt's image rebound amidst Brangelina divorce?\n\nThe statement is the first joint comment from the actors on their divorce since Jolie Pitt filed to end their marriage in September. At the time, one of her attorneys stated the petition was filed for the health of the family.\n\nAuthorities investigated allegations that Pitt was abusive toward his 15-year-old son on a private flight, but sources familiar with the cases said the actor was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nPrivate judges are often used in high-profile divorce cases, keeping many details of a breakup out of the public eye while a final judgment is negotiated.\n\nCustody of their six children has been the primary issue in the divorce, with Jolie Pitt initially seeking sole physical custody. California law favors joint custody in divorce cases, although final arrangements are often agreed to by parents and formalized in a written agreement.\n\nBrad Pitt's attempt to seal divorce documents denied\n\nPitt and Jolie were married for two years and together for 12 years after becoming involved while filming 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\n\nTheir divorce, and every filing in it, has attracted international attention. Last month, Pitt sought to seal custody records in the case, and a hearing had been scheduled for next week on the issue.\n\nBoth actors have kept a relatively low profile since their breakup was announced, although Pitt made an appearance onstage at Sunday's Golden Globes to spirited applause.
Mary Bowerman\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThis story was published in 2017\n\nReal life can be busy. And with hyper-sexual images and storylines dominating shows and movies, couples often ask: Should we be having more sex?\n\nThough people are quick to compare themselves against others, there is no magic number when it comes to how often you should have sex with your partner, according to Mary Andres, a professor at the University of Southern California, and co-coordinator of marriage and family therapy program.\n\nHere are a few things sex therapists say to think about next time you're questioning your sex life:\n\nHow much sex should a couple have?\n\nA 40-year study that surveyed more than 30,000 Americans, found in 2015 that couples who have sex once a week are the happiest. So, should couples put a number on how often they hop in the bed?\n\nAndres said couples need to understand how often each person needs to have sex to be fulfilled in the relationship.\n\nSome people want to have sex every day, and they are, she said. Other people have other priorities, so sex isn't on the top of their list, so they are having it less.\n\nThe primary problem for many couples is not the frequency of sex, but how they talk about it, according to Heidi Crockett, a licensed psychotherapist in Florida and an (AASECT) American Association of Sexuality educators, counselors and therapists, certified sex therapist.\n\nIf both people in the couple have a general desire to want to please their partner and participate in the relationship and talk about things openly, usually something can be negotiated that can satisfy both people, Crockett said.\n\nIs your hyper-plugged-in life hurting your sex life?\n\nToday couples have an onslaught of distractions keeping them from having sex, Andres said.\n\nA lot more people are connected to devices— if they are watching videos, TV in the bedroom, texting or updating Twitter feeds, it's detrimental to their sex lives, Andres said.\n\nShe compares refreshing a Twitter or Facebook feed to gambling.\n\nThat immediate gratification can be more compelling than let's take the time to get in the bed and have sex, she said. Sex may have longer gratification and might have a bigger payoff, but people are going for fast and easy.\n\nShe said people can reclaim their bedroom and use it not to update Twitter, but to spend time with their partner.\n\nToo tired for sex? Join the club.\n\nParticularly for couples with children or stressful jobs, sometimes the idea of having sex is too much to bear, but having sex can have positive effects on your life.\n\nAndres said sex does several things for people:\n\n1. Sex releases endorphins that make you feel good and increase the feeling of closeness with your partner.\n\n2. Sex can clear the mind. Andes said if you have a noisy brain, sex reallocates your blood flow to your genitals and can help clear your thoughts.\n\nBut while sex intellectually makes sense, when you're really tired it's hard to follow through, she said. If one person is exhausted, couples should have a conversation about it.\n\n'Lets make this work, don't want to put this on you when you are already depleted and think I am being selfish, but I also want to have the opportunity to connect with you – and remind ourselves why we are doing this,' Andres said.\n\nIf a partner wants to discuss issues within the relationship or the frequency of sex, it's important to carefully plan how they address the subject, according to Crockett.\n\nYou say, 'I am interested in talking more about our sex life but I would like to set up a time so make an appointment for it,' she said. There are introverts and extroverts, so some like to process out loud and some like to have information ahead of time and think about it before they come to the table.\n\nConversations about sex can be awkward, so it's important to be aware of your partners needs, she said.\n\nYou don't have to have physical intercourse to satisfy your partner\n\nAndres said couples can figure out what works for them when it comes to satisfying their partner's needs.\n\nIf one partner wants to have sex three times a week, and the other doesn't, other sex acts can act as a substitute for actual intercourse.\n\nYou can expand what the idea of that definition is, so you find something that is mutually beneficial to both, she said.\n\nSchedule sex like you would any other activity, and show up\n\nWhile the idea of romantic, spontaneous sex may be what many picture, it's hard to find time for sex when people are consistently hard-pressed for time.\n\nWe have to schedule sex like everything else, Andres said. If you are scheduling going to a class, you show up turn off your phone, leave it in your car… People have to prioritize their sex lives the way they prioritize other things.\n\nAndes said many people think a weekly date night will amp up romance, but many times couples end up in a food coma and don't have sex afterward.\n\nHave the babysitter take the kids out, have sex and then go out to dinner, Andres said. It works.\n\nWhen is it time to see a counselor?\n\nAndres said people should seek help if they feel rejected or like their partner is not listening to their needs sexually.\n\nShe said many couples might try to learn how to be more open with their partner about their needs by reading a book or watching a video on connecting.\n\nCrockett said sex therapy or counseling can be beneficial for couples who want to rebuild their sex lives and those who are already satisfied.\n\nEven couples that are happy with their sex life could see a therapist, because they will ask questions the couple may not have discussed or ideas they might not have known, she said. Going to a therapist is an opportunity to learn more about yourself and your sex life.\n\nFollow Mary Bowerman on Twitter: @MaryBowerman\n\nSurvey: Sleeping together before a first date is a-OK, but cracked phones are a put off\n\nSurvey: Sleeping together before a first date is a-OK, but cracked phones are a put off
The Arizona Republic\n\nPHOENIX — The U.S. Navy SEAL who was shot and killed by Islamic State militants in Iraq on May 3 is being promoted to the rank of chief petty officer, the Navy said Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement of the posthumous promotion for special warfare operator Charles Keating IV comes two days before his funeral in Coronado, Calif.\n\nLt. Cmdr. Nate Christensen, a Navy spokesman, said that Keating had been eligible to go before a promotion board this year, and that based on his evaluations and assignments, there was good reason to believe he would have been promoted.\n\nRELATED: Navy SEAL, grandson of S&L financier, killed in Iraq\n\nWhile the promotion will not affect pay or benefits, Keating, a grandson of the Phoenix savings-and-loan financier with the same name, will be able to be buried wearing his new rank.\n\nThe Navy confirmed Friday that Keating had privately married Brooke Clark before his deployment.\n\nYes, according to his military records, he was married before he deployed, Navy spokeswoman Lt. Beth Teach said Friday, confirming his wife as Clark.\n\nKeating, 31, was publicly engaged to Clark, 29, and the couple were planning a ceremony in November after he returned from Iraq.\n\nIt is common for service members to marry before deployment to secure benefits and protections for their loved one.\n\nIt would have been up to Keating to allocate survivor benefits to Clark, although he could have named other beneficiaries, Teach said.\n\nThe marriage was a well-guarded secret, friend Robert Whitley told People magazine. Whitley is a wine critic in the San Diego area and judges at wine competitions, where he met Clark, who has been a judge's concierge.\n\nI can't speak to the chemistry that existed between them, nor would I want to invade Brooke's privacy even if I had any special insight, but the one thing I do know is that they adored each other, Whitley told The Republic by email.\n\nThey dated for a year and a half or two years before his death, according to Eli Crane, a former SEAL and longtime friend whom Keating had listed as one of three people to identify his family in the case of his death.\n\nWho was Charles H Keating Jr.?\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, Keating was part of a quick reaction force that moved in to rescue U.S. military advisers from an Islamic State attack.\n\nKeating and other special operations forces went to the rescue of U.S. forces caught in a gun battle involving more than 100 Islamic State fighters. The small team of American advisers had gone to Teleskof, about 14 miles north of Mosul, to meet with Kurdish peshmerga forces.\n\nThe attack triggered a massive coalition air response that destroyed equipment, buildings and killed up to 60 militants.\n\nKeating is the third American to die in combat in Iraq since the U.S. military deployed advisers and other personnel there in 2014 to support the war against the Islamic State:\n\nMarine Staff Sgt. Louis F. Cardin, 27, of Temecula, Calif., was killed March 19 in a rocket attack on an Iraqi base.\n\n27, of Temecula, Calif., was killed March 19 in a rocket attack on an Iraqi base. Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler, 39, a Special Forces soldier from Roland, Okla., was killed Oct. 22 in a raid that freed 70 Islamic State hostages from a makeshift prison in northern Iraq.\n\nAccording to Christensen, 12 sailors have been posthumously promoted so far this year.\n\nKeating will be buried Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego. A public procession to honor him will take place Friday in Coronado, where Keating's SEAL Team 1 is based.\n\nContributing: Kaila White, The Arizona Republic.

Gabriel Schoenfeld\n\nCloser relations with democratic Taiwan. Unflinching support for Israel. A pledge to restore America's atrophied military power.\n\nDeregulation and tax cuts that have already sent the stock market soaring. A Cabinet with key slots assigned to individuals of impeccable integrity.\n\nThe record of this interregnum is enough to give a determined conservative #NeverTrumper like myself pause. Was I wrong? Did I badly misjudge things? Will America not only avert disaster but enjoy an unexpected renaissance? Is this rough orange beast slouching toward the White House the second coming of Ronald Reagan?\n\nIf so, having denounced Trump in op-ed after tweet after op-ed, I will be personally embarrassed. Worse, I also slammed his supporters for willful blindness at best and moral turpitude at worst, quite a few of them by name. If they turn out to be right, and I have made a monumental misassessment of President-elect Donald Trump, I will be deservedly dining on crow for the rest of my life.\n\nHowever, I have not yet quite reached the point of repentance. Rather, as I look around at the emerging Trump administration, if I am not feeling vindication, I am perceiving something else.\n\nFirst, Trump is in the honeymoon phase that is part of our democratic tradition. He is America's next president, after all, and even his harshest critics want him to succeed, to make the country prosperous and to keep it secure. In some quarters (including my own), expectations have been so low that we are inwardly astonished when he exceeds them.\n\nAre Trump's aides playing him on Taiwan?: Gabriel Schoenfeld\n\nTrump-Putin bromance unnerves the Baltics: David Andelman\n\nTo be sure, exceeding them has not happened with great frequency. But Trump is also benefiting from something else. Reflecting the bitter divisions of the campaign, Trump's transition (as no doubt will be true of the early months of his presidency) is turning out to be one of the nastiest honeymoons in the history of marriage. Yet some of the nastiness directed at the groom is working to his advantage. Trump and his entourage have been subjected to relentless salvos of over-the-top criticism — which are having a boomerang effect, discrediting his detractors and building support for their target. An anti-Trumper abusing Ivanka in front of her children on a JetBlue flight is part of a larger pattern.\n\nAt the same time, the outgoing administration of President Obama is failing so abjectly in core duties that one wonders whether, under incoming President Trump, things could possibly get worse. The fall of Aleppo, Syria, has illuminated a grim and seemingly endless landscape of national security failure. We are witnessing human suffering on a grand scale while simultaneously enduring strategic defeats, with Russia and Iran making headway in the Middle East and a refugee crisis in Europe merging with a terrorism crisis to jeopardize the post-war European liberal order. Obama's foreign policy legacy is so appalling — and Obama and his apologists are so blithe about what they have wrought, while also stopping to shaft Israel at the United Nations on their way out — that it fosters the impression that Trump can only do better.\n\nIt is only human to hope that will be true, and of course, we will have to wait and see. But the reality is, Trump can do worse, much worse.\n\nWe should not succumb to the pitfall of defining Trump's manifest deviancy downward. All the signs of trouble that were present across his career and during the campaign are present today, plus more: the conspiracy theorists whom Trump has selected as his key White House national security advisers; the compulsive tweeting about everything from a dearth of U.S. nuclear weapons to the wounds inflicted by Saturday Night Live to his blossoming love affair with Russian President Vladimir Putin; the impulsive policymaking based upon whatever adviser or business partner or child has most recently entered or left the room; the cyber bullying of critics, the threats against individual companies for daring to contradict him, the self-dealing, the incessant lying about matters trivial and great.\n\nRight-sizing the Trump defense buildup: Michael O'Hanlon\n\nHow to unite in spite of Trump: Column\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nAlready, the audience for these eccentricities extends to the heads of state of allies and adversaries. Soon, as Trump gains the power to move aircraft carriers or dispatch the Marines or make nuclear threats, their impact will be magnified by the awesome powers of the U.S. presidency.\n\nBeyond Trump's erratic character, there is the troubling substance of the Trump Doctrine itself, encapsulated in the formula Art of the Deal. If America's relationship with the world is reduced to a balance sheet of profits and losses, as seems to be one of Trump's core ideas, how will a country like Taiwan fare if its security turns out to be a bargaining chip in a negotiation with China over tariffs? How will Israel fare under a president who wants to sort of be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians, who also wants to back Israel to the hilt, while also bringing about the ultimate deal between the parties?\n\nThis is not strategic ambiguity; it is an incoherence replicated in Trump's approach to every trouble spot on the globe. Will this presidency end well? Even as I continue to fear the worst, I sincerely hope, for the good of the country, that I will soon be dining on crow.\n\nGabriel Schoenfeld, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and the author of Necessary Secrets: National Security, the Media, and the Rule of Law.

A quick look at the summary of Ethan Hawke's book might make you think it was his memoir: Love, fame and heartbreak – a searing story of a man making his Broadway debut as his marriage implodes.\n\nBut it's not. It's the movie star's fourth novel, A Bright Ray of Darkness (Knopf, 256 pp.), out Tuesday, imbued with elements of his real life. An elementary school detective could scroll through his Wikipedia page and discover he was married to Uma Thurman from 1998 to 2005 and that he made his Broadway debut in The Seagull in 1992.\n\nI thought if I could use my experiences and weave them together to create a fictional version of reality, I could tell a story that might have a larger point in my own life, Hawke (The Good Lord Bird) tells USA TODAY over the phone.\n\nThe book – which Hawke had the idea for 20 years ago – chronicles William's preparation for and ultimate performance as Hotspur in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1 and 2 while dealing with the fallout of cheating on his rock star musician wife, Mary. The first-person approach makes it read like a memoir, and like a book only an actor could write (especially an actor who's played the role of Hotspur himself).\n\n'The Good Lord Bird':Ethan Hawke, James McBride on bringing John Brown to Showtime in 2020\n\nThere's an intimacy you have with a play when you've lived inside that imaginative world, Hawke says. There's just little things you know about it that you don't know about a play you haven't done.\n\nIt helped, too, that the play's themes tied to what he was trying to write about: fathers, sons, forgiveness, healing and the difference between a good guy and a bad guy.\n\nIt just seemed like the perfect play to hold this novel, he says.\n\nHawke wrote in his experience as a film actor turning to theater; he landed in The Seagull amid the buzz of Dead Poets Society.\n\nI was really insecure about my right to be there, he says, and mentions that Laura Linney was in it and had just graduated from Juilliard. She was more facile and equipped for that experience, he says.\n\nWilliam endures a negative review for his role in the novel, something Hawke experienced firsthand for The Seagull.\n\nIt's a hurtful experience when you do what you love and people mock you for it, he says with a laugh. It's a process one has to grow through. In truth, it actually makes you much stronger. But it doesn't mean it's not painful.\n\nNot getting to do what you love at all proves difficult, too. Hawke has spent my whole life from 13 on acting pretty much constantly. So for me to stop that river, for that river to dry up, has been really painful in a lot of ways.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped him from acting. He's been working on a Zoom production of Samuel Beckett's iconic postmodern play Waiting for Godot for The New Group. And yes, you read that right: not a reading, but a production.\n\nHe rehearses a few hours per day with co-stars John Leguizamo (When They See Us), rapper Tariq Trotter (aka Black Thought of The Roots) and Wallace Shawn (Marriage Story).\n\nSundance Film Festival:2021 goes virtual with robust program, diverse offerings\n\nHawke will be playing Vladimir, one of the characters living in perpetual uncertainty, insecurity, anxiety and loneliness, per The New Group – in case that sounds familiar. We're rehearsing it as if it's like people Zooming each other in some post-apocalyptic world, Hawke says (streaming date TBD).\n\nHe says that audiences will be surprised how interesting the production is in light of the pandemic: The same way what Beckett was writing about the ravages of WWII, we've had our own ravages we're living through. It speaks to my ear, at least in a new way that makes it really worth revisiting.\n\nIn real life, Hawke would love to get a COVID-19 vaccine and finds the current state of the country exciting given the change in leadership.\n\nThe combination of this toxic grifter who was running our country being gone and a vaccine? It does feel like the sun is rising, doesn't it? You feel it all over, he says.\n\nHe notes, of course, that we are not done with the pandemic. The sun is not coming up as fast as we want, he says.\n\nSpeaking of the sun – will another film be added to the Before series?\n\nRichard Linklater's Before Sunrise, Before Sunset and Before Midnight romance films starring Hawke and Julie Delpy as Jesse and Céline have come out every nine years since 1995 – meaning a fourth movie, in theory, would be due in 2022. I'd love to see Jesse and Céline quarantining, Hawke says. I don't know, where they'd be, some apartment in Prague, or some strange city they find themselves trapped in.\n\nHe does admit that we'll all be pretty sick of pandemic art pretty soon, however, and is looking forward to the day he can stand onstage again.\n\nThe next time I get up on stage, I'll just be so grateful to be in that room with those people, he says. I never knew that we had so much to be grateful for.\n\nCan't wait for 'Bridgerton' Season 2? Look to Julia Quinn books for possible spoilers
Alice Dye, the Indianapolis golf legend credited with the famous island green on TPC Sawgrass who quietly used a club to break down barriers for women, has died. She was 91.\n\nMarried nearly 70 years to Pete Dye, a world-renowned golf course designer, Alice Dye never was the honorary sidekick in his projects.\n\nShe was the inspiration and architect of many of the couple's 130 high-profile championship courses -- from Franciacorta Golf Club in Italy to Whistling Straits in Wisconsin to The Citrus Golf Club in California.\n\nGolf was, after all, her sport. Not just something she picked up after becoming Mrs. Dye.\n\nBorn Feb. 19, 1927, in Indianapolis as Alice Holliday O'Neal, Dye grew up hanging out at the Woodstock Club. It had tennis, swimming and a 9-hole golf course. Dye tried all three sports, but swinging the club on the fairways, that's where she fell in love.\n\nBy the time Dye was 12 years old, she was enamored with golf. By the time she was a teenager, she was beating boys on the course, much to their chagrin.\n\nSandy Kunkel, a neighbor to the Dyes and member at Crooked Stick Golf Club in Carmel, designed by the Dyes, recalled a story in 2016 that his late father often told about Alice Dye. Kunkel's father was friends with her as a teenager and, one day, he was asked to play golf with Dye.\n\nHe didn't want to play golf with some girl, Kunkel said. But people kept saying it would be a great time, that she was good enough to compete.\n\nSo he went out and played nine holes and my dad shot par and he was two behind, Kunkel said. And Alice said, 'Do you want to play another nine?' and my dad said, 'No, that's enough.'\n\nDye would go on to spend a lifetime immersed in the sport, winning 11 Indianapolis Women's City titles. Dye claims nine Indiana state championships, three in Florida and too many national tournament titles to count.\n\nAt one point, she was ranked the No. 2 women's player in the U.S. She also shot seven or eight holes-in-one during her times on the course.\n\nDye was the first woman president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects and the first woman to serve as a director of the PGA of America. She was named the 2004 First Lady of Golf.\n\nI feel as a woman that it's your responsibility to take positions and be visible so that other women can follow, Dye told IndyStar in 2016. You need to open some doors.\n\nPGA of America called Dye one of the most enduring advocates for women's golf, in a tweet announcing her death.\n\nMaking sure women were given equal treatment in the sport is, perhaps, Dye's greatest legacy. She served with industry leaders to expand women golfers' access to the game. And she made sure, as she and her husband designed courses, that women players weren't forgotten.\n\nPete Dye may often be the name attached to the courses, but the two together are what made it all click, said Kunkel.\n\nThey are a great team and Alice has never gotten the credit she deserves. She really hasn't, Kunkel said. And she's had some great ideas and she's probably one of the smartest people I've ever met.\n\nDye, who graduated from Shortridge High School, was always the more practical of the couple. Pete Dye was known for his creativity, but Alice Dye's practicality led to the famous island green at Sawgrass.\n\nHer husband was having an awful time with the 17th green of the course. He woke up one morning and told his wife she had to come see it with him.\n\nI'm in a terrible mess, Pete Dye told his wife. The land where I was going to put the 17th green had wonderful material and I dug it all up and where I was going to put the 17th green, I've got a big hole.\n\nDye looked at the course and realized her husband was right. There wasn't any place to the right or the left, or in front of or behind the hole to put the green.\n\nAnd I said to him, 'Why don't you just put it right in the middle and fill up that big old hole with water?' she said. And that's what he did.\n\nThat was in the late 1970s and Pete Dye always said it was one of the many times he remembers thinking how lucky he was to have married Alice Dye.\n\nShe first spotted Pete Dye eating in the commons area of Rollins College in Florida. She was a junior and he a freshman. Pete Dye had come to college after serving in World War II as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne division.\n\nShe thought he was cute, so she followed him while he paid his tab.\n\nAnd I checked him out, Dye said. I thought, 'Man, I've got to find out about him.' Then, I went out to the golf course and there he was.\n\nHow perfect. The two dated on and off for the next two years. In 1948, she graduated and went back home to Indianapolis. Pete Dye didn't forget her.\n\nHe called Dye in the spring of 1949 and said he'd like to come up and talk to her about getting married. She was thrilled. She was working selling life insurance, the only woman in the business.\n\nOn a Thursday in June, he came to her home. They played golf on Friday, Saturday and Sunday morning. As he was set to head home, Dye's parents waited upstairs for Pete Dye to ask them for their daughter's hand in marriage.\n\nAnd he starts to head for the door with his suitcase, Dye said. I said, 'Wait a minute. What about getting married?'\n\nPete Dye said: Not in golf season. And he left.\n\nOh, I was furious with him, Dye said. I was so mad.\n\nWhen November rolled in with its chilly weather and Pete Dye asked her to marry him, her anger had dissipated. They were married the following February in 1950.\n\nDyes' Love Story: Wild elderberry wine and a labor of love\n\nPete and Alice are legends in the game, said Kent Frandsen, a member of Crooked Stick, who served as co-chair of the BMW Championship tournaments held at the course. Their imagination and innovative approach revolutionized golf course design.\n\nPGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said on its website, Alice blessed our sport as a player, a designer, and a trailblazer. But if you met her, you realized her favorite role of all was being a loving wife and mother. She loved golf and our sport loved her back. She will be sorely missed.\n\nDye died at her home in Gulf Stream, Fla., where she was helping to care for her husband. He is 93 and living with Alzheimer's disease. She is also survived by the Dyes' two sons, Perry and P.B., both prominent course designers.\n\nFollow IndyStar sports reporter Dana Benbow on Twitter: @Dana Benbow.

The 2021 NFL draft may still be three months away, yet recent league events are already beginning to shape it. For starters, the playoffs have nearly set the first-round order – Super Bowl 55 left to determine the Buccaneers or Chiefs as 2020 champions and the final team to select in Round 1.\n\nAnd then there's the quarterback carousel, which has cranked up unusually early. We're only a few weeks into the 2021 calendar, and already Philip Rivers has announced his retirement, the Lions and Matthew Stafford have apparently chosen to terminate their marriage, and it seems Deshaun Watson wants out of Houston.\n\nThe fallout will be reflected in my first mock draft of the year:\n\n1. Jacksonville Jaguars – Trevor Lawrence, QB, Clemson: This selection could make Cincinnati's choice of Joe Burrow a year ago seem dramatic by comparison. Lawrence has long been considered a generational prospect on the order of John Elway, Peyton Manning or Andrew Luck. He has the size (6-6, 200), arm strength, accuracy, mobility and grasp of the position to immediately jumpstart the Jags in concert with new coach Urban Meyer. Clemson didn't lose a regular-season game in Lawrence's three years as a starter, a stretch when he threw 90 TD passes and ran for 18 scores but was picked off just 17 times. The Georgia native should also put quite a charge into the Jags' often tepid fan base.\n\n2. New York Jets – Penei Sewell, OT, Oregon: This draft's intrigue begins with the Jets, who seemed destined for a union with Lawrence until their Dec. 20 defeat of the Rams changed everything. New York has myriad options at quarterback – draft one, pursue Watson or stick with underachieving 2018 first-rounder Sam Darnold among them. The latter two options only deepen the intrigue as GM Joe Douglas assesses the best ways to strengthen his supporting cast – and trading what should be a highly coveted selection might be the best way to do that. But Douglas, whose inaugural draft pick was LT Mekhi Becton last year, is a proponent of building his team from the inside out. In this scenario, taking Sewell (6-6, 330) – a gifted player who can bolster pass protection and elevate run game production with his mauling pancakes – would seem like the logical way for Douglas practice what he preaches.\n\n3. Miami Dolphins (from Houston Texans) – Ja'Marr Chase, WR, LSU: Heisman Trophy winner DeVonta Smith has perhaps recently overshadowed Chase, who opted out of playing in 2020. But before Smith won the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's preeminent receiver, Chase did so in 2019, setting a Southeastern Conference record with 20 TD catches – a mark Smith surpassed in 2020 – while averaging 21.2 yards per reception. Chase has plenty of speed and strength, excellent hands, high-points the ball with great effectiveness and is deadly in the red zone. He also runs every route, including a willingness to work over the middle – and this may be where his sturdier frame (6-0, 208) will distinguish him from Smith. Chase and DeVante Parker would make a nifty receiving combo for Tua Tagovailoa in Miami ... assuming Tua and this pick aren't packaged to the Texans for Watson.\n\n4. Atlanta Falcons – Zach Wilson, QB, BYU: He's been steadily rising and could well be the Jets' choice at No. 2 if they decide against chasing Watson and keeping Darnold. Wilson, who has exceptional arm talent, blossomed as a junior, completing 73.5% of his passes, 33 going for TDs with just three picked off. A solid athlete, he also ran for 10 scores. Matt Ryan is still playing at a high level in Atlanta. But he'll be 36 in May, and this may be the new regime's best shot at getting a worthy successor.\n\n5. Cincinnati Bengals – Kyle Pitts, TE, Florida: Another team that could go in a number of directions, but the priority should be putting more talent around Burrow – and that could mean O-line help ... or it could mean adding a playmaker like Pitts. The 6-6, 239-pounder caught 43 balls in 2020, averaging 17.9 yards per reception and finding the end zone 12 times. And given how the Chiefs' Travis Kelce continues to illustrate what a dominant tight end can do for an offense, why shouldn't the Bengals take a chance on a guy who could do a lot of damage between WRs Tyler Boyd and Tee Higgins?\n\nGREATEST SUPER BOWL MEMORIES:55 indelible Super Sunday moments\n\nJARRETT BELL:How these NFL players who had COVID-19 returned to play\n\nMIKE JONES:What Chiefs, Bucs can learn from their regular-season matchup\n\n6. Philadelphia Eagles – DeVonta Smith, WR, Alabama: He spent much of 2020 gliding through opposing defenses to the tune of 117 catches for an Alabama record 1,856 yards and those SEC record 23 TDs. Teaming him with 2020 first-round WR Jalen Reagor could be the optimal way to get QB Carson Wentz back on track in 2021. However Smith will have to prove his 170-pound frame can hold up in the NFL and that he can deal with stronger corners who will doubtless try to jam him at the line ... unlike, say, what he encountered against Ohio State in college football's championship game.\n\n7. Detroit Lions – Justin Fields, QB, Ohio State: They're not parting with Stafford to turn the keys over to Chase Daniel or David Blough. Fields is a multi-dimensional threat who was at his best with six TD passes against Clemson in the college playoff semifinals. However that performance was bracketed by several checkered ones, including his final one against Alabama. Still, Fields' estimable potential suggests the Lions might even have to move up a few spots to get him.\n\n8. Carolina Panthers – Trey Lance, QB, North Dakota State: His game reminds you of Cam Newton in his prime ... and at 6-3 and 224 pounds, Lance isn't all that much smaller than the former Panthers MVP. The pandemic limited the Bison to one game in 2020, but Lance was sublime in 2019 with 28 TD passes and zero INTs to go along with 1,100 yards and 14 TDs on the ground. He could probably use extra time to acclimate to the NFL, and apprenticing behind Teddy Bridgewater might be an ideal situation.\n\n9. Denver Broncos – Micah Parsons, LB, Penn State: Vic Fangio's defense relies on OLBs Bradley Chubb and (presumably) Von Miller creating pressure off the edge ... which means you need a pair of capable off-ball backers patrolling behind the line. Parsons fits the mold, and there could well be a need here with Alexander Johnson headed for free agency.\n\n10. Dallas Cowboys – Caleb Farley, CB, Virginia Tech: They began reloading the position last year, following Byron Jones' departure, by drafting Trevon Diggs. With Chidobe Awuzie and Jourdan Lewis potentially out the door in a few months, good chance Dallas continues upgrading on the corner with the 6-2, 207-pound all-Atlantic Coast Conference performer, who skipped the 2020 season due to the pandemic.\n\n11. New York Giants – Rashawn Slater, OT, Northwestern: Despite investments they've made in the offensive line, it continues to be a weakness after a season when QB Daniel Jones was sacked 45 times in 14 games. Slater was a guard in high school but played both tackle spots for the Wildcats and could settle in opposite 2020 first-rounder Andrew Thomas.\n\n12. San Francisco 49ers – Patrick Surtain II, CB, Alabama: The Niners will need to replenish their corner depth chart with the contracts of Richard Sherman, Jason Verrett, K'Waun Williams and Ahkello Witherspoon all set to expire. Even if they were sticking around, Surtain – son of the former Pro Bowler whose name he shares – would be a worthy selection following a season when he was named SEC defensive player of the year\n\n13. Los Angeles Chargers – Alijah Vera-Tucker, OL, USC: Whether he's deployed at guard or tackle, where the Trojans used him in 2020, Vera-Tucker solves a problem for the Bolts, who better start adding safeguards around QB Justin Herbert.\n\n14. Minnesota Vikings – Gregory Rousseau, DE, Miami (Fla.): The Vikes had an NFC-low 23 sacks in 2020, coach Mike Zimmer saying of his defense: worst one I've ever had. Rousseau, who's only 20, had 15½ sacks in 2019, winning ACC defensive rookie of the year honors before opting out in 2020. His 6-7 frame also makes him a threat to bat down balls when he can't get to the quarterback. He and Danielle Hunter could form quite a combo in a division ruled by Aaron Rodgers.\n\n15. New England Patriots – Mac Jones, QB, Alabama: It didn't go so well in Year 1 post-Brady. Hard to believe the Pats' 2021 quarterback is currently on their roster, though it wouldn't be a surprise if Stafford, Jimmy Garoppolo or another veteran lands in Foxborough. Barring that, Jones, who flourished under Bill Belichick's close friend Nick Saban in 2020, could be the best option if this team goes back to deploying a capable point guard. Jones completed 77.4% of his passes and threw 41 TDs last season but obviously benefited from having outrageous talent all around him.\n\n16. Arizona Cardinals – Najee Harris, RB, Alabama: They've got some defensive holes to patch but could slap the franchise tag on late-blooming pass rusher Haason Reddick. However the 6-2, 232-pound Harris – relatively early as this might be to take a back – seems uniquely suited to ease the load and punishment on QB Kyler Murray (11 rush TDs in 2020) in the red zone. Harris has 50 TDs over the past two seasons, 39 on the ground, but can also the catch the ball (43 receptions in 2020). And with RB Kenyan Drake unsigned, Harris also plugs a spot.\n\n17. Las Vegas Raiders – Jaelan Phillips, DE, Miami (Fla.): He replaced Rousseau in 2020, responding with eight sacks and 15½ tackles for loss. The Raiders only managed 21 sacks in 2020 and desperately need to bolster their pass rush given their inability to close out games.\n\n18. Dolphins – Trevon Moehrig, S, TCU: Miami looks set on the corners with Xavien Howard and Byron Jones but could certainly use help on the back end. Moehrig has nice range, plays with good instincts, can cover and is willing to come up and make a hit – all traits coach Brian Flores would love.\n\n19. Washington Football Team – Jaylen Waddle, WR, Alabama: Yep, he'll make it four Crimson Tide wideouts drafted since 2020, sure to join Smith, Henry Ruggs and Jerry Jeudy. Waddle, who averaged 18.9 yards per catch at 'Bama, would bring the big-play capacity the WFT could use while making defenses that opt to double-cover Terry McLaurin think twice. Waddle can also make a difference on special teams, though the ankle injury that derailed his 2020 season came on a kickoff.\n\n20. Chicago Bears – Rashod Bateman, WR, Minnesota: If they are going to be more than a one-and-done playoff team under Matt Nagy, the Bears simply must improve offensively. Elevated quarterback play is obviously incumbent, but wideout also looms as a priority with Allen Robinson headed for free agency. Bateman has a similar frame (6-2, 210) and similar game.\n\n21. Indianapolis Colts – Christian Darrisaw, OT, Virginia Tech: Anthony Castonzo's retirement leaves a void at left tackle for Indy's otherwise stalwart offensive line. Barring a free agent signing or shuffling All-Pro LG Quenton Nelson outside, the path of least resistance might be drafting steady Darrisaw and leaving the other four starters in place.\n\n22. Tennessee Titans – Kwity Paye, DE, Michigan: He'll need to get more productive off the edge after totaling 11½ sacks in 28 career games for the Wolverines. But Paye appears to have the tools to get better and certainly has the size (6-3, 270) to play in four- or three-man fronts for Tennessee, which managed only 19 sacks in 2020.\n\n23. Jets (from Seattle Seahawks) – Travis Etienne, RB, Clemson: A sweet dual threat out of the backfield, he can be what Le'Veon Bell was supposed to be for this offense. Etienne averaged nearly 1,800 yards from scrimmage and 22 TDs over his final three years with the Tigers and would certainly ease the burden on Darnold, Watson or whoever is New York's next quarterback.\n\n24. Pittsburgh Steelers – Jalen Mayfield, OT, Michigan: It's high time they reinvested in the offensive line, especially with LT Alejandro Villanueva's contract up. Mayfield may not be ready to man the blind side immediately – he did play there at times for the Wolverines – but should be able to lock down the right side right away.\n\n25. Jaguars (from Los Angeles Rams) – Christian Barmore, DT, Alabama: The Jags' 31st-ranked defense is in tatters, but Barmore – he was a wrecking ball against Ohio State in the national championship game – can certainly hasten the rebuild as a three-down interior disruptor.\n\n26. Cleveland Browns – Levi Onwuzurike, DT, Washington: He would be an upgrade over free agent Larry Ogunjobi, able to defend the run and penetrate on passing downs – especially if he's lined up next to DE Myles Garrett and able to exploit one-on-one blocking.\n\n27. Baltimore Ravens – Terrace Marshall Jr., WR, LSU: The offseason began with GM Eric DeCosta answering questions about how he'll improve QB Lamar Jackson's receiving corps. One option is adding Marshall, whose size (6-4, 200) would be a nice foil to diminutive Hollywood Brown's speed. Marshall's production as LSU's No. 1 receiver in 2020 (48 catches for 731 yards and 10 TDs in seven games) mirrored what he did in the No. 3 role in 2019 (46/671/13 in 12 games).\n\n28. New Orleans Saints – Joe Tryon, DE, Washington: Numerous questions in The Big Easy with QB Drew Brees poised to retire, per multiple reports, and a salary cap that needs a major haircut. The defensive line is also going to take a hit with DT Sheldon Rankins and DE Trey Hendrickson (career-high 13½ sacks) both slated to walk. Tryon had eight sacks when he last played in 2019 and would maintain the pass rush depth behind DEs Cam Jordan and Marcus Davenport.\n\n29. Green Bay Packers – Kadarius Toney, WR, Florida: Maybe GM Brian Gutekunst finally gets a bona fide complement to Davante Adams and more help for QB Aaron Rodgers? Toney had a breakout senior year for the Gators, amassing 70 catches for 984 yards and 10 scores. He's got the explosive ability to consistently burn No. 2 corners and should only blossom while learning how to fine-tune his routes with help from the masterful Adams.\n\n30. Buffalo Bills – Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, LB, Notre Dame: The Butkus Award winner as the country's top college linebacker and ACC defensive player of the year in 2020, he's a rangy type who could fill a number of roles as an every-down hybrid for this defense. Owusu-Koramoah will probably have to bulk up his 220-pound build, but he could be a great fit for a team that may not bring LB Matt Milano back.\n\nx-31. Tampa Bay Buccaneers – Daviyon Nixon, DT, Iowa: Depth looms as an issue on the Bucs' D-line, especially if DT Ndamukong Suh, 34, calls it a career or signs elsewhere in the offseason. An interior force, Nixon is fresh off earning Big Ten defensive player of the year honors after posting 5½ sacks and 13½ tackles for loss in eight games.\n\nx-32. Kansas City Chiefs – Tutu Atwell, WR, Louisville: Imagine having DeSean Jackson and Tyreek Hill on the field together ... and with Kelce working underneath. That would basically be the dynamic supremely swift Atwell, listed at 5-9 and 165 pounds, could add to an offense in which he'd only have to beat single coverage. An all-ACC selection in 2019 when he led the conference with 1,272 receiving yards, Atwell would be more than a luxury to K.C., which stands to lose WRs Sammy Watkins and Demarcus Robinson in free agency.\n\nx-Super Bowl 55 winner will select 32nd\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Jennifer Aniston's star-studded 50th birthday party brought out all of Hollywood's stars, from Reese Witherspoon to Robert Downey Jr., but fans were interested in only one attendee in particular: Brad Pitt.\n\nWhat appeared to be the back of Pitt's head was spotted walking into the Sunset Tower Hotel in Los Angeles, the site of his ex-wife's party, held Saturday in Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough it's unclear whether that head actually belonged to Pitt, that didn't stop fans (or E! or People, for that matter) from getting a little excited about the possibility of a reunion of what was once Hollywood's favorite couple.\n\nIt's like a FRIENDs episode!! She's with Ross, then not, then back again!! wrote one fan on Twitter.\n\nOther folks weren't too pleased about Pitt showing up to Aniston's birthday.\n\nThe fact that most commenters are hoping that Jen takes back a man who cheated during their marriage & LEFT her for someone else is seriously disturbing, commented another person.\n\nAniston's former castmates and friends, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow also came out to help the birthday girl ring in her 50th. (Cox's ex, David Arquette, was also allegedly spotted.)\n\nDemi Moore, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom were also photographed outside the hotel while Gwyneth Paltrow (who, like Aniston, counts Pitt as an ex) and Ellen DeGeneres were also reportedly seen.\n\nPitt and Aniston were married from 2000 to 2005. That same year, Pitt began a relationship with his Mr. and Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie. After dating for almost a decade, Pitt and Jolie married in 2014, only to file for divorce two years later. Their split still isn't finalized.\n\nAnother of Aniston's exes, John Mayer, was reportedly spotted, too. But ex-husband, Justin Theroux, from whom she separated last year, was not.\n\nHe did, however, give her a birthday shout-out on Instagram, in honor of her big day.\n\nHappy Birthday to this fierce Woman. Fiercely loving. Fiercely kind. ....and fiercely funny, Theroux captioned a black and white image of Aniston lifting a pair of longhorns over her head. ❤️ you B.\n\nLeave Aniston alone: The star doesn't want or need the public's pity\n\nTheroux breaks silence:Aniston's ex calls split 'the most gentle separation'\n\nPitt/Jolie custody battle: Exes take custody fight over their six kids to a 'private' trial
While reviewing the latest season of Netflix's Grace and Frankie to prep for this interview with Sam Waterston, we noticed that the actress playing the marriage counselor to Waterston's character is Lorraine Toussaint, a veteran guest star from the early seasons of … (dun dun) Law & Order.\n\nI guess Law & Order is connected to everything, we said aloud.\n\nAnd everything is connected to Law & Order, confirms Waterston, who returns as District Attorney Jack McCoy Wednesday on L&O spinoff Special Victims Unit (9 ET/PT) for the first time since the original series ended in 2010. He's back to deliver the eulogy for Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty), the first prosecutor on Dick Wolf's long-running New York crime procedural.\n\nMore:Sam Waterston set to appear on 'L&O: SVU'\n\nI literally got chills when Sam walked onto the set, Michael Chernuchin, a longtime writer on the original series and the current executive producer on SVU, now in its 19th season, says in an email to USA TODAY. Once we got past the 'hellos' and settled into work, it was like he never left and Law & Order was in its 37th year.\n\nWaterston returns in time for a Law & Order rite of passage: A cast change. Rafael Barba (Raúl Esparza), the assistant DA since Season 15, becomes personally involved in a right-to-die case, requiring McCoy to step in and appoint a pinch-hitter to try the case: Stone's adult son, Peter (Philip Winchester, from Dick Wolf's Chicago franchise). He'll step in as prosecutor while Barba does some soul-searching.\n\nThis episode thrusts the SVU characters into a moral dilemma the likes of which they haven't before experienced, explains Chernuchin. Who better to lend a Solomonic ear than DA Jack McCoy, who has spent the past three decades (some of it off-screen) in a universe painted in various shades of gray? His wit and wisdom more than holds up in the current social and ethical climate.\n\nWhile McCoy was dispensing justice offscreen the last eight years, Waterston was keeping up a busy schedule well into his 70s. He's done multiple Shakespeare plays onstage, played a cable news president in HBO's The Newsroom and a lobbyist in the film Miss Sloane. And in 2015, he began a foray into streaming TV with a pair of Netflix projects: the critically praised Western Godless and Emmy-nominated dramedy Grace and Frankie.\n\nWaterston says he's delighted by the opportunity to flex some long-dormant comic muscle as Sol Bergstein, a touchy-feely type who comes out of the closet after 40 years, leaving his hippie wife (Lily Tomlin) to marry his WASPy-law partner Robert (Martin Sheen), who divorces his equally uptight spouse (Jane Fonda).\n\nIt was an easy pitch for him.\n\nYou're saying you'd like me to work with Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda and Martin Sheen? he recalls. That was enough in itself. The rest didn't matter. But what it's about is interesting; cool and hip and fun.\n\nNow that he's on a show about seniors, he's even open to the idea of a story line involving Old Glory, the company from his cult-favorite 1995 Saturday Night Live ad that sold old people insurance against robot attacks. Perhaps now they could sell insurance against attacks by Russian bots or self-driving cars?\n\nOoh, tell the writers, he laughs.\n\nAlthough he's enjoyed the last eight years of his career, which have been filled with roles nobody could have imagined, Waterston's fine with being recognized for Law & Order.\n\nPeople remember it, and I'm glad that they do, he says. It continues on in reruns, one network after another. It's probably the longest-lasting thing I've ever had anything to do with.\n\nBut what he's actually proudest of is helping rebuild the TV industry in New York.\n\nAfter TV production in New York City was almost dead, (Law & Order) was the show that proved that you could do TV in New York and that it could work, he says. And it has spawned a whole new industry there and it is an exemplar of a wonderful framework for telling really good stories.
Jayme Deerwester\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nChuck Barris, the man who gave us game shows like The Newlywed Game and The Gong Show, has died at 87.\n\nPublicist Paul Shefrin, speaking on behalf of Barris' family, confirmed to the Associated Press that the self-proclaimed King of Daytime Television died at his home in Palisades Park, N.Y.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1929, Charles Barris had a hardscrabble youth after his dentist father died of a stroke, leaving his family destitute.\n\nHe graduated from what is now Drexel University in 1953 and worked odd jobs until he found his way into television through a short-lived entry level position at NBC, which he followed with a gig at ABC. It was there that he began building his game-show empire.\n\nDuring this period, Barris wrote the 1962 hit song Palisades Park, which was recorded by Freddy Cannon, but his true calling was game shows.\n\nHe made an immediate impact on the genre with The Dating Game, which premiered in 1966 and featured a young woman or man posing tongue-in-cheek risqué questions to three prospective dates who were hidden behind a screen. Jim Lange served as the original host and Chuck Woolery emceed the show during its final years.\n\nThe Dating Game also introduced several future celebrities to the audience, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sally Field, John Ritter and a pre-Charlie's Angels Farrah Fawcett.\n\nBarris also created and hosted The Gong Show (1976-1980), which was synonymous with 1970s game-show kitsch.\n\nThe Gong Show, a progenitor of America's Got Talent, repackaged vaudeville for TV, with assorted acts of varying talent levels auditioning on air. Instead of receiving three strikes and being torn to shreds by Simon Cowell, Barris would beat a gong and the condemned performer would be mocked by B-list celebs.\n\nA number of stars avoided getting gonged and went on to become famous: comedians Steve Martin and Paul Pee-wee Herman Reubens; country musician BoxCar Willie; Cheryl Lynn, who would go on to record the disco hit Got to Be Real; and Andrea McArdle, who would originate the title role of Annie on Broadway in 1977.\n\nBarris was the Mark Burnett of his day, supplying network TV with 27 hours worth of game-show programming at his peak. But by 1980, he realized his heyday was coming to an end and sold his production company for a reported $100 million.\n\nHis next undertaking, movie production, was not as successful and his Gong Show Movie adaptation stayed in theaters for only one week.\n\nThat brought on a crisis of confidence and Barris holed up in a New York hotel for two months writing his 1984 memoir Confessions of A Dangerous Mind, in which he claimed to have been a CIA assassin. It was adapted into a 2002 film directed by George Clooney.\n\nHe would write three other books, including 1993's The Game Show King: A Confession and 2004's Bad Grass Never Dies: A Sequel to Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.\n\nIts claims that a game-show host spent his spare time traveling the world taking out bad guys were met with raised eyebrows.\n\nIt sounds like he has been standing too close to the gong all those years, quipped CIA spokesman Tom Crispell. Chuck Barris has never been employed by the CIA and the allegation that he was a hired assassin is absurd.\n\nBarris took the CIA's response as tacit confirmation, noting, Have you ever heard the CIA acknowledge someone was an assassin?\n\nBarris was married three times: first to Lyn Levy, the niece of a CBS founder, which lasted from 1957-1976. The marriage produced Barris' only child, daughter Della, who died of a drug overdose in 1998 at age 36.\n\nIn 2010, he wrote about her substance-abuse struggles in Della: A Memoir of My Daughter.\n\nIn 1980, he married Robin Altman; they divorced in 1999 and he married his third and final wife, Mary, in 2000.\n\nThat year, he also suffered a health crisis: part of one lung had to be removed due to cancer and a post-operative infection led to a month in intensive care.\n\nContributing: Joscelyn Payne and Bob Thomas, Associated Press
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nReeltown: The baptism of high school football players on the 50-yard line in their football stadium has drawn complaints from a group that pushes for separation of church and state. After more than two dozen Reeltown High School players were baptized on the field in November, the Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation demanded an investigation. There is a strong relationship between conservative Protestantism and football at the high school and college level, said Michael Altman, a religious studies professor at the University of Alabama. Altman said the Wisconsin group is doing its best to call attention to a practice it finds unconstitutional by trying to take a local story national. Tallapoosa County Schools Superintendent Joe Windle told Al.com he found no wrongdoing. The baptism was not conducted by the school, he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Smoke has risen miles above a volcano on one of the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Volcano Observatory says. Lava flowed down the side of Shishaldin Volcano on Unimak Island on Saturday, and smoke rose more than 5 miles high Sunday, Anchorage Daily News reports. The National Weather Service issued an alert for pilots Sunday, as plumes were recorded 30,000 feet in elevation and extending up to 90 miles east. The volcano observatory tweeted late Sunday that the ash emissions ended about 8:30 p.m. The largest island on the Aleutian chain, Unimak is 120 miles northeast of Unalaska Island and about 700 miles west of Anchorage. The same volcano erupted two weeks ago, officials say. The volcano was quiet until seismic activity increased Friday, says geologist Tim Orr of the volcano observatory.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has agreed to pay $100,000 to settle a lawsuit by a former corrections officer who alleged his coworkers and supervisors repeatedly harassed him over his status as a transgender man. The lawsuit, which was tentatively settled Thursday, alleged colleagues used derogatory terms to refer to the officer and put his safety at risk by revealing to inmates that he had undergone a gender transition. The officer, who filed the lawsuit under a pseudonym due to safety and privacy concerns, alleged that the Department of Corrections responded inadequately to his complaints and that the harassment continued after he was transferred to another facility. Unable to tolerate the harassment, the officer resigned in 2016 after working nearly 11 years in state prisons in Florence and Douglas, according to the suit.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: CLL16 – a new high-yield, long-grain Clearfield rice variety developed by the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture – will be available to rice growers from Horizon Ag in 2021. Karen Moldenhauer, professor and rice breeder for the Division of Agriculture's Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, says CLL16 has excellent rough rice yields, averaging 205 bushels per acre, slightly better than Diamond, which averages 204 bushels per acre. CLL16 is resistant to blast in Arkansas growing conditions, Moldenhauer says. It has demonstrated good milling yields, averaging 63% whole kernel and 69% total milled rice for samples from Arkansas Rice Performance Trials across the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Homeless mothers who were evicted last week from a house where they were squatting plan to move back after speculators agreed to sell the property to a nonprofit organization, it was announced Monday. Wedgewood Inc. will sell the home to the Oakland Community Land Trust, which buys and fixes up property for affordable housing. The group plans to allow women from the group Moms 4 Housing to return, Mayor Libby Schaaf announced. The city helped negotiate the agreement with the land trust and Wedgewood after a public outcry following the evictions. This is what happens when we organize, when people come together to build the beloved community, Dominique Walker of Moms 4 Housing said in a statement on the holiday honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Today we honor Dr. King's radical legacy by taking Oakland back from banks and corporations. Wedgewood also agreed to work with the city to negotiate a right-of-first-refusal program for all its other Oakland properties, a city statement said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A sheriff's deputy who was pulled over by state troopers while driving three prisoners in a transport van has been charged with traffic offenses including reckless endangerment, authorities said Monday. Denver Sheriff Department Deputy James Grimes was charged following an investigation into the alleged aggressive driving incident, the Colorado State Patrol said. Grimes and the driver of a second vehicle were allegedly racing in and out of traffic as they traveled northbound on Interstate 25 on Thursday while under observation by a state patrol aircraft. Grimes faces additional charges of reckless driving and speeding in a construction zone. Grimes and another deputy who was with him in the prisoner van have been reassigned and placed on leave pending an internal investigation, the Denver Sheriff Department said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State lawmakers plan to resurrect a bipartisan proposal that attempts to help older workers who often face age discrimination when seeking employment. The bill would prohibit employers from requiring a job applicant to list their date of birth and school graduation years, information that reveals a worker's age even though prospective employers are not allowed to ask about age during interviews. Supporters said the legislation is aimed at addressing the discrimination older online job applicants often face. West Hartford Sen. Derek Slap, a Democrat, said this move could level the playing field for older workers in Connecticut and give them a chance once they get into the application process to get that interview and make a case. Slap said Connecticut has the sixth-oldest workforce in the U.S. Recent U.S. Census Bureau data show more than a quarter of the state's workforce is over age 54.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Legislation aimed at settling a minor controversy involving dogs and eating establishments has passed the state House of Representatives without a dissenting vote and now goes to the Senate for consideration. The bill has broad bipartisan support, with more than a third of the General Assembly sponsoring or co-sponsoring the measure. House Bill 275 specifies that the owner of a food establishment may permit leashed dogs in the business' outdoor patio area or beer garden, regardless of any state regulation to the contrary. The Delaware Division of Public Health inadvertently sparked controversy last summer when it took a renewed interest in an existing state regulation that prohibits pets in food establishments, including in outdoor areas. The ban does not apply to service animals.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A local startup is betting the skies are the future of food delivery with no delivery fees, no tips, and no worries for rumbling stomachs hoping to avoid getting so hungry that the sensation turns to anger, WUSA-TV reports. Shehan Weeraman and Nick Adimi named their company Hangry after becoming annoyed and exasperated by homemade food. We got really lazy to cook, and we just decided to order a lot, Weeraman says. We realized we were paying like $10, sometimes more, for delivery that would take us sometimes over an hour to arrive. The engine that drives this enterprise is a drone with a basket attached by a rope to the bottom. Hangry plans to partner with area restaurants and other establishments to deliver its products. Users would be able to meet the pilotless aircraft at a designated drop site, then scan a QR code to pick up their food.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Invasive iguanas burrowing into the soft dirt around an aging dam have cost the city $1.8 million in emergency repairs. Employees noticed last year that water was seeping around the edges of a decades-old weir that controls water delivery in West Palm Beach, the Palm Beach Post reports. South Florida's green iguana population has exploded since the last prolonged cold spell in 2010 reduced their numbers. They've become infamous for nuisance pool pooping and munching on ornamental landscapes, giving rise to a cottage industry of iguana-removal experts. They are also becoming an issue for agencies in charge of managing the hundreds of miles of canals that channel water throughout South Florida, says William Kern, an associate professor in the entomology and nematology department at the University of Florida's Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: One of Republican Brian Kemp's first acts as governor involved revamping the state's handling of sexual harassment complaints and placing State Inspector General Deborah Wallace in charge of the issue. Kemp now wants to expand Wallace's office, adding $435,182 to fund five new positions in his proposed fiscal 2021 budget, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Kemp's budget proposal must be approved by lawmakers. The expansion, which would represent a 43% budget increase for the small agency, comes as other state agencies are being asked to trim their budgets amid a revenue shortfall. Kemp also proposed an additional $250,000 in the current year's budget, as the agency already brought on new staff to handle complaints.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man suspected of stabbing a woman and killing two police officers last weekend wandered his neighborhood recording people with a camera mounted on his hat and rigged a barbecue grill to blow thick smoke directly into neighbors' windows, a lawyer for residents said. Jaroslav Jerry Hanel, a handyman who lived in the home in exchange for his work and faced eviction, stabbed a woman in the leg Sunday before he fired on responding authorities, killing Honolulu Police Officers Tiffany Enriquez and Kaulike Kalama, police said. A fire at Hanel's residence then spread through a normally peaceful neighborhood at the far end of the famed Waikiki Beach neighborhood. It was pretty clear he was out of control, said attorney David Hayakawa, who represented three neighbors in obtaining restraining orders against Hanel. Police have said Hanel is missing, and they're almost certain he's inside the burned house.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A lawmaker says that Chicken Dinner Road in southwestern Idaho is a historic name and that he is opposed to an animal protection group's request to rename it. Republican Rep. Scott Syme on Monday introduced a concurrent resolution urging fellow lawmakers to support the existing name. Concurrent resolutions do not need the signature of the governor and don't have the force of law. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in July asked Caldwell officials to change the name to what it said is the kinder and simpler Chicken Road. Syme said the original name stems from a 1930s resident famous for her chicken dinners who helped persuade then-Democratic Gov. C. Ben Ross to improve the road in Canyon County.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signed a law that eliminates driver's license suspensions for most non-moving violations. The Democrat signed the License to Work Act last week. It takes effect in July. Pritzker says it will allow tens of thousands of motorists to have driving privileges reinstated. That means more people will be able to work. Illinois now recognizes the fact that suspending licenses for having too many unpaid tickets, fines and fees doesn't necessarily make a person pay the bill, but it does mean that people don't have a way to pay, Pritzker said. He said license suspensions are too harsh a penalty for a practice that reinforces cycles of instability. Each year authorities suspend more than 50,000 licenses belonging to people who can't afford to pay tickets, fines and fees. According to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a study shows 42% of those who had their licenses suspended lost their jobs.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Hoosiers' electricity bills could rise and several state utilities may face obstacles in their plans to phase out coal-based power generation in the coming years under politically charged legislation that would help a struggling Indiana industry. House Bill 1414, filed last week by state Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, would require Indiana utilities to prove that any plans to shut down a power plant are either required by a federal mandate or otherwise in the public interest. Though the word coal does not appear in the language of the bill, advocates and analysts say the legislation specifically targets coal-burning plants. The proposed regulatory requirement follows similar but unsuccessful legislation last year and is raising concerns among not only environmentalists but also some conservatives who see it as heavy-handed favoritism.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: City leaders are condemning a homeowner's snow display depicting a figure gunning down a snowman wearing a Bernie Sanders shirt and another adorned with a Democratic Party hat. Mayor Mike Matson said he's asked the police chief to investigate the display. My personal reaction is that it's terribly wrong and an embarrassment to our city, Matson told the Quad-City Times. Homeowner Donald Hesseltine laughed off such concerns, saying he created the display to mess with friends who support Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president. It's just to make people cry I guess, Hesseltine said. They're crying, so I win. The display includes a mannequin topped with a military helmet that's holding a rifle and chainsaw, as well as a can of beer. The rifle is pointed toward the Sanders snowman, which has red-dyed snow near its head.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The University of Kansas will close its School of Languages, Literatures and Cultures, but departments within the school will remain open, and students will not be affected, according to a school official. The closing at the end of the academic year will change only the administrative structure for languages at Kansas, said John Colombo, interim dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The degree offerings and curriculum will not be affected, he said. Budget problems prompted the closing, The Lawrence Journal-World reports. One staff position will be lost because of the closing. The director and co-director of the school will return to their respective positions within their academic units, Colombo said in an email. The creation of the school about five years ago did not increase enrollment for language departments or raise substantial private support to sustain the language programs as anticipated, he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nHenderson: Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear have teamed up on an effort to expand the new Green River National Wildlife Refuge in western Kentucky. The two leaders on Tuesday announced the approval of federal Duck Stamp funding for land acquisition to expand the wildlife refuge. Duck Stamps can be purchased by hunters, conservationists and stamp collectors. The stamps provide revenue to support federal conservation and outdoor recreation. Last November, federal and state officials announced the wildlife refuge's establishment with the acquisition of the first tract – a 10-acre parcel donated by the Southern Conservation Corp. McConnell and Beshear discussed the issue before the new governor took office. Beshear has since given his approval so Duck Stamp funding can be used to support land acquisition from willing property sellers to expand the refuge.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Revenue from food and drinks has increased from a new $1 billion terminal at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, according to a recent report, which could mean more flights are added in the future. There was a 32% increase in food and beverage revenue in November 2019, compared to November 2018, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. The new terminal opened Nov. 6. A 46% revenue increase from drinking and dining options was recorded in December 2019, compared to the year before. The numbers were included in a report to the New Orleans Aviation Board last week, airport spokeswoman Erin Burns said. More non-airline revenue means it's cheaper for carriers to fly in and out of the airport, and thus the airport is more attractive for airlines considering adding flights, the newspaper reports.\n\nMaine\n\nYarmouth: A massive elm tree nicknamed Herbie is long gone, but it will live on, thanks to cloned trees being made available to the public. At 110 feet and more than 200 years, Herbie was the tallest and oldest elm in New England and survived 14 bouts of Dutch elm disease thanks to the devotion of his centenarian caretaker, Frank Knight, the late tree warden of Yarmouth. The duo became famous after Knight spent half of his life caring for the tree, which he referred to as an old friend. Knight realized he couldn't save the town's elms as they succumbed by the hundreds to Dutch elm disease. So he focused his efforts on Herbie. Over five decades, Knight oversaw selective pruning of Herbie's diseased limbs, plus applications of insecticides and fungicides. The tree was cut down Jan. 19, 2010, as the 101-year-old Knight looked on. Knight died two years later. But before Herbie was chopped down, the Elm Research Institute in New Hampshire worked with Knight to collect some cuttings from Herbie to preserve the tree's legacy with clones. The hope is that Herbie's descendants will have some resistance to Dutch elm disease.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: As rising seas drive saltwater farther inland, state officials are urging local governments, drinking water suppliers, farmers and others to start preparing now for a saltier future. Gov. Larry Hogan's administration in December released the state's first plan to combat saltwater intrusion. The 76-page report doesn't forecast how widely impacts will be felt, citing a lack of existing research, but it identifies the resources facing the highest risk, ranking agriculture at the top. Wetlands, coastal forests, freshwater streams and aquifers also are in danger of turning salty, according to the report. Melting ice at the poles and the ocean's thermal expansion – both triggered by climate change – are causing seas to rise across the globe, carrying salt into new places above and below ground. Saltwater intrusion is of even greater concern in the Chesapeake Bay region, climate scientists say, because the area's land surface is sinking.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: No Charlie Card required to board these MBTA trains – just about $500 cash. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is auctioning off seven vintage subway cars. To make room for hundreds of news cars coming in the years ahead and to comply with safety laws, the MBTA removes salvageable parts from inoperable trains, then puts the cars up for auction. The old cars are sold to the highest bidder, usually for the scrap metal, MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo told The Boston Globe. Old cars are retired after they are no longer capable of providing safe and reliable passenger service. Made by Boeing and Kinkisharyo in the early 1970s and '80s, the cars have sat idle for at least three years, according to the auction posting. Bidding for the lot of seven cars – Orange Line subway cars and Green Line trolley cars – starts at $500. The auction ends Jan. 28.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A national competition is underway that seeks artists' proposals for a planned public sculpture outside the main entrance to the TCF Center downtown. The Detroit Regional Convention Facility Authority and its Art Foundation say the proposals for the permanent sculpture cannot be taller than 30 feet and no more than 8 feet in diameter. Artists must register for the competition and are encouraged to consider physical placement, material and size in their proposals. Themes may reflect positive changes and growth in Detroit and southeastern Michigan, the area's strong spirit of innovation and design, the global impact of Detroit, and the region's renaissance. Proposals will be reviewed by a jury of expert panelists. The winning proposal will be awarded a budget of $250,000 to support the sculpture's conceptualization, fabrication and installment. An additional $50,000 will go to the winning artist.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: State troopers will be carrying more than 600 kits to give to homeless people who need clothes, food and toiletries. The Department of Public Safety collected donations and assembled them into Care and Go kits. A lot of times people will think it's just a metro issue, said Booker Hodges, assistant commissioner of law enforcement in the Department of Public Safety. In greater Minnesota, our troopers do encounter quite a few people who are homeless. Hodges said he wanted to start the program in the Department of Public Safety after seeing a similar initiative used in Ramsey County for recently released inmates. Hodges said he hopes to have kits in place by Feb. 1. He said the goal is that every state trooper will have one in his or her squad car. The kits include socks, T-shirts, toothpaste, conditioners, hand wipes and feminine products. They also include protein bars and water.\n\nMississippi\n\nMeridian: The state will pay $3 million for a fence to keep wild animals off the runways of a military base. A Navy official said the state's job-creation agency, Mississippi Development Authority, has offered a grant to pay for the barrier at Naval Air Station Meridian. The new chain-link fence would be built inside an existing fence surrounding the base, and the bottom of the new fence will be buried deep, the Meridian Star reports. Deer, cattle, hogs and coyotes have reached the property in recent years, and a farmer reported that a hunter killed a sow near the fence last month, said Jim Copeland, community planning and liaison officer for the base. Pigs have a low center of gravity and can cause a plane to lose control if they are hit by the nose wheel, Copeland said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday gutted a voter ID law that has been called a solution in search of a problem. In a 5-2 decision, the court cleared the way for Missourians to vote with non-photo IDs like current utility bills and bank statements, as well as Missouri college IDs, without having to swear they are who they say they are on penalty of perjury. Republican politicians had said the law combats voter fraud. Studies say the kind of fraud voter ID detects is practically nonexistent. Judge Mary R. Russell wrote for the majority Tuesday that the sworn statement requirement was misleading, contradictory and ultimately unconstitutional. Two dissenting judges, both appointed by Republicans, argued that the court could fix the issue by editing out contradictory language or prohibiting voting with non-photo ID entirely. Russell called both ideas nonsensical.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal environmental regulators say the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs violated an order to repair a public water supply system serving about 1,300 people on the Crow Indian Reservation. Environmental Protection Agency officials said in a letter that the bureau has repeatedly missed deadlines to complete repairs following concerns last spring about potential water contamination. Last March, a main line on the Crow Agency water system broke, prompting an advisory for users to boil water or use alternate supplies as a precaution. The concern was that loss of pressure because of the line break could have allowed contaminated water to seep into the system through cracks and joints. EPA spokeswoman Lisa McClain-Vanderpool says the Bureau of Indian Affairs has completed enough required work that there is no longer an imminent public health danger.\n\nNebraska\n\nWaverly: A woman who fell off a bridge while stargazing has been transferred from a Lincoln hospital to one in Omaha, authorities said. Lindsay Kroger, 37, of rural Lincoln, had gone with five other people to the bridge about 2 miles southeast of Waverly to look at the sky early Sunday morning. She leaned back, thinking there was a support piece behind her, but instead fell 27 feet to the ice below, the Lancaster County Sheriff's Office said. She was flown to a Lincoln hospital and then sent Monday to the Omaha facility.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Organizers of a protest of new city ordinances affecting the homeless say 12 demonstrators were taken into custody. About 100 protesters blocked a downtown street Monday to voice their opposition to two laws that ban camping. They had tents, sleeping bags and cardboard boxes. One ordinance prohibits camping on sidewalks if there are available beds at a shelter. The second bans sitting or camping on city sidewalks during street cleaning hours. Violation of either law could result in a misdemeanor. Police Lt. Jeff Stuart says about a dozen people were arrested after they refused to move from the road. It was not immediately known Tuesday what charges they might face. Opponents of the ordinances have been protesting since the first ordinance was passed in November. Supporters of the measures say they are necessary for public safety and sanitation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is holding a weeklong celebration of wine. New Hampshire Wine Week includes the 17th annual Winter Wine Spectacular, which benefits EasterSeals New Hampshire. The event, on Thursday, attracts more than 1,500 guests who get to sample more than 1,800 wines. A new event, Cellar Notes: An Evening of Wine and Music, will be held Wednesday evening at the Rex Theater in Manchester. It will feature a panel discussion and tasting.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJackson: An ad in the Waze navigation app is misdirecting motorists headed to Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa into the wilderness of New Jersey's Pine Barrens, police said. Jackson Township police posted on Facebook that officers in recent weeks have had to help motorists who followed the directions into the Colliers Mills Wildlife Management Area, where they became stuck on unpaved roads. The wildlife area is comprised of more than 12,000 acres, mainly located in Jackson and Plumsted townships, which is about 45 miles away from the actual Borgata Casino in Atlantic City, police said. The Borgata is off the Atlantic City Expressway. According to police, the problem stems from an orange ad logo in the Waze app. The address on the ad is correct, police said, but the location pinned with the ad is actually in the Colliers Mills wildlife area, police said. Waze was working to fix the problem, police said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Democrat-led Legislature is looking for new ways to bolster a lagging public education system and open up new economic opportunities by legalizing recreational marijuana and providing tuition-free college education, as a 30-day legislative session begins Tuesday. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is pushing for new investments in public education that include $74 million in new annual general fund spending on early childhood programs. She's also calling for the state to underwrite tuition-free college education for residents. A state scholarship fund from lottery proceeds already covers 60% of in-state tuition, and at least $35 million is needed to cover the remainder plus fees. Record-setting oil production is producing an economic windfall for state government, with state economists forecasting an $800 million budget surplus.\n\nNew York\n\nBattenville: The state is planning restoration work on the early childhood home of women's rights advocate Susan B. Anthony. The house Anthony's father built in 1833 in Battenville is water-damaged and in rough shape. The state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation bought the foreclosed property in 2006 but has done little to preserve it. The Albany Times-Union reports the agency now plans to invest $700,000 this year on the Greek Revival-style house where Anthony lived from age 6 to 19 when her father managed a nearby cotton mill. The official Susan B. Anthony Museum and House is in Rochester, where she lived for 40 years while she was a national figure in the women's rights and suffrage movement. No plans have been developed yet for the Battenville house, beyond preserving it. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right to vote, as well as the 200th anniversary of Anthony's birth.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: An appeals court on Tuesday upheld the legality of a legislative session Republicans quickly called in December 2016 to push through laws that weakened the power of incoming Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The unanimous decision of three judges on the intermediate-level Court of Appeals affirmed a 2018 trial-court ruling that declined to declare as unconstitutional the procedures used in calling and passing legislation during the three-day session. The group Common Cause and several citizens who sued in 2017 argued that the rushed session – announced and convened mere hours after another legislative session on Hurricane Matthew relief – violated their right in the North Carolina Constitution to instruct their representatives. The GOP-dominated General Assembly used it to pass laws that in part diluted the governor's powers.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new agreement between the state and Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation means bighorn sheep could be roaming the reservation in the next couple weeks. North Dakota Game and Fish director Terry Steinwand says 30 to 40 bighorns will be brought to North Dakota once they are captured on a Montana reservation. They'll be released in the Mandaree and Twin Buttes areas. The Bismarck Tribune says the state-tribal agreement includes a provision for a ram hunting season. Williams says that will depend on how well the animals do in their new habitat. The pact is the third such agreement between the state and the tribal nation. The others are twin agreements with MHA Nation in 2008 related to hunting and fishing access issues and a 2017 pact with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe for an elk hunting season.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court has rejected a recommendation that tools used to measure offenders' suitability for being released after an arrest be made available to all judges as they make bail decisions. Requiring the availability of so-called risk assessment tools was the top recommendation of a task force commissioned by the court last year to examine Ohio's bail system. The tools – there are several nationally – look at a variety of factors, including defendants' age, criminal history and past failures to appear, when analyzing what type of bond conditions should be set. More than 70 courts in Ohio already use them. Supporters say the tools are a more accurate way to examine the two most important factors that judges consider when setting bond: Will the offender skip out, and will they pose a public safety risk if released? Detractors say the tools can be racially biased, are costly to smaller courts and improperly override judges' own experiences in setting bond.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A lawmaker is seeking to repeal the state's controversial permitless carry law that took effect last year. Rep. Jason Lowe, D-Oklahoma City, who tried to prevent permitless carry from taking effect, filed legislation to repeal the law that allows most Oklahomans to carry a firearm without a permit. The legislation faces unfavorable odds in Oklahoma's Republican-controlled Legislature, where majorities in both the House and Senate overwhelmingly approved of permitless carry last year. The Legislature also passed similar legislation in 2018, which was vetoed by then-Gov. Mary Fallin. House Bill 3357 would repeal the permitless carry law dubbed by supporters as constitutional carry.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A beloved but decaying piece of artwork created from an industrial eyesore faces limited, costly options, according to an action plan from the city. Restoring Eco-Earth, the massive mosaic tile sculpture at Riverfront Park, would cost an estimated $475,000, and removing what was once an acid ball and repurposing the site would ring in at $680,000. What would that say about Salem if they scrapped it? said former Mayor Roger Gertenrich, who chaired the Eco-Earth project 20 years ago. The community turned the 25-foot-diameter black tank from the long-gone Boise Cascade paper mill into a colorful, one-of-a-kind globe. It once held liquid and chemical gases used to cook wood chips into pulp and has been a fixture of the riverfront since 1960, when the tank was floated up the Willamette River from Portland. Volunteers logged more than 30,000 hours to transform it, but more than 86,000 tiles have failed, and asbestos has been revealed underneath. Eco-Earth's fate lies with the Salem Public Art Commission.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGreensburg: A defense attorney says he expects to appeal the murder conviction of a man who asserts that his now-deceased twin brother was the shooter. Jurors in Westmoreland County deliberated for about two hours Friday before convicting 30-year-old Darrelle Tolbert-McGhee of first-degree murder in the shooting death of 32-year-old Michael Wilson. McGhee had asserted that he was in Florida at the time of the April 2017 slaying in downtown Jeannette. He said the shooter was his twin brother, Dwayne, who was killed in a shooting 13 months later in Wilkinsburg. The Tribune-Review reports that defense attorney Tim Dawson said he was surprised by the speed of the verdict. Apparently, they convinced the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that one identical twin committed the murder rather than the other, Dawson said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: A woman is taking legal action against the city for handcuffing and arresting her 13-year-old daughter after a fight with another student, the American Civil Liberties Union says. Tre'sur Johnson, an honors student who had no prior disciplinary infractions, was charged with disorderly conduct and kept in a police station holding cell for about an hour last June, ACLU lawyer Shannah Kurland said at a news conference Monday. The ACLU is representing the girl's mother, Tiqua Johnson, who is seeking $100,000 for physical pain, emotional distress and other damages. The school and police violated state law that bars the arrest of someone on misdemeanor charges, Kurland said. The brief confrontation at Goff Middle School involved physical contact, Kurland said, but neither student was hurt, and it was quickly broken up.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Twenty-four years ago, the Greenville County Council passed a resolution, with three members opposed, condemning homosexuality as incompatible with their community values. Today, an Upstate group representing members of county's LGBTQ community says it is time for the current County Council to reverse that action. Terena Starks, the diversity officer for Upstate Pride, together with the board of her organization sent an open letter Thursday to every member of the council. The letter, which is posted on the organization's website, also links to a change.org petition, which by late Friday had drawn more than 1,200 signatures. Upstate Pride has gotten more active over the past year, most notably with the Upstate Pride Festival last summer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary are trying to raise money and awareness about Native American women who are crime victims. The nonprofit organization Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women says Native American women are more than twice as likely to experience violence as any other demographic. The inmates made 200 pairs of earrings and raised $5,000, which they donated to Urban Indian and Health of Sioux Falls and Rapid City. Connie Hopkins, vice president of prisoner support, tells KELO-TV the money will be used in a variety of ways to bring awareness to what some say is an epidemic when it comes to Native American women. It's going to help them get more media out there or pay for fliers or to help people travel to go look for these women, Hopkins said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The state's college athletes could financially benefit from the use of their names, images and likenesses under legislation introduced by a pair of lawmakers from the city. The bill would allow athletes to sign contracts to advertise for local businesses or other companies and would also prohibit schools from discriminating against players based on donations by coaches to universities. It's time we treat college athletes like everyone else in America and allow them to earn money in the free market, Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, said in a statement. Kelsey and Rep. Antonio Parkinson, D-Memphis, each brought the legislation to their respective chambers months after a University of Memphis basketball player, James Wiseman, was suspended by the NCAA.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of foster care children who slept in state offices, hotels and other temporary housing spiked last year, as the child welfare system continues to grapple with recruiting and retaining specialized foster homes. Last year, the monthly count of foster care children who did not have a home for at least two nights totaled 678, a 49% increase from 2018, according to data from Child Protective Services. Many of them were teens, and most slept in state offices. The number of foster children without placements has increased every year but two since 2011. The problem became particularly acute last year amid the loss of 197 foster beds across the state, lengthier discharges from residential treatment centers, and an uptick over the summer in foster youth who rejected the placements assigned to them.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A new survey has found that in the Beehive State more than anywhere else in the nation, divorce doesn't necessarily mean contention. USAWillGuru.com, which provides will and testament information, surveyed 5,000 divorcees across the country and asked if the divorce ended on good terms. Utah has the highest percentage of amicable breakups at 79%. Neighboring Nevada ranked the lowest, with only 15% saying their marriage ended amicably. The survey also looked at what percentage of divorcees include their ex in their will. According to the survey's findings, 12% of divorced Utahans include former spouses in their will. Loni Stookey, a licensed marriage and family therapist in St. George, said there's a strong family element in Utah that may contribute to why parents try to split on good terms.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House on Tuesday unanimously approved a proposed constitutional amendment to make clear that Vermont prohibits slavery. The Senate passed the proposal last session. Vermont was the first state to abolish adult slavery. The state Constitution currently says no person 21 or older should serve as a slave unless bound by their own consent or by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like. The amendment would remove that language and add that slavery and indentured servitude in any form are prohibited. The proposed constitutional amendment must be considered by the 2021-2022 Legislature. If it passes, the question will be go before Vermont voters in 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state Senate has advanced legislation to scrap the state's Lee-Jackson holiday celebrating two Confederate generals. The Democratic-led Senate voted largely along party lines Tuesday to pass legislation that would make Election Day a state holiday instead of Lee-Jackson Day. The legislation now goes to the House for consideration. Lee-Jackson Day, established more than 100 years ago, is observed annually on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January. It honors Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas Stonewall Jackson, both native Virginians. Critics of the Lee-Jackson holiday view it as a celebration of the state's slaveholding history that's offensive to African Americans. Many cities and counties have opted not to observe it.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State Attorney General Bob Ferguson is challenging the lavish personal spending of bankrupt anti-tax activist and candidate for governor Tim Eyman, saying Eyman's assets must be preserved so he can pay his debts to the state. Eyman's been spending an average of nearly $24,000 a month over the past year, The Seattle Times reports, citing his bankruptcy filings. At the same time, the state is seeking more than $3 million from Eyman, including $230,000 in contempt-of-court sanctions for failing to cooperate with Ferguson's campaign-finance case against him. Eyman's expenses include legal fees, a vacation to Orlando, rent on a Bellevue condo, $4,000 a month in unspecified business spending and at least $2,400 to buy 97 Starbucks gift cards during a 10-month span. The first month after filing for bankruptcy, he ate out on 20 days. Last February, he made 74 restaurant purchases. Last month, Eyman reported meals at three separate restaurants to celebrate his birthday.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: People interested in portraying historical figures for the West Virginia Humanities Council's History Alive program can submit proposals through Feb. 1. The council is seeking proposals for portrayals of influential people who have made important contributions to state, national or international history. The roster of characters now includes Gabriel Arthur, Nellie Bly, Thomas Stonewall Jackson, Ostenaco, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Charles Schulz, Harriet Tubman and Mark Twain, The Herald-Dispatch reports. The council will consider portrayals of historically significant people who are no longer living, from any period in history.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: All day care centers, child care providers and children's camps would have to test their water for lead under a bill the state Senate approved Tuesday. Current state law requires anyone who cares for at least four children under age 7 less than 24 hours a day to obtain a license from the state Department of Children and Families. The state agriculture department licenses recreational and educational camps. Under the bill, child care center operators, child care providers, group home operators and camp runners would have to test water from every source in their facilities for lead contamination to obtain or renew their licenses. If the water is contaminated, the applicant would have two options: They could stop all access to the water, come up with a remediation plan and supply drinkable water in the interim. Or they could come up with a plan for supplying drinkable water on a permanent basis.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A second Democrat has entered the race for an open U.S. Senate seat. University of Wyoming ecology professor Merav Ben-David, of Laramie, announced her candidacy Saturday at the annual Women's March in downtown Cheyenne. A native of Israel, Ben-David has lived in Wyoming for 20 years. She says she decided to get involved in politics to get more involved in decisions affecting ecosystems worldwide. She says her goal in Washington, D.C., would be to develop new sources of income and industries in Wyoming, where fossil-fuel extraction is a critical part of the economy. Another Laramie resident, community organizer Yana Ludwig, announced her candidacy in June, the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle reports. Three Republicans including former U.S. Rep. Cynthia Lummis are running to replace U.S. Sen Mike Enzi, who plans to retire in 2021 after four terms.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
WASHINGTON – Vice President Kamala Harris took the oath office in a barrier-breaking ceremony Wednesday, becoming the first woman, first Black American and first South Asian American to hold the office.\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a trailblazer in her own right as the first Latina justice on the high court.\n\nDressed in a purple dress and overcoat, the vice president took the oath with her husband and second gentleman Doug Emhoff looking on. Emhoff's two children from his first marriage also were there. After taking the oath, Harris hugged Emhoff and gave a double fist-bump to President Joe Biden.\n\nHarris used two Bibles, one that belonged to the late civil rights icon and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, whom Harris has said inspired her career path, and one owned by family friend Regina Shelton, who was like a second mother to Harris and her sister. Harris used Shelton's Bible when she took the oath of office as California attorney general and later as a U.S. senator.\n\nThe crowd of lawmakers, family and friends fell silent as Harris made history, then erupted into applause after she was sworn in.\n\nReady to serve, Harris wrote in her first tweet on the official Vice President Twitter account.\n\nHarris is used to breaking barriers. Before she resigned from her Senate seat on Monday ahead of the inauguration, Harris was one of 10 Black lawmakers and only the second Black woman to serve in the upper chamber. Harris' resignation means no Black women are serving in the U.S. Senate.\n\nBefore she was in the Senate, Harris was the first woman and person of color to be district attorney of San Francisco and, later, California's attorney general.\n\nHarris received as standing ovation just before she presided over the swearing-in of three new Democratic senators in the upper chamber where she used to serve.\n\nJon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, and Alex Padilla of California, who is set to replace Harris, were sworn in Wednesday afternoon, handing the Biden administration razor-thin control of the government. The vice president will play a decisive role in the upper chamber, where she could cast a tie-breaking vote in the 50-50 split between Republicans and the Democratic caucus.\n\nMore:'A vice president like no other': Kamala Harris steps into VP role with unique strengths – and unique challenges\n\nMore:Kamala Harris makes history. Her swearing-in as vice president shows 'strength of our democracy.'\n\nHarris, a former prosecutor, made headlines during Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate confirmation hearing, in which she was criticized by some of her Republican colleagues for her pointed and direct cross-examination of the now-justice.\n\nShe also served on several Senate committees, including Budget, Judiciary, Intelligence and Homeland Security. Her time on the Intelligence and Homeland Security committees will benefit her in her new role, because she will likely deal with national security and foreign policy.\n\nBiden and Harris take office while the country faces several pressing issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic ramifications, a nationwide reckoning over racial justice and the effects of climate change. The pair's inauguration comes two weeks after a violent mob attacked the U.S. Capitol, leaving five people dead.\n\nMore:How the Kamala Harris pick is playing with Indian Americans, a fast-growing and influential voting bloc\n\nA Biden transition aide who spoke on background to discuss the Biden-Harris relationship said the administration will use a hand-in-hand approach to address the crises. As an example, the aide said, while Biden focuses on tackling vaccine distribution planning, Harris might take the lead on congressional negotiations over funding needed for that plan.\n\nMany lawmakers, activists and groups celebrated Harris' groundbreaking ascent.\n\nToday we witnessed one of the most historic moments in the history of this country, read a tweet from the account of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the country's first Black sorority, to which Harris belonged at Howard University. The swearing-in of our FIRST Female Vice President of these United States of America. The glass ceiling has been broken!! WE SALUTE YOU MADAM VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS!\n\nIn a nod to Alpha Kappa Alpha, Harris donned her signature pearls, which she has worn at major life events including graduating from Howard University, her swearing-in to the Senate and the vice presidential debate. The pearls are a symbol of her sorority, which refers to its founders as the Twenty Pearls.\n\nSupporters of Harris launched a Facebook group of more than 458,000 women called Wear Pearls on Jan 20 2021 in honor of the vice president's milestone.\n\nRep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., told USA TODAY that as a young woman, it was incredible to see the nation's first female vice president sworn in. She said she plans to focus on the work we need to do to rebuild our country and looks forward to working with Biden and Harris.\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., honored Harris' role as the first South Asian and Black vice president.\n\nAs the first South Asian American woman elected to the House, I'm deeply proud to call Kamala Harris OUR Vice President—the first woman, first South Asian American, and first Black woman to hold this position of public trust, Jayapal tweeted. A powerful moment in history!\n\nQuentin James and Stefanie Brown James, founders of The Collective PAC, which is dedicated to electing more Black people to public office, said in a statement that today is a day of pride for Black America, and for all who believe in equality, fairness and the rule of law.\n\nWe're hopeful the Biden-Harris administration will not only restore dignity to the offices they now hold but will work to support and build up all Americans; giving a voice to the many communities that have been disrespected, shut out and pushed aside by the Trump administration, they said said in the statement.\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin, Maureen Groppe, and Nicholas Wu
AP\n\nGANGNEUNG, South Korea (AP) — A giant national flag. A smiling angel. The dictator's pop diva. And a dozen women added to a South Korean hockey team to form the Koreas' first-ever joint Olympic team.\n\nYes, North Korea is again stealing the show in pre-Olympic media coverage, although none of its 22 athletes is expected to win a medal at the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\nThe athletes hardly speak but still gathered a crowd of journalists and curious South Korean spectators when they arrived at the Gangneung athletes' village and attended training sessions, the only chance for official access to them before the games start Friday.\n\nThe ongoing media frenzy appears even more intense than when North Korea attended previous international sports events. That's largely because the North Koreans are visiting archrival South Korea after an extended period of nuclear tensions that saw increased fears of war last year.\n\nA look at North Korea's current and past stars and what the country hopes to get from them.\n\n___\n\nEMERGING STARS\n\nA pair of North Korean skaters, Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik, drew rounds of applause from South Korean spectators during their training at Gangneung Ice Arena in recent days. Many of the spectators are young volunteer workers who had never seen North Koreans in person.\n\nTheir moves are beautiful. I can feel that, said Jung Ha Kyung, a 22-year-old college student who volunteered for translation work at the venue. Especially, I like Ryom Tae Ok. I like her facial expressions so much and everyone here is talking about it. You know ... her hand gesture mimicking firing a pistol is really awesome.\n\nRyom, who turned 19 last Friday, has been dubbed the smiling angel by the South Korean media after she waved and smiled broadly when she arrived at the athletes' village in Gangneung.\n\nKim was also in the news on Tuesday after South Korean skater Alex Kam posted a selfie on Instagram of them together during training the previous day.\n\nTwelve North Korean female hockey players who created the Koreas' first-ever joint Olympic squad with South Korean players are also a hot news item.\n\nInternational headlines focused on birthday parties that South Korean players held for two North Korean teammates; a dictionary they created to cope with the linguistic divide between the Koreas; and their emotional match last Sunday with world No. 5 Sweden in which they wore the same uniforms bearing a single unification flag.\n\n___\n\nNON-ATHLETES\n\nNorth Korea is also sending a 140-member art troupe and a 230-strong cheering group. The troupe's leader, Hyon Song Wol, created a media frenzy during a preparatory visit last month, with South Korean TV stations following her every move. She also heads the North's extremely popular Moranbong girl band, whose members were hand-picked by absolute leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nA giant North Korea flag is draped across three floors of the North Korean athletes' apartment building. The hoisting of North Korean flags is normally banned in South Korea under its tough anti-North security law.\n\nI'm actually a conservative and don't like North Korea. But what's wrong with a North Korean flag? I don't think our people would be affected by that flag, said Cho Seon-jeong, a 30-year-old officer worker in Gangneung. We are divided countries but I think it's important for us to take part in world festivals like the Olympics together.\n\n___\n\nNORTH KOREAN INTENTIONS\n\nThe sudden Olympics-inspired mood of detente began after Kim Jong Un said in a New Year's Day address that he was willing to send a delegation to the Olympics. It was welcome news for South Korea's liberal President Moon Jae-in, who espouses a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the North Korean nuclear standoff.\n\nThe two Koreas have agreed on a package of Olympic cooperation activities such as the joint hockey team and a joint march in the Olympics' opening ceremony. This has created a temporary thaw in nuclear tensions, but some experts say North Korea probably wants to use its Olympic overture to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington and weaken international sanctions against it. The easing of sanctions is crucial for North Korea because it's eager to develop nuclear missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.\n\nDuring a previous era of detente from 1998 to 2008, North Korea also sent large delegations to sports events in South Korea and launched many now-dormant cooperation programs. Athletes from the rivals marched together at the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympics for the first time since their 1945 division and did the same in other sports events.\n\nThose events raised hopes of eventual unification. But critics argue that North Korea only wanted improved ties to receive shipments of food and other aid to help revive its economy, which crumbled during a crippling famine in the mid-1990s that killed hundreds of thousands of its people.\n\n___\n\nPAST STARS\n\nNorth Korea boycotted the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Olympics, both in Seoul, during a period of heightened tensions.\n\nDuring the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, North Korean judo heroine Key Sun Hui, who won gold in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, lit the games' torch together with South Korean 1984 Olympic judo gold medalist Ha Hyung-joo.\n\nNorth Korea's Ham Pong Sil won the women's marathon in Busan and said in a subsequent interview that then-leader Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un's father, inspired her to win. When I was passing the 32-kilometer mark, I was thinking that great leader Kim Jong Il was looking at me and I was able to finish the race well, she said.\n\nNorth Korea sent cheering groups, comprised mainly of young women, to Busan and two other sporting events. They earned the nickname army of beauties in South Korea, receiving more attention than their athletes. Kim Jong Un's wife, Ri Sol Ju, was among a 2005 group before their marriage.\n\nA month before the Busan Games, North Korean dancer Cho Myong Ae rose to stardom after she performed and served as a flag bearer for the North Korean delegation during a joint festival. Cho, of North Korea's Mansudae Art Troupe, gained a huge following in South Korea and appeared in a commercial for Samsung cellphones with South Korean singer Lee Hyo-ri, the hottest South Korean entertainer at the time, in 2005.\n\n___\n\nFollow Hyung-jin Kim on Twitter at twitter.com/hyungjin1972
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is investigating the source of the leak of romantic texts published in the National Enquirer. His associates have questioned the brother of the woman he's dating, according to a bombshell report in the Daily Beast.\n\nBezos and wife MacKenzie announced they were ending their marriage after 25 years just ahead of the Enquirer story, linking him to former Los Angeles TV anchor Lauren Sanchez. Gavin de Becker, who does security for Bezos, confirmed to the Beast that he questioned brother Michael Sanchez.\n\nHow much? Jeff Bezos' divorce could be the most expensive in history\n\nWhat elevates this story from the usual sordid CEO having an affair angle is the political twist. President Donald Trump routinely attacks Bezos on his Twitter feed and refers to The Washington Post, which Bezos owns, as the Amazon Washington Post.\n\nThe Enquirer is a pro-Trump publication and has admitted that it used its position to try to influence the 2016 election. So there have been questions raised about whether the Enquirer spent four months tracking Bezos to report on his love life as payback for critical articles written in the Post about Trump.\n\nNot the first:Amazon CEO is just the latest master of the universe to have life exposed\n\nMichael Sanchez publicly supports Trump and, according to The Beast, is a personal and business associate of Trump associates Roger Stone, Carter Page and Scottie Neil Hughes.\n\nBecker told The Beast that in Sanchez, strong leads point to political motives.\n\nIn a letter to the Los Angeles Times, Sanchez called himself a gay man, a Hispanic, a West Hollywood homeowner and strong supporter of Trump, He often posts anti-media, pro-Trump tweets on Twitter to his 253 followers.\n\nWant news from USA TODAY on WhatsApp? Click this link on your mobile device to get started\n\nIn the Enquirer report, the publication said it got hold of leaked texts that Bezos sent to Lauren Sanchez and published several of them. A sampling: I love you, alive girl. I will show you with my body, and my lips and my eyes, very soon.\n\nJeff Bezos and those texts:How to keep what you text private\n\nUSA TODAY has requested comment from de Becker, Sanchez and Amazon and will update the story as replies come in.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham on Twitter, @jeffersongraham
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLent kicks off with a sprinkle of hashtags\n\nAsh Wednesday ushers in Lent, the 40-day period (excluding Sundays) of penance that precedes Easter, which is when Christians believe Jesus was resurrected. It's often a time of fasting and reflection. Now, followers can mark the period by posting photos with hashtags to Instagram, or watching a priest answer questions on Facebook Live. In the past several years, more churches are using digital tools to meet believers where they are — on social media. But whether or not Christians use any or all of these tools at their disposal, experts say the goal of Lent remains the same: improving a relationship with God.\n\nDelta fliers are in for a tasty free treat\n\nWe're not talking peanuts: The airline is bringing back free meal service for coach passengers starting with a few select coast-to-coast routes. The change begins Wednesday on flights between New York JFK and both Los Angeles and San Francisco. On those routes, fliers get a breakfast option in the morning and a sandwich or wrap option later in the day. If you think you're missing out, don't worry. Delta is planning to expand the program to more cities in April.\n\nTrade deadline looms for NHL teams\n\nThe clock is ticking for NHL teams looking to make a move for a playoff run: The league's trade deadline arrives at 3 p.m. ET Wednesday. Teams that are out of contention usually see the deadline as a time to dump salaries and build for the future, while contenders look for the last piece in their championship puzzle. Here's our primer to help keep track of who's buying and selling, and why the market for top talent is dwindling. (The league-leading Washington Capitals have already been busy, trading for star St. Louis Blues defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk.)\n\nFacebook working to prevent suicide on its live-streaming service\n\nFacebook will integrate real-time suicide prevention tools into Facebook Live on Wednesday to address the alarming phenomenon of people taking their own lives on its live-streaming service. Suicide has surged to its highest level in nearly 30 years, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, adding urgency to the social media giant's efforts after two separate incidents were broadcast on Facebook Live in January. In an attempt to report suicide or self-injury, live-chat support from crisis support organizations — such as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the Crisis Text Line — will be available through Facebook Messenger.\n\nBob Jones University to regain its nonprofit status\n\nBob Jones University says it will regain its federal tax-exempt status Wednesday, more than three decades after the IRS stripped its nonprofit ranking following a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling. One of the main issues stemmed from the university's refusal to allow interracial dating or marriage among students, staff or faculty of the university, a rule it has since abandoned. The case has been cited many times through the years, and most recently, it arose in an exchange before the Supreme Court in the Obergefell v. Hodges decision which legalized gay marriage.\n\nPop in those headphones and listen to the audio version below:
Martin Frank\n\nThe News Journal\n\nFor months, we have heard the platitudes: The Eagles want Sam Bradford to become their quarterback of the future, and Bradford wants to stay in Philly.\n\nBy 4 p.m. Tuesday, it will be time for both Bradford and the Eagles to prove that their professed love for one another is genuine. And that has nothing to do with the deadline for the Eagles to place the franchise tag on Bradford.\n\nThe Eagles aren't going to use the franchise tag on Bradford because that would be a salary of $19.95 million for a quarterback for 2016, according to figures confirmed Monday by the NFL Players' Association. That would use up most of the Eagles' available salary cap space for this coming season, leaving only about $6 million to sign free agents.\n\nEagles executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman has already said that the team is hoping to sign more than one when free agency begins next Wednesday.\n\nSo if the two sides really want to stay together, a long-term deal by Tuesday would make the most sense. That way, everyone is happy. The Eagles can lower the salary cap hit for this season significantly and have more money to go free-agent shopping. And Bradford, as you might have heard, has had two ACL surgeries, and would much more prefer long-term security.\n\nAnd, according to a FoxSports report, the Eagles have recently upped their offer on Bradford in talks with his agent, Tom Condon.\n\nOf course, nobody seems to know what the Eagles have upped their offer from. Suffice it to say that the new offer probably isn't in the $20 million per year range.\n\nBut, as in life, true love can be a lot more complicated. That's because if the two sides don't agree to a long-term deal by Tuesday, then Bradford could stop negotiations with the Eagles and see what he can get in free agency.\n\nThe other 31 teams can begin contacting Bradford's agent and start negotiating a contract by next Monday. Any deal isn't official until the new league year begins next Wednesday at 4 p.m.\n\nIt's possible that Bradford could look at the offers once free agency starts over the ensuing days and decide to come back to the Eagles, especially if no other team is willing to break the bank for him.\n\nThe Houston Texans, for example, need a quarterback. But are they willing to pay $20 million a year, or more, to sign Bradford? Or would they be more willing to draft a QB with their first-round pick at No. 26, such as Christian Hackenberg, whom Texans coach Bill O'Brien coached his freshman year at Penn State? That was by far Hackenberg's most successful season at the school.\n\nDenver, the recent Super Bowl champions, could also be looking for a quarterback now that Peyton Manning is expected to retire in the coming days. But the Broncos drafted Brock Osweiler in the second round in 2012, and gave him a bunch of starts last season when Manning was injured. No doubt, they would rather re-sign Osweiler, who's also eligible for free agency and knows the system, than spend at least twice as much for Bradford.\n\nOther quarterback-needy teams could also pursue Bradford. But would Bradford want to go to a team that doesn't have a chance at the playoffs, and likely subject himself to a porous offensive line and a greater chance for his knee to get shredded for a third time?\n\nAs for the Eagles, they probably already know what Bradford is worth to them. So when head coach Doug Pederson said last week that if Bradford wants to be in Philadelphia, then he'll be in Philadelphia, that most likely means that Bradford's return will have to be at the right price.\n\nThen again, if the Eagles are a playoff-ready team, like Roseman and Pederson have indicated, are they better off paying for Bradford to become the franchise QB? Or are they better off with a stopgap like Kansas City backup Chase Daniel - two starts in six seasons - at half the price, while selecting a quarterback in the draft and developing him?\n\nThen again, if the Eagles don't sign Bradford to a long-term deal by Tuesday, then it'll seem like a marriage of convenience if Bradford returns, and that might not be any better.\n\nEither way, the platitudes will stop soon enough. It's time to find out where both sides stand.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com. Follow on Twitter @Mfranknfl.
Sammy Roth\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFor millions of people in Florida, Puerto Rico, Texas and elsewhere whose lives were upended by hurricanes and for tens of thousands of Californians whose homes or businesses were destroyed by wildfires, climate change hit home in 2017.\n\nLast year, President Trump also mocked climate science on Twitter and rejected an international climate change agreement, while his administration began undoing dozens of regulations meant to slow the rise in global temperatures.\n\nDespite all that, Al Gore is optimistic.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which screened his new film, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, Gore pointed to what he called signs of progress.\n\nIndia plans to sell only electric vehicles by 2030 and build staggering amounts of solar and wind power over the next five years. China is launching a national carbon trading program to limit pollution. And Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund — the world's biggest investment fund — plans to sell its $37 billion worth of shares in oil and gas companies.\n\nCLIMATE POINT: Sign up for USA TODAY's climate change and energy newsletter\n\nDriven by rapidly falling prices of solar and wind power and by forward-looking governments in countries such as India and China, Gore said the world has finally reached a technological tipping point in the battle against climate change. The world is at the beginning of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the Industrial Revolution but the speed of the digital revolution, the former vice president said.\n\nWe saw it with the marriage equality movement. We saw it earlier with the civil rights movement. All these movements have bumped along very slowly with an agonizingly slow pace, and then all of a sudden there's an inflection, and people say, 'Oh, I get it,' Gore said. We're at that point now with efforts to solve the climate crisis.\n\nClimate change is becoming harder to ignore. Federal scientists reported Monday that 2017 marked America's third-hottest year on record and contained 16 separate weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the California wildfires. The damage from those disasters totaled a record-breaking $306 billion. While scientists don't attribute all those disasters to human-caused climate change, they say human influence likely played a key role in worsening many of them.\n\nGore compared watching the nightly news to a nature hike through the Book of Revelation.\n\nPeople are connecting the dots on their own, he said.\n\nRELATED: It's cold outside, but that doesn't mean climate change isn't real\n\nSurprisingly, Gore's new film says hardly anything about Trump, even though its release came six months after he took office. Instead, Gore and the filmmakers focus on reasons for hope: the stunning growth of solar and wind power and the Paris climate agreement signed by nearly every country in the world in 2015.\n\nGore said the Trump presidency has been less consequential than I feared it would be. He had been concerned other countries would follow Trump's lead in exiting the Paris deal. That hasn't happened.\n\nThe entire rest of the world stood up and said, 'We're still in the Paris agreement.' Some countries doubled down on it. California and quite a few other states said, 'We're still in.' Hundreds of cities, thousands of business, Gore said. And the U.S. is now going to exceed its commitments under the Paris agreement regardless of Trump.\n\nREAD MORE: What cities say they'll do to reduce greenhouse gases\n\nStill, Gore said he's painfully aware that more must be done to avoid the worst consequences of climate change.\n\nEarth is already nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it was before the Industrial Revolution, when people started pumping large amounts of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. The Paris agreement set a goal of limiting the warming to no more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, but scientists fear that's already slipping out of reach. Staying under that limit was based on countries committing to more ambitious targets every few years, which may be more difficult without America at the table.\n\nI don't think it's ever too late to recapture its position of leadership, but a great deal of damage has been done to the reputation of the U.S. in the rest of the world, Gore said. And many countries are now beginning to plan as if they can't rely on U.S. leadership.\n\nI don't think it's too late. But I think we need a new president, he said.\n\nAt the same time, Gore doesn't think one election is enough to turn the tide on climate change. He harshly criticized the cottage industry of climate denial and said the U.S. is unique in all the nations of the world in having this persistent climate denial movement that is financed by the large carbon polluters.\n\nAt one point in his latest film, Gore said: In order to address the environmental crisis, we're going to have to spend some time fixing the democracy crisis, because big money has so much influence now, our democracy has been hacked.\n\nReducing the influence of money in politics is a tall order. But even there, Gore is optimistic. He pointed to Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign as a positive sign.\n\nHe showed it's now possible to refuse any large contributions and finance a campaign solely with small contributions over the internet, Gore said. That's a source of real hope for our democracy, if others adopt that model.\n\nSammy Roth writes about climate change for USA TODAY.

LOS ANGELES — For the big winners of Super Bowl week, it is time to step forward and be recognized. So go ahead, LeBron James, Anthony Davis (and his dad), Kristaps Porzingis, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and agent Rich Paul. Take a bow.\n\nThe Super Bowl news vortex of past years, a force so all-encompassing that other sports might as well have ceased to exist during early February, did not materialize this time. In fact, as expertly detailed by USA TODAY Sports' Dan Wolken, the week heading into the big game was a bit lame.\n\nAnd, ever the opportunist, the NBA stepped into the void perfectly, thanks to the mischievous machinations of its biggest stars and their impeccable sense of timing.\n\nThings started with a bang Monday. The NFL kicked its media day up to the top of the schedule a few years ago, turning it into media night and putting it on Monday, essentially to generate more buzz earlier in the week. It worked brilliantly when Snoop Dogg was serenading Cam Newton, when Rob Gronkowski was reading from an erotic novella (yes, really) or even when Marshawn Lynch wasn't saying anything except how he'd only turned up so he wouldn't get fined.\n\nCLICK & ROLL:Get exclusive content in our NBA newsletter\n\nREAD MORE:NBA commentary from columnist Martin Rogers\n\nBut this year the Monday sound byte didn't come out of media night at all, it came hours earlier from the lips of Paul, Davis' recently acquired agent who, ahem, just so happens to be James' best friend. It involved dropping the carefully plotted narrative that the NBA's most impressive eyebrow wanted no more part of life in New Orleans, the same place he professed to love so much that he had started to speak its slang.\n\nBefore long all discussions centered around the different ways the story line could play out. If the Pelicans would rebuff trade offers. What more Davis could do to engineer a switch to his preferred destination of Los Angeles. The rights and wrongs and perils of excessive player power. Even Mr. Davis snared five minutes of fame by saying his son shouldn't sign with the Boston Celtics.\n\nMedia night passed by without so much as a marriage proposal, its wider impact suffering perhaps from a dose of New England Patriots fatigue and that the Los Angeles Rams play in a city only just waking up to the fact that it has a football team (actually, two of them) that is very, very good.\n\nMeanwhile, the NBA news cycle refused to stop, with the Lakers providing the bulk of the tweetable action. The bizarre saga of James' interminable injury absence came to a sudden conclusion, when he surprisingly returned in an overtime thriller against the Los Angeles Clippers. Then he sat out again Saturday, when a defeat to the Golden State Warriors spawned a reported locker room spat between head coach Luke Walton and obsolete veterans JaVale McGee and Michael Beasley.\n\nLANDING SPOTS:Six potential destinations for Anthony Davis\n\nCRAZY NUMBERS:Breaking down James Harden's historic streak\n\nThe NFL is the master at getting the nation to watch its games, with viewing figures still astronomical despite what the president would have us believe. When it comes to its ultimate showpiece, much of the world tunes in, a situation that wouldn't change even if they put Nickelback as the halftime act. Now that would be a news conference worth witnessing.\n\nHowever, the NBA is the true expert at getting the country to talk about its goings-on and relentless drama plays. It is the sporting king of the social media world, with a younger fan base to match. The media-scape is more than big enough for both sports, so it is not like the NFL is being pushed out. But how the week evolved and the make-up of the most popular news content just shows how the stars of the NBA sphere captivate focus in a way that very few NFL celebrities are capable of.\n\nIt might all be different next year. If the Super Bowl LIV showdown is between the Dallas Cowboys and their late-season signing Colin Kaepernick against a Kansas City Chiefs team spurred by Patrick Mahomes' 83 touchdowns, no one's going to be talking much about the NBA. We will see.\n\nIn truth, the best Super Bowl story lines are often the ones that have little to do with the game. The best ones about Tom Brady, except for when a Mexican television reporter asked to marry him more than a decade ago, tend to take place post-game, like when his wife Gisele Bundchen launched into a tirade against abusive fans and when his game-worn jersey got snatched by a pseudo-journalist two years ago.\n\nYes, the Patriots will wear the title of world champion, but the NBA reigned supreme in terms of capturing the public's attention last week. Even the flailing New York Knicks got in on the fun by shipping Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks for a blockbuster arranged Euro-marriage with rookie sensation Luka Doncic. Then the Celtics' Kyrie Irving gave the kind of straight talking that would have made Super Bowl media night better, walking back his earlier promise and casting doubt on whether he will re-sign with Boston or pack up his free agency U-Haul and take his talents elsewhere.\n\nAnd if you like something solid, consistent and so reliable that you can put your mortgage on it, Houston's Harden continues to score all the points, all the time, at a historic rate. He extended his streak of games with 30 or more points to 26 on Saturday night.\n\nEven though the Super Bowl ended up being a bore, the NFL owned Sunday — because it always owns winter Sundays. But the NBA won Super Bowl week. And that might be the biggest upset of all.\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Martin Rogers on Twitter @RogersJourno
Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst is a combat veteran of the Army and the first women elected to Congress from Iowa.\n\nWhen she arrived in Washington in 2015, she earned more than her husband.\n\nShe says she's also a victim of domestic violence.\n\nErnst said in court filings that she was assaulted by her husband of 26 years after she confronted him about his alleged affair with their daughter's babysitter.\n\nThe couple's divorce was finalized this month. A judge sealed most of the records, first reported Monday by the alternative newspaper Cityview, at the Ernsts' request.\n\nSurvivors of domestic assault and their advocates say Ernst's story is yet more evidence that domestic violence can happen to anyone.\n\nOne in three teenagers say they know someone their age who has been hit, punched, choked or otherwise physically hurt by a partner. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says one in three young women will be abused before they reach 25.\n\nErnst, a Republican, said in court papers that she was the victim of verbal and mental abuse and a physical assault. After the physical assault, she said, a victim's advocate wanted to take her to a hospital, but she refused.\n\nGail has been very cruel, she wrote in the filings. This has been an extremely painful journey.\n\nErnst described a history of emotional abuse, the Des Moines Register reported. Her husband belittled her, she said. When she achieved her goals, he became angry.\n\nGail Ernst has not responded publicly to the senator's allegations. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. A person who answered the telephone at his lawyer's office Tuesday said they were not releasing statements at this time.\n\nAuthor and domestic violence survivor L.Y. Marlow says the biggest myth surrounding domestic violence is that it's a problem primarily among the poor and minorities.\n\nI think that the Senator Ernst story reinforces that domestic violence does not have any biases against social status, class, education or economic conditions, Marlow said. And, more importantly, that the sheer shame and silence of it perpetuates why women stay.\n\nMarlow cites the stories of former victims Charlotte Fedders and Leslie Morgan Steiner, both of whom wrote books about alleged abuse by wealthy and prominent ex-husbands.\n\nFedders was married to a handsome attorney who became the enforcement chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the Reagan Administration and Steiner's husband was an Ivy League graduate and Wall Street trader.\n\nSteiner, a Harvard graduate and former Washington Post editor, wrote she was choked, pushed down the stairs and had a gun held to her head. But she stayed far longer than she ever thought she would – four years.\n\nNo one in my life had ever made me feel so safe, loved, beautiful and validated as he did during the early months of our relationship, she wrote in the Washington Post in 2014.\n\nMarlow said domestic violence often starts with emotional and verbal abuse, which can be as scary as the physical abuse it more likely than not will escalate to.\n\nSteiner's story, she said, broke the barriers on whether verbal abuse is domestic violence.\n\nMarlow founded the domestic violence advocacy group Saving Promise, she said, to prevent her granddaughter from becoming the fifth generation of women to experience domestic violence in her family.\n\nHer book, Color Me Butterfly, tells the story of the abuse she says her grandmother and mother suffered, along with what she says was her own abusive first marriage.\n\nMarlow says her daughter was abused by her daughter's partner while their baby lay next to them.\n\nFor abuse victims, 'code of silence' still prevalent\n\nMarlow has partnered with Harvard's school of public health to launch a learning lab that is researching the causes and potential policy solutions to address domestic violence.\n\nMarlow grew up in the public housing projects of Philadelphia projects. But she says she now knows the reach of domestic violence.\n\nMore affluent women hide behind that perfect economic status, as they have much more to lose, she said.\n\nErnst deployed in 2003 to Iraq, where she commanded a transportation company. She was elected to the Senate in 2014, and retired from the Iowa National Guard as a lieutenant colonel the next year.\n\nErnst wrote in court papers that her husband had a special friendship with their daughter's babysitter.\n\nShe confronted him, she said, and he attacked her.\n\nWe went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage, Ernst wrote. I very nearly filed for divorce after a night that we argued, and it became physical.\n\nErnst wrote that she went with her daughter to her mother's house. Her husband followed soon after, she wrote, crying and apologizing.\n\nThe next day, a courthouse victim's advocate examined Ernst's throat and head, she said, but she was too embarrassed and humiliated, and did not want people to know about what she described as an assault.\n\nWhen Ernst won her Senate seat, it was the first time in her marriage she earned more money than her husband, she said. She said he was not supportive of her career, and became mean when people asked her about work.\n\nHer husband agreed to attend counseling to fix their marriage, Ernst wrote.\n\nBut she said he had one condition: they would not discuss the assault at the sessions.\n\nI stupidly agreed, she wrote.\n\nIf you are interested in connecting with people online who have overcome or are struggling with issues mentioned in this story, join USA TODAY's I Survived It Facebook support group.
DES MOINES, Iowa – Years before her divorce, Sen. Joni Ernst was assaulted by her husband after she confronted him about his relationship with their daughter's babysitter, she wrote in court filings.\n\nErnst, a Republican who represents Iowa in the U.S. Senate, said that during her 26-year marriage with Gail Ernst, she was the victim of verbal and mental abuse and a physical assault after which a victim's advocate wanted to take her to a hospital, she wrote in public records connected to their divorce.\n\nGail has been very cruel, she wrote. This has been an extremely painful journey.\n\nIn August, Ernst announced that she and Gail Ernst were divorcing. The divorce was finalized this month.\n\nIn an affidavit filed in October, Joni Ernst described a history of emotional abuse that included her husband belittling her and becoming angry when she achieved her goals. She was interviewed by then-candidate Donald Trump to run for vice president, but she turned him down, describing the move as not the right thing for her or her family, she said.\n\nErnst, 48, a military veteran from Red Oak, was the first woman in Iowa elected to either chamber of Congress. She defeated Democrat Bruce Braley in 2014 to win a six-year term in the Senate after coming out victorious in a five-way Republican primary for the nomination. She has said she will seek a second term in the Senate in 2020.\n\nMore:Advocates: Sen. Joni Ernst allegations show domestic violence doesn't discriminate\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nErnst's chief of staff, Lisa Goeas, declined to comment Tuesday. Joni Ernst's attorney did not respond to a request to comment, and a person who answered the phone at Gail Ernst's attorney's office hung up when a reporter asked to speak to the lawyer. Other efforts to contact the Ernsts were unsuccessful.\n\nThe details of affidavits by Joni and Gail Ernst were first reported Monday by Cityview, an alternative newspaper in Des Moines. A judge on Tuesday sealed most of the records in the divorce case at the request of the Ernsts. Under Iowa law, divorce records are automatically made public when the divorce is finalized. But parties can request to keep some records private.\n\n'A very dark and troubling time'\n\nJoni and Gail Ernst married after she graduated in 1992 from Iowa State University, according to court records. She wanted to pursue a master's degree from the University of Iowa but followed him to Georgia, where he was assigned in the U.S. Army, she said.\n\nThe couple moved from place to place. As she worked various jobs, Ernst called herself the epitome of an Army wife, describing in court filings how she continued to drill for the Reserves and care for their daughter, who is now 19.\n\nThroughout their marriage, Gail Ernst, 65, joked about their 17-year age difference, Joni Ernst wrote in her affidavit. He referred to her as his retirement plan, something she did not think was funny, she wrote.\n\nWhen Gail retired from the Army in 2001, the couple moved back to Iowa. They have family members in the state and wanted to raise their own family here.\n\nJoni Ernst deployed with the Iowa National Guard as a company commander from April 2003 to 2004 in Kuwait and Iraq. When she returned, she ran for and was elected Montgomery County auditor, serving from 2005 to 2011.\n\nThat was when, according to Joni Ernst's affidavit, her husband had a special friendship with their daughter's babysitter, who she said he spent time with even when their daughter was not there. She confronted him about it.\n\nWe went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage, Ernst wrote. I very nearly filed for divorce after a night that we argued, and it became physical.\n\nJoni Ernst said she fled to her mother's house with her daughter in the middle of the night. Gail Ernst followed soon after, crying and apologizing, according to her affidavit.\n\nThe next day, a victim's advocate at the courthouse performed an examination of Ernst's throat and head, she said; the advocate wanted to take Ernst to the hospital, according to the court filing. Ernst declined, writing that she was embarrassed and humiliated and did not want people to know about what she described as an assault.\n\nTo repair their marriage, Gail Ernst agreed to attend counseling, Joni Ernst wrote. But, she said, he told her not to discuss the assault at the sessions.\n\nI stupidly agreed, she said.\n\nJoni Ernst said the two moved on, but their relationship was not the same.\n\nAs a U.S. senator, Joni Ernst has said domestic abuse should not be tolerated. When two ex-wives accused former White House aide Rob Porter of assault, Ernst told CNN the stories of abused men and women need to be heard and believed.\n\nAbuse is never OK, she said in February 2018. We need to send a very clear signal that it won't be tolerated.\n\nThe senator has also brought attention to sexual assault in the military. Having worked for a women's crisis shelter while at Iowa State, Ernst was among a group of senators who called for a special congressional investigation into USA Gymnastics after national team doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to decades in prison for sexually abusing gymnasts.\n\nErnsts accuse each other of affairs\n\nOn their 25th wedding anniversary in July, days after Gail Ernst told Joni he wanted a divorce, Joni opened his email and found something she said devastated her.\n\nThe senator found exchanges with someone she described as her ex-husband's longtime girlfriend, according to her account. The two were planning their divorces and saying demeaning things about Joni Ernst and the woman's husband, Ernst said.\n\nErnst wrote she began in a downward spiral of not eating or sleeping; she rapidly lost 17 pounds, which she said was about 13 percent of her weight. Her staff canceled two days of appointments because, she wrote, I couldn't function.\n\nIn his response to her affidavit, Gail Ernst denied ever having an affair, writing: I've never even danced with any other woman before I filed for divorce. He made no mention of Ernst's assault allegation in his response.\n\nGail Ernst accused Joni of having an affair with one of her soldiers while she was deployed as a company commander. He caught her secretly emailing him, he wrote.\n\nShe admitted to the affair, said she was sorry and begged me not to say anything, Gail Ernst wrote. But their daughter was 4 at the time, he wrote, so he swallowed (his) pride and kept quiet.\n\nIn the divorce papers, Gail Ernst, who retired in 2016, asked the court to award him $4,000 a month in temporary alimony, saying he grossed about $5,700 a month with disability while she earned $14,500. He also requested $10,000 in attorney fees.\n\nIn the end, neither was awarded alimony and each was responsible to pay attorney fees. In a financial statement, Joni Ernst estimated their net worth was about $930,000, while he calculated it was closer to $1,039,700.\n\nGail Ernst, who has two other children from a previous marriage, was awarded their residence in Red Oak, Iowa, as well as three lots in town. Joni Ernst, who has two other adult daughters, was awarded the condo in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe senator kept a 2013 Hyundai Elantra, a 2017 Ford Explorer and a 2009 Harley-Davidson. Her former husband kept a 1998 Chevy Corvette, a 2008 Dodge Ram and a 2006 Harley-Davidson, records show.\n\nJoni: 'He is doing everything he can to destroy me'\n\nWhen Joni Ernst won her Senate seat, it was the first time in her marriage she earned more money than her husband, according to her affidavit.\n\nDespite previous promises, Ernst said her then-husband was not supportive of her career and became mean when people brought up politics or asked her about work.\n\nAt one point, Gail Ernst said he would divorce Joni if she ran again for the Senate in 2020, though she wrote he seeks to continue to gain from the success he so badly didn't want me to have. Gail Ernst denied the accusation in his response, calling it an outright lie.\n\nWhen she announced she was running in 2020 in December, Ernst told reporters: To anyone who would like to step up and enter into that race, I say: Bring it on.\n\nGail Ernst wrote that he begged Joni to spend more time with him and their daughter, but her career was all-consuming. He accused her of dating other men in Washington and said other parents at their daughter's school called him a single father.\n\nGail Ernst said he gave up on his goals so Joni Ernst could pursue her dreams, he wrote. Joni Ernst said Gail Ernst was now trying to derail her ambitions.\n\nAlthough Gail seems to think he can live off my salary for the rest of his life, Joni Ernst wrote, he is doing everything he can to destroy me and ruin my chance for re-election, which would end the gravy train he apparently plans to ride.\n\nFollow Luke Nozicka and Linh Ta on Twitter: @LukeNozicka and @linhmaita
Advocates: Lawmakers must outlaw child marriage\n\nChild advocates say New York's marriage law that allows children as young as 14 to wed can trap minors in sexual abuse and domestic violence. Assemblywoman Amy Paulin introduced a bill Tuesday to raise the minimum age for marriage to 17. (Feb. 14)
Julia Louis-Dreyfus has serious marriage problems with onscreen husband Will Ferrell during their European ski vacation in the dark comedy Downhill (now in theaters).\n\nBut her Billie is sitting pretty when it comes to her ruggedly hot, Italian ski instructor Guglielmo, who ends up giving her solo instruction that includes a mid-mountain calf massage.\n\nThe scene-stealing mountain man is played by Italian model and actor Giulio Berruti, 35, a one-time dental student who might be remembered by fans for his appearance as the cad Italian prince wooing Kate Cassidy's Emma in 2011's Monte Carlo.\n\nSo who is 6-foot-3 Berruti? USA TODAY sought to find out.\n\nCan your marriage survive 'Downhill'?:Will Ferrell has advice\n\nQuestion: You're literally listed as Italian Guy #2 in the 2003 Lizzie McGuire Movie. How was that?\n\nGiulio Berruti: That's how I started. I was modeling at the time and they asked me to do this audition for Lizzy McGuire. I had no idea what it was. But I literally just passed her by in the shot, walking by as they were saying, Italian guys are so hot. Something like that. That's it. But that was my baptism in the movie business. I saw all these people doing this crazy job of being someone else. So I started studying it.\n\nQ: What did you have to do to get the part of an Italian ski instructor in Downhill?\n\nBerruti: In the beginning I auditioned to be a French ski instructor. So I worked hard on that accent. They asked if it was possible for me to go to LA and do the audition with Julia Louis-Dreyfus. I said, I'm already on the plane! I think Julia was looking for someone to be confident and comfortable around. She gave me a chance and was the best partner I ever had.\n\nSo they just asked me before shooting, why don't you speak with an Italian accent. So I was Yeah, I can do that. But I trained so hard to get the right accent for the French guy.\n\nQ: You show some moves on the slopes, have you ever really taught skiing?\n\nBerruti: I taught a bit when I younger on snow blades. I love to ski, it's one of my favorite sports. But I've crashed so much in the past that now I try not to. But we were working on the slopes all day (filming Downhill). So it was like a sort of a vacation with friends, just magic.\n\nQ. Did you ever imagine you'd be giving Julia Louis-Dreyfus a calf massage in a ski hut?\n\nBerruti: Never, ever in my life. Especially when I was studying dentistry – because that's my background – would I imagine I'd be the guy giving Julia Louis-Dreyfus a massage.\n\nQ. Your Guglielmo believes in spiking his coffee with alcohol before skiing. What's your thought on this?\n\nBerruti: Special coffee! That's very typical of big mountains in Europe. But I would not suggest it. You don't want to mix it up, alcohol and skiing. People can get smashed too much. We have a lot of après ski parties, too.\n\nQ: Speaking of smashes, will we see any wipeouts in the Downhill blooper reels?\n\nBerruti: I was acting and giving Julia ski instructions and I miserably crashed into a fence. I didn't see it. I was like, Bend your knees! Bend your legs! Then I crashed and ate tons of snow. I was like, Sorry guys! Everybody made fun of me. It is a good memory that I have.\n\nQ. How will you build on this role?\n\nBerruti: I'm pretty sure that I will be one of the few Italian guys out there that will probably be able to make it in the United States. I'm doing everything I can to fulfill my dream. This is the country I want to be in, the land of opportunity.\n\nNext, I'll play an American professor teaching Italian literature that falls in love in Gabriel's Inferno. It's a very interesting story and there's a huge fan base for this book. We just wrapped the first movie of the trilogy.\n\nQ: The only loss is really the dentistry field – were you a good dentist?\n\nBerruti: I don't know if I'm a good dentist because I'm working as an actor right now. So I guess I was not.
With quarterback Philip Rivers announcing his retirement Wednesday morning, perhaps no club has a more attractive opening under center than the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nIt should be an intriguing offseason for a franchise that arguably has the richest lineage of passers in the history of the NFL – Johnny Unitas, Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck ... not to mention some vocal Bert Jones truthers.\n\nNow a new name will join those ranks.\n\nWe don't know who will be taking the first snap for Indy next fall, particularly with backup Jacoby Brissett about to become an unrestricted free agent. He started 15 games in 2019 after Luck abruptly retired but returned to his backup role when Rivers signed for 2020.\n\nWith that in mind, here are eight names to consider:\n\nMike Freeman:Opinion: Sarah Thomas earning Super Bowl officiating bid is a crucial moment in sports history\n\nMore QB mystery:Deshaun Watson's next team if he leaves Houston Texans? Ranking the NFL's 31 potential suitors.\n\nCarson Wentz\n\nThe chic marriage is to reunite the embattled Philadelphia Eagles quarterback with Colts head coach Frank Reich, Wentz's offensive coordinator when he played at an MVP level in 2017 before suffering a season-ending knee injury. The men are also bonded by Christian faith. NFL Network has reported Wentz would like to come to Indianapolis if his time in Philly is, in fact, at an end – though the recent firing of Doug Pederson was a strong hint that the Eagles are headed for a fresh start that includes Wentz.\n\nAnd here's the real rub: To divorce Wentz this winter, the Eagles would have to absorb a huge salary cap hit as the four-year, $128 million extension he signed in 2019 takes effect at the start of the 2021 season. Cutting him is cost prohibitive (roughly a $60 million cap charge), which makes trading him – about a $34 million hit if done shortly after the new league year begins in March – palatable only by comparison. This also presumes Colts GM Chris Ballard, always thrifty with his draft picks and cap resources, is willing to engage.\n\nBut even if he and Reich decide they can resurrect the 2017 Wentz, the Eagles would have to be willing to sell at a discount given how depressed his value is while conceding the relationship with the face of their franchise is irreparable.\n\nMatthew Stafford\n\nThe Detroit Lions' longtime bomber has two years remaining on his deal and would be owed about $43 million – reasonable by the current quarterback salary scale. Stafford turns 33 next month, but his arm talent remains among the league's elite. Current and former teammates tend to swear by his personality and toughness. On the downside, he has taken a lot of abuse over the years and, from a team perspective, he's never led Detroit to a playoff win in 12 seasons – and now the Lions are in the midst of another regime change, which may or may not spell the end of the former No. 1 pick's tenure.\n\nStafford isn't the hand-in-glove fit that Wentz might be, but he is a more realistic trade option financially – the Lions would take a $19 million hit for moving him. And Stafford would sustain a veteran presence for a Colts roster that's built to win now.\n\nMatt Ryan\n\nThe Atlanta quarterback's name has been floated as a possibility – maybe because the 2016 MVP's experience and surgical style would probably fit well in the Circle City. But realistically, Ryan's contract – it runs through 2023 – is even more unwieldy than Wentz's and would cost the Falcons, who just filled their coach and GM positions, more than $40 million to unload in a swap. And given Ryan is nearly three years older than Stafford? Seems like the worst of all worlds given the Colts' other available avenues.\n\nAndy Dalton\n\nThe 33-year-old may not have quite the résumé or physical gifts of more acclaimed passers in the league. But the three-time Pro Bowler is steady, led the Cincinnati Bengals to five straight playoff berths – talk about a résumé bullet – and, best of all, is a free agent after helping keep the Dallas Cowboys afloat in 2020 in the wake of Dak Prescott's broken ankle. And Ballard has to like the idea of giving up nothing more than a mid-tier contract while searching for a longer-term solution to the position on a parallel track.\n\nMac Jones\n\nBallard could always turn to the draft to fill the position. Given the Colts will pick 21st in the first round this year, Jones seems like the most realistic target – though a trade up wouldn't be out of the question if a prospect like BYU's Zach Wilson, Ohio State's Justin Fields or North Dakota State's Trey Lance fell within range.\n\nStill, Jones, who will be 23 in September, seems logical given he comes from an Alabama program that resembles an NFL team in some ways and is used to being a distributor rather than the center of attention. A guy who completed 77% of his passes in 2020 could theoretically step right into an offense built to run the rock while supplementing a staunch defense with a ball-control approach.\n\n(And, yes, his dismantling of Ohio State's defense in Alabama's recent national championship victory shows he's not just a game manager.)\n\nSam Darnold\n\nThe New York Jets drafted him third overall in 2018, using a pick acquired from Ballard – who thought then that Luck would be Indianapolis' starter for the long term. But now the Jets could opt to reset the position with the No. 2 pick in 2021, meaning Darnold would be available with at least two years of contractual control. He was widely viewed as the best QB prospect on the board when he came out of USC but has been plagued by the turmoil and talent gap that so often plagues the Jets ... and his own tendency to press. He could be a relatively low-cost, high-ceiling reclamation project in a place where he could initially reboot as a role player.\n\nMitchell Trubisky\n\nBarring a franchise tag from the Bears, he's also headed for free agency. Though he was a Pro Bowler in 2018, the No. 2 pick of the 2017 draft has largely been a disappointment in Chicago. Signing him could represent a sweet spot between guys like Dalton and Darnold when it comes to finding the right mix of experience and upside. Adding Trubisky would certainly suggest Ballard had a Plan B in the works, too. But this could be the kind of environment, similar to those 2018 Bears, where Trubisky could excel as part of the puzzle without being saddled by outlandish expectations.\n\nJacob Eason\n\nThe only reason last year's fourth-round pick rates a mention is because he's currently the only quarterback on Indy's roster who's under contract. Eason, considered a boom-or-bust prospect after a checkered college career split between Georgia and Washington, did not play as a rookie and is probably the classic example of a youngster especially hindered by the lack of a 2020 preseason due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It would be surprising if he challenges for the backup job in 2021. But if he makes a meteoric rise up the depth chart this offseason, he wouldn't be the first quarterback to come trotting into the spotlight from anonymity.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

USA TODAY staff and wire reports\n\nPeter Phillips, the eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, and his wife Autumn are divorcing after 12 years of marriage.\n\nThe couple said in a statement Tuesday that the separation was sad but amicable. They plan to share custody of daughters Savannah, 9, and Isla, 7.\n\nThe 42-year-old Phillips is the son of Princess Anne, the queen's only daughter, and will be the first of the queen's eight grandchildren to divorce. Three of the monarch's four children are divorced, including Anne, who split from Mark Phillips in 1992. (Anne subsequently married Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence.)\n\nPhillips married Canadian management consultant Autumn Kelly at St. George's Chapel in Windsor in 2008. They met in Montreal the previous year.\n\nShe was Catholic and under the then-current rules, she had to renounce her faith and convert to the Church of England because Peter was in the line of succession. He is now 15th in line to the throne. (Nowadays, under new legislation passed before Prince George was born six years ago, members of the royal family are no longer forbidden from marrying Catholics.)\n\nAt their children's births, Anne and Mark decided not to seek titles for either of their children so they are just known as Peter Phillips and Zara Phillips Tindall.\n\nAmong other things Peter was a strong support to his younger cousins Prince William and Prince Harry when their mother was killed in a car crash in 1997. He is also a favorite of the queen.\n\nAnnouncement of Peter and Autumn's separation comes after a tumultuous few months for Britain's royal family. Last month the queen's grandson Prince Harry and his wife, the former Meghan Markle, quit royal duties, saying they wanted to seek financial independence and spend more time in North America.\n\nIn a January speech, Prince Harry expressed great sadness over his and Duchess Meghan's decision to step back from their royal duties.\n\nSpeaking at a charity event for Sentebale, the charity he co-founded in 2006 to honor Princess Diana's support for those affected by HIV and AIDS, Prince Harry, 35, addressed the elephant in the room: He told attendees he wanted them to hear the truth from me, as much as I can share.\n\nJust weeks earlier, the queen's second son, Prince Andrew, also stepped down from royal duties in November amid controversy over his friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nIn a statement announcing the change in his public role, Prince Andrew said he continued to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nShocking headlines – and pictures – popped up in January 2015 when an American woman living in Australia, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, 35, alleged in court documents that she was groomed by Epstein and his associates to sexually service Epstein's powerful friends when she was a young Florida teen.\n\nAndrew emphatically denied knowing anything about Epstein's alleged crimes and to having any sexual contact with Giuffre.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, USA TODAY, and The Associated Press
Russia accidentally recognizes gay marriage\n\nA newlywed couple returning to Russia pulled off a first for the country, by finding a legal loophole that accidentally forced officials into recognizing gay marriage for the first time. For more on the story here is Zachary Devita.
The holiday parties and New Year's celebrations flew by. Suddenly, we're thrust into the glorious Hollywood parade of awards season, with the 77th annual Golden Globe Awards (NBC, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT) stepping up as the first star-studded event Sunday night.\n\nNot prepared? No problem. We have the guide for what to look for as Ricky Gervais kicks off the festivities – his fifth Golden Globes hosting gig – and the most glamorous stars in the world assemble at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, for a plant-based meal (for the first time).\n\nHere are five things to watch for during the awards show.\n\nGolden Globes 2020: How to watch the show and what you need to know\n\nGolden Globes predictions:Who will win – and who should?\n\nWatch as Ricky Gervais takes his final hosting shots at Hollywood\n\nOften drinking lager at the podium, Gervais has a reputation for taking the mickey out of the biggest stars in Hollywood, many of whom will be seated mere feet away from the After Life star.\n\nGervais has been especially harsh toward the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group who previously hired the acerbic star for three successive years – from 2010 to 2012 and a fourth time in 2016.\n\nBut this fifth time will be significant since Gervais has promised that it will be his final show. This, in his words, could make for a fun evening. The British comic has already stepped into real controversy on Twitter, making a joke last month that critics found transphobic. Far from apologizing, Gervais carried on.\n\nThe more people are offended by a joke, particularly on Twitter, the funnier I find it. And the angrier the tweet, the more chance of me using it and turning it to laughs and cash, he wrote. PC culture isn't killing comedy. It's driving it. As it always did.\n\nThis will make for a riveting evening.\n\nAwkwafina could make history as the awards race starts\n\nThe Golden Globes are decided by a small group of foreign journalists, but the results do give a sense of trends that could play out in the awards season ahead of the Oscars on Feb. 9, along with giving a major boost to winners.\n\nDirector Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story leads all films with six nominations (including acting nods for stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson), ahead of Martin Scorsese's The Irishman with five (including for stars Al Pacino and Joe Pesci). Awkwafina is the odds-on favorite to make history with a best actress in a musical/comedy win for her role in The Farewell, which would make her the first Asian actress to win the category. That will be a speech to remember.\n\nJust as riveting will be the prospect of Joaquin Phoenix pulling a best actor award (as pundits predict) for the dark hit Joker, and what the wild-card actor will say from the lectern.\n\nIn the best comedy/musical actor category, Eddie Murphy looks to revive his awards season mojo with a best actor win for Dolemite Is My Name, and Renee Zellweger starts her awards spotlight run, looking to win best actress in a drama for Judy.\n\nIt's a fashion show with the world's most glamorous stars\n\nThe Golden Globes is almost custom-built to please TV viewers, with multiple categories to make sure the big stars get the nominations and walk the red carpet. Nominated mega-stars Brad Pitt and Leonard DiCaprio will represent Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Meanwhile, just the best actress in a drama category includes Zellweger, Johansson, Charlize Theron (Bombshell), Cynthia Erivo (Harriet) and Saoirse Ronan (Little Women).\n\nThe Golden Globes are less rowdy inside than the show's craziest days, such as the legendary 1958 show during which Frank Sinatra and alcohol-fueled members of the Rat Pack took over award presentations in a show that went until 1 a.m.\n\nBut the champagne still flows freely during the awards program, which always makes for excitingly unpredictable TV viewing.\n\nBeloved Tom Hanks gets a lifetime achievement award\n\nThis is going to be Big. Tom Hanks, 63, will take the Globes' lifetime achievement salutation, called the Cecil B. DeMille Award, which goes to those leaving a lasting impact on the film industry. Past honorees include Robert De Niro, Audrey Hepburn, Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, Sidney Poitier and Steven Spielberg.\n\nThe Oscar-winning Hanks has already been nominated for a Golden Globe for his Mister Rogers role in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. But this is a sure win, with big names paying their respects on the podium, a film tribute that would make Forrest Gump blush, and Hanks giving a speech.\n\nEllen DeGeneres follows in the footsteps of Carol Burnett\n\nThis is going to be funny, and touching. Ellen DeGeneres, 61, will be the second recipient ever of the Carol Burnett Award, citing the highest level of achievement in television. It's exclusive company, since the only other winner is Burnett, who took the first award in her name last year. The Ellen DeGeneres Show host and Ellen star will be recognized for her impact. The moment will have resonance and, no doubt, many laughs.
Did the arrival of Disney+ and Apple TV+ cause streaming audiences to cool off their love affair and chill less with Netflix? Apparently not.\n\nDespite two new heavyweight contenders, the net TV provider added more subscribers than expected – beating several Wall Street metrics. And viewership is 40% higher for returning royals series The Crown, while The Witcher, a new series launched just last month, is tracking to be Netflix's best viewed season one TV series yet with 76 million homes watching the fantasy series.\n\nTake that, Baby Yoda and The Mandalorian.\n\nNetflix said Tuesday that it added 8.76 million subscribers worldwide between October and December 2019 – it was during November that Disney+ and Apple TV+ joined the streaming wars. Netflix's growth surpassed Wall Street expectations and its own forecast of 7.6 million new subscribers.\n\nOverall, Netflix grew 20% over the last year and now has 167.1 million subscribers worldwide, with more than 100 million outside the U.S.\n\niPhone hacks:Here are 20 tips to make you fall more in love with your smartphone\n\nUber testing:Drivers set their own fares in California in response to gig economy laws\n\nThe recent love the streamer has gotten from the Academy hasn't hurt either – and could help sustain subscriber numbers in the current January-March quarter. Netflix expects to gain 7 million subscribers in Q1, compared to its all-time quarterly high growth of 9.6 million in the same period a year ago.\n\nLast week, Netflix reeled in 24 Oscar nominations, up from 15 last year, when Roma was nominated for Best Picture and won three awards including best director. The Irishman got 10 including Best Picture; also nominated for Best Picture was its divorce drama Marriage Story, which had six total.\n\nThe Two Popes landed three nominations, including best actor and supporting actor nods for Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins, respectively. The Obamas' first Netflix documentary, American Factory, got nominated, too, for best documentary.\n\nNote to the competition: That's the kind of bar Netflix is setting.\n\nWe have a big head start in streaming and will work to build on that by focusing on the same thing we have focused on for the past 22 years – pleasing members, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings wrote in a letter to shareholders released Tuesday after the market's close.\n\nWe believe if we do that well, Netflix will continue to prosper, he wrote. As an example, in Q4, despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per membership grew both globally and in the U.S. on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters.\n\nHastings noted that ​Google search trends​ for ​The Witcher​, outperformed the new Disney+ Star Wars series ​The Mandalorian​, Amazon's Jack Ryan, which returned during for season two during November,​ and the new Apple TV+ series, ​The Morning Show, starring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carrell.\n\nNetflix added 548,000 new subscribers in U.S. and Canada – the company now releases subscriber totals by international regions with the U.S. and Canada combined as one. The company's biggest growth was in its Europe/Middle East/Africa region where it added 4.4 million subscribers.\n\nNetflix expects to gain 7 million subscribers worldwide in the January-March quarter, compared to 9.6 million in the same period a year ago – an all-time quarterly high.\n\nShares of Netflix were up 2.5% to $346 after briefly falling 2% after the company released its financials.\n\nMany had expected to see Netflix hit another bump in terms of subscriber growth, especially with the new competition on the streaming scene. The streaming provider had missed two previous subscriber growth forecasts, gaining 6.8 million in the second quarter (7 million expected) and missing its first quarter forecast by far with 2.7 million new subscribers, compared to the 5 million forecasted.\n\nDespite all the new challengers – NBCUniversal's Peacock and AT&T's HBO Max streaming services are due this spring – Netflix still sits in a position of strength, says Michael Olson, analyst with Piper Sandler, which has a price target of $400.\n\nAs consumer content dollars shift from traditional TV to streaming, we think the market will support multiple players, with Netflix leading the way, Olson said in an investor note last week. In other words, despite new services on the horizon from Disney and Apple (and probably others), we expect minimal long-term impact to Netflix subscriber addition and retention.\n\nBut Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter suggests Netflix faces a steep uphill climb to replace the content it is slated to lose over the next two years, he said in an investor note last week. It remains unclear whether Netflix can replace it with quantity and quality sufficient to keep its current subscriber base loyal.\n\nThe streaming company reported Q4 revenue of $5.47 billion, up 30% over the October-December period a year ago. That nearly matched the $5.45 billion expected, based on analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Netflix had estimated revenue of $5.4 billion, compared to $4.2 billion a year ago.\n\nNet income of $587 million was more than three times that of $133.9 million a year ago. Netflix forecasted net income of $232 million, while analysts had expected $239.41 million.\n\nEarnings per share of $1.30 surpassed expectations of 53 cents. In the period a year ago, Netflix reported earnings of 30 cents.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.
It can be tricky when TV shows try to portray the millennial experience. Sometimes creators fail spectacularly. Other times what shows up on screen is so real it hurts.\n\nHurt, anger, sadness, and love are some of the emotions younger viewers might experience in Hulu's remake of High Fidelity starring Zoe Kravitz (streaming Friday, ★★★½ out of four), a piercing and relatable look at one woman's struggle to find lasting love in New York.\n\nKravitz takes over the lead role that John Cusack played in the beloved 2000 film, and rather than rehashing an old story (although there are plenty of callbacks), Fidelity creators Sarah Kucserka and Veronica West (Ugly Betty) craft something singular and stunning. The series is a love story that is neither fairy tale nor entirely cynical, with a cast of electric actors who seem destined for great things.\n\nLike the original film and the Nick Hornby novel on which it's based, Hulu's Fidelity centers on Rob Gordon (only now it's short for Robyn), the proprietor and sometimes DJ of Championship Records.\n\nA year after Mac (Kingsley Ben-Adir) walked out on her, Rob still isn't quite over him, but she tries dating again and meets the unassuming nice guy Clyde (Jake Lacy), and there might be a spark if only she can pay attention to him long enough. A chance encounter with Mac has her reeling about her inability to be in a successful relationship, so she begins a journey to get in touch with the Top 5 men and women who broke her heart.\n\nThe cast is filled out by Rob's two record store employees – Simon (David H. Holmes), an unambitious music fanatic who made the list of Rob's heartbreaks after he came out as gay and broke up with her; and Cherise (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), a boisterous wannabe musician who can't figure out how to start that career.\n\nFidelity works as a new take on a well-known story while standing on its own. Elements from the book and film are playfully reimagined here, including the fourth-wall-breaking narration and the iconic primeval shriek of What Ian guy?! from Cusack when he finds out his ex has a new beau.\n\nThe narrative is updated for 2020, with references to Tinder and a struggle to keep the record store in business in the age of Spotify. The series is also achingly accurate in its portrayal of the period of young adulthood when some friends move on to marriage and kids and others still party just as hard as ever. The writing is sharp and concise, and at 10 half-hour episodes, it feels exactly the right length.\n\nRob is not perfect by any means, and it's a huge credit to Kravitz's performance and innate charm that she remains likable despite revelations of past wrongs. She hurts and causes hurt, just like the rest of us. Kravitz, whose mother Lisa Bonet starred in the film, imbues Rob with a cool factor emphasized by the character's bohemian wardrobe and distaste for Instagram influencers and gentrification. She has chemistry with nearly every romantic or platonic foil she faces.\n\nHowever, Holmes is the series' big breakout. In a late-season episode that spins the camera away from Rob and gives Simon a chance to recount his heartbreaks, Holmes is so magnetic, and such a natural leading man, that you might wish Fidelity had been about him instead. A major flaw is the underuse of Randolph, who had a star-making turn in last year's Dolemite Is My Name alongside Eddie Murphy. Simon's episode begs to be followed up with one from Cherise's point of view, especially one that makes her a romantic hero like Rob and Simon.\n\nRomantic comedies have so many tropes and predictable punchlines that the whole genre has become a cliché. It can be hard to remember why stories of love and loss, balanced with just enough humor, became so popular in the first place. Fidelity isn't revolutionary, but it's just nuanced enough to remind us how affecting a first date and a tear-filled breakup can be.\n\nIt's a new look for the formerly masculine, Gen X Fidelity story, but it's got the same great flavor.\n\nWinter TV:10 new shows to watch, from 'Locke & Key' to 'High Fidelity'
Jason Strother\n\nPRI.org\n\nYoon Ji-young lays down slabs of fatty pork belly that sizzle and crackle as they touch the burning hot grill atop her kitchen table. Four months into her first pregnancy, the 35-year-old says she's been caught off guard by the weird desires she's had for meaty dishes that she typically avoids.\n\nI've had strong cravings for junk food, like hamburgers and fried chicken, she says. I don't even like fried chicken at all!\n\nYoon says she's looking forward to her mother's dumplings and other home-cooked meals when she and her husband, Canadian expat Matthew Crawford, 37, visit her family outside of Seoul for the Lunar New Year, which is locally called Seollal and begins today. Based on the Chinese zodiac, their child will be born in the year of the dog — a reputedly auspicious year to give birth.\n\nIn South Korea, some people refer to the zodiac animal they were born under much in the same way a person in the U.S. would talk about their astrological sign and the personality traits associated with it. Some believe that a person born during a dog year will exhibit canine-like characteristics; including intelligence and loyalty.\n\nAccording to tradition, this year is especially lucky because it represents a golden dog — a cycle in the zodiac that comes around every 60 years and means extra prosperity.\n\nSouth Korean media speculate that the country's birthrate, one of the world's lowest, could rise thanks to the perceived enhanced fortune as it did in 2007 during the year of the golden pig — a reported 10% surge in births.\n\nYoon and Crawford admit they don't necessarily buy into all the beliefs connected to the zodiac and didn't intend to start their family in the dog year, but will never the less welcome the positive notions that come with it.\n\nI'm sure we'll hear a lot about the year of the golden dog, says Crawford, who adds that the success of his three-year marriage has been attributed to their zodiac animals, a monkey and a pig.\n\nIt's a good combination — pigs and monkeys get along together, he recalls being told on multiple occasions.\n\nFaced with shrinking demographics, the South Korean government has tried encouraging couples to start families by passing laws that guarantee working parents fully or partially paid maternity and paternity leave. And to make commuting easier for pregnant people, women can obtain pink badges that signal to other passengers on Seoul's metro system to give up their seats.\n\nYoon and Crawford joke about how they're helping the nation boost its population, but note that raising a child in South Korea is, for some, prohibitively expensive.\n\nYoon, a business analyst at an international company in Seoul, explains that parents are expected to spend lots of money on children's education — and that's a big reason why many couples decide to have only one child, or none at all.\n\nShe says she feels pressured already to educate her unborn child because pregnant Korean women are obsessed with making their child smarter and better than the others.\n\nBabies have to be competitive, she says with a laugh.\n\nTo get an edge on the competition, says Crawford, who works in the education field, the couple plays Mozart in the evening and he reads poetry directly to his wife's belly.\n\nBefore heading out of town for what's considered one of Korea's most important family holidays, Yoon says she's grateful that unlike many parents, her own mother and father never pressured her to marry or produce a grandchild — a grandson in particular.\n\nIn fact, the couple isn't legally allowed to know whether to expect a son or daughter.\n\nA traditional preference for boys coupled with the introduction of ultrasound technology decades ago, led to a rise in sex-selective abortions and caused a lingering imbalance in South Korea's male to female ratio.\n\nThat prompted authorities in the 1980s to ban obstetricians from revealing a baby's gender in utero. But, Yoon says during a recent ultrasound, she realized her doctor was trying to give her a hint.\n\nThe doctor looked at the screen and said she saw something, so I asked if it was a pretty or handsome something, Yoon says.\n\nWith a grin, her doctor replied, It's handsome.\n\nThis article was originally published on PRI.org.

Irina Shayk is not one to speak on her personal life, not even when it comes to Bradley Cooper – until now.\n\nThe supermodel gave a rare glimpse into her relationship with the A Star is Born actor post-breakup during a British Vogue cover interview published Monday.\n\nShayk said navigating life without Cooper is new territory.\n\nI think we've been very lucky to experience what we had with each other, she said. Life without B is new ground.\n\nWhile the couple rarely speak about their relationship or split, the two reportedly broke up in June 2019 after four years together.\n\nI think in all good relationships you bring your best and your worst – it's just the nature of a human being, she said. Two great people don't have to make a good couple.\n\nThe 34-year-old model and Cooper share a 3-year-old daughter, Lea De Seine Shayk Cooper, who they co-parent. But even with Cooper's support, as a single working mom, Shayk admitted that sometimes it gets tough.\n\nIt's hard to find a balance between being a single mom and being a working woman and provider. Trust me, there are days I wake up and I'm like, 'Oh my god, I don't know what to do, I'm falling apart,'  Shayk said.\n\nThis is the first time the Sports Illustrated model has directly spoken about her relationship with Cooper. A month after rumors of their split were swirling, Shayk snagged BAZAAR.com's summer digital cover, but the notoriously private model stayed quiet on the subject of her relationship.\n\nIrina didn't comment on her personal life before, nor will she 'address recent developments' now, said one of her modeling agents, according to the cover story.\n\nContributing: Anika Reed\n\nMore:Irina Shayk says she believes in marriage amid Bradley Cooper split rumors\n\nMore:Irina Shayk sparks Bradley Cooper breakup rumors, steps out without ring
WASHINGTON – When Sen. Dick Durbin first met Tereza Lee — then an undocumented teenager living with an unspoken, ever-present fear of deportation — the Illinois Democrat thought it would be easy to address her anguishing immigration status.\n\nHe called federal immigration officials and recounted the story of this budding piano prodigy from Chicago who wanted to go to college and live the American dream. Sorry, they said, Lee would have to be deported to Brazil — a country she'd left at the age of 2 with her parents — wait there for 10 years and then petition for re-entry to the U.S.\n\nWe've got to fix this, Durbin thought.\n\nThat was 17 years ago. Now, Lee is known to some as the original 'DREAMer.'  And the spark she lit in Durbin in 2001 has become a raging national fire that has mobilized activists and paralyzed Congress.\n\nAt the center of the blaze is the DREAM Act, which Durbin sponsored in 2001 to create a path to citizenship for young immigrants brought to the U.S. as children and now living here illegally. Those who would benefit from the DREAM Act quickly became labeled DREAMers.\n\nWhat started out as a bipartisan bill eventually led to a polarizing executive order — issued by President Barack Obama and rescinded by President Trump.\n\nWhen he first proposed the DREAM Act, Durbin believed it would be a simple, commonsense and humane bipartisan action, said Josh Hoyt, an immigration-rights activist who began working with Durbin on the issue in the early 2000s. Now it's dragged on for 17 years and has gotten to the point where it's shut down the government.\n\nIn recent weeks, Durbin has been the target of derogatory tweets from Trump and bitter complaints from disappointed DREAMers. And the real test is still ahead, as the Illinois Democrat tries to navigate the current immigration standoff and Lee watches intently from the sidelines hoping Durbin doesn't lose his will.\n\nThe fate of the DREAMers was at the heart of last weekend's government shutdown, and it remains the main sticking point as lawmakers try to negotiate a new agreement that will both keep the government open and prevent the DREAMers from being deported.\n\nHe truly feels that this is his legacy, said Lee, now a 34-year-old American citizen, immigration-rights activist, and pianist studying for her doctorate at the Manhattan School of Music. Lee became a citizen through marriage in 2010.\n\nLee said part of her believes that Durbin will do whatever it takes to get the bill into law. But another part, she said, is burning mad that Durbin and other Democrats caved in to the Republicans and agreed to reopen the government without an agreement to protect the DREAMers.\n\nThey should be powerful enough and courageous enough not to do that, Lee said.\n\nLee knows something about courage. She was 7 years old when she learned that she was living in the United States illegally.\n\nMy dad sat us down around the living room, she recalled. He said he had a very serious secret to tell us. We couldn't say anything to anybody.\n\nLee's parents fled South Korea after the Korean War left them financially devastated. The couple moved to Brazil first and then to the U.S. when Lee was 2. They arrived on tourist visas and stayed after those expired, with her mother working in a dry cleaners and her father serving as a pastor at a church on Chicago's north side.\n\nIt was at her father's church that she discovered the piano. My dad forced me to learn a hymn a week, she said. By the time I was 9, I had memorized the entire hymn book.\n\nAfter a wealthy parishioner bought her family a piano, Lee started playing in — and winning — local competitions. In high school, she earned a scholarship to attend the Merit School of Music, a Chicago institution that provides musical training to low-income children.\n\nRead more:\n\nCongress solved the shutdown but deep spending and immigration disputes remain. What now?\n\nSchumer rescinds offer to Trump to fund the wall in an immigration deal\n\nAfter the shutdown, 4 things that make the road ahead to a 'DREAMer' deal rocky\n\nAs Lee blossomed, Merit's artistic director at the time, Ann Monaco, started asking about her college plans. Lee said she had no such plans.\n\nShe printed out 10 college application forms, including to Juilliard, and asked me to fill them out, Lee recalled. Lee brought them back to Monaco with her birthplace listed as Brazil and the Social Security number box empty.\n\nWhen Monaco asked for an explanation, I burst into tears and told her I was undocumented, Lee recalled. She had never uttered that word to anyone outside her family, and she begged Monaco not to report her to the police.\n\nMonaco called Durbin, not the police. At the time, Lee thought she was alone in her immigration limbo. Durbin guessed there were others like her but didn't realize how many — until he started talking publicly about her case.\n\nOne by one, other undocumented children started coming to him, often waiting by his car after events around Illinois.\n\nI'm one of those kids, Durbin recalled of those hushed conversations. I couldn't imagine the stress and the strain they were under, the senator said, as they literally came out of the shadows to ask for his help.\n\nThat's my idea\n\nWhen Durbin first crafted the DREAM Act in 2001, he got a call from an irritated Republican, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. What are you doing stealing my bill? Hatch asked Durbin. That's my idea.\n\nRepublicans were in the majority at the time, so Durbin decided to sign his name to Hatch's proposal instead of pursuing his own. The first hearing was set for Sept. 12, 2001, and the two lawmakers had lined up strong bipartisan support.\n\nThen came the Sept. 11 attacks. The hearing was canceled. The mood of the country shifted.\n\nPeople started to fear perceived outsiders, Lee said. People started to become very kind of closed to the immigrant communities.\n\nDurbin said it became more difficult for him to find GOP co-sponsors for the bill, as the Republican Party took a tougher line on immigration. Conservatives said the DREAM Act was a Trojan horse for a broader amnesty bill that would grant legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nHatch said it became mired in stupid politics, and the DREAM Act, along with broader immigration reform efforts, stalled year after year after year.\n\nHe's had his heart broken a number of times, Hoyt said of Durbin. His interest in this is deeply personal. ... He really believes that what's happening with DREAMers is one of the most unfair things this country is doing.\n\nThe DREAM Act came close to passing as part of a broader immigration reform bill that cleared the Senate in 2013. But that bill included a path to citizenship for the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. And conservatives threatened to revolt if then-speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called the Senate bill up for a vote.\n\nThe impasse prompted Obama to issue an executive order in 2012, giving DREAMers the ability to apply for temporary legal status and work permits. Approximately 800,000 young immigrants signed up for the program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n\nIn reversing Obama's order, Trump gave Congress until March 5 to address the status of the DREAMers — throwing an immigration time bomb into lawmakers' laps where it's gotten tangled up with an already treacherous spending debate. The three-day shutdown came after Durbin and other Democrats pushed unsuccessfully to attach a fix for the DREAMers to a spending bill to keep the government open.\n\nIt ended when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., promised Democrats he would allow open debate on an immigration bill by Feb. 8, when the next spending bill expires. Durbin said it would give lawmakers a chance to break the partisan stalemate and work cooperatively on immigration.\n\nTo all the DREAMers who are watching today, don't give up, Durbin said on the Senate floor Monday. I know that your lives are hanging in the balance on what we do here.\n\nLee's life is no longer hanging in the balance, but she was one of those watching the news on television Monday — and organizing in the streets. She came away feeling conflicted.\n\nPeople put their trust in the Democratic Party, and they're not delivering, she said. At the same time, she believes Durbin will keep his word and fight for the DREAM Act all the way until it's passed,\n\nOthers said if anyone can get a deal, it's Durbin.\n\nHe's more passionate about this than anybody, said Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., one of the key GOP players in the negotiations. And he's more experienced on it than anybody.\n\n.Read more:\n\nThere are 3.6M 'DREAMers' — a number far greater than commonly known\n\nWhat is 'chain migration' and why does President Trump want to end it?\n\nDid Trump use vulgar language at an immigration meeting?

New Jersey police pursuits killed at least 55 people in the past decade and injured more than 2,500. Nearly half the people injured were bystanders and cops.\n\nNew Jersey ranks second in the nation behind Louisiana for the percentage of African Americans killed during police pursuits since 2009, an Asbury Park Press and USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey investigation found. New Jersey leads the nation over the last 20 years.\n\nNewark police car chases killed black residents at a higher rate than any other city in the country, the last decade of federal fatal crash data shows. Thirteen people were killed in Newark pursuits, nine were not in the car police were chasing. One was a three-year-old boy. All were black.\n\nMost chases in the last two years didn't arrest a suspect. Even when cops catch a fleeing driver, they're most frequently charged with drug possession. People fleeing the police are rarely robbers or wanted killers, the Network found after reviewing more than 66,000 state arrest records on people fleeing from cops.\n\nDig Deeper: NJ police chases are killing innocent people. Here's how to make them safer.\n\nNew Jersey's written policy has acknowledged for decades that most chases start with traffic violations. The rules say cops aren't allowed to chase cars for motor vehicle offenses, with one important and broad exception: Police can chase if an officer feels the vehicle is being operated so as to pose an immediate threat to the safety of another person.\n\nIt can happen to anybody. Pizza delivery driver killed by motorcyclist fleeing cop Eric Larson was killed on his way home from work, leaving his fianceé to raise two daughters alone. Andrew Ford, @AndrewFordNews\n\nThat one-sentence exception allows cops to engage in dangerous, high-speed chases that start with even the smallest traffic infraction, like an illegal right on red. Traffic violations prompted at least 23 fatal pursuits, law enforcement records show.\n\nI think that it is ridiculous that police are allowed to chase people for violations that are trivial in the grand scheme of things, said Taylor Bromberg, whose fiancé, Eric Larson, was killed in Jackson by a motorcycle fleeing police after the motorcyclist failed to stop when turning right at a red light.\n\nTo understand New Jersey police pursuits, the Network reviewed more than 5,000 pages of police chase summary reports to compile 10 years of data on the state's 466 municipal police departments.\n\nThe Network also analyzed more than four million New Jersey state court arrest records, 1.3 million fatal crash records from the federal government and state data on police pursuits. The Network conducted dozens of interviews that included law enforcement experts, police, lawmakers and people affected by the aftermath of police chases.\n\nNew Jersey state Sen. Ron Rice, D-Essex, whose district includes Newark, called for a legislative hearing to investigate police pursuits after he reviewed the Network's key findings.\n\nIt appears to me there's a lot more harm done than good right now, Rice said.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said his office needed time to review the data presented by the Network.\n\nI have not shied away from enforcing the pursuit policy, he said, noting that was a reason he took over The Palisades Interstate Parkway Police Department in 2017 when he served as Bergen County prosecutor.\n\nHe spoke to a reporter about pursuits at a press conference Dec. 4, where he announced a series of police accountability reforms, some of which address problems previously highlighted by the Network. He pointed to those reforms when asked about pursuits.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Attorney General Gurbir S.

By the same token, our Office of Public Integrity is there to hold those accountable who might violate those policies in a criminal way too.\n\nGrewal's office later issued a statement pointing to the Office of Policing Policy, a branch of the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability, which was tasked with reviewing attorney general directives and ensuring compliance.\n\nPolice pursuits have been something that law enforcement struggled with for a long time — you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't, said Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose. But you take into consideration, an officer that follows the guidelines, and the officers that do the job, it's the behavior of the person that they're pursuing that's creating that type of environment.\n\nThe president of the state's largest police union declined to comment on pursuits when presented with the Network's key findings.\n\nWhen he was Milwaukee police chief, Edward Flynn saw a spike in police car chase deaths. To curb the deaths, in 2010 he limited the reasons his officers could go on chases.\n\nAll the data indicates that it's never worth it, almost never, Flynn, said about police pursuits. He's a former Jersey City officer with law enforcement experience in several states.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of when police pursuits are appropriate, and for how long and at what level of risk, our moral obligation is to limit that potential for a bad outcome, Flynn said. And if that means limiting our officers' willingness to be brave on the public behalf, sometimes we have to do that.\n\nPursuits hurt cops\n\nShow caption Hide caption A heavily damaged Millville police cruiser rests near Broad and 3rd streets on Sunday morning, hours after a crash in which Officer Christopher Reeves was...

He was captured by Camden County police.\n\nIn November, Absecon police chased four men later charged in connection to a shooting at a Pleasantville High School football game.\n\nBut these chases represent a tiny fraction of the incidents in which people are fleeing New Jersey police, court records show. Out of 66,816 people accused of eluding police in the past four decades, 174 faced both a murder charge and an eluding charge.

Friend recalls Umar King, who was killed by a fleeing driver King gave up his time to teach sign language to his community. Kevin R. Wexler and Andrew Ford, Asbury Park Press\n\nLooking just at the cars police are choosing to chase, New Jersey still leads the nation for racial disparity in police pursuits.\n\nIn the last 20 years, New Jersey police pursuits took the lives of 38 people who were riding in the car police were chasing, the data shows. Twenty-three of them were black. Six were white.\n\nThat's a larger disparity than any other state.\n\nSet aside passengers who were killed and the gap remains.\n\nTwelve of the fleeing drivers were black, five were white.\n\nThat's a larger disparity than any other state.\n\nIt suggests there's a kind of devaluing of the lives of people of color in those communities, without — I don't think — broad public conversation from the police department saying: listen folks, this is for your own safety, Alex Shalom, senior supervising attorney for the ACLU in New Jersey, said of the Network's findings.\n\nI don't think there would be buy-in in those communities for policies of the widespread use of police chases if people knew that which you reveal in these data, he added. Which is that most folks are not going to be arrested. When they are arresting people, it's seldom for violent crimes. That suggests that police should be thinking through wholesale changes to the way they conduct chases and frankly whether they're conducting them at all in many instances.\n\nNew Jersey's top rank for racial disparity in police chase deaths doesn't appear to be explained by the time of day of chases, crime rates, population demographics or density.\n\nNewark provided figures that show in 2019, the victims and suspects of murders, aggravated assaults and robberies were usually black people. Murder victims and suspects were black more than 90 percent of the time.\n\nIn 49 states, including New Jersey, most pursuit deaths happened before 6 a.m. or after 6 p.m. — overnight hours when it might be hard to judge the race of a fleeing driver. New Jersey's share of overnight pursuit deaths is lower than most states.\n\nNew Jersey's police pursuit deaths cluster in cities like Newark, which has a large black population and a higher crime rate than the state. But compared to other cities since 2009, Newark leads the nation, with a pursuit death racial disparity bigger than Atlanta, Birmingham, Cleveland or Detroit, cities with higher violent crime rates and a larger percentage of black residents.\n\nFive ways to address deadly police chases Read more\n\nNewark is densely populated, but there's little mathematic correlation between density and racial disparity in police chase deaths, a sample of 100 cities shows.\n\nSetting aside cities where all the people killed were black, there appears to be some correlation between cities with large black populations and disparity in the police pursuit deaths, the 100-city sample shows.\n\nBut Newark isn't the city with the greatest proportion of black residents.\n\nSo why does Newark lead the nation for racial disparity in police pursuits?\n\nFormer Milwaukee chief Edward Flynn and Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose urged a reporter to consider the demographics of the victims of crime.\n\nNewark provided figures that show in 2019, the victims and suspects of murders, aggravated assaults and robberies were usually black people, who make up just under half the city's population.\n\nThe standard forms New Jersey police use to track pursuits don't record the race of a suspect, making it difficult to know if there's a racial disparity in the pursuits that don't end with a death.\n\nMurder victims were 92 percent black people and 97 percent of murder suspects were black. At least 60 percent of aggravated assault victims and suspects were black. Robbery victims were more evenly split — 40 percent black to 37 percent white. Robbery suspects were black 70 percent of the time.\n\nNewark isn't the only city where crime disproportionately involves black people.\n\nData provided by Atlanta Police Department — a city with a proportion of black residents two percentage points greater than Newark— shows a rate similar to Newark for black murder victims (87 percent) and suspects (94 percent) and a higher percentage of black people involved in aggravated assaults in 2019. Atlanta aggravated assault victims were 87 percent black, and 94 percent of the people arrested for assault were black.\n\nAtlanta's violent crime numbers are similar to Detroit, a city with a black population 28 percentage points greater than Newark. More than 90 percent of the victims and perpetrators of aggravated assault and murder were black in 2019, data provided by Detroit shows.\n\nYet those cities with comparable 2019 crime demographics and more black residents have a lower rate for killing black people in police car chases since 2009: Atlanta at 86 percent and Detroit at 78 percent compared to Newark's 100 percent.\n\nAt least four of Newark's deaths took place in the city's South Ward, one as recently as 2018. South Ward Councilman John Sharpe James said he wasn't aware of the city's pursuit death racial disparity and called the police chase deaths random and rare.\n\nAs a police officer, you can't control every scenario, every situation, he said.\n\nThe standard forms New Jersey police use to track pursuits don't record the race of a suspect, making it difficult to know if there's a racial disparity in the pursuits that don't end with a death.\n\nMembers of the Newark Police Division do not arrest for race, Ambrose said in an emailed statement. We make arrests to equally protect the citizens of Newark, without consideration of the race of the perpetrator.\n\nData compiled by the Network shows that on top of a huge racial disparity in pursuit deaths, Newark's chases in the last decade are among the least effective in the state: just under half the pursuits ended with arrests, about 40 percent caused crashes and about 18 percent caused injuries.\n\nA 10-year look at police pursuits does not paint an accurate picture of our policies over the last few years, when we changed strategies to protect the public, Ambrose said in the statement.\n\nNewark's policy on pursuits was last updated in 2017, adding restrictions on the reasons officers can chase cars — no chasing stolen cars and no chasing people just because they fled from police.\n\nNewark cops initiated many fewer pursuits in 2017 and 2018 compared to years before. There were fewer crashes and injuries, but still at least three deaths.\n\nThe pursuits also became less effective, ending with more crashed cars than arrested suspects.\n\nLet's also be mindful that every pursuit begins with actions of the suspect to evade police, putting the public at immediate risk, whether we pursue or not, Ambrose said in the statement.\n\nKilled before his daughter's eyes\n\nFamily photo featuring James Walsh, who was killed by a suspect fleeing police.

And he loved it and always talked to me like I was this amazing genius, even though I was perfectly average.\n\nOn his first visit to campus, father and daughter had dinner at a nearby brew pub. They talked about renting an RV the next summer, maybe cross-country. They talked about going to see the school's basketball team.\n\nAnd then, Erin said, that's when we crossed the street.\n\nIt was about 8:15 p.m. Erin, her dad and a friend were in a crosswalk, headed to a nearby parking lot. They had the light to cross the road.\n\nAnother friend spotted Erin and called out a greeting. She paused to look back. Her father kept walking across the road.\n\nA Honda Civic doing at least 55 m.p.h. on the 25 m.p.h. road veered around cars stopped for the traffic light at the intersection.\n\nErin Walsh, whose father James was killed by a driver being pursued by police I definitely don't think minor traffic violations need to be ending in a high-speed police pursuit.

The driver didn't stop.\n\nAnd at that point, she said, everything kind of goes a little blurry for me.\n\nThe impact killed her father and derailed her life.\n\nShe didn't know how to process the feelings. She said she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition sometimes associated with returning soldiers. She said she began to drink. She has flashbacks and is gripped by anxiety whenever she crosses a street.\n\nThe crash that killed Erin's father and ruined her college years started with a traffic violation.\n\nFamily photos featuring James Walsh, who was killed by a suspect fleeing police. Andrew Ford, USA Today Network\n\nThe driver of the Honda, Frank Bradley Jr., then a 29-year-old man from Newark, was chased after he ran a red light, then sped away when police tried to pull him over, according to a federal judge's ruling that struck down a lawsuit alleging wrongdoing by cops in the pursuit.\n\nBradley was charged with driving on a suspended license and endangering children he had in his car during the chase, in addition to crimes for the crash that killed Erin's father, Essex County Prosecutor's Office announced at the time. He pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and vehicular homicide. He's scheduled to be released from prison in February.\n\nErin called Bradley a coward at his sentencing nine years ago.\n\nNow she forgives him.\n\nHe was my age when he killed my dad, I can't even begin to think of what was going through his head besides fear and panic, she said in an online message. It is what it is, and I hope he finds the support and peace he needs once he gets out.\n\nErin said she doesn't blame the cops for what happened to her father. But she does think New Jersey can do more to limit pursuits and keep bystanders safe.\n\nI definitely don't think minor traffic violations need to be ending in a high-speed police pursuit, she said.\n\nNew Jersey policy has gaps\n\nNew Jersey is among a handful of states with rules for police pursuits and New Jersey's guidelines are the most detailed, according to a 50-state review by undergraduate researchers from The College of New Jersey working in cooperation with the Network. Authorities in two states didn't confirm the student's findings but don't appear to have a statewide policy on pursuits.\n\nThe New Jersey guidelines obligate a cop to consider 10 factors while racing after a fleeing suspect — like chances of success, whether the suspect is known and can be captured later, how much risk is involved, and the officer's driving skills.\n\nOnce the chase is on, cops are supposed to radio in details like the reason for the chase, the direction, speed and information about the fleeing vehicle.\n\nSupervisors play a huge role in pursuits, said Joseph Blaettler, former Union City deputy chief. And that's part of the reason why cops, as soon as they get into a pursuit, they have to call it out. The supervisor has to monitor the pursuit.\n\nBut that doesn't always happen. Jackson Patrolman Cherrick Daniels, involved in the pursuit that ended with the death of motorcyclist Anthony Griffin and pizza delivery driver Eric Larson, didn't call in the pursuit until after the crash, his police report shows. That means a supervisor didn't have a chance to weigh whether the chase was a good idea.\n\nWhen a police car crashes in a pursuit, New Jersey's policy calls for departments to review whether the collision could have been prevented and make a copy of that report available to their county prosecutor's office.\n\nNone of the 21 prosecutor's offices produced these records in response to a Network request, saying they couldn't be easily located and in one case denying access to a report as a confidential internal affairs record. Police cars were involved in more than 1,300 crashes since 2009, records from each town show.\n\nPolice internal investigations are closely guarded secrets in New Jersey, making it difficult to know whether a department took action against a cop involved in a chase.\n\nThis year, the state attorney general was tasked with investigating police-involved deaths and his office announced an investigation related to a police pursuit in August. A spokesman for the office said in December the investigation is ongoing.\n\nRaw video: Fatal crash after Bernards township police chase car for suspended registration A 19-year-old passenger was killed in Bernards Township in Somerset County in 2015 after he was thrown from a car in a crash. Police chased the car because the vehicle's registration was suspended. Andrew Ford, @AndrewFordNews\n\nFamilies aren't finding help in court\n\nLawsuits claiming police misconduct have cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in recent years, the Network found. But these claims appear to yield little for people hurt in police car chases or their loved ones.\n\nData from the largest municipal insurer in the state, which covers at least 240 towns, show they closed 30 cases related to police chases in the last five years, 15 of which cost nothing, the remainder cost a total of $116,088, including the town's attorney fees.\n\nTo win a lawsuit filed against the cops, the law requires an aggrieved relative to show that police engaged in willful misconduct, which means an officer knowingly violated a superior's command or a specific standing order.\n\nIt's easy to show wrongdoing in court when an officer used excessive force against a citizen.\n\nBut it's hard to convince a judge or jury of a police officer's liability when a bystander was injured by a bad guy racing away from police, according to Gregg L. Zeff, a Mount Laurel attorney who has sued cops and defended them.\n\nIt's so hard to prove a claim of wrongdoing when the eluding driver is the injured person that Zeff said he's reviewed such cases, but he hasn't taken one.\n\nEven if I thought that what was done was wrong, it's just too hard to persuade people in a case like that, he said.\n\n'It can happen to anybody'\n\nTaylor Bromberg, 26, visited the grave of her fiancé Eric Larson with her daughters, Adriana Nicole, 5, and Mikayla Grace, 2. Larson was killed by a suspect fleeing police. Andrew Ford, USA Today Network\n\nTaylor Bromberg is 26. Yet she has her name on a gravestone.\n\nShe loved Eric Larson, a native of Jackson, a skilled bowler and Yankees fan who favored sports video games. He stood 6-foot-2 and had long brown hair.\n\nI just thought he was cute, Taylor said.\n\nTaylor's name was chiseled into granite next to Eric's after he was fatally injured in Jackson in July 2018 by a motorcyclist fleeing a traffic stop.\n\nMy whole life plan was taken away instantly, she said.\n\nThey had a daughter together and Eric was an attentive father to her and Taylor's other child. They lived together. They went out as a family together: Adventure Aquarium in Camden, a trick or treat event at Manalapan High School.\n\nThey moved into an apartment in Jackson about three weeks before the crash.\n\nTaylor recalled the night it happened. Eric was working his third day as a delivery driver for a nearby pizzeria. Taylor was asleep.\n\nTheir baby woke her about 1 a.m. She found a river of missed calls on her phone, Eric's uncle took her to the hospital.\n\nShe said she was at the hospital three days straight before taking a break. Eric, his body broken, remained alive for about three weeks.\n\nRaw video: Two fatally injured in Jackson crash after police chase Two lives were lost after a Jackson officer chased a motorcycle that didn't stop completely when turning right at a red light.

There were days Taylor thought about the future.\n\nBut he never left intensive care.\n\nHis worst day was my birthday, she said. He died the next day.\n\nThe officer who initiated the chase, Cherrick Daniels, was suspended without pay about two months after the pursuit that left two dead. Daniels declined to comment on the pursuit.\n\nAsked whether Daniels' suspension was related to his conduct during the deadly pursuit, Jackson Police Chief Matthew D.

He said in a text message he's no longer affiliated with Jackson.\n\nThe town and Daniels face a lawsuit filed on behalf of Eric's estate, claiming Daniels violated police standards for pursuits and Jackson failed to properly train him. An attorney representing Daniels and the town denied the claims in a legal response to the lawsuit.\n\nTaylor didn't realize how many people die like Eric did.\n\nEleven of New Jersey's 55 fatal police chases this decade involved motorcycles.\n\nWhen Assemblyman Gordon Johnson, D-Bergen, did traffic enforcement in the mid-1980s as an officer in Englewood, he avoided pursuing fleeing motorcyclists.\n\nI would never chase motorcycles, he said. Because one of two things: if the guy on the motorcycle is good, you're not going to catch him. If he's not good, he's probably going to kill himself. So, therefore, I just wouldn't bother chasing them. It's not worth it to me.\n\nAs a former cop and Bergen County sheriff, Johnson has taken an interest in police accountability issues raised by the Network, recently introducing a bill intended to stop bad cops from quietly hopping between jobs.\n\nTaylor Bromberg This is a perfect example of what gets left behind.

It may be time to address that and tighten them up a little bit.\n\nTaylor visited her fiancé's grave in the fall, patiently wrangling her two young daughters. She struggled to get the 2- and 5-year-olds to put their shoes on to leave.\n\nThis is a perfect example of what gets left behind, she said, fumbling with the tiny Velcro footwear. There is no help. It's just me.\n\nShe wants people to know what happened to Eric. It wasn't a regular car crash, she said.\n\nIt can happen to anybody – it can happen to you, it can happen to them, she said, gesturing to her daughters.\n\nIt can happen to any person, she said. It's just a matter of when.\n\nAndrew Ford: @AndrewFordNews; 732-643-4281; aford3@gannettnj.com\n\nThis story was produced with assistance by undergraduate researchers from The College of New Jersey under the guidance of Assistant Professor David M.

Deutsche Welle\n\nA 28-year-old man has been arrested in the Indian capital on charges of raping his 8-month-old female cousin.\n\nThe man has confessed, he was drunk when he attacked the girl, a senior police officer said Tuesday. The incident happened Sunday at her home in Delhi, and marks the latest such case in a country notorious for high levels of sexual violence.\n\nDelhi Commission of Women chief Swati Maliwal visited the child in hospital Monday night and tweeted that her injuries were horrific.\n\nThe child's parents had gone to work leaving their daughter in the care of their sister-in-law, police said. It was the sister-in-law's son who raped the child. When the mother returned from work, she found her daughter lying unconscious in a pool of blood, Indian news agency IANS reported, citing police investigators.\n\nThe mother who works as a domestic help called her husband, a daily wage laborer, and they took the child to hospital where it was found that she was sexually assaulted. Investigations pointed to the child's cousin as the assaulter.\n\nA case has been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act. Maliwal said the child underwent three hours of surgery. She suffered inhuman injuries to internal organs, Maliwal tweeted in Hindi. When will things change?\n\nThe incident comes at a time when a series of sexual assault cases have already thrust into focus the utter lack of protection for Indian women and girls, both in public and private spaces. Over the past several weeks, multiple assaults on women and girls have been reported from five towns in India's northern state of Haryana. The crude and frighteningly brutal nature of these attacks had already had Indian society reeling in shock and despair at its inability to prevent such crimes.\n\nPervasive sexual assault\n\nBrutal rapes have been reported in India on a near-daily basis and reports of ghastly sexual assaults have risen in recent years.\n\nThis is complete lawlessness in Haryana and a war on women, senior Indian National Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala recently told DW.\n\nAnd these crimes are happening when the state is celebrating its highest-ever gender ratio of 914 girls per 1,000 boys. What a travesty! Surjewala said.\n\nSexual assault crimes are not new to India, which is still a deeply conservative and patriarchal society where many families prefer sons over daughters. In fact, India's government said Monday that more than 63 million women and girls are statistically missing by being deprived of food, health care and schooling.\n\nOfficials also said Indian families have more than 21 million unwanted girls, a calculation based on analyzing the gender of last-born children.\n\nIndia bans gender-selective abortions, but the practice of aborting female fetuses persists. The birth of a son is celebrated, while a daughter's birth can be a time of mourning, as parents fear the debts they'll incur for marriage dowries.\n\nGirls are threatened before they are born, and every second after they are born. It is a living hell and male attitudes toward them have not helped, lawyer and activist Seema Misra told DW.\n\nAbuse, molestation, torture and rape of girls have become the sad order of the day, which has shamed humanity, rights activist Kavita Krishnan told DW. The entrenched violence against women and the failure of authorities to protect them is sad, she said.\n\nProblems with the 'official' mindset\n\nIn the midst of this outrage over the savage rapes and killings, statements by authorities have only added fuel to the fire. RC Mishra, a director general of police, stoked controversy with comments about the rape-murders, which were construed as being insensitive.\n\nIt's part of society. Such incidents have been taking place forever, Mishra reportedly told an Indian news agency.\n\nEven politicians like Haryana state's Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar have made sexist and misogynistic comments in the past, raising doubts about their resolve to tackle the problem of acute insecurity faced by women in the country.\n\nIn 2014, before he became chief minister, Khattar told an election rally: If a girl is dressed decently, a boy will not look at her in the wrong way. If they want freedom, why don't they just roam around naked? Freedom has to be limited. These short clothes are Western influences. Our country's tradition asks girls to dress decently.\n\nIndia recorded more than 36,000 cases of rape, sexual assault and similar offenses against children under the POCSO Act in 2016, according to data available with India's National Crime Records Bureau. It's unclear whether the series of attacks in recent weeks will prompt authorities to do some soul-searching regarding their failure in this area and mull over how they could best ensure safety for women and girls in India.
Tori Spelling has had enough.\n\nThe mom and former Beverly Hills, 90210 star frequently posts on social media about her family. She and husband Dean McDermott have five children together, plus his son from his first marriage. And those posts are often fodder for shamers, who bash Spelling for everything from letting her daughters dye their hair to the kids' clothes and weight.\n\nBut Saturday, Spelling hit back with a long post to Instagram detailing the bullying she says her kids have faced at school, saying they have been thru so much bullying I can no longer not share.\n\nShe starts her post with 11-year-old Stella, whom she says has endured enough bullying for a lifetime.\n\nMore shaming:Dean McDermott fires back at 'cowards' who criticized Tori Spelling's bikini picture\n\nSpelling says at her old school, administrators told her Stella was playing the victim and that the bully's affluent parents assured there were Never any consequences for his actions.\n\nWhen they moved Stella to a new school, a bully made comments about her weight and sexual things he said that my daughter didn't even know about. This time, the school acted, but the damage had been done.\n\nSpelling says Stella now associates her education with boys that have been so horrific to her. She wanted to empower others girls and be a business leader. She now has panic attacks and doesn't want to return to school.\n\nMore family:Tori Spelling says her relationship with her stepson Jack blossomed after he 'came out'\n\nShe says Liam's principal told her that her son was unmotivated & lazy. The new school that stood up for Stella didn't help Liam, Spelling says: He was bullied to the point that he developed severe emotional based headaches and stomach aches. … He continued to be bullied so bad we had to leave.\n\nThe actress concluded her post by saying she was hesitant to post this bc as celebs we are sometimes judged for having problems others have.\n\nSpelling's comment section was flooded with support from fans and stories from others who have been bullied, or whose kids have had to cope.\n\nDoesn't matter if you are a celebrity or not bullying is never ok, commented Instagram user deavonhobson.\n\nAnd user wyciskala added, Every child deserves to feel safe at school.
After three losing seasons in which they endured locker room strife and looked wayward on the field, the Detroit Lions have a new coach and new direction.\n\nThe Lions agreed to hire New Orleans Saints assistant Dan Campbell as their 28th head coach Wednesday, the team confirmed, plucking him from a pool of candidates for his leadership and motivational ability.\n\nThis is an exciting day for our organization as we introduce Dan Campbell as the new head coach of the Detroit Lions, team owner Sheila Ford Hamp said in a released statement. With more than 20 years of experience as both a coach and player in the National Football League, Dan knows the rigors of professional football and what it takes to be successful. He will help promote the culture we want to establish across our organization, while also bringing with him high energy, a respect for the game and an identity with which everyone can align themselves.\n\nThe deal is for six years, according to a source who was granted anonymity because he is not yet allowed to speak publicly about the agreement.\n\nCampbell replaces Matt Patricia, who was fired Nov. 28 after two-plus seasons with a 13-29-1 record, and interim head coach Darrell Bevell, and is the third ex-Lions player to coach the team in the Super Bowl era.\n\nDan's passion for this opportunity was evident throughout our interview process, Lions president Rod Wood said in the statement. When we began the search for a head coach, it was imperative that we find the right leader who values our commitment to building a winning culture based on organizational alignment and collaboration. The leadership Dan has exemplified throughout his football career has prepared him for this next step, and we are excited to support him as our new head coach.\n\nThe assistant head coach and tight ends coach for the Saints the past five seasons, Campbell has never been a coordinator at any level, but played 11 NFL seasons with four different teams and went 5-7 as interim head coach of the Miami Dolphins in 2015.\n\nHe appeared in 19 games with the Lions in 2006-08.\n\nThe big thing about him is Dan's a tough guy now, said longtime NFL assistant Gregg Williams, the defensive coordinator of the Saints during Campbell's one season playing for the team. Dan doesn't take any bullshit and Dan is a guy that when he practices, he practiced how he played. And he was an overachiever kind of guy, but whenever you watched him do his trade or do his work, whenever he did speak out to his teammates, you had to respect the example he was setting before he talked to you.\n\nCampbell both played for and coached under Saints head coach Sean Payton, and counts Payton and Hall of Fame NFL coach Bill Parcells as two of his coaching mentors.\n\nCampbell played three seasons for Parcells with the Dallas Cowboys, and worked with him as a first-year coaching intern, when Parcells was in the Dolphins' front office.\n\nHe said in an appearance on the Luccicast podcast last summer he was fascinated by Parcells and took copious notes about Parcells' coaching style. The two share a similar philosophy of building a strong, smart defense, playing ball-control football on offense and letting the other team beat itself with mistakes.\n\nCampbell said smart coaches have to be able to adapt, though, to their opponents' strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI'll never forget that from him, it was like, 'Man, what are going to do to win?'  Campbell said on the podcast. You can't use the same thing every game. Like, you have a philosophy, but not every opponent's the same. You have to judge each opponent, what they have and what you have and what the matchup's like different every week, and sometimes what beats that team is not going to beat this team this week. It's just, I know it sounds like, 'Well, that's common sense.' But, man, I'm telling you, not everybody knows how to handle that like he did.\n\nCampbell and new Lions GM Brad Holmes have never worked with each other before, but share a common connection through Williams.\n\nTheir union in Detroit is an arraigned marriage, as the organization held parallel coach and GM searches. Holmes was hired last Thursday, after the Lions finished their first round of coaching interviews.\n\nAlong with Campbell, the Lions formally interviewed five other candidates for the job: Bevell, former Cincinnati Bengals coach Marvin Lewis, and coordinators Eric Bieniemy of the Kansas City Chiefs, Arthur Smith of the Tennessee Titans and Robert Saleh of the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nSmith canceled a second interview with the Lions to take the head coaching job of the Falcons, and Saleh was hired by the New York Jets.\n\nThe Lions did not conduct second interviews with their other candidates.\n\nNow, Campbell and Holmes have the tall task of remaking the Lions' roster. They must rebuild a defense that could need as many as eight new starters, depending on what happens with free agent defensive end Romeo Okwara. They have a decision to make on whether to re-sign top wide receiver Kenny Golladay or use the franchise tag on him before free agency. And they must formulate a plan for how to proceed with Matthew Stafford at the quarterback position, and whether to target his eventual replacement with the seventh pick of this spring's NFL draft.\n\nCampbell is expected to bring Saints secondary coach Aaron Glenn with him as defensive coordinator, and his former strength coach at Texas A&M, Mike Clark, along as strength coach.\n\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.

Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSaturday marks the five-year anniversary of the shocking death of Whitney Houston, the superstar singer emblazoned on American culture, whose legacy endures in the wake of more shocks since.\n\n. .\n\nHouston was found dead Feb. 11, 2012, in a hotel bathtub in Beverly Hills, just hours before music stars began to gather at the hotel for the annual Clive Davis pre-Grammy party at which Houston, then mounting a come-back, was expected.\n\nInstead, she slipped away after slipping under the water in the tub, the victim of an accidental drowning brought on by heart disease and longtime cocaine abuse, as the Los Angeles coroner found weeks later.\n\nOn this anniversary, what do we know about the aftermath?\n\n1. The autopsy report on her death was grim:\n\nAside from some titillating details (she wore a wig and dentures, had undergone breast augmentation, and had mild emphysema in her lungs from smoking), the key findings had to do with the effects of substance abuse. Toxicology results showed she was acutely intoxicated with cocaine at the time of her death; traces of the drug were found throughout her body, indicating chronic use.\n\nIn the bathroom, investigators found a small spoon described as having a crystal-like substance in it, and they discovered a white powdery substance in a drawer. They also found in her room a dozen different prescription medications, including anti-anxiety medication Xanax, but they did not contribute to her death.\n\nIn short, no evidence was found to suggest her death was anything more than an accident, with no foul play involved.\n\n2. Family tragedy, Part 2:\n\nThree years later almost to the week, on Jan. 31, 2015, Houston's daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, then 21, was found unresponsive in a bathtub in the Roswell, Ga., townhouse she inherited from her mother.\n\nBobbi Kristina never regained consciousness to explain what had happened to her. She died nearly six months later, in July 2015, age 22, and was buried next to her mother in a cemetery in New Jersey.\n\nMonths later, the local medical examiner declared her death was the result of immersion in water and a toxic mixture of drugs, but could not conclude if it was the result of homicide or accident. It is still labeled undetermined.\n\nHer boyfriend at the time, Nick Gordon, remains under investigation by the police in Georgia. Bobbi Kristina's family blames him for her death and won a civil lawsuit and judgment of $36 million against him for wrongful death in November 2016.\n\n3. What happened to Whitney's ex, Bobbi Kristina's father?\n\nBobby Brown, divorced from Houston in 2007 after a tumultuous marriage , was devastated by his daughter's tragedy and the three-ring circus that ensued. He has found some measure of happiness with his second wife, Alicia Etheredge, and their three children, including a girl born nearly a year to the day after Bobbi Kristina's death.\n\n4. What happened to Whitney's millions?\n\nShe left an estate estimated at $20 million, although it has likely increased substantially from music sales since her death. Under the terms of her will, the estate was left to Bobbi Kristina but doled out in installments once she reached certain ages. In the event Bobbi Kristina died childless and unmarried before 30, Whitney's will called for the estate to go to her mother, gospel star Cissy Houston, and her two brothers. Whitney's sister-in-law, Pat Houston, took over as the executor of the estate at Cissy Houston's request.\n\n5. What happened to her record sales?\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Houston's death, her music sales soared: Her catalog of songs and albums sold nearly 1 million copies in one day after fans learned of her death.\n\nThe latest data from Nielsen Music show Houston's total album sales since her death through the week ending Feb. 2, 2017, reached nearly 4 million, 3.7 million to be exact.\n\n6. What happened to the Whitney bio-pic?\n\nWhitney, directed by Angela Bassett, aired on Lifetime in January 2015, and was trashed by her family in advance. Pat Houston posted a statement on WhitneyHouston.com, saying the film was produced without the family's blessing and against the wishes of Cissy Houston.\n\nIf you watch this movie, watch it knowing that Lifetime is notorious for making bad biopics of deceased celebrities and brace yourself for the worst, Pat Houston wrote, accusing the filmmakers of assaulting the legacy of Whitney.\n\nTV critics were not impressed, either. But the film, paired with other programs related to Whitney, nevertheless scored good ratings, drawing 4.5 million viewers.\n\n7. What happened to Whitney's reputation?\n\nDespite everything, the turmoil and tragedy, the legal jousting and the lingering unanswered questions, Whitney Houston remains a gold standard for pop singers with pipes, demonstrated every year when someone is chosen to sing the National Anthem at the Super Bowl.\n\nNo matter who it is, no matter how good they are, they are always compared to Whitney, who is widely acknowledged as the singer who set the bar impossibly high in 1991 at Super Bowl XXV in Tampa.\n\nThat is unlikely to change.
Arthur Levine\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nIs marriage on your horizon? Do you love the Disney theme parks almost as much as you love your fiancé? Imagine this fantasy scenario: It's your wedding day, and you ride up Main Street U.S.A. in Cinderella's horse-drawn carriage accompanied by bewigged, royal coachmen. A vintage jitney has already deposited your husband-to-be at the Magic Kingdom's hub. Trumpeters herald your arrival, and your wedding guests stand. You make your way to the altar in a lush garden with the majestic Cinderella Castle rising behind you.\n\nIt's not a fantasy. But it is Fantasyland. Florida's Disney World has announced that couples can now plan their wedding ceremonies inside the Magic Kingdom at the park's new East Plaza Garden.\n\nBrides will be able to live out a fairy tale dream like no other, says Korri McFann, marketing director for the division that helps couples plan their nuptials at the company's properties. It is called, appropriately enough, Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings.\n\nGuide to Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom | Experience America from USA TODAY Travel\n\nAs the world's most popular theme park with an estimated annual attendance approaching 20 million, the Magic Kingdom's central hub had been a congested hubbub. Disney recently expanded and reconfigured the area to better control the flow of guests, including new gardens on both sides. With its whimsical topiaries, fountain, and especially its striking views, the European-inspired garden on the Tomorrowland side is an ideal spot to tie the knot.\n\nThe East Plaza Garden will be available for 9:30 a.m. ceremonies and can accommodate a good-sized destination-wedding crowd of up to 100 people according to McFann. The park will also be open to regular customers at that time.\n\nMcFann says that couples have been clamoring to get closer to the iconic castle and hold their weddings in the theme park. Previously the only other Magic Kingdom spot has been the train station, and that has only been available in the early morning hours before the park opened. Now, in the shadows of the castle's spires, brides and grooms will be able to indulge their wishes amid the park's elegant, romantic, and nostalgic ambiance. Disney World has been offering wedding services for many years. One of its most popular ceremony locations is its wedding pavilion, located across the lagoon from the Magic Kingdom. It offers a prime, if distant, view of Cinderella Castle. For their receptions, couples can choose among a variety of locations throughout the vast resort, although the East Plaza Garden will only be available for ceremonies.\n\nDisney's Fairy Tale Weddings package collections start at $2,500, and custom experiences begin at $12,000. Premiere locations such as the Magic Kingdom, with a completely customized ceremony and reception for 100 guests, start at $75,000.

Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos says that he and his wife MacKenzie are divorcing after 25 years of marriage.\n\nWe want to make people aware of a development in our lives, the couple said in a post on Bezos' Twitter account Wednesday. As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends.\n\nThe carefully worded announcement suggests a cordial divorce and one that is unlikely to disrupt or affect Amazon, currently the world's most valuable company, at $810 billion just ahead of Microsoft ($789 billion), according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nThe couple met at management investment firm D.E. Shaw in New York City and married in 1993, six months after MacKenzie asked him out to lunch, according to a Business Insider profile of their marriage.\n\nA year later, they moved to Seattle to found Amazon, where she became an accountant and one of the first employees for the then-Internet bookseller. Until five years ago, she dropped Bezos off at work in their Honda after they took their four kids to school.\n\nMore:How much could Mackenzie Bezos get in divorce with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos?\n\nSince then, Bezos became the world's richest man, supplanting Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on Forbes' annual list of the 400 richest Americans three months ago, with his net worth rising to $160 billion, up from $81.5 billion a year ago.\n\nMacKenzie Bezos became a novelist, winning an American Book Award for her 2005 debut novel The Testing of Luther Albright. Subsequently, she released the book Traps in 2013.\n\nIt's unclear whether the couple had a prenuptial agreement. But that is unlikely, says Stuart Slotnick, chairman of the matrimonial department of law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney in New York City.\n\nPeople get prenuptial agreements when they have assets to protect, Slotnick said. In this case, they had no real assets vis à vis Amazon because when they got married Amazon did not exist.\n\nThat doesn't mean the separating couple have not come to an arrangement, he says. In fact, the statement issued by them both devoid of emotion, Slotnick said, likely suggests they might already have an agreement … (and) be done essentially.\n\nWhatever the agreement, it's unlikely to disrupt Amazon's operations, as that would be counterproductive to an amicable separation, he said. There would be no reason that the company would be affected by this divorce, Slotnick said.\n\nCrisis management expert Juda Engelmayer said the split will be about money, and it's not going to be about control of the company.\n\nI've dealt with corporate divorces when there was vindictiveness and bitterness involved. This doesn't seem that way, said Engelmayer, president of HeraldPR, a New York public relations firm.\n\nAs part of the settlement, MacKenzie Bezos could get a lasting annuity based on the company's performance, he said. But in terms of actual control of the company, splitting up and having co-CEOs, I don't think that is where this is going.\n\nA prenuptial agreement would not have been out of the question for the couple, as they were common in New York more than two decades ago and the couple could have gotten one because they had significant earning potential, said Wendy Crew, a Birmingham, Alabama, attorney who specializes in family law issues.\n\nBut the language in their announcement suggests they may have had a postnuptial agreement, similar to a prenup but arranged after earnings and finances change or bad acts in a marriage occur, she said.\n\nThe wording, Crew said, certainly indicates that the great majority of the dissolution of the marriage had been worked out amicably before they made the statement. If the divorce has been filed, probably the terms had been worked out even before the filing of the divorce, which is not unusual in a high net worth case.\n\nSimilarly, any custody issues have been likely settled, too, as the two mention wonderful futures ahead as parents in the statement. They are successful in their lives, Crew said, so most likely they are going to be able to be successful co-parenting together.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.

Despite fighting aggressive brain cancer for at least the past six months, Sen. John McCain is still fighting hard and progressing every day, his son Jack said in an interview Tuesday with The Arizona Republic.\n\nI talk to him about once a day on the phone, and every time I talk to him he sounds better than the day before, Jack McCain said.\n\nHe is a very strong human being with the type of will that I have not seen paralleled anywhere else, and I have no doubts that he's going to be fine.\n\nLast July, John McCain shocked the nation when he revealed that, at 80 years old, he had been diagnosed with brain cancer.\n\nREAD MORE: McCain to miss State of the Union, January goal of Senate return\n\nThe cancer, glioblastoma, was discovered during cranial surgery to remove a blood clot above his left eye. It is a typically malignant and aggressive cancer, with a median survival rate of 14.6 months.\n\nThe diagnosis he has is not a good one. But of all of the things that have happened in this man's life, of all of the times that his life could have ended in the ways it could have ended, this is by far one of the least threats to him and that's kind of how he views it, Jack McCain said.\n\nHe's very sober about it. He understands the implication and the weight of it. But for not one minute has he let that take over his feelings towards how hard he has to fight.\n\nJack is a 31-year-old Navy lieutenant and helicopter pilot.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. – United Methodist leaders are proposing to split the church and spin off a new traditionalist Methodist denomination after decades of fighting over same-sex marriage and LGBTQ clergy.\n\nThe group – made up of 16 bishops and representatives from United Methodist advocacy groups with diverse views – announced Friday they had a proposed agreement on the future separation of the second-largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. The church has more than 13 million members worldwide and several of its central agencies are headquartered in Nashville.\n\nThe proposed plan, called the Protocol of Reconciliation & Grace Through Separation, comes after decades of fighting over sexuality, including whether to lift the denomination's ban on same-sex marriage and LGBTQ clergy. In February, a special meeting of the church's top governing body failed to find an amicable solution.\n\nIn the midst of these ongoing tensions, this unofficial group of 16 spent several months collaborating on the proposed agreement. Mediation expert and prominent attorney Kenneth Feinberg, who worked on victims' compensation funds for the Sept. 11 attacks and BP Deepwater Horizon disaster, participated in the talks.\n\nThe undersigned propose restructuring The United Methodist Church by separation as the best means to resolve our differences, allowing each part of the Church to remain true to its theological understanding while recognizing the dignity, equality, integrity, and respect of every person, the proposed agreement states.\n\n'Sometimes, divorce is necessary':Fight for LGBTQ inclusion may finally split United Methodists\n\nBut this path forward and future split is not a done deal, as Sierra Leone Bishop John Yambusa explained in the news release. Bishops from outside the U.S., including Yambusa, laid the groundwork for the formation of the group.\n\nAll of us are servants of the church and realize that we are not the primary decision-makers on these matters, Yambasu said, speaking on behalf of the group.\n\nInstead, we humbly offer to the delegates of the 2020 General Conference the work which we have accomplished in the hopes that it will help heal the harms and conflicts within the body of Christ and free us to be more effective witnesses to God's Kingdom.\n\n'The best likelihood of being adopted'\n\nLegislation implementing the proposed agreement is expected to be considered later this year at the church's upcoming legislative meeting. The United Methodist General Conference is slated to gather in May in Minneapolis.\n\nThe Protocol of Reconciliation & Grace Through Separation is not the only proposed plan for how the church should address this issue at General Conference, but it has the broadest support, said the Rev. Keith Boyette, who served on the 16-member mediation team and holds a theologically conservative view of sexuality.\n\nI think it has the best likelihood of being adopted, said Boyette, president of the Wesleyan Covenant Association, which is expected to help lead the conservative denomination that would spin off.\n\nEverybody had to compromise on something, Boyette said. That's how you get to an agreement with polarized sides.\n\nBoyette, who lives in Fredericksburg, Virginia, said Friday the announcement of the plan, which was touch-and-go for much of the mediation process, came with a sense of relief, peace and hope.\n\nThe Rev. Junius Dotson, who served on the mediation team, is also optimistic about the viability of the proposed plan. He is a representative of UMC Next, a group of centrist and progressive United Methodists who support lifting the church's prohibitions on LGBTQ people.\n\nRegrettably, we are at a point of separation, but the hope in it is that we are able to maybe go our separate ways, but yet respect one another and seek to multiply the mission and ministry that we're called to, said Dotson, who lives in Nashville and works for the denomination as the CEO of Discipleship Ministries. That's the hopeful part of our story even in the midst of the regret that our differences have brought us to this point.\n\nThis sexuality debate has divided the United Methodist Church for about a half-century.\n\nIn 1972, the General Conference changed denominational rules to say the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching. The church continued to wrestle with related matters at subsequent denominational meetings. Protests, church trials, talk of schism and calls for unity ensued.\n\nEntertainment:Netflix show that insinuates Jesus is gay sparks controversy\n\nOpinion:This Advent season, I know God accepts me as a gay Catholic. But do other Christians?\n\nThe disagreement over whether the church should allow same-sex marriage and LGBTQ clergy continues to cause tension within the denomination.\n\nAll 16 members of the group have pledged to work together to support the proposed agreement and develop legislation to implement it.\n\nWhat does the proposed agreement say?\n\nThe proposed agreement calls for suspending all administrative and judicial processes related to same-sex marriage and LGBTQ clergy until the separation is completed.\n\nIf the split is approved at General Conference, the proposal calls for a special follow-up meeting so the United Methodist Church could lift its restrictions on LGBTQ people and repeal a plan passed in February that reinforced those prohibitions. The special session could also be used to create regional conferences.\n\nThe proposed agreement includes financial solutions, too.\n\nUnder it, the new traditionalist denomination would receive $25 million over the next four years and relinquish further claims to United Methodist Church assets. Another $2 million would be earmarked for any other new Methodist denomination that spins off.\n\nThe plan also would allocate $39 million to keep supporting ministries going for those historically marginalized by racism.\n\nThe proposed agreement also details what conferences and congregations would need to do if they want to leave the United Methodist Church. Within a set amount of time, those who want to separate can vote to leave. It also details how those that leave can keep their assets and liabilities.\n\nNo vote would be needed for entities that want to stay.\n\nBut regardless of the decision made, all current clergy and lay employees would get to keep their pensions.\n\nFollow Holly Meyer on Twitter: @HollyAMeyer
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Lindsey and Lucy may soon rival figure skating pairs here as the darlings of the 2018 Winter Games.\n\nThat would be Lindsey Vonn, the American ski racing star, and her sidekick, Lucy, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The speed queen and her dog showed up Friday for Vonn's first news conference.\n\nVonn said she got the dog two years ago to help cope with loneliness she said has experienced since her divorce in 2011 after a four-year marriage to Thomas Vonn.\n\nIt's extremely lonely on the road and since I got divorced,'' Vonn said. I had a lot of free time on my hands at night. And being in a hotel room is oftentimes, yeah, it's just extremely difficult.\n\nSo I got Lucy to travel with me everywhere. I was questioning whether I was going to bring her here because it was a long trip. But she's always with me, so I figured I need her with me for the most important event.''\n\nMore:Lindsey Vonn brings dog to Olympics, addresses lonely life on road\n\nMore:Memory of her grandfather gives Lindsey Vonn added motivation in final Winter Olympics\n\nVonn will be looking to add to her Olympic medal haul, which includes a gold in the downhill and a bronze in the Super-G at the 2010 Vancouver Games. And training has included time with her four-legged pal.\n\nOn Jan. 31, Vonn shared on Instagram a video of Lucy sprinting after Vonn as Vonn skied down gently sloped hill. Wrote Vonn: look out she's a speed demon like her mom.''\n\nBut apparently Lucy loves something even more than running down a snow-covered mountain.\n\nShe's usually at the hotel room whenever I'm racing,'' Vonn said. She enjoys sleeping a majority of the day.''\n\n(Vonn has two other dogs, Leo and Bear, who can be found on the Instagram page Vonn started for her dogs.)\n\nAs photographers got into position to take a photo of Lucy during the press conference, Vonn said, Lucy's definitely a bigger star than me.''\n\nYet it was after the news conference ended and when Vonn scooped up Lucy into her arms that the photographers snapped photos that it became clear — Lindsey and Lucy could be the power couple of the 2018 Games.
Something is going on with Mike Perry, and whatever that may be, it isn't good.\n\nThe latest example of this came Sunday night when the UFC welterweight posted a graphic video of himself lying down in an empty hallway, bleeding profusely from his leg. The video starts up close on Perry's face as he sighs. Then he flips the camera around to show a shattered glass door next to him and a puddle of blood near his feet, the implication being that he may have kicked it himself.\n\nPerry also can be heard whispering, F*ck am I supposed to do about this? F*ck.\n\nYou can watch the footage below (via Twitter):\n\nFull video. This is really disturbing pic.twitter.com/JexmgI4S1t — Amy Kaplan (@PhotoAmy33) January 4, 2021\n\nShortly after sharing the video, Perry issued a disturbing tweet potentially incriminating himself.\n\nNo matter what I do it's never enough. So I act out. Happy to spill my own blood. — Platinum Mike Perry (@PlatinumPerry) January 4, 2021\n\nNo matter what I do it's never enough. So I act out.

Last July, Perry was seen on video knocking out an older man with one punch outside of a restaurant in Texas. Just a few months later, Perry's ex-wife, Danielle Nickerson, detailed serious allegation of a domestic violence during their marriage, which Perry denied.\n\nPerry is expecting his first child soon with his girlfriend and corner person, Latory Gonzalez.

Patty Rhule\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nAnita Shreve returns to the mysteries of marriage for her new novel, The Stars Are Fire (Knopf, 241 pp., ***½ out of four stars).\n\nLike her sensational best-selling 1998 novel The Pilot's Wife, about a widow who discovers her pilot husband had a second family, Stars explores what happens in the secret spaces between married people.\n\nIn 1947 Maine, Grace Holland is the mother of two toddlers in a dutiful but loveless — and borderline abusive — marriage to taciturn Gene, a highway surveyor. A months-long drought leaves their town a tinderbox, and suddenly, much of the coastline is burning. Gene goes off to fight the blaze, leaving Grace and the children to flee their burning home. Grace saves her friend Rosie and the children by burrowing in the surf and sand as flames lick the beaches.\n\nThe fires burn out, but Gene fails to return home. Homeless and penniless, Grace moves her family into her dead mother-in-law's home and gets a job at a doctor's office. A handsome young pianist rents one of her rooms, filling the house with music and Grace with longing.\n\nShreve is masterful at creating compelling characters whose inner conversations about love and intimacy are both heartfelt and heartrending. As 24-year-old Grace remakes her life as a single mother in small-town Maine, the reader roots for her as she sells jewelry to buy a car, and befriends her kind young doctor boss.\n\nBut just like you know the boogeyman isn't dead the first time he gets whacked in a horror film, Gene's body hasn't been found. As Grace strides toward independence, Gene's inevitable return looms like a nagging headache.\n\nGene's secret doomed their marriage; Grace's secret could end it. If you know Maine, this novel will have special resonance; its setting is based on real-life fires that raged through numerous towns and hundreds of thousands of acres in 1947.\n\nEven if you don't know Maine, Shreve's quiet novel about marriage, duty and passion lingers long after the last page is turned, like the smoke from a wildfire.
Rev. Paul Scalia\n\nDiocese of Arlington\n\nThe following is a transcript of the homily by Rev. Paul Scalia, the son of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, at the funeral Mass for his father at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nYour Eminence Cardinal Wuerl, Your Excellencies, Archbishop Viganò, Bishop Loverde, Bishop Higgins, my brother priests, deacons, distinguished guests, dear friends and faithful gathered:\n\nOn behalf of our mother and the entire Scalia family, I want to thank you for your presence here, for your many words of consolation, and even more for the many prayers and Masses you have offered at the death of our father, Antonin Scalia.\n\nIn particular I thank Cardinal Wuerl, first for reaching out so quickly and so graciously to console our mother. It was a consolation to her and therefore to us as well. Thank you also for allowing us to have this parish funeral Mass here in this basilica dedicated to Our Lady. What a great privilege and consolation that we were able to bring our father through the holy doors and for him gain the indulgence promised to those who enter in faith.\n\nI thank Bishop Loverde, the bishop of our diocese of Arlington, a bishop our father liked and respected a great deal. Thank you, Bishop Loverde, for your prompt visit to our mother, for your words of consolation, for your prayers.\n\nThe family will depart for the private burial immediately after Mass and will not have time to visit, so I want to express our thanks at this time so that you all know our profound appreciation and thanks. You will notice in the program mention of a memorial that will be held on March 1st. We hope to see many of you there. We hope the Lord will repay your great goodness to us.\n\nWe are gathered here because of one man. A man known personally to many of us, known only by reputation to even more. A man loved by many, scorned by others. A man known for great controversy, and for great compassion. That man, of course, is Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nIt is He whom we proclaim. Jesus Christ, son of the father, born of the Virgin Mary, crucified, buried, risen, seated at the right hand of the Father. It is because of him. because of his life, death and resurrection that we do not mourn as those who have no hope, but in confidence we commend Antonin Scalia to the mercy of God.\n\nScripture says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever. And that sets a good course for our thoughts and our prayers here today. In effect, we look in three directions. To yesterday, in thanksgiving. To today, in petition. And into eternity, with hope.\n\nWe look to Jesus Christ yesterday, that is, to the past, in thanksgiving for the blessings God bestowed upon Dad. In the past week, many have recounted what Dad did for them. But here today, we recount what God did for Dad, how he blessed him.\n\nWe give thanks first of all for the atoning death and life-giving resurrection of Jesus Christ. Our Lord died and rose not only for all of us, but also for each of us. And at this time we look to that yesterday of his death and resurrection, and we give thanks that he died and rose for Dad.\n\nFurther, we give thanks that Jesus brought him to new life in baptism, nourished him with the Eucharist, and healed him in the confessional.\n\nWe give thanks that Jesus bestowed upon him 55 years of marriage to the woman he loved, a woman who could match him at every step, and even hold him accountable.\n\nGod blessed Dad with a deep Catholic faith: The conviction that Christ's presence and power continue in the world today through His body, the Church. He loved the clarity and coherence of the church's teachings. He treasured the church's ceremonies, especially the beauty of her ancient worship. He trusted the power of her sacraments as the means of salvation as Christ working within him for his salvation.\n\nAlthough one time, one Saturday afternoon, he did scold me for having heard confessions that afternoon, that same day. And I hope that it's some source of consolation, if there are any lawyers present, that the Roman collar was not a shield against his criticism.\n\nThe issue that evening was not that I had been hearing confessions, but that he had found himself in my confessional line, and he quickly departed it. As he put it later, Like heck if I'm confessing to you!\n\nThe feeling was mutual.\n\nGod blessed Dad, as is well known, with a love for his country. He knew well what a close-run thing the founding of our nation was. And he saw in that founding, as did the founders themselves, a blessing, a blessing quickly lost when faith is banned form the public square, or when we refuse to bring it there. So he understood that there is no conflict between loving God and loving one's country, between one's faith and one's public service. Dad understood that the deeper he went in his Catholic faith, the better a citizen and public servant he became. God blessed him with the desire to be the country's good servant because he was God's first.\n\nWe Scalias, however, give thanks for a particular blessing God bestowed. God blessed Dad with a love for his family. We have been thrilled to read and hear the many words of praise and admiration for him, for his intellect, his writings, his speeches, his influence and so on.\n\nBut more important to us — and to him — is that he was Dad. He was the father that God gave us for the great adventure of family life. Sure he forgot our names at times, or mixed them up, but there are nine of us.\n\nHe loved us, and sought to show that love. And sought to share the blessing of the faith he treasured. And he gave us one another, to have each other for support. That's the greatest wealth parents can bestow, and right now we are particularly grateful for it.\n\nSo we look to the past, to Jesus Christ yesterday. We call to mind all of these blessings, and we give our Lord the honor and glory for them, for they are His work. We look to Jesus today, in petition, to the present moment, here and now, as we mourn the one we love and admire, the one whose absence pains us. Today we pray for him. We pray for the repose of his soul. We thank God for his goodness to Dad as is right and just. But we also know that although dad believed, he did so imperfectly, like the rest of us. He tried to love God and neighbor, but like the rest of us did so imperfectly.\n\nHe was a practicing Catholic, practicing in the sense that he hadn't perfected it yet. Or rather, Christ was not yet perfected in him. And only those in whom Christ is brought to perfection can enter heaven. We are here, then, to lend our prayers to that perfecting, to that final work of God's grace, in freeing Dad from every encumbrance of sin.\n\nBut don't take my word for it. Dad himself, not surprisingly, had something to say on the matter. Writing years ago to a Presbyterian minister whose funeral service he admired, he summarized quite nicely the pitfalls of funerals and why he didn't like eulogies.\n\nHe wrote: Even when the deceased was an admirable person, indeed especially when the deceased was an admirable person, praise for his virtues can cause us to forget that we are praying for and giving thanks for God's inexplicable mercy to a sinner.\n\nNow he would not have exempted himself from that. We are here then, as he would want, to pray for God's inexplicable mercy to a sinner. To this sinner, Antonin Scalia. Let us not show him a false love and allow our admiration to deprive him of our prayers. We continue to show affection for him and do good for him by praying for him: That all stain of sin be washed away, that all wounds be healed, that he be purified of all that is not Christ. That he rest in peace.\n\nFinally we look to Jesus forever, into eternity. Or better, we consider our own place in eternity and whether it will be with the Lord. Even as we pray for Dad to enter swiftly into eternal glory, we should be mindful of ourselves. Every funeral reminds us of just how thin the veil is between this world and the next, between time and eternity, between the opportunity for conversion and the moment of judgment.\n\nSo we cannot depart here unchanged. It makes no sense to celebrate God's goodness and mercy to Dad if we are not attentive and responsive to those realities in our own lives. We must allow this encounter with eternity to change us, to turn us from sin and towards the Lord.\n\nThe English Dominican, Father Bede Jarrett, put it beautifully when he prayed, O strong son of God, while you prepare a place for us, prepare us also for that happy place, that we may be with you and with those we love for all eternity.\n\nJesus Christ is the same, yesterday, today and forever,.\n\nMy dear friends, this is also the structure of the Mass, the greatest prayer we can offer for Dad, because it's not our prayer, but the Lord's. The Mass looks to Jesus yesterday. It reaches into the past — reaches to the Last Supper, to the crucifixion, to the resurrection — and it makes those mysteries and their power present here on this altar.\n\nJesus himself becomes present here today under the form of bread and wine so that we can unite all our prayers of thanksgiving, sorrow and petition with Christ himself as an offering to the father. And all of this with a view to eternity, stretching towards heaven, where we hope one day to enjoy that perfect union with God himself and to see Dad again and, with him, rejoice in the communion of saints.\n\nRev.

Continuing to social distance and shelter in place to slow the spread of coronavirus leaves us with a lot of time on our (sanitized) hands. Thankfully, TV shows are here to offer a distraction (and a reason to stay inside) amid chilly temps.\n\nGiven the lagging effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on production, offerings are slimmer than usual. But there are still new releases to be excited about. This winter beloved singing competitions The Voice and The Masked Singer return. Networks and streaming platforms continue to reach to the past for inspiration, and will premiere a Punky Brewster reboot and The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers.\n\nOur calendar of major highlights ensures you won't miss the return of your favorite series or the start of a new show you'll fall in love with.

Jayme Deerwester\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe help wanted sign is about to go back up at Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital.\n\nSara Ramirez, who played orthopedic surgeon Dr. Callie Torres for the last decade, signed off from ABC's long-running medical soap Grey's Anatomy Thursday and later confirmed her departure in a tweet.\n\nI'm deeply grateful to have spent the last 10 years with my family atGrey's Anatomy and ABC, but for now, I'm taking some welcome time off, her statement read. Shonda's been so incredible to work for, and we will definitely continue our conversations! I send my love to Ellen, the rest of the cast and crew, and I look forward to always being a part of the Shondaland family!\n\nRamirez joined the show in 2006, fresh off a Tony-winning run in Broadway's Spamalot and dove headlong into an hour-long network TV drama, widely regarded as one of the more arduous acting gigs.\n\nHer character arrived as a resident and a love interest for the long-departed George O'Malley (T.R. Knight). Torres then embarked on a brief relationship with another now-departed female surgeon (which ended because the actress Brooke Smith was suddenly fired), which caused her to struggle with her bisexuality and caused a rift with her parents. Eventually, she met and married pediatric surgeon Dr. Arizona Robbins, and gave birth to their daughter, Sofia (with an assist from the dearly departed Dr. Mark Sloan). Their marriage ended after bouts of infidelity and failed attempts at reconciliation and couples' therapy.\n\nRamirez's character got a quieter sendoff than, say, that of Sandra Oh's Cristina Yang. But at the same time, it was a happier-than-expected parting for the Big Apple-bound Torres. Arizona, who had just won their custody battle over Sofia a couple of episodes ago, dropped their daughter off so she could spend the next week with Callie and her new girlfriend Penny in New York. She also proposed a much more generous custody arrangement.\n\nSeries star Ellen Pompeo toasted her colleague on Twitter, writing, Sara Ramirez's portrayal of Callie Torres brought much comfort and understanding to people who needed it. Her contribution was immeasurable.\n\nBut we don't expect this to be the last we see of Ramirez on TV — at least not if it's up to Shonda Rhines.\n\nDr. Callie Torres came into our lives dancing in her underwear almost a decade ago, she wrote on Twitter, and I could not be happier or more proud of her journey. Sara Ramirez's performance inspired me and well as millions of fans each week. We wish her the best on her well-deserved time off. I will miss Callie tremendously, but am excited for what the future holds for Sara. She will always have a home at Shondaland.
Armie Hammer is speaking out amid allegations against him and a dropped film role – and now his alleged ex-girlfriend is weighing in on the uproar.\n\nThe Call Me By Your Name and Rebecca star, 34, has faced scrutiny on social media recently after Instagram messages he allegedly sent went viral detailing sexual fantasies.\n\nHammer confirmed his exit Wednesday from the film Shotgun Wedding in the wake of the allegations. He was slated to star in the film with Jennifer Lopez.\n\nI'm not responding to these (expletive) claims but in light of the vicious and spurious online attacks against me, I cannot in good conscience now leave my children for four months to shoot a film in the Dominican Republic, Hammer said in a statement to USA TODAY. Lionsgate is supporting me in this and I'm grateful to them for that.\n\nHammer's alleged ex-girlfriend Courtney Vucekovich detailed her experience dating the actor to Page Six in an interview published Thursday. The publication reports the pair dated from June to August of last year.\n\nHe enters your life in such a big way, Vucekovich, the founder of the app Flashd, told the outlet. He's such a captivating person. He has such a presence and he's aware of that and he uses it in such a way that most women would think, 'Oh my gosh this is amazing,' but especially young women, that's kind of the scary part — how good he is at active manipulation and making you feel like he's never felt this way about anybody.\n\nShe claims he manipulated and abused her: He kind of captivates you and while being charming he's grooming you for these things that are darker and heavier and consuming. When I say consuming, I mean mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, just everything.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Hammer and Vucekovich for further comment.\n\nAfter the pair broke up, Vucekovich says she entered a 30-day partial hospitalization program geared toward PTSD and trauma. As a strong mental health advocate I knew that this relationship was something I needed to process with help from people who specialize in trauma and PTSD. That is my experience, she told the outlet.\n\nThe comments come months after Hammer and wife Elizabeth Chambers announced in July they were ending their marriage.\n\nIt has been an incredible journey, but together, we've decided to turn the page and move on from our marriage, they said in a joint statement in July. As we enter into this next chapter, our children and relationship as co-parents and dear friends will remain our priority.\n\nThey have two children: 6-year-old daughter Harper Grace and 3-year-old son Ford Douglas Armand.\n\nMore on 'Rebecca':5 ways Netflix's new 'Rebecca' differs from Alfred Hitchcock's Oscar-winning 1940 classic\n\nMore on the marriage split:Armie Hammer, Elizabeth Chambers announce split after 10 years of marriage
Natalie Portman's feminist Oscars outfit – powerful or offensive?\n\nAccording to Rose McGowan, the actress' Dior cape worn Sunday, which was embroidered with the names of female directors who were snubbed for best-director Oscar nominations, was deeply offensive.\n\nI wanted to recognize women who were not recognized in a subtle way, Portman told USA TODAY on the red carpet ahead of the Academy Awards show, where she presented best adapted screenplay to winner Taika Waititi.\n\nMcGowan, who was one of the earliest of dozens of women to accuse Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, making her a major figure in the #MeToo movement, took to Facebook Tuesday to air her grievances about Portman's look, calling the subtle shade the kind of protest that gets rave reviews from the mainstream media for its bravery.\n\nThe Backstory:We've had more than 50 million views of our Oscars content. Here's why.\n\nBrave? McGowan added. No, not by a long shot. More like an actress acting the part of someone who cares. As so many of them do.\n\nMcGowan said her disgust for Portman's subtle activism was because she wanted the actress to walk the walk and actually work with more female directors, particularly through Portman's production company, Handsomecharlie Films.\n\nNatalie, you have worked with two female directors in your very long career - one of them was you, she wrote, referencing Portman's 2015 film A Tale of Love and Darkness. You have a production company that has hired exactly one female director- you.\n\nOscars:Natalie Portman wears cape embroidered with names of snubbed female directors\n\nPortman has worked with three female directors on major releases: Mira Nair in 2008's anthology New York, I Love You, Rebecca Zlotowski for 2016's Planetarium and Vanita Shastry for 2015's vignette-driven The Heyday of the Insensitive Bastards.\n\nToo soon? Our ridiculously early predictions for 2021's Oscar contenders\n\nThere is no law that says you need to hire women, work with women, or support women. By all means, you do you. But I am saying stop pretending you're some kind of champion for anything other than yourself, McGowan added. As for me, I'll be over here raising my voice and fighting for change without any compensation. That is activism. Until you and your fellow actresses get real, do us all a favor and hang up your embroidered activist cloak, it doesn't hang right.\n\nPortman responded to McGowan's criticism directly on Wednesday.\n\nI agree with Ms. McGowan that it is inaccurate to call me 'brave' for wearing a garment with women's names on it, she wrote in a statement sent to USA TODAY. Brave is a term I more strongly associate with actions like those of the women who have been testifying against Harvey Weinstein the last few weeks, under incredible pressure.\n\nPortman also copped to not working with as many female directors as she would have liked.\n\nIt is true I've only made a few films with women. In my long career, I've only gotten the chance to work with female directors a few times - I've made shorts, commercials, music videos and features with Marya Cohen, Mira Nair, Rebecca Zlotowski, Anna Rose Holmer, Sofia Coppola, Shirin Neshat and myself. Unfortunately, the unmade films I have tried to make are a ghost history.\n\nDirectors she's hoped to work with have have faced insurmountable challenges through the years, Portman said, citing recent studies that have tracked difficulties women- and minority-directed films face obtaining financing, getting into festivals, finding theatrical distribution and getting accolades.\n\nRose McGowan defends tweet:'I don't support Iran over America. I want America to be better'\n\nI have had the experience a few times of helping get female directors hired on projects which they were then forced out of because of the conditions they faced at work, Portman said. So I want to say, I have tried, and I will keep trying. While I have not yet been successful, I am hopeful that we are stepping into a new day.\n\nThis year's Oscars was not the first time Portman has championed equal representation.\n\nAt the 2018 Golden Globes, Portman made a pointed comment about the lack of diversity among the director nominees.\n\nWe are honored … to be here to present the award for best director, Ron Howard said, to which Portman deadpanned, And here are the all-male nominees.\n\nOn Tuesday, Portman posted a photo of herself on Instagram presenting with Timothee Chalamet at the Oscars, writing, I was so honored to present Sunday with @tchalamet. He's so incredibly talented, so fun and so smart—and a third of the films he's been in have been directed by women!
Few teams enter 2021 with a bigger question at quarterback than the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nPerhaps no club has a more attractive opening under center than the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nAnd, arguably, no front office has a more pivotal decision to make regarding the immediate future of the organization than the brass of ... the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nIt should be an intriguing offseason for a franchise that arguably has the richest lineage of passers in the history of the NFL – Johnny Unitas, Peyton Manning, Andrew Luck ... not to mention some vocal Bert Jones truthers. Will a new name join those ranks? Will a familiar one remain?\n\nWe don't know who will be taking the first snap for Indy nine months from now, but here are nine names to consider:\n\nPhilip Rivers\n\nHe was in his feelings Saturday, dealing with the aftermath of a crushing playoff loss to the Bills in which Rivers played quite well but missed just enough crucial throws to cost the Colts in a 27-24 heartbreaker. The 39-year-old with the wonky throwing motion had an uneven yet impressive inaugural season in Indianapolis, though it could well be his last with his one-year, $25 million contract set to expire. Rivers needs surgery on his foot, already has his next job lined up – head football coach at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama – and was often replaced by backup Jacoby Brissett (also headed for free agency) when a QB sneak or Hail Mary was required.\n\nStill, an emotional Rivers gave little indication Saturday afternoon that he's a man on the verge of walking. He admitted his faith will guide his next move, but if the Colts are interested in re-upping, it was obvious he very much enjoyed playing for them after spending 16 years with the Chargers.\n\nIt's a really neat team. I think under these circumstances, Rivers said, I know personally, for me, to develop the type of bond and camaraderie that we had, it was pretty special for sure.\n\nAnd, given his relationship with coach Frank Reich and the allegiance earned from the locker room, it might still be.\n\nMIKE JONES:NFL playoffs divisional round shaping up as rivalry week\n\nRANKING 7 OPEN NFL JOBS:From worst to first\n\n32 THINGS WE LEARNED:From 'Super Wild Card Weekend' of 2020 NFL season\n\nAs I sit here right now, yes, I want Philip Rivers to be my starting quarterback next year, Reich said Sunday.\n\nBut the caveat wasn't far behind, the coach admitting everything could change.\n\nI think we both know how we feel about each other and about the year that he had, but we also know this business is what it is, Reich added. We know the natural tendency is to say, this is great stuff, let's keep this rolling, and that's how we feel, and I hope that's how he feels. But you have to digest, you have to pull away to get perspective, you have to think about the whole thing.\n\nWe'll have to see, but it's too early to tell right now.\n\nCarson Wentz\n\nThe chic marriage is to reunite the embattled Philadelphia Eagles quarterback with Reich, Wentz's offensive coordinator when he played at an MVP level in 2017 before suffering a season-ending knee injury. The men are also bonded by Christian faith. NFL Network has reported Wentz would like to come to Indianapolis if his time in Philly is, in fact, at an end – though Monday's firing of Doug Pederson was a strong hint that the Eagles are headed for a fresh start that includes Wentz.\n\nAnd here's the real rub: To divorce Wentz this winter, the Eagles would have to absorb a huge salary cap hit as the four-year, $128 million extension he signed in 2019 takes effect at the start of the 2021 season. Cutting him is cost prohibitive (roughly a $60 million cap charge), which makes trading him – about a $34 million hit if done shortly after the new league year begins in March – palatable only by comparison. This also presumes Colts GM Chris Ballard, always thrifty with his draft picks and cap resources, is willing to engage.\n\nBut even if he and Reich decide they can resurrect the 2017 Wentz, the Eagles would have to be willing to sell at a discount given how depressed his value is while conceding the relationship with the face of their franchise is irreparable.\n\nMatthew Stafford\n\nThe Detroit Lions' longtime bomber has two years remaining on his deal and would be owed about $43 million – reasonable by the current quarterback salary scale. Stafford turns 33 next month, but his arm talent remains among the league's elite. Current and former teammates tend to swear by his personality and toughness. On the downside, he has taken a lot of abuse over the years and, from a team perspective, he's never led Detroit to a playoff win in 12 seasons – and now the Lions are in the midst of another regime change, which may or may not spell the end of the former No. 1 pick's tenure.\n\nStafford isn't the hand-in-glove fit that Wentz might be, but he is a more realistic trade option financially – the Lions would take a $19 million hit for moving him. And Stafford would sustain a veteran presence for a Colts roster that's built to win now.\n\nMatt Ryan\n\nThe Atlanta quarterback's name has been floated as a possibility – maybe because the 2016 MVP's experience and surgical style would probably fit well in the Circle City. But realistically, Ryan's contract – it runs through 2023 – is even more unwieldy than Wentz's and would cost the Falcons, who are also searching for their next coach and GM, more than $40 million to unload in a swap. And given Ryan is nearly three years older than Stafford? Seems like the worst of all worlds given the Colts' other available avenues.\n\nAndy Dalton\n\nThe 33-year-old may not have quite the résumé or physical gifts of more acclaimed passers in the league. But the three-time Pro Bowler is steady, led the Cincinnati Bengals to five straight playoff berths – talk about a résumé bullet – and, best of all, is a free agent after helping keep the Dallas Cowboys afloat in 2020 in the wake of Dak Prescott's broken leg. And Ballard has to like the idea of giving up nothing more than a mid-tier contract while searching for a longer-term solution to the position on a parallel track.\n\nMac Jones\n\nBallard could always turn to the draft to fill the position. Given the Colts will pick 21st in the first round this year, Jones seems like the most realistic target – though a trade up wouldn't be out of the question if a prospect like BYU's Zach Wilson, Ohio State's Justin Fields or North Dakota State's Trey Lance fell within range.\n\nStill, Jones, who will be 23 in September, seems logical given he comes from an Alabama program that resembles an NFL team in some ways and is used to being a distributor rather than the center of attention. A guy who completed 77% of his passes in 2020 could theoretically step right into an offense built to run the rock while supplementing a staunch defense with a ball-control approach.\n\n(And, yes, his dismantling of Ohio State's defense in Monday's national championship game shows he's not just a game manager.)\n\nDAN WOLKEN:Saban and Alabama appear untouchable after securing sixth national title\n\nTEAR IT DOWN?:How to break up Nick Saban's monopoly at Alabama to improve college football\n\nSam Darnold\n\nThe New York Jets drafted him third overall in 2018, using a pick acquired from Ballard – who thought then that Andrew Luck would be Indianapolis' starter for the long term. But now the Jets could opt to reset the position with the No. 2 pick in 2021, meaning Darnold would be available with at least two years of contractual control. He was widely viewed as the best QB prospect on the board when he came out of USC but has been plagued by the turmoil and talent gap that so often plagues the Jets ... and his own tendency to press. He could be a relatively low-cost, high-ceiling reclamation project in a place where he could initially reboot as a role player.\n\nMitchell Trubisky\n\nBarring a franchise tag from the Bears, he's also headed for free agency. Though he was a Pro Bowler in 2018, the No. 2 pick of the 2017 draft has largely been a disappointment in Chicago. Signing him could represent a sweet spot between guys like Dalton and Darnold when it comes to finding the right mix of experience and upside. Adding Trubisky would certainly suggest Ballard had a Plan B in the works, too. But this could be the kind of environment, similar to those 2018 Bears, where Trubisky could excel as part of the puzzle without being saddled by outlandish expectations.\n\nJacob Eason\n\nThe only reason last year's fourth-round pick rates a mention is because he's currently the only quarterback on Indy's roster who's under contract. Eason, who was considered a boom-or-bust prospect after a checkered college career split between Georgia and Washington, did not play as a rookie and is probably the classic example of a youngster especially hindered by the lack of a 2020 preseason due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It would be surprising if he challenges for the backup job in 2021. But if he makes a meteoric rise up the depth chart this offseason, he wouldn't be the first quarterback to come trotting into the spotlight from anonymity.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

On This Day: 5 January 2004\n\nBritney Spears' marriage to childhood friend Jason Alexander was annulled, 55 hours after the ceremony. (Jan.5)
Alia E. Dastagir\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a feminist icon, so it's no surprise she said this week she is a professional success because she is a mother, not in spite of it.\n\nThe liberal justice is the second woman to sit on the Supreme Court, with a long history of advocating for gender equality and fighting institutionalized misogyny. Soft-spoken and penning blistering dissents, the 83-year-old has exploded as a pop culture phenomenon late in life. Her cult following affectionately refers to her as the Notorious RBG, a (controversial) homage to celebrated rapper Notorious B.I.G. The juxtaposition of the diminutive justice with the rapper's formidable figure is a celebration of her toughness.\n\nGinsburg spoke candidly this week — in an interview with The Atlantic and during a talk at Stanford University — on family, motherhood and the meaning of life (light stuff). Some of the highlights:\n\nThe big picture\n\nHaving Jane gave me a better sense of what life is, Ginsburg told The Atlantic of her firstborn. She also has a son, James.\n\nProps to daughter Jane\n\nWhen I started law school my daughter Jane was 14 months, and I attribute my success in law school largely to Jane. I went to class about 8:30 a.m., and I came home at 4:00 p.m., that was children's hour. It was a total break in my day, and children's hour continued until Jane went to sleep. Then I was happy to go back to the books, so I felt each part of my life gave me respite from the other.\n\nThanks to husband Marty\n\nIn different times in our life, one deferred to the other, Ginsburg told The Atlantic of her husband Marty, who died in 2010. Ginsburg said she leaned hard on Marty during the women's movement, especially when she co-founded the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project in 1972. Marty realized how important that work was. saying that in those years Marty took over the kitchen entirely, and I was phased out of it, to the everlasting appreciation of my food-loving children.\n\nYes, you can get great advice from your mother-in-law\n\nDuring Ginsburg's speech at Stanford on Monday, the dean for religious life, Jane Shaw, asked the justice if she had any advice for students. Ginsburg said, It comes from my savvy mother-in-law, advice she gave me on my wedding day. 'In every good marriage,' she counseled, 'it helps sometimes to be a little deaf.' I have followed that advice assiduously, and not only at home through 56 years of a marital partnership nonpareil. I have employed it as well in every workplace, including the Supreme Court. When a thoughtless or unkind word is spoken, best tune out. Reacting in anger or annoyance will not advance one's ability to persuade.\n\nThe meaning of life\n\nIf you want to be a true professional, you will do something outside yourself, she said at Stanford. Something to repair tears in your community. Something to make life a little better for people less fortunate than you. That's what I think a meaningful life is — living not for oneself, but for one's community.\n\nWhat she said on other important topics — and kale\n\nGinsburg did not discuss Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, President Trump's pick to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. She said she was surprised Hillary Clinton didn't win the election, lamented partisanship in Congress and would like to see changes to the Electoral College.\n\nDuring the talk at Stanford, a student asked Ginsburg about her age: A lot of people have been expressing encouragement that you eat more kale — so to speak — so that you can continue doing the public service work that you are doing for as long as possible. I was wondering, he said, who do you want to eat more kale in Washington?\n\nGinsburg's response: Justice Kennedy.

NEW YORK – Fans won't miss the real-life similarities between Ben Affleck and Jack Cunningham, the character he plays in his new movie The Way Back (in theaters March 6).\n\nCunningham, a former high school basketball star, returns to his alma mater as the team's head coach. He does so while battling an alcohol addiction that ruined his marriage.\n\nThe parallels weren't lost on director Gavin O'Connor, who notes that Affleck's steeper learning curve was with the basketball rather than the bottle.\n\nThat was the harder part because Ben understood the alcoholism, O'Connor says. He'd never coached before. He'd never played basketball.\n\n'I couldn't crack it': Ben Affleck explains why he's done with Batman\n\nBen Affleck: 'I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction'\n\nAffleck has been open about his battle with alcohol abuse. Battling any addiction is a lifelong and difficult struggle, he wrote on Instagram in 2018 after announcing he'd completed a stint in rehab. Because of that, one is never really in or out of treatment.\n\nThe actor laughs when told O'Connor's comment about the basketball aspect of the film being more difficult for him than the addiction.\n\nThe greatest fiction of this movie is that at any time I was a great basketball star in high school, Affleck jokes to USA TODAY. I am not a great athlete; never been my thing. I mean, I can hit a little bit; I can play a little baseball, but I've always been interested in acting and that's kind of what I've dedicated my time to.\n\nThe former Batman acknowledges that prior to shooting, he didn't have a good enough understanding of the game.\n\nWe spent a lot of time teaching Affleck basketball, O'Connor says. I used to bring Ben down to the practices and in the beginning, he was very reserved. …So getting him up to speed with (basketball), that to me was more challenging than (the alcoholism).\n\nLike any good coach, Affleck deflected any success he had in his role to his castmates – the players. But for the actors, including Brandon Wilson and Will Ropp, who play two of the team's stars, that meant attending a basketball camp at O'Connor's behest.\n\n(The players) made me look so good, Affleck says. I could just kind of wave my arms and run up and down the sideline and they'd do all the work.
David Holahan\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nIn The First Love Story: Adam, Eve, and Us (Penguin Press, 320 pp., ***½ out of four stars), best-selling author Bruce Feiler makes a convincing case that mankind still has much to learn from the first human beings.\n\nAfter all, they invented love and marriage, and their relationship ran the gamut, from early passion to the tough slog through disappointment and crushing loss.\n\nTheir story, which predates the myths of Greece and Rome, is alive and well. No one ponders Jupiter and Juno anymore, but the first couple of the Bible endures. In every century they reappear in literature, art, song, and now on flat screens.\n\nAnd the saga of Adam and Eve gives birth to new lessons as each generation reexamines their story. As with many things written down long ago, like the United States Constitution, the Bible is open to interpretation.\n\nFor example, the Apostle Paul justified male domination in matters of religion by spinning Scripture thus: I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man. She must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve.\n\nGood luck with that glib analysis today. For starters, many scholars question whether that is an accurate translation of Genesis, which contains two distinct creation stories. Then, of course, a cursory reading of the first book of the Bible reveals that the birds and animals were created before Adam: Pope Hippopotamus anyone?\n\nAdam and Eve were exiled from paradise, for heaven's sake, and then raised two contentious children, Cain and Abel. At the dawn of their relationship, Adam gave up Eve in a heartbeat, blaming her for making him eat the forbidden fruit (yes, the woman took the fall). But they stayed together nonetheless — and, in the epitome of optimism, had a third child together, Seth.\n\nOne of the many morals of their story is that it is not good for people to be alone, this according to the God of Israel as well as modern social science.\n\nFeiler (The Secrets of Happy Families) takes the reader on an engaging meander in search of the first family's transcendent meaning. His itinerary encompasses the Middle East and the Galapagos, Biblical scholars and anthropologists, and the likes of Michelangelo, Mark Twain and Mae West.\n\nIt's a thought-provoking odyssey, and by its end it is hard not to nod in agreement with the author's conclusions, such as There is no love without time or Instead of censuring them (Adam and Eve), we should be celebrating them.\n\nConversant with Scripture, Feiler can make a single word dance before the reader, who may assume, for example, that the gerund knowing is merely a euphemism for sex.\n\nWell, listen up: The root the Bible uses for 'knowing,' yada, is also the root the Bible uses for 'reason.' This overlap is not accidental. It implies marital love contains a deep knowledge of your partner that is neither rose-tinted nor rainbow-hued but battle-tested and well-earned.\n\nLove isn't easy, but without it life is an even harder grind.
John Hogan\n\nWZZM-TV, Grand Rapids-Kalamazoo-Battle Creek, Mich.\n\nKALAMAZOO, Mich. — A federal judge in Ann Arbor has dismissed a lawsuit filed under the name of accused mass shooter Jason Dalton, determining that the hand-written complaint is a hoax.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in mid-March against the online transportation company, cited Dalton's failed marriage among a litany of grievances in a two-page complaint seeking $10 million in damages from San Francisco-based Uber Technologies.\n\nHowever, court officials immediately saw red flags in the filing. Mailed to U.S. District Court in Detroit, the lawsuit lists a return address in Kalamazoo, but bears a March 11 postmark from Philadelphia.\n\nAt the time the complaint was filed, the court was concerned that it might be a hoax because the mailing was postmarked from Philadelphia, federal Judge John Corbett O'Meara wrote in his order for dismissal. The court has since received information from the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department verifying that Mr. Dalton did not file the complaint and that it is, in fact, a hoax. Accordingly, the Court dismisses without prejudice the complaint. This case is closed.\n\nKalamazoo shooting suspect found competent to stand trial\n\nO'Meara signed the dismissal order Friday.\n\nDalton told Kalamazoo County deputies he did not mail nor authorize the lawsuit, authorities said.\n\nMedia outlets across the nation reported on the lawsuit, which requested a jury trial: My wife is divorcing me because of Uber, the lawsuit said. My life is ruined because of Uber.\n\nSheriff: Kalamazoo suspect's Uber lawsuit is hoax\n\nDalton's wife, Carole Dalton, filed for divorce six days after the Feb. 20 shootings that left six dead and two critically wounded in the Kalamazoo area.\n\nA Kalamazoo County District Court judge ruled last week that Dalton is competent to stand trial. A preliminary examination is scheduled for May 20 to determine if enough evidence exists to move the case to trial.\n\nFollow John Hogan on Twitter: @JohnHoganWZZM
Let me start off by saying I am sucker for a good closet system. What made it difficult to move out of my parents' house many years ago was that I'd be saying goodbye to the custom-built California Closet they had installed in my room (I mean, I'd miss my parents too, obviously, but I've accumulated more shoes over the years than I know what to do with). It was almost genius the way they transformed an empty space with the addition of a few well-placed bars, shelves, hooks, and more.\n\nI needed to find a way to recreate that on my own—within a reasonable price point. Enter Rubbermaid.\n\nThe basics\n\nCredit: Rubbermaid Rubbermaid closet configurations can be customized for nearly any space.\n\nYou've probably seen the brand Rubbermaid floating around your miscellaneous Tupperware drawer. But they offer much more than food storage: the brand sells sheds (you heard that right: buy and build your own shed), cleaning supplies, water bottles and coolers, and more—all pretty standard equipment you'd need for everyday living. It's thus not entirely surprising one of their best-selling items is a closet system. I mean, as we prepare for the apocalypse, we need all the storage we can get to stock up on canned goods.\n\nThe brand offers three types of closets: The FastTrack system that features expandable all-in-one shelving, the Direct Mount system that includes basic non-adjustable wire shelves, and the Configurations system, the one I have complete with bracket supports, hang rod supports, telescoping rods and more. While I wish I had a more eloquent response as to why I went with this one, it was all they had in stock at Home Depot at the time. But looking into their other two offerings, I'm glad the one I chose represents a healthy mix of both adjustable and fixed shelving. It's meant to fit into closets between six and 10 feet wide, and its steel-based shelves and hanger bars support between 11 and 20 pounds.\n\nWhat I liked about Rubbermaid Configurations Closet Kits\n\nCredit: Rubbermaid This closet is easy on the eyes, the wallet, and the clutter.\n\nThe main thing I like about it probably won't apply to everyone: While the brand claims, rails, shelves, and telescoping rods can be set up in minutes with no cutting, using simple household tools, I'm a little ashamed to say I hired someone to install it. Before installing anything heavy like this closet (which weighs 62 pounds once assembled), you need to hammer and nail directly into a stud behind the drywall (this can be achieved using a studfinder, which TBH sounds like a dating app I would 10/10 sign up for). If you don't have studs behind your drywall that you can hook your furniture into, you'll need to insert separate anchors to avoid having your drywall ripped out of your wall.\n\nI am not a particularly graceful person with so much as a butter knife—I couldn't trust myself to hit the nail on the head, so to speak. (And yes, I could have solicited my husband to do it, but we've learned that building furniture together puts a very real strain on our marriage, so we figured the cost-benefit analysis of hiring a handyman vs. a divorce lawyer made sense.)\n\nMy husband and I share a hollow nook that connects directly from our bedroom into an en-suite bathroom. When we bought the house, it was completely empty, so I like that this system made excellent use of wasted space. This tells me a product like this can essentially turn any old corner in your home or small apartment into a custom-built walk-in closet. Our handyman used a chainsaw to divide the shelving so we could place two units at opposite ends of our closet. My husband has around two feet of shelving since he owns like three shirts, and I have four feet of shelving.\n\nMy three levels of shelves house at least 50 sweatshirts (it's cold in Canada, okay?!), and my hanger racks keep at least 20 button-downs and trousers crease-free. I also use the racks to hang items I'd normally pile in a heap somewhere, like purses, scarves, bras, and belts. Since having it installed seven months ago, I've noticed far less clutter in my actual bedroom. Wall shelving like this is also a great way to free up some space in your chest of drawers or armoire, should they be bursting at the seams.\n\nI also appreciate that the system is said to be customizable even after it's built, which is why I've held on to some extra pieces I hadn't used, just in case I decide to change things up.\n\nWhat I didn't like about Rubbermaid Configurations Closet Kits\n\nCredit: Rubbermaid There's lots to love about these closets, but they're not perfect.\n\nIf it seems like I like having a closet system more than I like having this particular closet system, you're not wrong. I don't like that I felt intimidated by all the options. It felt like a very do-or-die situation. Like, what if the configuration I chose is not, in fact, the most economical use of space? Will I have to tear it out of my wall and start over? In the brand's defense, that doesn't seem like their fault. I just struggle with making decisions and sticking to them. I am much more used to reorganizing free-standing furniture to change up a room's vibe than resigning myself to one particular look.\n\nI was excited about the prospect of placing shelves according to where I felt in my heart of hearts they belong, but I left it up to the handyman. He's an engineer by trade, so I trusted him to have a sense of how its pieces would make sense aesthetically and structurally. If you don't have self-confidence issues when it comes to home repairs like I do, I'm sure you would be able to install it yourself with a quick YouTube tutorial beforehand.\n\nI wouldn't say the material itself is flimsy—it can support the weight of an entire well-fed toddler, after all. My main quip is that the base of each shelf is made of wires separated a bit over one inch apart. That means if I stack a pair of heels on top, the heel plunges right through onto a lower shelf, sullying clean clothes. This requires I place a mat under each pair of shoes, which isn't particularly convenient or easy on the eyes.\n\nAnother tiny issue I have is, again, entirely my fault. I don't love that I built my hanger bars only a few feet from the floor. This means my blouses and scarves drag on the floor, which my cats interpret as the most interesting toy ever. However, it says a lot that the closet was able to withstand my cats swinging from my clothes like Jane and Tarzan (they collectively weigh 22 pounds, according to their last checkup).\n\nAre Rubbermaid Configurations Closet Kits worth it?\n\nCredit: Rubbermaid Store a serious chunk of your belongings in a fraction of the space.\n\nHonestly, yes. I recognize how huge of a luxury it is to have the space to put up a wall-mounted closet in the first place, so that in and of itself negates some of my issues with it. If you plan on using the shelves to store large flat items, like folded sweaters, then it's a great bet. But if you're looking to use this as a sort of display case for smaller trinkets, cute little purses, or other accessories, you're better off looking for something with a solid flat base.\n\nAfter testing a variety of closer organizers, we dubbed the configurations kit our runner-up. As our tester Rebecca Boniface notes, this type of closet is a better idea if you own your home or are planning to stay in one place for a while, since it requires you to drill into the wall.\n\nIts individual compartments are of perfectly fine quality, so the closet system is very much what you make of it. I can't say for sure how it'll turn out without the help of a handyman because, y'know, anxiety, but I have faith in you to pull it off.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

Adi Joseph\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nWho thought a coin toss could be so emotional?\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush, the oldest living president, was in the hospital a week ago in Houston. But he recovered from pneumonia and gave us the rare memorable Super Bowl coin toss.\n\nBush was rolled out by a military member in a wheelchair while wife Barbara took a golf cart to center field.\n\nThe beauty was the combination of unified appreciation from the fans - something so rare in politics these days - and the knowledge of everything it took for Bush to be out there at NRG Stadium for this moment. He's 92 - a few months older than Jimmy Carter.\n\nBarbara is 91 and looked terrific riding a golf cart next to her husband.\n\nEveryone seemed to understand that this was something different than, say, Joe Montana's coin flip last year.
AP\n\nJEONGSEON, South Korea (AP) — Happily married skiers do ski fast, Bode Miller. Mrs. Anna Veith is the proof.\n\nThree days after Miller said in an NBC broadcast that marriage had not been so good for one of the best Alpine skiers of her generation, the Austrian responded on the slopes.\n\nYeah, we can, Veith said after earning an Olympic silver medal in Saturday's super-G.\n\nAs Anna Fenninger, before her wedding to snowboarder Manuel Veith two years ago, she was the 2014 Olympic champion in super-G and a three-time world championship gold medalist.\n\nLike Miller, the then-Miss Fenninger also won two overall World Cup titles as the best all-around skier over a full season — the sport's most prized honor. However, a serious knee injury in October 2015 derailed her career and it seemed the 28-year-old Mrs. Veith was past her peak.\n\nThe knee was an issue, Miller said — on Valentine's Day, no less. I want to point out that she also just got married and it's historically very challenging to race in the World Cup while trying to raise a family or after being married.\n\nNot to blame the spouses, but I just want to get that out there that it could be your husband's fault, Miller said, before apologizing on air.\n\nOn Saturday, Miller was in Jeongseon helping NBC call a race that showed Veith can still compete at the highest level.\n\nHe can say what he is thinking about and it doesn't matter for me, said Veith, who laughed out loud when asked if she proved a point.\n\nVeith was delighted despite losing her Olympic title by the smallest of margins and in the most surprising way. She was already being acclaimed the winner by rival racers when an unheralded No. 26 starter from the Czech Republic, part-time skier and snowboard world champion Ester Ledecka, went 0.01 seconds faster.\n\nI'm happy with the silver. I won everything today, said Veith, who had won the last of her seven career major championship medals in 2015. After two years, I never knew that I can make that again to get back into that shape, or get the chance to go to the Olympics.\n\nThis was already a success for me to be here. And now I have a medal. It's unbelievable.\n\nIt was a full 25 minutes that Veith led the race, 0.10 seconds ahead of Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein, who wound up with bronze.\n\nVeith said she started to believe she had retained her Olympic title.\n\nI thought at first, yes. This was the reason why I was so emotional, Veith said. At first I couldn't believe that it happened and after it, this one-hundredth, just a big surprise and I thought: 'Is that true or not?'\n\nEster had a pretty good run and she deserved this, said Veith, who maybe more than anyone in Saturday's race might have guessed how great a snowboarder racer can be.\n\nAfter all, she married one.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Olympic coverage: https://wintergames.ap.org
Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON – Thousands of requests by men to bring in child and adolescent brides to live in the United States were approved over the past decade, according to government data obtained by The Associated Press. In one case, a 49-year-old man applied for admission for a 15-year-old girl.\n\nThe approvals are legal: The Immigration and Nationality Act does not set minimum age requirements. And in weighing petitions for spouses or fiancees, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services goes by whether the marriage is legal in the home country and then whether the marriage would be legal in the state where the petitioner lives.\n\nBut the data raises questions about whether the immigration system may be enabling forced marriage and about how U.S. laws may be compounding the problem despite efforts to limit child and forced marriage. Marriage between adults and minors is not uncommon in the United States, and most states allow children to marry with some restrictions.\n\nThere were more than 5,000 cases of adults petitioning on behalf of minors and nearly 3,000 examples of minors seeking to bring in older spouses or fiances, according to the data requested by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in 2017 and compiled into a report.\n\nSome victims of forced marriage say the lure of a U.S. passport combined with lax U.S. marriage laws are partly fueling the petitions.\n\nMy passport ruined my life, said Naila Amin, a dual citizen from Pakistan who grew up in New York City.\n\nShe was forcibly married at 13 in Pakistan and applied for papers for her 26-year-old husband to come to the country.\n\nPeople die to come to America, she said. I was a passport to him. They all wanted him here, and that was the way to do it.\n\nAmin, now 29, said she was betrothed to her first cousin Tariq when she was just 8 and he was 21. The petition was eventually terminated after she ran away. She said the ordeal cost her a childhood. She was in and out of foster care and group homes, and it took a while to get her life on track.\n\nI was a child. I want to know: Why weren't any red flags raised? Whoever was processing this application, they don't look at it? They don't think? Amin asked.\n\nThere is a two-step process for obtaining U.S. immigration visas and green cards. Petitions are first considered by USCIS. If granted, they must be approved by the State Department. Overall, there were 3.5 million petitions received from budget years 2007 through 2017.\n\nOver that period, there were 5,556 approvals for those seeking to bring minor spouses or fiancees, and 2,926 approvals by minors seeking to bring in older spouses, according to the data. Additionally, there were 204 for minors by minors. Petitions can be filed by U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\n\nIt indicates a problem. It indicates a loophole that we need to close, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, told the AP.\n\nIn nearly all the cases, the girls were the younger person in the relationship. In 149 instances, the adult was older than 40, and in 28 cases the adult was over 50, the committee found. Among the examples: In 2011, immigration officials approved a 14-year-old's petition for a 48-year-old spouse in Jamaica. A petition from a 71-year-old man was approved in 2013 for his 17-year-old wife in Guatemala.\n\nThere are no nationwide statistics on child marriage, but data from a few states suggests it is far from rare. State laws generally set 18 as the minimum age for marriage, yet every state allows exceptions. Most states let 16- and 17-year-olds marry if they have parental consent, and several states – including New York, Virginia and Maryland – allow children under 16 to marry with court permission.\n\nFraidy Reiss, who campaigns against coerced marriage as head of a group called Unchained at Last, researched data from her home state of New Jersey. She determined that nearly 4,000 minors, mostly girls, were married in the state from 1995 to 2012, including 178 who were under 15.\n\nThis is a problem both domestically and in terms of immigration, she said.\n\nReiss – who says she was forced into an abusive marriage by her Orthodox Jewish family when she was 19 – said that often cases of child marriage via parental consent involve coercion, with a girl forced to marry against her will.\n\nThey are subjected to a lifetime of domestic servitude and rape, she said. And the government is not only complicit; they're stamping this and saying: Go ahead.\n\nThe data was requested in 2017 by Johnson and then-Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, the committee's top Democrat. Johnson said it took a year to get the information, showing there needs to be a better system to track and vet the petitions.\n\nOur immigration system may unintentionally shield the abuse of women and children, the senators said in the letter.\n\nUSCIS didn't know how many of the approvals were granted by the State Department, but overall only about 2.6 percent of spousal or fiancee claims are rejected.\n\nSeparately, the data show some 4,749 minor spouses or fiancees received green cards to live in the U.S. over that same 10-year period.\n\nThe head of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna, said in a letter to the committee that their request had raised questions and discussion within the agency on what it can do to prevent forced minor marriages. The agency noticed some issues in how the data was collected and has resolved them. Officials also created a flagging system that requires verification of the birthdate whenever a minor is detected.\n\nThe country where most requests came from was Mexico, followed by Pakistan, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and Yemen. Middle Eastern nationals had the highest percentage of overall approved petitions.
WASHINGTON — President Trump said Friday he was surprised by allegations of domestic violence against his staff secretary that forced the top aide to resign this week — but lauded the work Rob Porter did and noted that that he has maintained his innocence.\n\nWe found out about it recently and I was surprised by it, but we certainly wish him well and it's a tough time for him, Trump said. He did a very good job when he was in the White House.\n\nTrump's comments Friday were the first time the president has spoken publicly about the top aide since the allegations surfaced Wednesday in a report in the British tabloid The Daily Mail.\n\nTrump said he was saddened by the allegations but said Porter has denied the accusations.\n\nHe also, as you probably know, says he's innocent and I think you have to remember that, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in an unscheduled photo-op. He said very strongly yesterday that he's innocent so you have to talk to him about that, but we absolutely wish him well, he did a very good job when he was at the White House.\n\nThose pleas of innocence come despite public accusations by two ex-wives — one of whom produced photos of a black eye she said Porter gave her while in Italy. In a written statement sent through the White House press office Wednesday, Porter said he took those photos, but that the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described, he said. He did not elaborate.\n\nMore:Ex-wife of ousted White House aide Rob Porter says marriage was 'strongly' abusive\n\nMore:White House says background check for Rob Porter was never completed\n\nThe staff secretary is one of a small circle of top aides to the president, controlling the information flow into and out of the Oval Office — including some of the most classified and sensitive documents the president sees. Like many White House jobs, the position requires a security clearance.\n\nThe episode has raised questions about who in the White House knew of the issue, and whether presidential aides have been properly vetted. Both ex-wives have said they told FBI agents of the incidents during their background check investigation, but Porter was allowed to remain on the job with a temporary clearance for more than a year.\n\nDemocratic senators wrote Friday to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Counsel Don McGahn, demanding answers.\n\nWe recognize that you and the president have tremendous discretion in deciding whom to hire to work in the White House, they wrote. However, we are troubled by published accounts suggesting that you decided to hire Mr. Porter despite the fact he could not get a security clearance and that you were aware of the specific domestic violence allegations made against him.\n\nFor his part, Trump avoided those questions on Friday.\n\nWe hope he has a wonderful career and he will have a great career ahead of him, Trump said of the 40-year-old aide. He did a very good job when he was at the White House.\n\nIn an interview with NBC News in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Vice President Pence said he was appalled by the allegations and promised to personally look into them when he returns to Washington from the Winter Olympics.\n\nThere's no tolerance in this White House, and no place in America for domestic abuse, Pence said.
Boua Xiong\n\nKARE-TV, Minneapolis-St. Paul\n\nMINNEAPOLIS — Ring size doesn't matter. That's the message a Minnesota wife posted on Facebook.\n\nRachel Pedersen took to social media after people repeatedly asked whether she'd ever upgrade her small wedding ring. She wrote that it's not about the size of the rock but rather the love story behind it.\n\nThe post, which was written in February but just went viral, has received nearly 190,000 likes and has been shared close to 50,000 times. Many men and women have responded to Pedersen's post with their own stories.\n\nAll it took was one night two years ago at a Perkins restaurant for Rachel and her husband, Paul Pedersen, to fall in love.\n\nThe chemistry was out of this world, said Paul Pedersen. It was so good that I had my lines set for how I was going to get her number.\n\nHe not only got her number, he won her heart. The Eden Prairie, Minn., couple eloped to Mall of America's Chapel of Love 13 days after meeting.\n\nI picked out my dress that day at Macy's on the clearance rack, Rachel said.\n\nWhat she didn't know, was that while she was picking out a dress, her soon-to-be husband was picking out a ring.\n\nI looked at about 15 rings and I finally find the one, he said.\n\nHe drained his savings, about $700, to purchase a 0.25-carat pave diamond ring. Rachel was thrilled.\n\nAs their careers flourished, Rachel Pedersen said people started pestering her about the size of her rock.\n\nIn part, her Facebook post said:\n\nWait a minute.... Since when did the size of someone's ring become an indication of success?! For me, the ring is SO much more. My ring symbolizes a whirlwind, storybook, make you sick love story.... It reminds me of how my husband and I met and fell at in love in one night at a Perkin's diner.\n\nI think as a woman it kind of gets to you a little bit so I wrote this post as a declaration of how I felt about my ring, she said.\n\nShe said that she'd catch herself looking at 2-carat diamonds thinking if only I could have that. But then comments from others reminded her of what's important.\n\nBut then I saw other people who were looking at our marriage, and say 'if only I could have that.' \n\nFollow KARE-TV on Twitter: @kare11
Dan Caplinger\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nIf you want to get your tax refund as quickly as possible, it's critical to avoid making mistakes that will delay the processing of your return. Yet every year, millions of taxpayers make tax errors that hold up their refunds and can trigger closer examinations of their taxes. The IRS has identified the most common errors that taxpayers make, and fortunately, it's pretty easy to steer clear of them once you know they're there.\n\n1. Wrong or missing Social Security numbers\n\nAll of the tax information that gets reported to the IRS is tied to your Social Security number. Therefore, if you provide the wrong number, then the IRS won't be able to match up your return with the information that your employer and financial institutions have provided. To avoid problems, make sure that the Social Security numbers that you provide match up correctly to what appears on your Social Security card.\n\nTax news and advice\n\n2. Wrong names\n\nYou'd think this wouldn't be a major problem, but the IRS receives many returns on which people's names are incorrect. Again, your Social Security card is the best place to cross-check your name, and you should make sure you spell everything consistently so that it matches with other records. One particularly common issue is that if you change your name because of marriage or divorce, then you should be sure to notify the Social Security Administration so that its records will match what you report to the IRS.\n\n3. Filing status errors\n\nSome filing statuses can give additional tax breaks, but it's critical to choose the right one for your particular situation. Often, taxpayers make mistakes in choosing a filing status for which they don't qualify, such as head of household status for unmarried individuals. Using the interactive tax assistant on the IRS website can make sure that you pick the right status.\n\n4. Math errors\n\nSimple mistakes in arithmetic make up a substantial portion of the errors that show up on tax returns, especially for those who prepare their returns by hand. Tax software typically catches errors in math, although software won't necessarily pick up simple data-entry mistakes like switching two digits around. Double-checking with a calculator can be a good way to avoid problems.\n\n5. Errors in figuring credits or deductions\n\nSome tax breaks are complicated, and the IRS says that errors in figuring the earned income tax credit, child and dependent care credit, and the standard deduction are particularly common. The best way to avoid these errors is to follow instructions carefully in calculating these credits and deductions, or else you'll risk shortchanging yourself out of a bigger tax break.\n\n6. Incorrect bank account numbers\n\nIf you use direct deposit to get your refund, you'll get it faster than if the IRS has to mail a paper check. But you have to provide the correct routing number and account number for your bank account, or else your refund won't get processed correctly. Be sure to look on a check or get routing and account information from your financial institution to make sure your refund goes where it's supposed to go.\n\n7. Not signing or dating your tax forms\n\nAfter spending hours or days preparing your return, it's easy to forget the key final step of signing and dating your tax forms. However, an unsigned tax return isn't valid, and if you're filing a joint return, both spouses have to sign. Also, you'll want to put the correct date as evidence that you filed your return in a timely fashion.\n\n8. Errors with validating an electronically filed tax return\n\nThose who file electronically have to select a personal identification number or use their prior-year adjusted gross income to validate your electronic tax return. Often, taxpayers don't understand the procedure, or they fail to provide the correct number. Being certain about providing correct figures makes tax preparation and electronic filing simpler.\n\n9. Not correcting erroneous tax information forms\n\nIf there are errors on your Form W-2 from your employer, or on 1099 forms from financial institutions and other providers, then you shouldn't simply ignore them. Rather, talk to the reporting party and ask them to correct the error. Otherwise, the IRS will flag a mismatch between what you said and what the other party said, and it'll be up to you to prove that you're right.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

Congratulations are in order for Emma Stone and Dave McCary!\n\nThe couple is expecting their first child together, according to People and E! News. The reports came Monday, after the Daily Mail posted pictures of Stone appearing to cradle her baby bump while out walking.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the couple's reps for comment.\n\nIn September 2020, People and Page Six reported that Stone, 32, and McCary, 35, had tied the knot. Stone opened up about how her attitudes toward marriage and parenting have shifted as she's gotten older in a 2018 Elle interview with Jennifer Lawrence.\n\nAs a teenager, I was like, I'm never getting married, I'm never having kids, she said. And then I got older and I was like, I really want to get married, I really want to have kids.\n\nAccording to People and E!, Stone and McCary began dating in 2017. In December 2019, the two announced their engagement on McCary's Instagram, with a picture of Stone showing off a pearl and diamond ring on her left ring finger. Alexandra Crotin, a rep for Stone, later confirmed to USA TODAY the actress and writer had become affianced.\n\nMcCary captioned the photo of the beaming couple with a simple double heart emoji. In the pic, a smiling McCary, in a dark blue sweater, cuddles up to Stone, who's wearing a white top.\n\nThough the Oscar-winning La La Land actress and comedian have kept their relationship relatively out of the public eye, USA TODAY spotted the two coupled up at the 2019 Academy Awards, with her introducing him to a group during a commercial break.\n\nEmma Stone and Dave McCary are engaged! They announce it by flashing her ring on Instagram\n\nIn addition to writing and directing for Saturday Night Live, McCary, 35, also directed the 2017 film Brigsby Bear. The movie premiered at Sundance Film Festival and was co-written by SNL star Kyle Mooney and Kevin Costello. The three writers have been best friends since middle school.\n\n'Easy A' 10th anniversary: Where are Emma Stone, Amanda Bynes and Penn Badgley now?\n\nContributing: Anika Reed, Patrick Ryan
Blake Shelton is already many things, including a Grammy-nominated singer and a coach on NBC's The Voice. He plans on adding stepdad to his list of titles.\n\nIn an interview with KFROG's The Ride with Kimo & Heather, the country crooner, who is engaged to Gwen Stefani, opened up about his relationship with his fiancée's kids and shared his feelings about becoming their stepfather.\n\nThere's definitely nothing easy about it, said Shelton, whose fiancée shares sons Kingston, 14, Zuma, 12, and Apollo, 6, with her ex-husband Gavin Rossdale.\n\nThe singer, too, has a stepfather and called him one of my heroes.\n\nI love my stepfather, and I looked up to him, and he's like a father to me, so I have a good inspiration in my life for how to do this and the kind of stepdad I want to be, he said.\n\nThough Shelton said he takes the responsibility of being a father figure very serious, he added that he also has fun with the experience.\n\nI also have a blast with it, I'm not gonna lie, he said. I don't take it so serious that I'm not enjoying this time, because I really am, especially now that we're five years into this thing. I can't imagine my life without these kids now.\n\nThis isn't the first time Shelton has been candid about becoming a role model. During a Today interview in July, 2020, Hoda Kotb asked him about a Father's Day Instagram post from Stefani, in which she thanked Shelton for helping me raise these boys!!\n\nThat's a scary moment for me, because it's one thing for me to be with the kids all the time and be their buddy, he said. But then you do have to consider after awhile, that they're starting to listen to things that you say, and there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that, which is new to me.\n\nShelton tweeted the news of his engagement to Stefani in October 2020, writing: Hey @gwenstefani thanks for saving my 2020... And the rest of my life.. I love you. I heard a YES! During an On Air with Ryan Seacrest interview in December, Stefani said the plans for their nuptials are still up in the air because of COVID-19.\n\nBlake Shelton talks becoming role model to Gwen Stefani's boys: 'That's a scary moment'\n\nEven when you cut it down to just family, it's still too many people for COVID so we're sort of going to see what happens in the next few months, she said.\n\nThe two have been a couple for about five years, getting together after Shelton divorced Miranda Lambert. This will be Shelton's third marriage. His first wife was Kaynette Williams.\n\nGwen Stefani doesn't want her wedding with Blake Shelton to be a 'COVID situation'\n\nShelton and Stefani got to know each other while working on NBC's The Voice. In a 2017 interview on NBC's Today, Shelton acknowledged that many fans were perplexed when they became a couple.\n\nIn people's defense, I think it's so hard for people to wrap their head around why Gwen would want to be with me, he said. I don't blame 'em.\n\nWhy Blake Shelton is receiving backlash over 'tone deaf' song 'Minimum Wage'\n\nContributing: Sara M Moniuszko
WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide if foster care agencies can turn down gay and lesbian couples, an indication that the court's conservative majority may be ready to give religious objectors greater freedom to skirt laws with which they disagree.\n\nThe dispute from Philadelphia is another in a series of challenges brought by Catholic and other religious groups and individuals that object to same-sex marriage.\n\nThe justices already are considering three major religious liberty cases this year on state funding for religious schools, their right to fire teachers despite employment discrimination laws, and challenges to the Affordable Care Act's requirement that employers offer free insurance coverage for contraceptives.\n\nIn the foster care case, the court could consider overruling a 30-year-old precedent limiting religious freedom that was written by conservative icon Antonin Scalia. The case, Employment Division v. Smith, has been a target of fellow conservatives since it was decided in 1990.\n\nThat would continue a trend in which the high court has looked kindly on religion – making churches eligible for some public funds, upholding public prayer at government meetings, exempting religious objectors from laws regarding contraception and same-sex marriage, and allowing a mammoth Latin cross to remain on government land.\n\nJust as no LGBT couples are prevented from marrying because a particular church does not perform same-sex weddings, no LGBT couples are prevented from fostering because a particular church cannot provide an endorsement, lawyers for Catholic Social Services said in court papers. Yet many churches will be prevented from exercising religion by caring for at-risk children, all due to a disagreement with the government about marriage.\n\nLori Windham, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said the court's decision to hear the appeal could prevent a shortfall in the foster care system.\n\nOver the last few years, agencies have been closing their doors across the country, and all the while children are pouring into the system, Windham said.\n\nBut Leslie Cooper of the American Civil Liberties Union said religious agencies' unwillingness to serve same-sex couples – not city and state governments' refusal to grant taxpayer funds to those agencies – causes the shortfall.\n\nAllowing foster care agencies to exclude qualified families based on religious requirements that have nothing to do with the ability to care for a child, such as their sexual orientation or faith, would make it even worse, Cooper said.
Daniel B. Kline\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nIf you're looking for love this Valentine's Day, you may want to check your finances.\n\nNo, you're not looking to make sure you have enough money to pay for flowers, chocolates or a fancy dinner. Instead, you're checking to see if your debt limits your dating pool.\n\nNearly three-quarters of American adults (72 percent) said they'd reconsider a romantic relationship because of another person's debt according to a survey from Finder.com. According to the website, that could shrink your pool of potential matches by roughly 182.8 million adults.\n\nSurvey respondents were most turned off by credit card debt, with 56 percent citing that as a red flag, and $12,615.96 being the threshold that raises concerns. That was followed by student loan debt (52 percent), with potential romantic partners becoming concerned when that obligation exceeded $48,761.15.\n\nWhat about other types of debt?\n\nPayday loan debt was the third worrisome debt (49 percent), with the threshold for concern there being $4,885.52. That's an interesting contrast to credit card debt – more people said they were concerned about credit card debt (likely due to it being more common), but they were willing to look past a larger amount. That's an appropriate response given the very high interest rates associated with often-predatory payday loans.\n\nWhat to do:Why you should come clean to your partner about your finances\n\nRespondents also cited mortgages (49 percent), auto loans (49 percent), personal loans (45 percent) and medical bills (45 percent). Respondents are more forgiving on these types of loans, which aren't as closely associated with making poor financial choices.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nDebt should not doom you to being alone, but prospective partners are right to be concerned, especially if you have credit card, payday loan, or other high-interest debt. This isn't a first-date topic – Hi, I'm Joe and I have way too much credit card debt, is an awkward introduction. It is, however, something you should bring up before a relationship becomes serious.\n\nIdeally, if you have debt, you should proactively address it once a relationship begins to become serious. Don't just lay out your financial situation without comment. If the relationship has the potential to lead to marriage, the debt of one partner becomes the debt of the other.\n\nBeyond credit cards:You should be worried about financial fraud on all your accounts\n\nExplain your debt, how you accumulated it, and how you're tackling it. You may have made irresponsible choices in the past, but you want to show that you're handling it, and that it won't be a drag on your future as a couple.\n\nAside from taking the steps needed to get your finances under control, the most important thing you can do as you go from dating to couple is be open. Talk about finances even when it's uncomfortable. Share your victories and mistakes.\n\nOther debt:Take these steps to conquer your credit cards and student loans\n\nYou probably can't solve all your financial woes quickly. But what you can do is show that you're taking the right steps and working to make yourself less of a dating risk. Love isn't all roses and champagne, sometimes it's honesty and a willingness to improve yourself – and not only for your sake, but for the benefit of your partner.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

Dave Boucher\n\nThe Tennessean\n\nNASHVILLE — The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation confirmed Thursday it has found a missing east Tennessee girl in a case that has garnered national attention.\n\nCarlie Marie Trent, 9, was found safe in Hawkins County after she went missing May 4, the TBI said in a tweet Thursday afternoon. Her uncle, Gary Simpson, 57, was taken into custody and charged with especially aggravated kidnapping.\n\nThank God, she was rescued safe. And we hope all the medical examinations turn out positive, TBI Director Mark Gwyn said in a news conference Thursday evening.\n\nShe was rescued thanks to two heroes, Gwyn said. ​\n\nTwo men, Donnie Lawson and Roger Carpenter, found a remote site where Carlie was being held by Simpson, Gwyn said. Carpenter, a minister, held Simpson at gunpoint while Lawson called for law enforcement help.\n\nGwyn said law enforcement had called on residents to search remote areas of their properties after learning Simpson had purchased camping equipment. It's believed Lawson and Carpenter were patrolling the property on ATVs when they found Simpson.\n\nCarlie was taken from Rogersville is in Hawkins County. Simpson, who has no custodial rights for Carlie and is her uncle by marriage, removed Carlie from school under false pretenses, according to a TBI news release.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the TBI had added the uncle to its Top 10 Most Wanted list, according to The Associated Press, and officials warned that the girl was in imminent danger.
The state of Mississippi doled out more than $2.1 million in welfare to a religious and wrestling nonprofit run by former professional wrestler Ted DiBiase Sr., state records show.\n\nDiBiase, who as a wrestler dubbed The Million Dollar Man wore a golden championship belt adorned with dollar signs, later turned to preaching and formed a nonprofit in Mississippi called Heart of David Ministries.\n\nHeart of David Ministries had relatively meager funds until DiBiase's son was hired as deputy administrator at the Mississippi Department of Human Services in early 2017. Both DiBiase's son Brett and the director who hired him were indicted last week as part of a massive alleged embezzlement scheme that also involved welfare money.\n\nHeart of David Ministries — which received as much as $900,000 one year from the Mississippi Department of Human Services — describes its central mission in nonprofit filings as religious education & training. It reported spending its 2017 grant money on general church speaking engagements, religious conferences, school assemblies, and wrestling events.\n\nThe money came through a federal fund called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, commonly known as welfare. Six people were indicted last week as part of a scheme that allegedly stole more than $4.15 million in welfare money.\n\nTed DiBiase Sr. was not named in the indictments.\n\nIt is unclear precisely how Heart of David Ministries used the $2,126,739 in welfare money it received. The payments began in May 2017 and continued until the current fiscal year. As MDHS officials pumped money into DiBiase's nonprofit, the state was denying more than 98% of its individual applicants for welfare.\n\nHeart of David was vague in describing how it would use the money. It pledged in one 2018 contract to establish a network of partnerships, services and resources throughout Mississippi communities for faith-based and self activities.\n\nThe man in charge of the state's welfare distribution — including the grants to Heart of David — was John Davis, former director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services. He was among those indicted last week. Davis, who departed DHS last summer, decided to hire DiBiase's son Brett in 2017, agency spokesman Danny Blanton said.\n\nBlanton said the contracts with Heart of David did not go through a bidding process. Davis often would unilaterally distribute the federal grant money without bidding, Blanton said.\n\nThe agency has since implemented a more robust committee system to review bids before awarding contracts for TANF money and other grants, Blanton said. Heart of David, he added, is no longer receiving grant money from the department.\n\nThe Clarion Ledger made several attempts to reach DiBiase and his family. A woman who answered the door at his Clinton home called the Clarion Ledger's past reporting fictitious. She declined to comment. Attempts to reach the board of directors and other officials connected to Heart of David Ministries were unsuccessful.\n\nDiBiase founded Heart of David Ministries 20 years ago. He has said he became a Christian minister after struggling with alcohol and drugs and cheating on his wife while on the road for wrestling events. As part of the nonprofit, he often travels to speak at churches and events.\n\nI was traveling the world in Lear jets and limousines. I had it all, but I had succumbed to those things on the road that take us away — the drugs, the booze and the women, DiBiase told former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in a 2017 interview. I had put the most important things in my life at risk to stroke my ego.\n\nHeart of David Ministries does not appear to have filed any tax documents with the IRS for the past two years, despite receiving nearly $2 million in federal funds during that time. As of 2017, its board of directors included a former Ole Miss punter, an Ohio attorney and a Jackson youth minister.\n\nThe website for Heart of a David Ministries has few details about the organization and what it does.\n\nMost years, Heart of David received relatively small amounts of donations and grants and no substantial money from the government. In 2013, for example, it pulled in just $5,000 in grants, a number that had grown to more than $80,000 by 2016.\n\nBut by 2017 — three months after Brett DiBiase was hired at MDHS — the nonprofit raked in $271,000 in welfare money from the agency. Brett DiBiase is also a former professional wrestler, and it's unclear what qualifications, if any, he had to be a senior official at a state agency. His salary was $95,000 and he left the job after seven months.\n\nIn 2017, when Heart of David received $271,000 from the state, the group reported spending nearly $60,000 on website design and maintenance, nearly $30,000 on travel and $13,000 on advertising, among other expenses such as wrestling events. DiBiase Sr. was paid more than $80,000 as president of the organization.\n\nPer federal guidelines, block grants distributed through TANF are supposed to accomplish one of four specific purposes: encouraging healthy families, promoting job preparation and marriage, reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and helping needy families.\n\nAs Heart of David received its first infusion of cash from MDHS in 2017, filmmakers put the finishing touches on The Price of Fame — a movie about Ted DiBiase Sr.'s struggles and religious awakening.\n\nA trailer for the film said it was made in association with Heart of David Ministries, but the producer and manager behind the film said the nonprofit was not involved. Blanton said the agency has not found signs state funds were used for the movie.\n\nThey say that the love of money is the root of all evil, Ted DiBiase Sr. says early in the film, clad in a tuxedo and brandishing a stack of $100 bills. Hogwash — with enough of this, you can buy anything.\n\nRead the contract
Nate Davis\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nWith free agency and the draft receding in the rearview mirror, this is a fair time to assess each NFL team's offseason to date. Though some dominoes still might fall, here's a ranking from 1 to 32, based on each team's progress (or lack thereof) relative to how it finished the 2015 season.\n\n1. Jacksonville Jaguars: They might have scored the draft's two best players by picking DB Jalen Ramsey and LB Myles Jack, whose mysterious knee condition knocked him into Round 2. A defense that allowed the most points in the AFC should also benefit from DT Malik Jackson, perhaps free agency's biggest prize this year, along with incoming S Tashaun Gipson and CB Prince Amukamara. DE Dante Fowler, the No. 3 overall pick in 2015, is ready to rock after a knee injury scuttled his rookie season. GM Dave Caldwell, who also added AFC rushing leader Chris Ivory to an ascending offense, still has more than $50 million in cap space for the future. After so many desolate seasons, the Jags seem on the cusp of rewarding the patience of their fans and owner Shad Khan.\n\n2. Houston Texans: The J.J. Watt-led defense is as stout as ever. But a plodding offense was injected with speed during free agency (RB Lamar Miller) and the draft (WRs Will Fuller and Braxton Miller). If new franchise face QB Brock Osweiler can quickly assimilate with a team that won nine games apiece the last two years despite often-shoddy quarterback play, the Texans could be poised to do something special.\n\n3. Tennessee Titans: New GM Jon Robinson traded the draft's No. 1 pick – a blessing in light of the Laremy Tunsil fiasco that ensued – and wound up with five of the top 64 selections, which were parlayed into potential impact players T Jack Conklin, OLB/DE Kevin Dodd and RB Derrick Henry. Robinson also acquired RB DeMarco Murray for a song during free agency. Could be yet another AFC South club on the fast track to relevance.\n\n4. Los Angeles Rams: It's already been a year of big moves for this team, literally and figuratively. But it's understandable why coach Jeff Fisher and GM Les Snead would part with so much draft capital to get Cal QB Jared Goff at No. 1 overall considering one Rams passer in the past nine seasons has managed to throw for at least 20 TDs. Despite cutting aging defensive mainstays Chris Long and James Laurinaitis and failing to re-sign CB Janoris Jenkins, this club got better this offseason.\n\n5. Oakland Raiders: With a strong foundation in place, GM Reggie McKenzie may have finally put the roof on this house. G Kelechi Osemele, OLB Bruce Irvin, CB Sean Smith and S Reggie Nelson were nice free-agent additions but the types used to fill in gaps rather than build around. First-round S Karl Joseph can alter a game's momentum just like retired Charles Woodson, the man Joseph will replace\n\n6. Minnesota Vikings: They didn't make much noise and that's OK. New G Alex Boone should be a boon to RB Adrian Peterson while departed WR Mike Wallace won't be missed, especially with highly touted first-round WR Laquon Treadwell inbound. Overall, the Vikes quietly added depth to solidify a roster that should be ready to defend the NFC North crown.\n\nNFL draft tracker 2016: Seven-round breakdown on picks\n\n7. Baltimore Ravens: An 11-man draft headlined by LT Ronnie Stanley looks like another strong Ozzie Newsome haul. Veteran S Eric Weddle should stabilize a defense that struggled. But perhaps most importantly, QB Joe Flacco, OLB Terrell Suggs, WR Steve Smith and others are on track to return to a team that lost 20 players to injured reserve.\n\n8. Arizona Cardinals: GM Steve Keim and coach Bruce Arians don't shy from risk and have assumed plenty. If pass rusher Chandler Jones signs an extension and avoids trouble, the low second rounder Arizona spent to acquire him looks like a bargain. The Cards used the draft's 29th pick on DL Robert Nkemdiche, whose baggage dropped him to that point even though his talent warranted a far higher selection. Veteran G Evan Mathis was a great pickup – assuming he can stay healthy at age 34.\n\n9. Green Bay Packers: GM Ted Thompson followed his usual script, re-signing most of his own free agents while largely eschewing outside ones – the exception being TE Jared Cook, who was cut by the Rams. First-round DE Kenny Clark might be the only draft pick who gets a lot of snaps in 2016. But if all goes as planned, recovering WR Jordy Nelson (ACL) and shrinking RB Eddie Lacy will have significantly more snaps this season.\n\n10. Washington Redskins: Franchise-tagged QB Kirk Cousins isn't going anywhere. A defense bolstered by the arrival of all-pro CB Josh Norman and promising draft picks Su'a Cravens and Kendall Fuller may be ready for a big leap. But GM Scot McCloughan is gambling that second-year RB Matt Jones can carry spearhead the rushing attack without Alfred Morris.\n\n2016 NFL draft team grades: Jaguars roar, Eagles whiff\n\n11. Buffalo Bills: Despite a dearth of cap space, they retained starting O-linemen Cordy Glenn and Richie Incognito for the league's No. 1 rushing attack. Coach Rex Ryan and GM Doug Whaley then reloaded a disappointing defense with promising prospects like OLB/DE Shaq Lawson and ILB Reggie Ragland. The question that remains is whether Buffalo will extend QB Tyrod Taylor, who's now looking over his shoulder at fourth rounder Cardale Jones.\n\n12. Atlanta Falcons: They've quietly gotten better. Adding Pro Bowl C Alex Mack makes the offense tougher, while new WR Mohamed Sanu creates options. A steadily improving defense got bigger in free agency (DE Derrick Shelby and OLB Courtney Upshaw) and more athletic through the draft (S Keanu Neal, and LB Deion Jones).\n\n13. Dallas Cowboys: A headline-stealing, go-for-broke draft – RB Ezekiel Elliott and LB Jaylon Smith didn't address needs but could be future all-pros (assuming Smith's knee heals), and QB Dak Prescott may one day replace Tony Romo – masks the suspensions of DEs Randy Gregory and Demarcus Lawrence and failure of the Greg Hardy experiment. But the return of Romo, who had another collarbone surgery, and WR Dez Bryant (foot) is what the Cowboys are counting on most.\n\n14. Kansas City Chiefs: With few exceptions, their maneuvers were unremarkable. Yet a similar approach has brought playoff berths two of the last three years. They need RB Jamaal Charles and OLB Justin Houston to rebound from ACL injuries.\n\n15. Miami Dolphins: New head coach Adam Gase is regarded as a quarterback guru and if he can get Ryan Tannehill on track, the Fins' outlook is sunny. Assuming the hubbub surrounding him diminishes, Miami may have a steal by drafting T Laremy Tunsil at No. 13. New DE Mario Williams negates the loss of Olivier Vernon. The big questions are whether there's a locker-room issue with DT Ndamukong Suh, who's been skipping voluntary workouts, and if RBs Jay Ajayi and rookie Kenyan Drake can replace Lamar Miller's production.\n\nLaremy Tunsil, Myles Jack must remember it's how you finish, not how you start\n\n16. Cincinnati Bengals: Pretty much a typical Bengals offseason – which they don't get enough credit for – as they stayed under the radar in free agency before producing what looks like another stellar draft. QB Andy Dalton is fully healthy, which is good as he'll need to acclimate to several new wideouts, including second-rounder Tyler Boyd. LB Vontaze Burfict's three-game suspension stings.\n\n17. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Free agency proved a success when RB Doug Martin re-upped. Adding CB Brent Grimes and DE Robert Ayers was gravy. The defense got further help when GM Jason Licht drafted CB Vernon Hargreaves and DE Noah Spence with his top picks, though he invited scrutiny for dealing 15 slots up the board for K Roberto Aguayo, the first kicker called in Round 2 in 11 years.\n\n18. Pittsburgh Steelers: They hope their first two draft picks, corners (Artie Burns and Sean Davis) remedies the AFC's worst pass defense. Retired TE Heath Miller will be missed as will suspended WR Martavis Bryant.\n\n19. Indianapolis Colts: They spent four draft picks on offensive linemen, which should be welcome news to battered QB Andrew Luck even though he lost TE Coby Fleener to free agency and doesn't yet have a long-term contract. But coach Chuck Pagano and GM Ryan Grigson did get new deals, perhaps why they seemed far more measured with their spending habits.\n\n20. Carolina Panthers: GM Dave Gettleman boldly rescinded the franchise tag from all-pro CB Josh Norman, signaling an intention to reinvest in his beloved front seven – DTs Kawann Short and Star Lotulelei will soon need new deals – which also saw first-round DT Vernon Butler join the rotation. Three of Gettleman's four remaining picks were used on cornerbacks (and veteran Brandon Boykin was signed), so there could be a committee vying for Norman's post. WR Kelvin Benjamin (ACL) should be ready to go.\n\nBroncos, Rams two of the teams that should get instant impact from NFL draft\n\n21. New Orleans Saints: A defense that allowed a league-high 476 points and league-record 45 TD passes welcomes veteran MLB James Laurinaitis and DT Nick Fairley along with a first rounder (DT Sheldon Rankins) and a second rounder (S Vonn Bell). And though QB Drew Brees lost trusted targets Jimmy Graham and Marques Colston over the last year, GM Mickey Loomis signed a talented tight end (Coby Fleener) and drafted a large wideout (6-3, 212-pound Michael Thomas) in Round 2.\n\n22. Chicago Bears: A defense that made great strides in 2015 under its new 3-4 alignment should further benefit with rookies Leonard Floyd and Jonathan Bullard joining the front seven. However an offense that has a hole at left tackle and bid adieu to RB Matt Forte and coordinator Adam Gase could suffer a significant setback.\n\n23. New York Giants: Free-agent spending sprees rarely yield the desired results, at least immediately, but embattled GM Jerry Reese had little choice other than to drop $200 million on DEs Jason Pierre-Paul and Olivier Vernon, DT Damon Harrison and CB Janoris Jenkins to try and fix the NFL's worst defense. Reese's draft is promising, and CB Eli Apple and WR Sterling Shepard may contribute heavily as rookies.\n\n24. Detroit Lions: It's hard to be optimistic when your best player retires at age 30. However the loss of WR Calvin Johnson may be a blessing in disguise for a team that became way too reliant on the passing game and really needed the infusion of cap space. New GM Bob Quinn earmarked four of his first five draft picks on linemen and could score big on T Taylor Decker and DT A'Shawn Robinson. Newly-signed WR Marvin Jones won't replace Megatron but costs a lot less.\n\n25. Cleveland Browns: Until they've finished painting the bigger picture with their analytics brush years from now, it's hard to make a fair evaluation. Aside from signing QB Robert Griffin III, the Browns were panned for their inactivity during free agency. However $40 million-plus in cap space gets pushed into the future, and several good compensatory picks will be forthcoming next year as a result. The draft brought highly-productive college players (WRs Corey Coleman and Jordan Payton and DEs Emmanuel Ogbah and Carl Nassib among them) but, more importantly, the front office's manipulation of the board netted future first- and second-round selections.\n\nProjected Week 1 starters for teams who made off-season quarterback moves\n\n26. Philadelphia Eagles: They swept away much of the Chip Kelly past – goodbye, DeMarco Murray, Byron Maxwell and Kiko Alonso – but bet heavily on the future, surrendering a future first and second rounder in hopes that QB Carson Wentz is the ideal fit for new coach Doug Pederson's system. Of course prior to maneuvering his way up the draft board for Wentz, executive vice president of football operations Howie Roseman had already guaranteed nearly $35 million to free agent QBs Chase Daniel and Sam Bradford. Despite a few other nice additions, G Brandon Brooks and S Rodney McLeod among them, how the quarterback situation unfolds (and whether something can be recouped in a future trade of Bradford) will define an extremely risky strategy in Philly.\n\n27. San Diego Chargers: They spent on role players – WR Travis Benjamin, CB Casey Hayward and DL Brandon Mebane. They kicked Pro Bowl S Eric Weddle to the curb. They're gambling that the O-line didn't need anything but time to heal. And most of the draft picks, aside from pass rusher Joey Bosa, might be a year or two away.\n\n28. Seattle Seahawks: This season could reveal how sustainable they are as an NFC juggernaut. Maybe Thomas Rawls and a committee of backs can offset the retirement of Marshawn Lynch. The remainder of an offensive line that was crucial to the 2013 title team was raided in free agency, but maybe assistant Tom Cable can cobble together an effective group with the additions of rookies Germain Ifedi (first round) and Rees Odhiambo (third round). Maybe the defense won't miss LB Bruce Irvin and DT Brandon Mebane. A lot of maybes to overcome in a highly competitive division.\n\n29. New York Jets: A team that fell a tiebreaker shy of the playoffs remains in weeks-long limbo amid the contractual standoff with unsigned QB Ryan Fitzpatrick. The current options under center are Geno Smith, who lost the locker room and his starting job last year; second-rounder Christian Hackenberg, who is nowhere near ready to play; and Bryce Petty, who didn't take a snap as a rookie. The Fitzpatrick showdown also doesn't give GM Mike Maccagnan much opportunity to hammer out an extension for franchise-tagged DE Muhammad Wilkerson. But the roster looks formidable otherwise with Matt Forte a potential upgrade at running back, new LT Ryan Clady a capable replacement for retired D'Brickashaw Ferguson and rangy first-round LB Darron Lee a likely Day 1 starter.\n\n30. San Francisco 49ers: They're banking that Chip Kelly 2.0 is a better coach than the one the Eagles couldn't wait to divorce. But it won't be easy for Kelly to revive an offense that scored the fewest points in the league after GM Trent Baalke sat on $50 million in cap space added little firepower in the draft. And can the strained marriage with QB Colin Kaepernick survive, much less thrive again, after the team agreed to trade him to the Broncos?\n\n31. New England Patriots: A somewhat eventful offseason that included the retirement of LB Jerod Mayo, trade of DE Chandler Jones, arrival of replacement Chris Long and a two-year extension for Tom Brady was upended when the quarterback's four-game Deflategate suspension was reinstated, thus reinstating a summer-long distraction.\n\n32. Denver Broncos: After investing four years of development into QB Brock Osweiler, losing him to Houston clearly wasn't part of GM John Elway's master plan. That forced the acquisition of franchise QB flameout Mark Sanchez and a Round 1 gambit on Paxton Lynch, who typifies today's boom-or-bust quarterback prospects. Free agent departures Malik Jackson and Danny Trevathan will be missed by the champs' No. 1 defense, and Super Bowl MVP Von Miller still needs a long-term deal despite getting the franchise tag.\n\n***\n\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.\n\nPHOTOS: First-round draft picks
Cara Kelly\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCan there be any secrets left after two reality shows, countless interviews, magazine covers and an adult life spent entirely in the spotlight?\n\nI sometimes worry that so much of my life is in the public eye now that there is nothing left of me in private, Caitlyn Jenner, 67, writes in her new memoir, The Secrets of My Life (Grand Central). But somehow, even after exclusives with People and an interview with Diane Sawyer to mark the two-year anniversary of the last sit-down with Bruce Jenner, there's always more to tell.\n\nThe book, written with Buzz Bissinger, who penned the story Call Me Caitlyn for Vanity Fair in 2015, flips back and forth between present day and Jenner's past, culminating with the news that the former Olympian has successfully completed gender confirmation surgery.\n\nSecrets is revelatory for the depth with which Jenner details the staggering challenges of finding her true self, and the repercussions of hiding her gender dysphoria. She describes the once elaborate ritual of dressing as a woman before transitioning, a private act done in hotel rooms while on the road for speaking engagements, a turn around the hotel lobby or short car ride the only reward after an hour-long effort with fake eyelashes and Krazy Glue. And the excruciating process of electrolysis for facial hair, explained as torture she felt she deserved.\n\nBut the most unexpected parts involve the K-troop, as Jenner calls the Kardashians, particularly the world's most famous momager. Several passages seem to contradict how much Kris Jenner has said she knew about then-husband Bruce's dysphoria, and indicates their marriage was one of mutual benefit.\n\nLove is at the crux of us, Jenner writes. But I believe, and this is my opinion and my opinion only, we both want something from each other.\n\nTo be fair, who doesn't want something when entering marriage, if simply companionship? Jenner says that for Kris, their union was a giant flipping of the bird to ex-husband Robert and a jump-start to the empire she has since built, Jenner's famous name serving as the kindling. For Jenner, Kris restored the image of Bruce after she nearly transitioned but ultimately decided not to in the late '80s.\n\nUnlike with her first two wives, Chrystie Jenner and Linda Thompson, Jenner writes that she was forthcoming with Kris from the beginning of their 23-year marriage, telling Kris that she had been a woman inside her whole life. So the stunned reaction from her now ex-wife seen on Keeping Up With the Kardashians seemed a little puzzling then and seems puzzling now.\n\nJenner offers as further evidence that she had developed size 36B breasts after undergoing hormone therapy for 4½ years, stopping only six months before meeting Kris. She had her breasts removed after daughters Kendall and Kylie were born, births she calls incredible because the couple worried they wouldn't be able to have children after Jenner's hormone therapy.\n\nSome things remain private, however. Jenner writes that it is the first and last time she'll ever speak of Final Surgery. Not every secret needs to be tabloid fodder, even for an honorary Kardashian.
Gabe Lacques\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nPORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. – Kevin Kiermaier is a two-time Gold Glove winner who at times defies gravity and outruns scorching line drives to make highlight-reel catches for the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nBut perhaps nothing he's done on the baseball field required the precision it took to pull off an engagement that took one of Central Florida's most eligible bachelors off the market.\n\nA piece of plywood, a willing future sister- and mother-in-law and even the Golden State Warriors all played key roles in Kiermaier's conspiracy to beat the calendar and successfully request Marisa Moralobo's hand in marriage.\n\nMLB win totals: How we see the 2017 season unfolding\n\nLife is good for me right now, said Kiermaier, 26, who reported to camp on Tuesday for a season in which he's expected to be the Rays' full-time No. 1 or 2 hitter. A very eventful off-season.\n\nTo say the least. Kiermaier purchased his first home, and then went about the far more arduous task of ensuring it would have a second permanent residence.\n\nKiermaier and Moralobo's romance came to light about a year ago. This winter, he was inspired to propose, and had a date in mind well before spring training.\n\nOne problem: While vacationing in Montana with his brothers, Kiermaier's older brother Dan – who works as a groundskeeper at Wrigley Field - let it be known he was going to propose to his girlfriend in February.\n\nOnce he said that I said, 'You know what? I'm not going to steal his shine,' Kiermaier said.\n\nSo he let the dust settle, as he put it, for a couple of weeks. Unfortunately, baseball season waits for no man, and Kiermaier – a Type A personality if there ever was one – wanted to have his biggest personal transaction taken care of before it was time to report.\n\nSo it had to be last Saturday, which happened to be his future mother-in-law's birthday.\n\nThey went to dinner and then Kiermaier went to work. Moralobo's younger sister served as videographer. Her mother went to great pains to decorate her backyard to Marisa's exacting specifications.\n\nA family friend had carved out a piece of plywood with the words MARRY ME painted on them, and it fit just so in a living room window.\n\nFortunately, there was a compelling televised sporting event to serve as distraction. Kiermaier beckoned Moralobo – who played collegiate volleyball at Florida's Warner University - into the living room to catch the Warriors-Oklahoma City Thunder game.\n\nI went out in the backyard, says Kiermaier, and her mom comes in and says, 'Hey Marisa, we're going to go to the backyard and eat my birthday cake.'\n\nShe walks out and it was only me.\n\nShe told me everything she wanted when it did happen, so I kept all these mental notes. So once I dropped down to one knee, Marissa was so surprised. It's a three-minute video that Marissa will never forget. It was perfect.\n\nAll 30 MLB teams' 2017 starting rotations, ranked\n\nKiermaier insists he won't bring up his proposal again after Tuesday; he's going full throttle into what he hopes is a huge 2017 season.\n\nAfter winning his first Gold Glove in 2016, Kiermaier suffered a broken hand attempting – what else? – a diving catch on May 21. He missed seven weeks, which didn't sink his Gold Glove candidacy but did curtail his offensive development.\n\nStill, he made strides last year, upping his on-base percentage from .298 to .331 as he aims to become a more well-rounded player.\n\nI want to maintain a level of consistency myself, he said. I feel like when I'm going good, our team does very well. You can say that about a lot of guys on our team. But I want to be available each and every day, and try to create havoc any way I can.\n\nHe says his body feels great, and it seems abundantly clear his active winter has his mind and heart in the right place, as well.\n\nI couldn't have had a better off-season, he said. This one truly topped all.\n\nGallery: Best pictures from Spring Training
Bartholomew Sullivan, USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Rep. Kurt Schrader missed the opening session of the 115th Congress on Tuesday — and six roll call votes — because he is on his honeymoon, his spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.\n\nThe Democratic congressman was elected to his fifth term in November representing Oregon's 5th District. On Tuesday, House records indicated he didn't answer the opening quorum call and was listed as not voting for the Speaker of the House, the first procedural vote of a new, two-year Congress.\n\nHe wasn't listed as voting or not voting on the four subsequent roll call votes because, technically, he is not a member of the new Congress until he is officially sworn in. That's expected to happen next Tuesday, said his spokeswoman Carlee Griffeth.\n\nInitially, Griffeth provided no additional detail, including the new wife's name or the couple's whereabouts.\n\nHe does not discuss his family publicly, Griffeth said in an email message.\n\nLater, she said her name is Susan Mora, an executive with Pepco. Records indicate Mora has been director of federal affairs for Pepco Holdings, the huge energy provider owned by Exelon Corp. She was on the 2014 committee for Will on the Hill, the annual fundraiser for the Shakespeare Theatre Company that uses members of Congress and other high-profile Washingtonians as actors.\n\nSchrader's chief of staff, Paul Gage, said the marriage took place on New Year's Eve in Maryland and the newlyweds are honeymooning out of the country, but he wouldn't say where. Gage said the two have known each other a few years and that Mora is no longer a lobbyist but has an executive role with the company.\n\nSchrader was the only member of the 435-member body not sworn in on Tuesday.\n\nSchrader did inform House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as a courtesy that he would be absent for the opening days of the new Congress, said Pelosi's spokeswoman, Caroline Behringer.\n\nSchrader, 65, was divorced from his wife of 35 years, former Oregon state senator and Clackamas County Commissioner Martha Schrader, in 2011.
Carolyn Beeler\n\nPRI.org\n\nInternational student enrollment in graduate science and engineering programs in the US dropped in 2017 after several years of increases.\n\nScience and engineering fields saw a 6% decrease in international graduate students from the fall of 2016 to the fall of 2017, and almost all of that decrease was concentrated in two fields: computer science and engineering.\n\nThis follows steady increases from 2005 to 2015 and comes at a time when demand for tech workers outstrips supply — and foreign-born students are increasingly filling a gap left by declining numbers of American citizens studying science and technology at the graduate level.\n\nThe biggest drop came from Indian students, whose numbers fell by 19% in 2017. Saudi Arabia, Iran and South Korea also sent fewer students in 2017.\n\nThe figures were released today in the 2018 Science and Engineering Indicators report from the National Science Foundation's governing body, the National Science Board.\n\nIn the U.S., (international students) are tremendously important, said Geraldine Richmond, a member of the National Science Board and chemistry professor at the University of Oregon. Over 50% of our graduate students in technical areas are from outside the country.\n\nThe number of U.S.-born students in STEM graduate programs started declining in 2008, and international students have been important in keeping program numbers up, Richmond said.\n\nWe have a research engine that needs to be fueled, and that fuel is really our graduate students, Richmond said. So, as we continue to try to attract the best and brightest in our country, we also seek to attract the best and brightest from these other countries.\n\nGraduate programs also feed, in part, into hubs like Silicon Valley, where more than half of tech workers are foreign-born.\n\nThere is an insatiable demand. There's more jobs than we can fill with the current slate of talent, said Michael Morell, a founder of the tech recruiting firm Riveria Partners.\n\nThe way we talk about it internally is, if you are an average or above-average engineer with core skills as a computer scientist, that is probably a negative unemployment rate.\n\nThe new National Science Board report doesn't try to explain why enrollment numbers dropped in 2017.\n\nGeraldine Richmond said it will be important to see if this one-year dip turns into a trend. She points to the relatively high costs of coming to the U.S. for graduate school, as well as increasing competition from China, as possible contributing factors.\n\nA survey last year by the American Association of College Registrar and Admissions Officers raised similar concerns about international students overall.\n\nStudents from India concerned about job prospects, safety\n\nThe concerns of Indian students planning to attend graduate school in the next few years suggest this dip might not be a one-year aberration.\n\nSeveral students interviewed by PRI.org worried that with changing U.S. immigration policies under President Trump's administration, they may not be able to get jobs after graduation, which would saddle them with the debt of an American degree but provide few of the benefits. Some worried about their personal safety as cases of anti-immigrant violence make news around the world. Others were turned off simply by the high cost of pursuing a degree in the US.\n\nMany are looking to Canada, Australia, Germany and the U.K. as possible destinations for graduate school instead of the U.S.\n\nOne of those students is Sai Shouri, a senior studying IT at an engineering college in Hyderabad, India. When he was a kid, relatives who lived in the U.S. would come back to India for visits and tell him about the job opportunities and comfortable lifestyle that came with living in the US.\n\nSince my childhood, I had dreams of the U.S., studying in the U.S. as well as getting settled in the U.S., Shouri said.\n\nFour years ago, he started an undergraduate degree in IT specifically so he'd be competitive for a computer science master's program in the U.S. But his plans changed in a single moment in the fall of 2016.\n\nThat moment was when Trump was elected, Shouri said.\n\nShouri had followed Trump's America-first campaign platform and his promises to restrict immigration to increase job opportunities for citizens.\n\nWe used to believe that, Shouri said. If he really gets to be the president of the United States of America, then we might have a tougher situation.\n\nHe thought landing a job might be harder, and after hearing about anti-immigrant violence in the US, like how two Indian men were shot in a Kansas City bar last February, he feared for his safety.\n\nWhat if I get attacked by some random guy? Shouri worried.\n\nIt was enough for Shouri to ditch his decade-old dream to study in the United States.\n\n(I was) shattered for some time, for a couple of days I was, like, totally aimless.\n\nCanada's immigrant-friendly reputation attractive to students\n\nInternational enrollment trends in Australia and Canada are moving in the opposite direction. International students in Australian colleges and universities were up 15% from March 2016 to March 2017.\n\nCanada also saw increases.\n\nThis is a moment for Canada to shine, said Paul Davidson, president of Universities Canada, which represents nearly 100 institutions across the country.\n\nWe have seen an 11% increase in international enrollment at Canadian universities over the last year, Davidson said.\n\nHe first started seeing increases of interest in Canadian universities after Brexit. Then came Trump's January 2017 travel ban.\n\nThe weekend that that happened, my iPhone was absolutely dancing across the table, because the world wants to find an alternative, Davidson said.\n\nThat Canadian alternative caught Shouri's eye when researching graduate school options outside the U.S. after Trump's election.\n\nI was reading about that country, and I fell in love, Shouri said.\n\nShouri started chatting online with Canadians and found them welcoming.\n\nThey don't mind which country you're from, what's your financial status, how you look, how you talk, they don't care about any of those things, Shouri said.\n\nThat rosy view of Canada was reinforced by what Shouri saw on the news.\n\nYou can see the prime minister (Justin Trudeau), how he's accepting the Syrian refugees, going to the airport, receiving them one by one, hugging each of them, Shouri said. And you can see Mr. Trump. And you can see a contrast between them.\n\nShouri has applied to five computer science programs in Canada and hopes to start at one of them in September.\n\nHe still wants to work at a big tech company like Google — just in their Canadian office.\n\nAnd he hopes that one day he'll return home to Hyderabad with stories of how great his new home is. It just probably won't be in the U.S.\n\nThis article originally appeared on PRI.org.

Charles Curtis\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNBA fans everywhere should be celebrating the DeMarcus Cousins trade from the hapless Sacramento Kings to the suddenly-intriguing New Orleans Pelicans, if they aren't already.\n\nIt means two very, very important things: First, we finally - finally!! - get to see Anthony Davis play alongside a fellow superstar, a mouthwatering proposition given what the 23-year-old has already done this year with little help around around him. Back in October, when Davis put up the season's most insane statline (50 points, 16 rebounds, 5 assists, 7 steals, 4 blocks) in a loss to the Denver Nuggets, we had this to say:\n\nThe Pelicans need to figure out how to turn the roster into a contender fast, because a healthy Davis could be entering what could be a scary-good prime. … So, please, Pelicans front office: Make something happen soon. Don't let Davis's prodigious talent go to waste.\n\nThanks for listening, Pels!\n\nYou can't just double both Davis and Cousins, which means Boogie and The Brow (which is also a terrific pairing of nicknames and perhaps the name of a 1970s cop show) will have ample opportunities to play superstar from game to game. The Captain Obvious take is: Opponents are going to have a rough time defending that frontcourt, even if it takes a while to figure out how to make both of them work together.\n\nWe also get to celebrate a second chance for Cousins, whose behavior in Sacramento was a dark cloud over one of the NBA's biggest talents. Maybe being closer to his childhood home in Alabama and playing for a happier franchise will keep his temper - and the whistles for technical fouls - at bay.\n\nNow, for the bad news: The Kings are very much on the losing end of this one.\n\nCousins and Omri Casspi turn into Buddy Hield, Tyreke Evans, Langston Galloway, a 2017 first-rounder along with second-round pick. For someone with as much talent as Cousins, that's a poor return.\n\nHield appeared to have a big ceiling when he was drafted 6th overall in last year's draft, but will he blossom into a superstar to match Cousins? At the moment, it certainly doesn't look that way. And if the Kings intend on blowing it all up and restarting the franchise, can't they get more for a big name? Perhaps some unprotected first-rounders?\n\nEven if this was the best the Kings were going to get with other NBA front offices knowing full well the marriage of the mercurial Cousins and Sacramento was on its way to a divorce, this trade is a failure, and that's true whether Hield blows up or not.\n\nIt's another sad day in a series of them for Kings fans.
The Lodge is an exceptionally creepy horror film – and a really disturbing one.\n\nMaybe that shouldn't be a surprise, given that it is directed by Severin Fiala and Veronika Franz. Did you see Goodnight Mommy? If so, the mere mention of the title probably elicits shudders. They're really good at making you feel really bad, or at least really uncomfortable.\n\nIf anything, they've upped the ante with The Lodge (★★★½ out of five; rated R; expanding nationwide Friday), a psychologically (and sometimes physically) brutal film about grief, faith, escaping your past – you know, the usual horror fare. Only it's really well-rendered in Fiala and Franz's hands. Plus the cast is terrific, in particular Riley Keough in a tricky role as Grace, a woman about to marry a man with two children. Aidan (Jaden Martell) and Mia (Lia McHugh) want nothing to do with her. They prefer their mom, Laura (Alicia Silverstone), who is struggling with impending divorce from their father, Richard (Richard Armitage).\n\nPart of this is the expected trauma of a cratering marriage. Part of it is Grace's troubled past. (You left Mom for a psychopath is probably not something Richard enjoys hearing.)\n\nReview:Grizzled Harrison Ford works but the digital dogs don't in 'Call of the Wild'\n\n'Sonic the Hedgehog':Not the 'horror' of first trailer, but still 'work in progress'\n\nMonths after a tragedy, Richard decides it would be a great idea for the kids to spend the Christmas holidays with Grace, who they truly can't stand. The idea is Richard will drive them to the family's remote cabin in the middle of snowy nowhere, isolated, for a little bonding. There's some hemming and hawing and complaining, but they wind up making the trip. Soon, however, Richard is called back to the city for work.\n\nSo now we've got three people who don't want to be there, and definitely don't want to be with each other, stuck in a cabin with a dangerous blizzard raging outside.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nMore than you might think, though probably not what you would think.\n\nAt first, the kids' interactions with Grace could give the weather outside a run for its money in terms of frostiness. But gradually they come around, bit by bit. Then strange things begin happening. The power goes out. The generator won't work. The decorations disappear. So does the food.\n\nWhy? Well, there's your movie. The stress was already at a breaking point. Where can it go from there?\n\nBeyond.\n\nThere are touches of The Shining here that will make themselves obvious, and Hereditary even more so. But there are also traces of Sinister, a genuinely disturbing movie (not that the other two aren't) that reveal themselves in subtler ways – ways that, like the rest of the details, you'll have to discover for yourself. Fiala and Franz don't overdo the nods. They simply make them work in service of their own film.\n\nMartell, who played Bill in the It movies, gives a layered performance as a boy channeling his grief and anger in surprising ways. McHugh is particularly affecting as a young girl in pain; you really believe her struggles and anguish.\n\nBut it all falls ultimately to Keough, who is outstanding at portraying the duality of a character, a duality the story demands. As with their previous films, Fiala and Franz toy with the truth, and keep you guessing as to what's real and what isn't. Keough plays this masterfully. You will question reality throughout, particularly in the last act. The answers The Lodge provides will remain with you long afterwards.
Mary Bowerman\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nWhen it comes to getting over your ex, the best strategy may be 'fake it until you make it, according to a new study.\n\nA study published in the Journal of Neuroscience found that doing something that makes you feel like you are getting over your ex, may help mend your broken heart.\n\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder researchers measured the placebo effect on a group of 40 volunteers who had recently been through unwanted romantic breakups. Some studies have shown that placebos, or fake treatments like sugar pills, can have some positive effect on symptoms, but this is the first time a study has tried to measure a placebo's impact on emotional pain from a breakup, according to the researchers.\n\nIn our study, we found a placebo can have quite strong effects on reducing the intensity of social pain, Leonie Koban, an author of the study and postdoctoral research associate at the University of Colorado Boulder said in a statement.\n\nFor the study, 40 volunteers were asked to bring a photo of their former partner and a friend.\n\nThe participants were placed inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine and shown a picture of their ex while being asked to recall the breakup, followed by a picture of their friend. They were also subjected a hot stimulus on their arm, meant to simulate physical pain.\n\nRegions of the brain that lit up during physical pain were similar to those that lit up when the participants experienced emotional pain, or saw the photo of their ex.\n\nTor Wager, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at CU-Boulder, said in a statement that the pain felt after a breakup is real – neurochemically real.\n\nFor the second part of the study, half of the subjects were given a powerful analgesic effective in reducing emotional pain while the other half were told it was just nasal spray.\n\nWhen the subjects were placed back in the machine and again put through the same routine, the group given the pain-reduction nasal spray, reported less physical pain, felt better emotionally, and their brain did not respond the same way it had for the first test.\n\nAn area of the brain associated with controlling emotions increased sharply, and decreased in areas associated with rejection, according to the study. Brain activity also increased in an area of the brain called the periaqueductal gray, or PAG, which controls painkilling chemicals, or opioids, and neurotransmitters like dopamine.\n\nThe authors say the study shows how emotional pain occurs in the brain, and further illustrates the power of expectations.\n\nJust the fact that you are doing something for yourself and engaging in something that gives you hope may have an impact, said Wager. In some cases, the actual chemical in the drug may matter less than we once thought.\n\nFollow Mary Bowerman on Twitter: @MaryBowerman
A 5-year-old Texas girl is getting so much love from her dads, who aren't in a same-sex relationship by the way.\n\nThe girl, who goes by Princess Willow, was on her way to a father-daughter dance when her mom, Sarah Megnon, snapped a photo of her being kissed on each cheek by her dad, David Lewis, and her soon-to-be stepfather, Dylan Lenox.\n\nLewis, Megnon's ex-husband, and Lenox, her fiance, came together for a touching photo to show how they're working out the whole blended-family thing.

Not only did I gain a daughter, I gained a brother and a best friend.\n\nThe fiance went on to add that as a family, they've decided to eschew the norm that parents are supposed to have hatred and bitterness toward their exes.\n\nWhen we care more about our children (on both sides of the party) than the way society has taught us to be towards (ex's/baby mommas/daddys) then walls will fall, life will be free of hatred and remorse, and our children will conquer the foolish norms that media has shoved in our faces, Lenox continued.\n\nThe post has since gone viral, having been shared 128,000 times at the time of writing and the comments were nothing short of supportive.\n\nWow this is truly amazing for once adults that put their daughter first and make it about her and not themselves.

Peter Dunn\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nDear Pete,\n\nI'm worried about what will happen to my retirement income when my husband dies. I'm 52 years old, and he's 62. He's made much more money than me for years, and I personally don't have many assets. He plans on retiring sometime in the next year, and he wants me to retire too. We won't have a pension, and he barely has enough to retire, but he's going to do it anyway. This works fine until he dies, because he doesn't have life insurance and he says he's leaving some of his accounts to his adult children. What should I do?\n\nMarie\n\nScottsdale, Arizona\n\nThis is a problem. Not a cross this 't' and dot that 'i' problem but a very big problem. Retirement planning is difficult enough when both people in a marriage are the same age, but when there's a sizeable age gap the problem gets especially complicated.\n\nStatistically speaking, you will likely outlive your husband. And based on your age difference, you may be without him for well over a decade.\n\nIn a perfect world, you take your concern to your husband, he calls his life insurance agent and buys a giant life insurance policy on himself that will help create an income stream for you at his death.\n\nSave better, spend better:All the money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here\n\nMacy's closings:Macy's is closing 125 stores with the first locations closing soon: Is your location on the map?\n\nFalling short:28% of Americans in their 60s are extremely short on retirement savings\n\nBut I've done this long enough to know if that was in his wheelhouse of prudence, he would have already done it. Besides, the premiums for the policy would likely be cost-prohibitive at this point, especially if he's barely able to retire.\n\nThe last thing you need is a pep talk from me about the importance of a woman taking control of her finances and sticking up for herself, but you're about to get just that.\n\nAs much as you want to spend time together in an idyllic retirement, I highly recommend turning your focus to building your own financial plan. This plan means you need to keep working and make financial decisions based on your own personal retirement readiness. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this.\n\nIf you don't take control of this situation, you will undoubtedly find yourself living a financial nightmare. Without proper planning, any person in a committed relationship would suffer the same fate.\n\nWhether your husband secures life insurance or not, you should not personally retire when he does. You should view the next 15 years or so as your opportunity to create the sustainable stability you've always deserved.\n\nSpecifically, you should maximize your income and then save as much of it as possible in a company-sponsored retirement plan. In fact, you should focus on breaking your own personal dependency on your husband's financial resources, all the while heavily weighing-in on decisions involving those resources.\n\nMaximizing your income will allow you to maximize your available Social Security benefit, which will be key to creating your own sustainable income strategy. Based on your situation, you should likely wait as long as possible to tap this income stream.\n\nSince I'm recommending something rather intense, it's worth exploring the alternative.\n\nThe alternative is for you to do nothing. But here's how that ends. Upon retiring at age 52, you will enjoy the next several years of retirement until reality hits. When a person barely retires, there are very real consequences.\n\nIs $1 million enough for retirement?:Here's how to find out\n\nThey will spend-down their assets and time becomes their worst enemy. The longer they live, the worse it gets. Your age gap will exacerbate this problem, and you will get left holding the bag. But unfortunately, the bag won't have any money in it.\n\nRetiring now is akin to buying a baby alligator and keeping it in your bathtub. Sure it's cute, but don't do it.\n\nI'm so sorry you're in this financial quagmire. But fortunately you have the power to fix it.\n\nPeter Dunn is an author, speaker and radio host, and he has a free podcast: Million Dollar Plan. Have a question for Pete the Planner?

Savannah Guthrie is back.\n\nThe Today show host, 48, returned Monday morning to her TV gig after a couple of months in and out of the studio with an eye injury. Guthrie is officially back in action after she spent the holidays at home recovering from retina surgery.\n\nWhen I say good to see you, I really mean it, Guthrie addressed viewers in the show's opening.\n\nCo-host Hoda Kotb concurred: It feels so good to have you sitting right here.\n\nGuthrie later joked she was finally seeing 2020 in her first show in the new year with newly cleared vision. She had been in and out of the Today show since November, after her son, Charley, accidentally threw a toy train at her eye.\n\nPreviously:Savannah Guthrie likely to return to 'Today' after the holidays: I don't have my vision back yet\n\nThe host kicked off her return with a bang: She sat down in a pre-taped interview with Tom Hanks, who was honored Sunday night at the Golden Globes with the Cecile B. DeMille award. He opened up about his family life and legacy as Hollywood's nice guy.\n\nNo. 1: I hope I'm not done, Hanks began, reflecting on his career highlights. He called acting the greatest luck of the draw I ever had.\n\nHe also praised his wife, actress and singer Rita Wilson. The couple, parents to 29-year-old Chet and 24-year-old Truman Hanks, is gearing up to celebrate their 32nd anniversary this year. Hanks also has two children from his previous marriage to late actress Samantha Lewes: Colin, 42, and Elizabeth, 37.\n\nWe dig each other, I must say, Hanks said of Wilson. There was a moment long ago (with her) where I thought, 'You can actually feel like this?'\n\nGolden Globes 2020:Ricky Gervais bores, Tom Hanks soars and an honest review of the rest\n\nWhat advice would the actor give his younger self? Calm down. Both the good and bad feelings about success will fade.\n\nThe gutsiest thing sometimes is to say no to something, he said, adding it can be tough when a project offers a lot of money, you might get to travel somewhere; ... they might infantilize you the way they sometimes do with actors. ... But if it doesn't break your heart, if it doesn't make you think about something bigger, you have to say no. That's hard to do sometimes.\n\nGuthrie wondered how Hanks, already a Hollywood legend, wants to be remembered at the end of his life. Known to fans as America's dad, Hanks said he liked the idea of people thinking of him as kind. But he isn't a big fan of the word nice.\n\nYou know what nice is? Nice is the meal you had at not a bad restaurant, but not a great restaurant, he said with a laugh. No, I want something better than that. So maybe that's the epitaph: 'He was fantastic.'
Martin Rogers\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nDavid Beckham became one of the world's most famous sports figures thanks to a combination of looks, talent, circumstance, marriage — and the accompanying glut of media attention that those things brought.\n\nOver the past week, however, the English soccer icon's popularity has taken a monumental hit, following the release of a damning collection of alleged personal emails between him and his longtime public relations assistant.\n\nBeckham, 41, retired in 2013 yet has remained in the spotlight, modeling for fashion companies, endorsing high-end products around the world, dabbling in the acquisition of a Major League Soccer franchise in Miami and plowing his time into charitable causes with UNICEF.\n\nIt all kept him relevant and beloved, especially in his homeland. Brits saw him as a stand-up guy and seemingly the perfect antithesis of the spoiled, money-hungry soccer player.\n\nMORE SOCCER COVERAGE:\n\nStruggling Leicester earns respite by winning FA Cup replay\n\nSpanish clubs spend only 18M euros in transfer window\n\nUntil last week.\n\nThat was when Football Leaks, soccer's version of the secret-spilling WikiLeaks, released a series of emails allegedly involving Beckham, many exchanged between the star and his PR man and friend Simon Oliveira.\n\nThey were not flattering. The messages included a rant in which Beckham complained of being snubbed in Britain's New Year's Honours list instead of being knighted and given the title Sir David.\n\nIn another alleged email from Beckham, he asks UNICEF to pay him more than $7,000 for a business class flight to a charity event in Asia, even though he was already catching a ride with one of his sponsors.\n\nAmong other details in the emails in question, it is suggested that Beckham publicly backed the Remain campaign in last year's Brexit vote that saw the United Kingdom split with the European Union, in order to curry favor with the establishment.\n\nA further claim that Oliveira asked popular British chat show host Jonathan Ross to raise the prospect of Beckham being knighted during Beckham's appearance on Ross' program. David is up for it, Oliveira is said to have written.\n\nAttempting to sway the honors committee, which works on behalf of the Queen, is highly frowned upon in Britain and the whole saga has left both the public and some of Beckham's millions of fans around the world wondering what to think.\n\nNo brand as powerful as his is built and cultivated without hard work, yet there always seemed to be a natural ease about Beckham, a genuine feel about his working-class upbringing before his talent brought him soccer fame and a marriage to former Spice Girl Victoria Posh Spice Adams.\n\nPerhaps the most telling part has been the response, which is either a master class in crisis management or a dirty second chapter to a sorry scenario. Immediately Beckham's publicity machine has whirred into action.\n\nMitigating stories have begun to spring up in the English news media. The emails had been doctored, it is claimed, though no details have been provided. Oliveira did not respond to requests for comment from USA TODAY Sports on Wednesday.\n\nThere was a blackmail plot against Oliveira's company, several other stories have claimed. The emails, apparently, were taken out of context. He didn't even care if he got a knighthood, reported another publication. UNICEF put out a press release defending him. And so on.\n\nIt is a typical approach. Respond quickly and loudly and, in some cases, with threats of legal action against your accuser. It is intended to have the effect of muddying the waters, throwing enough doubts on the accusations that people don't know what to believe. Alternative facts, if you like. Or, if not, then certainly an alternative narrative.\n\nIn Beckham's case, it is not a new thing. The former midfielder is pleasant company and an engaging man, with an agreeable personality and an underrated sense of humor.\n\nBut whether through his design or that of others, significant parts of his life and career have been cloaked in spin. Back when he signed for the Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007, a move that was supposed to revolutionize American soccer, a press release was concocted claiming the deal was worth $250 million over five years. The biggest contract in soccer history!\n\nExcept that it wasn't. MLS and Galaxy officials later said the trumped-up figure was insisted upon by Beckham's then-management company. His salary, over five years, was actually a touch over $30 million, with some add-ons included.\n\nHowever, the $250 million figure stuck, and still often gets quoted in reference to his time in America.\n\nWhen Beckham engineered a temporary loan to Italian club AC Milan in 2008, it incited the frustration of Galaxy fans who had barely seen him in any meaningful action due to injuries. At the time, Oliveira angrily called up reporters who dared to suggest the move was in poor taste given that he had produced so little for L.A.\n\nPeople are a whole lot more skeptical now. It is a new time for Beckham and the old rules might not work anymore. The days of his every move being taken at face value are over. Now every social media message, even those with his children over the past few years, will be scrutinized to see if it is part of some hidden agenda.\n\nThe PR effort aimed at remedying the email situation has caused some confusion but hasn't repaired Beckham's reputation, just created more doubt.\n\nThere is only one thing that everyone seems to agree on coming out of this. Whether he wants one or not, Beckham won't be getting a knighthood now.
Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — A judge on Thursday ordered Robin Thicke to have only monitored visits with his 6-year-old son and stay away from his ex-wife, actress Paula Patton, after she accused the singer of emotionally abusing them during an ongoing custody dispute.\n\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Colin Leis issued the temporary restraining order after Patton also accused the singer of physically abusing her during their marriage, which ended in March 2015. She also said the Blurred Lines singer has traumatized her and her son by demanding visitation and refusing to leave her mother's home last week.\n\nThicke's attorney Larry Ginsberg wrote in a court filing opposing the restraining order that there was no basis to issue it and called it a retaliatory move by Patton after she was denied sole custody earlier this month.\n\nIn a statement, Angela Pierce Di Donato, another attorney working for Thicke, told People, She is attempting to throw anything at him to hurt him, but Robin's focus is their son.\n\nEmails to Ginsberg and Thicke's publicist were not returned Thursday afternoon.\n\nPatton's sworn declaration includes several allegations that Thicke was abusive during their marriage and pushed her to the ground and kicked her during a fight in April 2013. She also accused him of numerous infidelities during their marriage and having a substance abuse problem. Her attorneys cited a California law that Thicke's behavior during their marriage made Patton currently feel a reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury to herself and the child.\n\nHer filing states that Thicke showed up at her mother's house on January 19 while their son was being interviewed by child services workers and that the singer refused to leave. After the child services workers left, Thicke banged on the door and demanded to see his son, leaving only after Patton's mother called police, Patton wrote.\n\nThis last incident with Robin was terrifying for me, Patton wrote. It was terrifying for our son.\n\nGinsberg wrote in a court filing that Thicke is seeking sole custody and accuses Patton of manipulating their son.\n\nThe couple has been embroiled in a custody dispute for weeks, and Thicke's paperwork notes that Patton had recently sought a change in custody arrangements unsuccessfully. She is trying to take a second bite at the apple, Ginsberg wrote.\n\nLeis' order, which will remain in effect until a Feb. 24 hearing, includes a finding that Thicke has a history of domestic violence and is a risk to flee with his son. The order restricts Thicke's ability to travel outside Los Angeles County with his son.\n\nThe custody battle erupted earlier this month, after child services investigators began looking into allegations that Thicke had physically abused his son. Thicke acknowledged that he spanked his son, which his attorney noted is allowed under the law, but denied the singer was abusive. Patton's petition was supported by declarations from her son's school, who asked child welfare workers to investigate.\n\nThicke's attorney has said in court filings that investigators cleared the singer of any wrongdoing.\n\nIt also comes just weeks after the death of Thicke's father, Growing Pains actor Alan Thicke.\n\nThicke, whose biggest hit was the 2013 song Blurred Lines, and Patton dated for 10 years before marrying in June 2005. She filed for divorce in October 2014, and their judgment was finalized a few months later.
Thirty-six years and one 48 Hours special later, the truth about how Natalie Wood drowned remains as elusive as ever.\n\nFor days, CBS had touted the news that the actress' widower, Robert Wagner, 87, is now considered a person of interest. But little new light was shed on the case, which the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reopened in 2011, leading to the circumstances surrounding her death being reclassified from accident to undetermined.\n\nI mean, we know now that (Wagner) was the last person to be with Natalie before she disappeared, Lt. John Corina told CBS' Erin Moriarty in the report, which aired Saturday night. Later, Corina noted, He's changed his story a little bit. His version of events just don't add up.\n\nMore:Natalie Wood's 'suspicious' death: What you need to know\n\nRelated:As Natalie Wood investigation reopens, five other Hollywood deaths still shrouded in mystery\n\nAlso:After all these years, Natalie Wood's death is still a big mystery\n\nThe glamorous, three-time Oscar nominee died in 1981 off Catalina Island, where she was spending Thanksgiving weekend aboard the yacht Splendour with her husband, her Brainstorm co-star Christopher Walken and the boat's captain. She disappeared after retiring to her room for the night, and her body was found floating in the water the next day, clad in a nightgown and a red down jacket.\n\nHighlights of the report:\n\n• The newest developments in the investigation involve unnamed witnesses who say they overheard the couple's arguments.\n\nOne person on a neighboring boat saw Wood, 43, who appeared to be drunk, quarrel with Wagner about moving the boat the night before her death; as he walked away from the fight, she fell to one knee. Boat captain Dennis Davern says she asked him to take her ashore, where she booked two hotel rooms for them and poured her heart out about the difficulties in her marriage. The next day, Davern told investigators, Wood had a change of heart; she decided to return to the boat and cook breakfast to smooth things over.\n\nTwo other witnesses say they heard Wagner and Wood arguing on the back of the boat the night she disappeared. Nobody saw anybody go in the water, Corina says. Nobody heard a splash. Nobody heard anything. They just heard an argument and then silence.\n\n• All four of the boat's occupants were so intoxicated in town the evening of Wood's death, the restaurant manager alerted the harbor master to keep an eye out for the celebrities. They're really intoxicated, Corina quotes the manager as saying. Make sure they get back to their boat OK.\n\n• Wagner wrote in his 2008 memoir, Pieces of My Heart, that he shattered a wine bottle the night of his wife's death, during an argument with Walken after Wood retired for the night. But Davern says Wagner broke the bottle because Wood was paying too much attention to Walken. He says Wagner followed Wood to her room, and a loud and physical fight ensued. When Davern knocked on the door, he says Wagner answered and told him to go away.\n\n• When Wood and the boat's dinghy went missing around midnight, Wagner wouldn't call for help, Davern says. He says the actor brought out a bottle of scotch. More than an hour later, it's time, Davern says. We have to call somebody. She's gone. Wagner sought help to search for his wife in town and was finally persuaded to call the Coast Guard.\n\n• Wood's autopsy detailed a number of bruises on her body, which would be consistent with drowning. But she looked like a victim of assault, says Det. Ralph Hernandez.\n\n• Since the investigation reopened, detectives have traveled twice to Hawaii to comb the yacht for clues, once bringing Davern along to re-enact his version of events — though Davern has changed his story over the years, sold it to tabloids and collaborated on a tell-all book. The boat is now up for sale.\n\n• Both Wagner and Walken, who detectives say isn't a person of interest in the investigation, declined to be interviewed by CBS. Investigators say Wagner hasn't spoken to them since the case was reopened. No charges have been filed, and Wagner has previously denied any involvement in his wife's death.\n\nHis representative did not immediately respond when USA TODAY reached out for comment on the report.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press
Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhat's happening in Washington today? Plenty, as usual.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi began speaking at 10:04 a.m. ET Wednesday and kept going for more than eight hours. The California Democrat said she would oppose a budget deal to avert a government shutdown, then started a talk-a-thon to protest inaction on legislation to protect DREAMers, undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States when they children. She has water to stay hydrated, but is she wearing sneakers for comfort? What if she needs to take a bathroom break? Back to that budget deal she opposes: Senate Democrats and Republicans struck a sweeping deal Wednesday to set federal government spending levels for the next two years and eliminate the stream of government shutdown threats. The bitter fight over spending wound up with a fairly simple solution by the senators: more money for everybody's priorities. Here's what is in the deal.\n\nAlso from Washington: White House staff secretary Rob Porter resigned following reports that he abused two ex-wives. One ex alleged Porter choked, punched and emotionally abused her during their five-year marriage. The other said he verbally abused her on their 2009 honeymoon and once dragged her out of the shower. Porter says the allegations are simply false, but he is stepping down once there is a successor.\n\nElon Musk sent a Tesla and a 'Starman' to space. We can't stop talking about it\n\nSpaceX launched our collective imaginations with Starman, sitting at the wheel of a red Tesla convertible. The photo of the ultra-cool dummy with Earth in the background is incredible. Starman (in a fully functioning spacesuit, no less) is now up there for hundreds of millions of years following Tuesday's launch of Falcon Heavy rocket from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. You can check out the livestream to see what he's up to now. Worth noting: The rocket's two side boosters, which each had launched missions in 2016, successfully flew back and landed at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station — meaning they can be reused, a key to making space travel more affordable.\n\n#MustRead: Two women say the Marines did nothing after they complained of sexually explicit advances by an officer\n\nTwo civilian officials with the Marine Corps say their boss, a Marine officer, repeatedly made sexually explicit advances to them at work, and their complaints to leadership were minimized, according to interviews and documents exclusively obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nDog meat, barfing, Pence and the figure skater: The Olympics so far\n\nThese stories from Pyeongchang, South Korea, have us talking today ...\n\nTrump loves a military parade\n\nPresident Trump has wanted to watch tanks and soldiers march down Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue since before his inauguration. And now he's set the wheels in motion to make it happen. The White House confirmed that Trump asked the Pentagon to start making plans for a military celebration. The president reportedly told senior military staff, I want a parade like the one in France, referring to last year's Bastille Day parade, which made a big impression on him. While critics lament the costs, logistical nightmares and a potential Napoleon in the making, the federal government has actually sponsored many military parades over the years — just not lately.
Sheila Vilvens, The Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nCINCINNATI - There's serious intent behind the laughter and smiles found at this playdate.\n\nPlaydate with the Bearcats is an event that raises money to help send children to Cincinnati Children's Hospital summer camp, held at Camp Joy in Clarksville, Ohio, for pediatric cancer and blood disease patients and survivors.\n\nThe Playdate is the major fundraising vehicle for Mitch's Mission, founded by Mitch Stone and his family.\n\nStone, an Anderson Township resident and cancer survivor, has fond memories of Camp Joy. A camper there for five years, he said kids at all stages of cancer treatment go to Camp Joy.\n\nThey can just be a kid again and do all the stuff you would do at a regular camp, he says. It's just a really neat experience. It was the highlight of my summer.\n\nLucy Yungblut shares similar camp memories. Also of Anderson Township, the now Nagel Middle School eighth-grader was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia just shy of her fifth birthday, her mom Emily Yungblut says. Two-and-a-half-months later, she was cancer free, but the journey takes about two two-and-a-half-years of treatment.\n\nI've been to Camp Joy every year since I was in the first grade, except one, Lucy Yungblut says. This year will be my eighth summer camp. I hope to be a counselor there one day. I love going to camp. I get to see my friends that I've made there over the years and always make new ones too.\n\nMitch Stone's cancer diagnosis came in 2009 when he was just 11. A malignant brain tumor (primitive neuroctodermal tumor) was discovered. The experience was the greatest challenge ever for him and his family.\n\nNews of the brain tumor alone was startling enough, his mom Dee Stone recalls. Learning of its malignancy delivered a punishing blow.\n\nWhen they told me it was malignant, that really hit me, she says.\n\nThat was a long summer for Mitch as he underwent treatment including chemotherapy and radiation.\n\nAs Mitch's fight continued, something extraordinary happened. Through Friends of Jaclyn, a foundation that connects children with brain tumors with a sports team, he was adopted by the UC Bearcats football team.\n\nThe athletes and their families were praying for Mitch, texting him, knitting him blankets, Dee Stone recalls. They were invested in seeing Mitch through his cancer.\n\nI was thinking, 'oh my goodness, we've got our village,'  Stone remembers.\n\nThey gave me a lot of support and they definitely had my back through that whole thing, Mitch Stone says.\n\nThe relationship fueled Stone in his battle and is also credited, by some, with inspiring the Bearcat players who, in 2009, had a record-breaking season. Many referenced Stone as the team's good luck charm, his mom says.\n\nIn return for the great kindness shown to him during his cancer battle, Stone and his family formed Mitch's Mission. The Playdate event was inspired by Stone's love of hanging out with the athletes, he says.\n\nWe thought for other kids it would be a really cool experience to hang out with them and have really fun thing to do, Stone says. Just basically to be a kid for a day.\n\nPlaydate with the Bearcats is such a fun way for the community to get involved with the university, Emily Yungblut says. In addition to attending the Playdate, the Yungblut family is also active with the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\n\nThis year's Playdate holds a special meaning for Stone who is in his freshman year at UC majoring in business administration. To date the event has raised $75,000.\n\nFor more inspiring stories, LIKE the Humankind Facebook page.
Lauren Ready\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nFORT PIERCE, Fla. – A video of two chimpanzees holding hands is capturing hearts all over the world. While the affectionate gesture is incredibly sweet to watch, the story behind the two chimpanzees makes the hand holding all the more sweet.\n\nTerry, a 37-year-old male, spent 18 years living alone at the Las Vegas zoo. Jeannie, a 51-year-old female, spent 40 years undergoing medical research testing. Both were rescued by Save the Chimps, a non-profit organization based in Florida that gives permanent sanctuary to over 250 rescued chimpanzees.\n\nRecently, Terry and Jeannie met at the sanctuary and immediately began holding hands. No matter what they are doing – eating, laying down, sitting next to one another – they hold hands.\n\nAccording to Save the Chimps, Terry and Jeannie hold hands all through breakfast. These two chimps are reminding us of the beauty that can be found in simply holding hands.\n\nWatch the video above to see the two chimps holding hands.\n\nFor more heartwarming stories of special relationships, LIKE Humankind on Facebook.
Neon lights gave Randy Rogers anxiety. The son of a preacher, Rogers remembers sitting in the backseat of the car in his youth as his parents explained that unsavory things happened in bars, in an interview with The Tennessean, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nThey'd say, 'You don't need to go there, son,' Rogers recalled. I used to get scared when we would go out to eat and there were (blinking) signs.\n\nToday he's in bars nearly every night. The frontman for popular Texas-based country group Randy Rogers Band, Rogers said he grew out of that fear as soon as he went to college. Now he's singing about those days in the band's new single Crazy People. Written by Brad Clawson, Jamie Paulin and Will Weatherly, lyrics include: Flashing neon signs/ People all around/ Mom said, 'Don't pay them no mind, they ain't your kind of crowd.\n\nThe song is the first single from the band's upcoming album, Hellbent. Produced by Dave Cobb and recorded at Nashville's Studio A, Hellbent is Randy Rogers Band's eighth studio album in 18 years. The 11-song collection will available April 26. The band will tour extensively promoting the album.\n\nI think the record sounds like them live, like a live, raw band, Cobb said. I think it's less calculated. There's a lot of heart on it. When you're young and you're making your first records, you don't know any boundaries or borders or you're not worrying about X, Y or Z. I think this record was made in that spirit.\n\nRandy Rogers Band started its career in a 1988 Chevrolet Suburban members named Peaches. The truck, which is featured on the album cover, carried them to their first gigs. They graduated to vans over the years, signed a record deal and got a tour bus.\n\nAs a band, we've been through everything you could possibly imagine, Rogers said. We're still out here pounding the pavement and playing shows and doing what we love to do. It's still fun. We still have something to say, something to prove. 'Hellbent' sums us up as a group of guys. It's hard to be in a marriage for 16 ½ years with the same group of guys.\n\nThe band took its time making the album. They went into the studio and recorded a few songs with Cobb then took a year to write more and crystallize their message as a group. The result, they believe, is the most mature album they've made.\n\nIn addition to Crazy People, other highlights on the album include Anchors Away, You, Me and A Bottle and We Never Made it to Mexico. Rogers said Anchors Away is about a man who ruins relationships because he doesn't know how to be in one — something Rogers admits to being guilty of himself. He describes You, Me and A Bottle as a sweet love song about two people who disappear when they're together because nothing else matters. We Never Made It to Mexico is the story of a man who was dumped on the way to the airport and went to Mexico alone because he had already paid for the trip. The song is particularly sentimental to Rogers because it's the first time he wrote and sang in Spanish. He said he had to call a couple of Spanish-speaking friends to make sure he got the lyrics exactly right.\n\nI think for us in our culture and our landscape that we do live in and are embedded in, I hope my Mexican-American friends and fans see that I understand how important they are to us as a culture, Rogers said. I'm really proud of that song.\n\nHe also said that these days his parents are so proud of him, too.\n\nThis industry is impossible, he said, referring to the music business. What we've created and what we've become and the class and the way that we did it, they call doing it the hard way. My parents realize it's a real job and real work and real sacrifice. They just wish I would come home more.\n\nRandy Rogers Band 'Hellbent' tour dates\n\nFriday, March 29, 2019 — Helotes, TX - Floore's Country Store\n\nSaturday, March 30, 2019 — Helotes, TX - Floore's Country Store\n\nFriday, April 5, 2019 — Bossier City, LA - The Stage at Silver Star Smokehouse\n\nSaturday, April 6, 2019 — Snook, TX - Starlight Ballroom\n\nSunday, April 7, 2019 — Poteet, TX - Strawberry Festival\n\nFriday, April 12, 2019 — Houston, TX - White Oak Music Hall\n\nSaturday, April 13, 2019 — Lubbock, TX - The Blue Light\n\nFriday, April 19, 2019 — Greenville, TX - Hunt County Fair\n\nThursday, April 25, 2019 — Stephenville, TX - Melody Mountain Ranch\n\nFriday, April 26, 2019 — Mission, TX - Las Palmas Race Park\n\nSaturday, April 27, 2019 — San Marcos, TX - Cheatham Street Warehouse\n\nFriday, May 3, 2019 — Texarkana, TX - Scottie's Grill\n\nSaturday, May 4, 2019 — Tyler, TX - Red Dirt BBQ & Music Fest\n\nFriday, May 10, 2019 — Lincoln, NE - The Railyard\n\nSaturday, May 11, 2019 — Iowa City, IA - First Avenue Club\n\nFriday, May 24, 2019 — Biloxi, MS — IP Casino Resort Spa - Studio A\n\nFriday, May 31, 2019 — Ruidoso, NM - Wingfield Park\n\nSaturday, June 1, 2019 — Graham, TX - Young County Arena\n\nSaturday, June 8, 2019 — New Braunfels, TX - Whitewater Amphitheater\n\nSaturday, June 15, 2019 — Irving, TX\n\nSaturday, June 29, 2019 — Durant, OK - Choctaw Grand Theater\n\nThursday, July 25, 2019 — Kansas City, MO - KC Live\n\nSaturday, July 27, 2019 — Sioux City, IA - Battery Park at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino\n\nFriday, August 2, 2019 — Dodson, MT\n\nSaturday, August 3, 2019 — Joseph, OR
Raul Reyes\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nOpen mouth, insert foot. On Sunday's Meet The Press, the show was wrapping up with a discussion of what could bring our politically divided country together, and former news anchor Tom Brokaw decided then would be a good time to weigh in with his views about Latinos.\n\nBrokaw said that he hears from a lot of Republicans who are unhappy with the rise of the Hispanic community. Also, I hear, when I push people a little harder, 'Well, I don't know whether I want brown grandbabies.' I mean, that's also a part of it. It's the intermarriage that is going on and the cultures that are conflicting with each other.\n\nBrokaw went on to offer his own opinion. I also happen to believe that the Hispanics should work harder at assimilation. That's one of the things I've been saying for a long time, he said. You know, they ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities. And that's going to take outreach on both sides, frankly.\n\nBrokaw rightfully received a storm of criticism on social media, and he issued a series of what he considered apologies on Twitter. In one tweet, he said, I feel terrible a part of my comments on Hispanics offended some members of that proud culture.\n\nMore commentary:As US teachers ramp up pressure, face reality: L.A. strike was about control, not students\n\nDemocrats and Republicans flip all the time on border security. This was a fabricated shutdown.\n\nAfter interviewing Roger Stone, it didn't surprise me that he turned his indictment into an event\n\nBrokaw's comments were bigoted, misguided, and deeply disappointing. Most importantly, they are not supported by evidence or reality — something an esteemed journalist like Brokaw ought to know.\n\nSteve King territory\n\nWhen Brokaw reported hearing concerns about having brown grandbabies, he was veering dangerously into Steve King territory; the infamous Iowa congressman once opined that the U.S. doesn't need somebody else's babies. It was a lapse in judgment for Brokaw to relay sentiments that are not only racist but out of date.\n\nIn fact, the number of multi-cultural, multi-ethnic U.S. babies is on the rise, according to the Pew Center. One-in-seven, or about 14 percent, of infants were multi-racial or multi-ethnic in 2015, nearly triple the share in 1980. Contrary to Brokaw's idea that the cultures are conflicting with each other, the rise in multi-racial marriage means that more cultures are living and loving in harmony. If people don't like that, it's their problem — a more diverse population is something for Americans to cheer, not fear.\n\nBrokaw's comments about The Hispanics needing to work harder to assimilate were similarly ignorant, especially since he added that he had been saying this for a long time.\n\nMeanwhile, there are currently two Latinos (Julian Castro and Richard Ojeda) running for president, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has 39 members, an all-time high. Hispanic voters turned out in record numbers in the midterms. A Latina sits on the Supreme Court. Latinos have served in the U.S. military for generations. One of America's hottest tickets is a Broadway show written by a Latino. Latino college enrollment has reached a record high. Latinos are acclaimed athletes, Kennedy Center Honor recipients, and national news anchors. So how exactly do Latinos need to work harder at assimilation?\n\nLatinos assimilate like everyone else\n\nBrokaw doesn't want Latinos to be codified in their communities (whatever that means) and believes Latinos should make sure their kids know English. Here's a news flash to one of America's most distinguished journalists: In terms of language, Latinos assimilate just like everybody else. Among first-generation Latino immigrants, Spanish is naturally the dominant language, Pew reports. By the second generation, the use of Spanish falls as the use of English rises. By the third generation, English has become the dominant language. Overall English proficiency is on the rise among Latinos, by the way.\n\nWhat's sad about Brokaw's remarks is that they are a reminder of how pervasive and persistent are the myths about Hispanics not fitting in or somehow not being full Americans.\n\nTrue, Brokaw apologized on Twitter — multiple times. Still, even his apologies were off-base. He mentioned his days reporting on Cesar Chavez as evidence that he values Hispanic contributions to the U.S. However, if Brokaw has to go all the way back to the early 1970s for proof that he values Hispanic Americans, that is a sign that his sense of the Latino community might be a bit dated.\n\nInvoking Cesar Chavez when you are accused of ethnic insensitivity is like saying you have a Black friend when you are accused of being a racist. It is lame and it is no excuse. If Brokaw is legitimately concerned about Hispanics assimilating, maybe he could mentor young Latino journalists, or help push for more diversity in newsrooms.\n\nBrokaw's Meet The Press comments were unfortunate and offensive. Hispanics do not need to work harder at assimilating; we are doing that, and on our own terms. Rather than offering unwanted advice to Hispanics, it would benefit Brokaw to make a serious effort to adapt to the changing face of this country.\n\nRaul Reyes, an attorney, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

Bob Nightengale\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nFORT MYERS, Fla. -- David Ortiz, who arrived in Boston 13 springs ago as a castoff, and will depart this fall with the greatest legacy by a Red Sox hitter since Ted Williams, kept trying to come up with the right words.\n\nHe started. Stopped. Looked down. Away. And up again.\n\nThe only man in the last century to win three Red Sox World Series championship rings, and will be remembered for his impassioned speech after the Boston Marathon bombing, Ortiz wanted to make sure this message was perfectly delivered.\n\nI was never trying to be a role model,'' Ortiz, 40, told USA TODAY Sports in front of his locker Tuesday afternoon. I don't really want people to look at me like a role model. When I look at role models, they want you to be perfect.\n\nOnly God is perfect.\n\nAll I was trying to do, was do the right things.''\n\nDavid Ortiz: 'I was never trying to be a role model'\n\nOne of only four players with three World Series rings and 500 homers (Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson), you know what Ortiz is most proud of in his career?\n\nHis nearly flawless conduct.\n\nI never did anybody wrong,'' Ortiz said. All I did was make friends in the game, on the field and off the field. You go around the league, you ask them about me, I don't think anybody would have anything bad to say.''\n\nOk, maybe he can be prone to a bit of showboating on the field. His home run off All-Star pitcher All-Star pitcher David Price ignited hostilities, which were doused Monday once they saw one another.\n\nYet, in his entire 19-year career, his record has been clean. No publicized incidents. No charges or arrests. No embarrassing TMZ clips. Not even a speeding ticket.\n\nI'm very proud of that,'' Ortiz said. I tried to be careful, and avoid negative things my entire career. There were always a lot of things that could happen, but you avoid things. If you have a few drinks, you call for a driver. If you get mad, you just walk away.\n\nThat's why I feel bad now. You're seeing a lot of these guys get into trouble, like domestic violence.''\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred is expected to make a ruling this week on at least two of three domestic violence incidents involving Jose Reyes of the Colorado Rockies, Aroldis Chapman of the New York Yankees and Yasiel Puig of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Reyes was the only one who was arrested and charged with domestic violence, but all three face potential discipline.\n\nThese are good guys, I feel so bad for them,'' Ortiz said. I know Jose well. Jose is not a trouble maker. He's a good guy.''\n\nRockies shortstop Jose Reyes placed on leave pending domestic violence case\n\nReyes was arrested on Oct. 31 in Hawaii when he allegedly grabbed his wife's throat, and pushed her into a sliding glass door during an argument. Reyes plead not guilty.\n\nThat's not the Jose I know,'' Ortiz said. He's a good kid. But people are going crazy and want to judge him.\n\nIt was something that got out of control, but only he and his wife know exactly what happened. People already are making a judgement on him.\n\nI just don't think that's fair.''\n\nWatch: David Ortiz's 13 most memorable moments\n\nThe only negative blip off-the-field during Ortiz's entire career was the New York Times report that he was among the 104 names of players who tested positive during the anonymous drug test in 2003. Ortiz acknowledged his name was on the list, but says he still does not know what over-the-counter supplement triggered the positive test.\n\nAs an athlete, you've got to be particularly careful,'' Ortiz said. A lot of people are watching. I'm proud to say that nothing ever bad happened to me.\n\nI always went about things the right way.''\n\nOrtiz, one of the greatest DHs in history, symbolized Boston's historic resurgence. He not only became one of most revered players in Red Sox history, but truly an ambassador for the city.\n\nIt was Ortiz who uttered the most famous words in Boston since Paul Revere, when he addressed the emotional Fenway Park crowd after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing: This is our (expletive) city. Nobody is going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong.''\n\nRed Sox catcher Ryan Hanigan, a Boston native said: No one's ever going to forget that speech. What he's done for our team, our city, he'll never be forgotten. He loves the city, and they love him back.''\n\nEven though Ortiz was born and raised in the Dominican Republic, played for Seattle and Minnesota, and even spent his winters in Green Bay, Wis., it's as if he's spent his entire life in New England.\n\nWhen you look around the game,'' Red Sox president Dave Dombrowski said, this is as close a bond between a player and the city in the game of baseball. When you talk about what he accomplished, what the team accomplished, his ability, and his length of time here, very few guys mean that much to his city.''\n\nIt was love at first sight, turning into a perfect marriage, with a relationship that will last forever.\n\nThe first time I ever played at Fenway Park, it made me feel like I was playing back in my country …'' Ortiz said. Red Sox fans, man, they are just like us. It was easy for me to adjust myself to our fans. Every time we lose a game, I suffered, just like them. It's so important to win. And all of a sudden you don't, it's something that gets to you.\n\nAnd Red Sox fans, that's how it always has been.''\n\nThe 86-year curse finally ended in 2004 when Ortiz led the Red Sox to the World Series championship, recovering from a 3-0 deficit in the ALCS to beat the Yankees, and then sweeping the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series. They won again in 2007. And once again in 2013.\n\nYet, it was the 2004 season that will forever be cherished, changing not only the fate of a player, but an entire franchise.\n\nThe Yankees were the team to beat back then,'' Ortiz said. Being able to do what we did, was something that was very special. It was career-lifting for me.''\n\nIt was the birth of a legend.\n\nEverybody gets that moment when you feel like it's time to go,'' Ortiz said. I'm ready to pass the torch.\n\nWow, it's been an unbelievable journey.''\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale and Facebook
NBC wants to give you something to sing about.\n\nZoey's Extraordinary Playlist (Sundays, 9 EST/PST, ★★★ out of four), centers on Zoey (Jane Levy, Suburgatory), a woman who, after an MRI mishap, hears other people's thoughts through elaborate song and dance numbers.\n\nWhen a stranger needs help? He or she sings Help by the Beatles. Someone with a crush might sing Sucker by the Jonas Brothers. A colleague working through grief sings Mad World by Gary Jules. All the while, only Zoey can hear the songs and see the accompanying dance moves.\n\nThe stars explain:Why NBC's 'Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist' gets emotional with Van Morrison, Jonas Brothers tunes\n\nStrange and ambitious concept? Absolutely. But when it comes to executing what is essentially X-Men telepath Professor X trapped in the Glee classroom, Zoey hits most of the right notes. Created by Austin Winsberg (Gossip Girl, The Sound of Music Live!), the series happily embraces its musical numbers with gusto and builds a strong stable of characters – and talented voices such as Peter Gallagher, Skylar Astin, Mary Steenburgen and Lauren Graham – to sing them. There is certainly room for improvement, but the cast is so charming and the tone so joyful that Zoey carries itself through a few early hiccups.\n\nWinter TV preview: 10 excellent new shows that will keep you warm and happy\n\nZoey is a quiet, less-than-confident computer programmer living in San Francisco when she goes through her life-changing MRI. At work, she's having a tough time interviewing for a promotion, while in her personal life, she and her family struggle with her father Mitch's (Peter Gallagher) degenerative neurological disorder, which renders him mostly paralyzed and unable to communicate.\n\nThe power of mind-reading through song helps Zoey realize which of her co-workers really has her back (not many) and that her best friend, Max (Astin), is in love with her. In the first episode's best scene, she's able to communicate with her father after so much silence between them. Zoey confides her secret power only to her gender-fluid neighbor, Mo (Alex Newell), a DJ who offers advice both musical and spiritual.\n\nIn the first four episodes, there isn't a lot of depth to the stories or the way the songs are used, other than Mitch's scenes. Mostly, the lyrics of the songs serve as a bridge to the emotions of Zoey's friends, family and acquaintances. You almost wish the series made the audience work for it a little more. Maybe there was a subtler choice to be made than when Zoey's boss Joan (Graham) is unsatisfied in her crumbling marriage and sings (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction by the Rolling Stones?\n\nZoey does, occasionally, make more nuanced musical choices. After Max sleeps with his new girlfriend, he doesn't bust out The Lonely Island song I Just Had Sex, but instead belts out a jubilant opera tune. The moment is all the funnier for the implication rather than an explanation.\n\nThe series ventures a bit into Joan of Arcadia territory, the 2003-05 CBS series that also starred Steenburgen, when the songs follow Zoey around until she starts helping the singers. That raises questions about the mechanics of her power (and the basic plot of the show) that the writers have yet to answer. Is Zoey an angel? A superhero? Is there more magic in the world? Or is it really all just science?\n\nZoey has a magnetic cast and – most importantly – an incredible flair for staging its musical numbers. The songs are visually interesting even if there aren't coordinated background dancers. Putting together a TV musical is no small feat. The live musical event trend has had more than its share of duds, from Rent to The Little Mermaid and Peter Pan, in part because the people behind them didn't quite grasp what makes a musical tick.\n\nIf nothing else, Zoey is a celebration of the unabashedly joyful, big and loud musical number. After sing-song wonders Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Glee left the air, that's enough to win the hearts of theater nerds.\n\nBeyond its music, the series needs a little Help to become great. But all signs, musical or not, indicate it will eventually get there.
Mary Walsh\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nMy wife Bev and I have known each other since we were teenagers and played in the same softball league. We hit it off after college and were close friends before we became a couple in 1978. We've been together ever since.\n\nThe thing I most cherish about Bev is her ability to laugh at herself, something I don't have. She's the most honest person I've ever met, and I trust her more than anyone else in the world. When I'm with Bev, I feel whole. We love being together.\n\nIt was hard to be gay in the 1970s and 1980s, including in St. Louis, Missouri, where both of us were born and still live near to be close to our families. For many years, we feared discrimination and lived very quiet lives. I worked for almost 30 years in the telecommunications industry, and Bev dedicated her life to teaching, first as a math teacher, then as a principal in the Clayton School District and eventually as an associate professor at Maryville University.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nWhy we have LGBTQ Pride and not 'Straight Pride'\n\nJack Phillips: Despite my court win, Colorado Civil Rights Commission is coming after me again\n\nTrump anti-transgender memo would hurt teens like me. I'm hoping my state protects me.\n\nThroughout our careers, we were terrified we might be fired if we were open about our relationship. Only our closest friends knew we were a couple. After Bev retired in 2014, and after the U.S. Supreme Court's marriage-equality decision in 2015, we began living more openly.\n\nDiscrimination is far from dead\n\nI am 72 and Bev is 68. A few years ago, we started looking for communities in St. Louis where we could live safely and comfortably for the rest of our lives. Friendship Village Sunset Hills jumped to the top of our list. It was reasonably priced and provided every level of care, so we would be cared for no matter what the future held. We also had several friends at Friendship Village who spoke highly of their experience and encouraged us to move there. We loved the community that Friendship Village provided, with exercise classes, card games and a choir.\n\nKnowing this was the place for us, we made plans to put our home on the market and canceled a vacation so we could start packing. Then our lives were pulled out from under us.\n\nA few days after sending a deposit to Friendship Village, the marketing director called and asked about the nature of Bev's and my relationship. I told her we have been married since 2009 and together since 1978. She replied that she was going to have to get back to us, that this may be a problem.\n\nShe called back a few days later and said Friendship Village would not accept us because we are a same-sex couple. We would violate their cohabitation policy because of their definition of marriage.\n\nI was stunned and felt sick to my stomach. For so many years, Bev and I feared being discriminated against. We finally thought that fear was over, and then this happened.\n\nWhat happened to us broke our hearts after planning the next phase of life surrounded by friends in the community we've always called home. It was also blatant discrimination based on our sex. If one of us were a man, we would have been accepted. But because we are both women, we were barred. So Bev and I sued Friendship Village under the Fair Housing Act, a federal law that prohibits discrimination against renters or homebuyers due to sex and other factors.\n\nLGBT community needs specific protection\n\nDisappointingly, last week, a judge in St. Louis dismissed our case. The court found that the Fair Housing Act does not protect legally married same-sex couples, though other courts have recognized that LGBT people have the same protections from housing discrimination under that law.\n\nBev and I are devastated. Friendship Village turned us away for one reason: Because we are in a legally valid marriage between two women, not between a man and a woman. That is discrimination based on sex.\n\nNo one should have to endure what we went through. Bev and I thought we had finally reached a point in our lives when we wouldn't have to worry about discrimination anymore. We are retired from our jobs, our remaining family members love and support us, and we have a rich community of friends. But what this experience made clear is that, even in 2019, we still have a long way to go to reach true equality.\n\nSame-sex couples can marry in every state in our country, yet many of us still live in fear that we might be fired from our jobs or lose our homes. This is not just about Bev and me — it's about all LGBT people. While Bev and I plan to continue our legal battle against Friendship Village, it is critical that we push for state and federal laws expressly protecting LGBT people from discrimination so others won't need to go through what we did. No one should be denied the opportunity for housing because of who they are or whom they love.\n\nMary Walsh is a retiree living with her wife, Beverly Nance, in Shrewsbury, St. Louis County, Missouri.
Michael Collins\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — Advocates for gay, lesbian and transgender rights urged the Senate on Monday to reject President Trump's choice for Army secretary, calling him a social issues warrior who has worked to undermine LGBT rights at every turn.\n\nThe administration could not have picked a worse nominee, said David Stacy, government affairs director of the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nTrump announced Friday he is nominating Mark Green, a former Army officer and Republican state senator from Tennessee, to lead the Army. If confirmed by the Senate, he would succeed Eric Fanning, the first openly gay leader of a branch of the military.\n\nGreen, 52, is a physician and West Point graduate who is popular among many Tea Party-aligned Republicans. He was deployed three times overseas during his military service and was an Army medic for a special operations team that captured Saddam Hussein. Green wrote a book about the experience.\n\nGay-rights groups, however, contend he's one of the most extreme, anti-LGBT politicians in the country and worry that, if confirmed, he would work to roll back the progress that has been made in integrating openly gay men and women in the armed forces since the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy on military service.\n\nWe've finally ended archaic policies that forced service members and their families to hide who they are and treated them as second class citizens, said Stephen Peters, the Human Rights Campaign's press secretary and a military veteran who was discharged under don't Ask, don't tell.\n\nPutting Green in charge of the Army would send an incredibly dangerous message down the chain of command, a message that undermines the important progress we have made.\n\nLGBT groups point to Green's legislative record in Tennessee and his public comments on issues such as same-sex marriage and transgender rights as proof of his radical and outdated views.\n\nRead more:\n\nVincent Viola withdraws from Army secretary nomination\n\nPresident Trump nominates Tennessee state Sen. Mark Green for Army secretary\n\nThey are particularly incensed about his sponsorship this year of legislation that they've labeled the license to discriminate bill.\n\nThe bill would prevent local governments from taking discriminatory action against a company based on the company's policies related to personnel or employee benefits. This could include either not contracting with a vendor or canceling a current contract.\n\nHence, a local government would be blocked from ending a contract with a company for the sole reason that it did not have employee protections for gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender workers.\n\nThe bill passed the Tennessee Senate but died in the House.\n\nLGBT groups also took exception to a number of comments that Green has made regarding gay-rights issues.\n\nWhile speaking to the Chattanooga Tea Party in 2016, Green referenced then-president Barack Obama's federal guidelines allowing public school students to use restrooms and other facilities corresponding to their gender identity.\n\nGreen called transgender men and women guys or gals with question marks and complained, The notion that Mr. Obama thinks he can tell the state of Tennessee who can go into a men's bathroom or a women's bathroom is absurd.\n\nIn the same speech, Green suggested Tennessee should not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and insinuated that permissive attitudes that legalized same-sex marriage could eventually open the door to using taxpayer dollars for infanticide.\n\nThat's absurd. Right? he said. We would think, 'Oh, they'll never get there.' But 30 years ago, that's what they thought about two guys getting married. So at what point do you just say, 'I drew this line in the sand,' and 'No!' \n\nGreen could not be reached for comment. But Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said last week he is confident of Green's ability to lead the Army.\n\nMark will provide strong civilian leadership, improve military readiness and support our service members, civilians and their families, Mattis said in a statement issued shortly after Green's nomination was announced.\n\nLGBT groups began reaching out over the weekend to Senate Democrats and moderate Republicans to let them know about Green's views, said Stacy, with the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nWe are hearing real concerns, not only from lawmakers, but also from gay and lesbian military personnel who fear what Green's nomination could mean for their future, Stacy said.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison of the USA TODAY Network-Tennessee
Congratulations are in order for Katharine McPhee and David Foster, who have welcomed their first child together.\n\nI can happily confirm that they welcomed a baby boy, McPhee's representative Leslie Sloane said in a statement to USA TODAY on Wednesday. No other details were provided.\n\nIn December, the American Idol alum confirmed on Instagram she was expecting her first child. In the photos, McPhee cradled her baby bump while wearing a long powder-blue coat. Her accompanying comment was simply two blue hearts and a blue butterfly, perhaps giving fans a hint about her baby's sex.\n\nIn June, the couple celebrated their one-year marriage anniversary, with McPhee sharing photos of their wedding day on Instagram.\n\nA year ago today I married the love of my life, she wrote. Thank you for always loving me and inspiring me in all aspects of my life. I love you. Here's to the future! (Oh and happy anniversary to the other love of my life - this dreamy dress!\n\nThe two met in 2006, when Foster mentored McPhee on Season 5 of ABC's American Idol. They married at the Church of Saint Yeghiche in the South Kensington district of West London on June 28, 2019, according to US Weekly and People.\n\nThe couple's wedding day shares an anniversary with the release of McPhee's Somewhere Over the Rainbow cover, her first single after her run on American Idol. The song dropped in 2006, and her now-husband Foster produced it.\n\nLife is full of beautiful coincidences, isn't? she wrote on Instagram on June 28, 2019. Thank you for taking me over the rainbow, David.\n\nKatharine McPhee shows off baby bump after news of pregnancy with David Foster\n\nFoster, 71, opened up about his marriage to McPhee, 36, in a July interview with USA TODAY, in which he addressed their age gap.\n\nWell, we have that musical connection, Foster said of their relationship. Look, we have haters on social media, and there's not a person around that's not going to make some comment about the age difference. But there are so many things that can bring a marriage down: It can be financial, it can be children, it can be geography, it can be infidelity. And one of them is age difference, but that's our only problem. Everything else is in line, so it's not going to bring us down.\n\nThis is Foster's fifth marriage, and he has five adult children.\n\nDavid Foster on his new Netflix doc, age difference with Katharine McPhee: 'That's our only problem'
Director Sam Mendes' innovative war movie 1917 pulled off a couple of shockers at the 77th annual Golden Globe Awards – including taking best drama over Oscar contenders The Irishman and Marriage Story – while Quentin Tarantino's 1969-set Once Upon a Time in Hollywood proved to be the grooviest comedy around.\n\nThis is a huge thing for this movie, said Mendes, who also won best director over Martin Scorsese and Tarantino for his World War I thriller (which opens nationwide Friday). It's difficult to make big movies without huge actors in the leads.\n\nIn contrast, Once Upon a Time is full of A-list stars and now has awards-season momentum: Tarantino's love letter to retro L.A. took home a leading three Globes, including best comedy or musical, screenplay and supporting actor for Brad Pitt.\n\nGolden Globes:The winners list\n\nRicky Gervais:Golden Globes host doesn't offend, he just bores\n\nHoly moly! Pitt said when accepting the award, his second win in the category. (He also won in 1996 for 12 Monkeys.) Pitt remarked that when he was starting out, fellow nominees Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, Tom Hanks and Anthony Hopkins were like gods to me, so this is an honor. All my respect.\n\nBest joke of the night:Brad Pitt called a 'legend' for quip about 'Titanic' aimed at Leonardo DiCaprio\n\n6 must-know moments: From the 2020 Golden Globes show\n\nRenee Zellweger conquered the field for best actress in a drama for her transformative performance as Judy Garland in Judy. Hi, everybody. You all look pretty good 17 years later, said Zellweger, picking up her fourth Globe – and first since 2003's Cold Mountain.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix won best actor in a drama for his villainous high-profile turn in Joker, which also took best original score. Phoenix thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for a plant-based meal, director Todd Phillips and the crowd for putting up with me, and his fellow nominees for the beautiful, mesmerizing work you've all done this year.\n\nBest dressed:Taylor Swift, Nicole Kidman and more stars stun at Globes\n\nWorst dressed:Jennifer Lopez, Sofia Vergara, Cate Blanchett, more\n\nTaron Egerton snagged best actor in a comedy or musical for the Elton John fantasy biopic Rocketman. I really wish I had written something, said the British actor, who thanked John for living a life less ordinary.\n\nLegendary songwriting partners John and Bernie Taupin received their first award ever together for (I'm Gonna) Love Me Again. The Rocketman tune won the Globe for original song over Beyoncé's Spirit and Taylor Swift's Beautiful Ghosts. It's very humbling, John said while Taupin added that the song was special because it honored their 52-year-old marriage.\n\nAwkwafina was named best actress in a comedy or musical for The Farewell. If I fall upon hard times, I can sell this, said the comedian, who dedicated the Globe to her father. I told you I'd get a job, Dad. She's the first woman of Asian descent to win the category. It's pretty mind-blowing. It feels incredible, Awkwafina told reporters backstage. But there's this other feeling that you want there to be more. I hope this is just the beginning.\n\nLaura Dern also picked up honors at the glitzy extravaganza, hosted by Ricky Gervais: She won supporting actress for Marriage Story. Supporting characters often give voice to the voiceless, Dern said, and she thanked director Noah Baumbach for letting her give voice, pay tribute to the divorce lawyer. Long, long overdue.\n\nHBO's Succession snagged two Globes, for best TV drama and lead actor Brian Cox, and so did Fleabag, which won best comedy as well as lead actress in a comedy for creator/star Phoebe Waller-Bridge. She thanked President Barack Obama for putting Fleabag on his 2019 favorites list. As some of you may know, he's always been on mine, Waller-Bridge said, referring to an Obama gag in her show's first season.\n\nOlivia Colman, who won film best actress honors last year for The Favorite, won the Globe for lead actress in a TV drama for Netflix's The Crown, in which she stars as Queen Elizabeth II. For the last year, I feel I've been living someone else's life, Colman said, and now I definitely feel I've won someone else's award.\n\nCritically acclaimed black comedy Parasite took honors for best foreign-language film. South Korean director Bong Joon-ho said in his speech that once viewers get over the barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\n\nChernobyl won a pair of Globes, best limited series and supporting actor for Stellan Skarsgard. Among the limited series categories, Fosse/Verdon star Michelle Williams won lead actress while Russell Crowe received lead actor honors for The Loudest Voice. Patricia Arquette won for TV supporting actress for The Act, and Ramy star Ramy Youssef was a big surprise for lead actor in a comedy.\n\nI know you guys haven't seen my show, the self-deprecating Youssef said. My mom also was rooting for Michael Douglas.\n\nCharlize Theron presented Tom Hanks with the Cecil B. DeMille Award, and recounted a story of his kindness when filming one of her earliest film roles in That Thing You Do! He just makes the world a better place, Theron said of Hanks.\n\nMost of the people in this room, I would pay to see them get their cars washed, a humbled Hanks said. He sang the The Love Boat theme with a cold the size of Merv Griffin's 'Jeopardy!' royalties, but choked up when mentioning his wife Rita Wilson and five children in front of him. I can't tell you how much your love means to me.\n\nWhen Ellen DeGeneres was honored with the Carol Burnett Award for excellence in television, presenter Kate McKinnon noted how important DeGeneres has been as an LGBTQ icon: She risked her entire life and her entire career to tell the truth.\n\nDeGeneres had a little fun with receiving a career achievement award but ended with a heartfelt message about what she enjoys most about having her own talk show: All I ever want to do is make people feel good and laugh. But the real power of television is ... that people watch my show and are inspired to do the same in their lives.
Lorena Gallo, known to the world as Lorena Bobbitt, has been with her partner for more than 20 years.\n\nShe and David Bellinger have a 13-year-old daughter. They met long ago in college and share a life together in Virginia. In conversation, she occasionally refers to him as her husband.\n\nBut Gallo, 48, never married Bellinger. She gives a knowing laugh when asked why.\n\nI believe in marriage as an institution, of course, and I respect that, she says. It was my choice. He even says, 'If you're ready to marry, I'll just show up!'\n\nRelated:Lorena Bobbitt OK'd filmmakers' request to interview her ex, John: 'I know who he is'\n\nMore:What if Lorena Bobbitt were on trial now? How perception of abuse has (or hasn't) changed\n\nTime passed, she says, and the couple kept saying, 'Well maybe this year.' And this year comes and goes. So it's been over 20 years now, she laughs. It's great.\n\nMeanwhile, her new Amazon Prime Video docuseries Lorena (streaming Friday) is prompting unexpected parenting conversations at home.\n\nThe four-episode series, which combs through the trauma and marital abuse that preceded the night a 19-year-old Gallo sliced off her ex-husband John Wayne Bobbitt's penis, debuted last month to critical acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nOn the day it screened there, Gallo finished interviews and asked where Bellinger and their daughter were. She presumed they'd gone shopping in the snowy Utah ski village. To her shock, Gallo was told they were inside the theater next door watching the series.\n\nImmediately, my motherly instincts are like, 'Oh my God, protect, protect her,'  says Gallo. She'd shared only limited details with her daughter; when she was about 8, she'd simply said she'd been married before, and she'd been hurt.\n\nBut in Utah, Gallo panicked, thinking she's too young for this! But then I went and I sat right behind them. Bellinger was holding her, and she was leaning on his shoulder watching.\n\nOverwhelmed, Gallo began to cry. Afterward, when we got into the hotel room, she told me, 'Mom, I didn't realize how strong you were.' I melt(ed). My heart just – she disarmed me completely.
Compiled by Jocelyn McClurg\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhat should you read this weekend? USA TODAY's picks for book lovers include the twisty best-selling thriller The Widow, and a non-fiction look at teen girls and social media.\n\nThe Widow by Fiona Barton; NAL, 324 pp.; fiction\n\nIt turns out that having serious trust issues can be a very good thing. At least when it comes to fiction.\n\nBest sellers The Girl on the Train, Gone Girl and Luckiest Girl Alive prove the point. Fiona Barton's The Widow is a psychological thriller with enough twists and turns to fit perfectly on the shelf alongside the gaggle of aforementioned girls.\n\nThe Widow opens in an English university town four years after the alleged abduction and murder of 2-year-old Bella Elliott. The prime suspect remains Glen Taylor, a mild-mannered delivery driver whose professional aspirations are never realized and whose childless marriage is put under scrutiny. The only problem is, Bella has never been found and now Glen, released after an unsuccessful prosecution, is dead in an accident.\n\nThe result is even more press coverage, more police inquiries and much more pressure for the widow, Jean Turner.\n\nUSA TODAY says *** out of four stars.

AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Marriage equality proponents draped themselves in rainbow flags at Margaret Court Arena on the first day of the Australian Open to protest tennis great Margaret Court's controversial views on gay marriage and the broader lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nSeveral, however, stopped short of saying Court's name should be removed from the venue — a move advocated by Billie Jean King before the tournament began.\n\nMarlene Jorgensen, sitting with a group of friends decked head to toe in rainbow-colored attire, said Court was entitled to her opinion.\n\nI don't think you should ever take away from what Margaret Court's achievements were, said Jorgensen, who was festooned with a rainbow boa and knee-high, rainbow-striped socks. We're just saying we have a different opinion and it's not the same as hers. But that's what Australians are about. ... It's not about your race, your religion or your sexual orientation. We're here to play tennis.\n\nIn recent days, many top players have similarly declined to take a stand on the name of the stadium.\n\nAfter criticizing Court's comments last year and questioning whether players might request not to play at Margaret Court Arena during this year's tournament, Australia's Samantha Stosur on Monday said she had no issue with playing her first-round match there.\n\nI think that happened, what, six months ago now. Everyone said what they said, said former U.S. Open champion Stosur, who had a match point before losing to Monica Puig. But, you know, I'll play on the court. It's a nice court to play on.\n\nU.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens, who also played at Margaret Court Arena on Monday, bristled when asked in a pre-tournament news conference whether she'd refuse to play on the court.\n\nYou guys, don't ask me these questions. It's up to the tournament. It's not up to me, she said, before adding, I respect all of my fellow players, colleagues, their lifestyles. I don't think there should be hate toward anyone.\n\nAdded Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza: I will play whatever they put me, which court. ... If I play on Margaret Court, the last thing I'm going to think is this.\n\nCourt, who holds the record for the most Grand Slam singles titles with 24 across the amateur and Open eras, had been an outspoken opponent to Australia's national referendum on gay marriage, which passed by a wide margin late last year.\n\nNow a Christian pastor, the 75-year-old Court blamed the devil for young people questioning their sexuality and wrote a public letter urging Australians to vote against gay marriage for the sake of Australia, our children, and our children's children.\n\nBoth King and Martina Navratilova criticized Court's statements and recommended that Tennis Australia officials rename the No. 2 arena at Melbourne Park.\n\nSporting venues named for athletes, or any place, really, named for whoever, are so named for one reason. That reason is their whole body of work, Navratilova wrote in a letter to The Sydney Morning Herald last year. In other words, it is not just for what this person did on the field, on the court, in politics, arts or science, for instance, but also for who they are as human beings.\n\nAt a news conference at Melbourne Park last Friday, King said if she was still competing, she wouldn't play on the court.\n\nI was fine until lately when she said so many derogatory things about my community, said King, who, like Navratilova, is gay. I personally don't think she should have (her name on the stadium) anymore.\n\nBut among spectators waving rainbow flags in the arena on Monday, opinions were mixed whether the court should be renamed.\n\nLisa Fox, a tennis fan from Melbourne, said she brought her giant rainbow flag and rainbow-colored hat in response to the blatant bigotry in this country around marriage equality and Margaret Court's very vocal bigotry.\n\nBut she doesn't support renaming the arena.\n\nI think she's a great tennis player and she won more majors than Rod Laver, Fox said, referring to the Australian men's tennis champion whose name appears on Melbourne Park's center court. So I don't necessarily (think the name should change), but I think what she says is abhorrent.
This news story has been updated with information from a court hearing on Feb. 23, 2021.\n\nThe wife of convicted Mexican drug lord Joaquin El Chapo Guzmán Loera was arrested at a suburban Washington, D.C. airport Monday, for her alleged role in the distribution of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamines and marijuana.\n\nA judge on Tuesday ordered the family's latest defendant, Emma Coronel Aispuro, to remain in custody as her attorneys consider a bail application. But prosecutors told the judge she poses a substantial flight risk and should not be released before trial.\n\nCoronel, 31, a dual U.S.-Mexican citizen who had been a fixture at her husband's 2018-2019 federal trial in Brooklyn, N.Y., monitored the hearing from a detention center via a Spanish translation.\n\nGuzmán, a leader of Mexico's Sinaloa narcotics cartel, was sentenced to life in prison following his trial.\n\nMore:Notorious drug lord Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán sentenced to life. And U.S. wants his $12.6B fortune.\n\nCoronel is charged in a conspiracy to distribute drugs in the U.S. and is alleged to have assisted in her husband's elaborate 2015 escape from a Mexican prison. She is suspected of plotting another prison escape, which would have been Guzman's third, before his 2017 extradition to the U.S. for trial.\n\nJeffrey Lichtman, a prominent New York City defense lawyer who was one of Guzman's lawyers during his trial, told U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin Meriweather during Tuesday's hearing he represented Coronel and consented to her detention. He said he would consult with prosecutors before proposing a bail package.\n\nHowever, Anthony Nardozzi, a representative of the U.S. Department of Justice's Narcotics and Dangerous Drug Section, told Meriwether that Coronel had ties to Guzman's Sinaloa drug cartel, access to substantial funds and no direct ties to the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nShe poses a serious risk of flight, he said. Pretrial detention is justified.\n\nCourt records filed Monday made the same argument.\n\nCoronel grew up with knowledge of the narcotics trafficking industry, and married Guzman when she was a teenager, federal authorities said in court documents. Coronel understood the scope of the Sinaloa Cartel's drug trafficking; Coronel knows and understands the Sinaloa Cartel is the most prolific cartel in Mexico.\n\nAccording to the documents, she also was aware of multi-ton cocaine shipments, multi-kilo heroin production, multi-ton marijuana shipments, and ton quantity methamphetamine shipments.\n\nCoronel understood the drug proceeds she controlled during her marriage to Guzman were derived from these shipments, federal authorities said.\n\nCiting statements from a cooperating witness, federal authorities said Coronel participated in the plan to construct an underground tunnel linked to the Mexican prison that aided in her husband's most dramatic escape.\n\nShe was implicated directly in her husband's criminal affairs during his 2018-2019 trial in a Brooklyn federal court.\n\nDamaso Lopez Nuñez, a former Guzmán lieutenant who testified as a government witness in January 2019, told jurors his boss was determined to escape from Mexico's maximum-security Altiplano prison, where he was locked up after a squad of Mexican Marines captured him in February 2014.\n\nIn the brazen July 2015 breakout that captured international headlines, Guzmán slipped into a roughly mile-long tunnel that had been secretly excavated beneath the prison. He made his getaway on a motorcycle attached to rails inside the ventilated and lighted passageway.\n\nTestifying through a Spanish translator, Lopez said Coronel began relaying the boss' instructions during a secret meeting that took place around April 2014 in Culiacán, Mexico.\n\nGuzmán was taking the risk ... and thinking of escaping from prison, Lopez said Guzmán's wife told him, the boss' sons and others during the meeting.\n\nRecounting a follow-up session a month or so later, Lopez testified that Coronel relayed additional instructions from her husband to the plotters: A tunnel had to be built and they should start to work.\n\nWatching and listening from a courtroom bench at the time, Coronel showed no evident emotion during the testimony as she fidgeted with her nearly waist-length dark hair.\n\nShe later declined to comment afterward about Lopez's testimony. Similarly, Brooklyn federal prosecutors at the time declined to discuss why Coronel had not been charged in her husband's criminal indictment.
AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Vogue editor Anna Wintour has added her voice to those calling for the renaming of Margaret Court Arena at the Australian Open because of the tennis great's outspoken condemnation of same-sex marriage.\n\nWintour is an avid tennis fan who has been at Melbourne Park this week and spent time in the stadium player boxes of Serena Williams and Roger Federer She used a speech at an Australian Open function on Thursday to raise the issue.\n\nI find that it is inconsistent with the sport for Margaret Court's name to be on a stadium that does so much to bring all people together across their differences, Wintour was quoted as saying by Melbourne's The Age newspaper. This much I think is clear to anyone who understands the spirit and the joy of the game. Intolerance has no place in tennis.\n\nTennis greats Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova have criticized Court's statements during previous visits to Melbourne Park, and recommended Tennis Australia officials rename the arena.\n\nWintour said Court, who won a record 24 Grand Slam singles titles, was a champion on the court but that the arena — the No. 2 show court at the season's first major — should be meeting point of players of all nations, preferences and backgrounds and should celebrate somebody who was a champion off the court as well.\n\nNow a Christian pastor in Western Australia state, the 76-year-old Court caused controversy in 2017 by saying the devil was to blame for young people questioning their sexuality and wrote a public letter urging Australians to vote against gay marriage for the sake of Australia, our children, and our children's children. Same-sex marriage has been legalized in Australia.\n\nCourt has been a regular visitor to the Australian Open but didn't attend last year's tournament.\n\nIn 2018, marriage equality proponents draped themselves in rainbow flags at Margaret Court Arena on the first day of the tournament to protest Court's controversial views.\n\nThe main show court at Melbourne Park is Rod Laver Arena, named after the only player to twice win a calendar-year Grand Slam.\n\n__\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
Tim Tebow and Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters have officially tied the knot.\n\nThe former NFL quarterback-turned-professional-baseball-player shared a photo on social media on Monday night seemingly from the couple's wedding ceremony, which they told People took place in Nel-Peters' native South Africa.\n\nI've been looking forward to three things, Tebow told People. The first moment I see her in her wedding dress, the first kiss, and the first dance together as man and wife. It's such a special night.\n\nI've been waiting my entire life for someone special, who I can spend the rest of my life with. I was waiting for the right person to come along. And now I'm marrying Demi. I can't wait to see what our future holds. All of my dreams have come true. It was 100 percent worth the wait.\n\nTebow won two national championships and the 2007 Heisman Trophy in one of the most decorated careers in college football history at Florida. He was selected in the first round of the 2010 NFL draft by the Denver Broncos, whom he led to the playoffs in 2011 in the infamous Tebow Time era. Despite pulling an upset of the defending AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers while there, he was traded by Denver and would appear in just 12 more NFL regular-season games, for the New York Jets in 2012.\n\nNel-Peters, 24, was crowned Miss Universe in 2017. The couple first confirmed they were dating in July 2018.\n\nThese days, Tebow, 32, is in the New York Mets' minor league system (and he's a spring training non-roster invitee this year). His pursuits in baseball were kept in mind, apparently, for his wedding, as Nel-Peters told People they selected a cheesecake so that Tebow could stick to his diet.\n\nTebow also serves as a college football analyst for ESPN.
Life is a constant emergency.\n\nThat's the idea behind Fox's 9-1-1 (Wednesdays, 9 ET/PT, ★★★ out of four), a drama portraying the non-stop intensity of first responders in Los Angeles, on and off the job.\n\nCreated by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk (American Horror Story, Glee), 9-1-1 focuses primarily on Bobby (Peter Krause), a seasoned firefighter in recovery for alcohol and drug abuse; Athena (Angela Bassett), a beat cop trapped in an unhappy marriage; and Abby (Connie Britton), a what's-your-emergency? operator caring for a mother with Alzheimer's and trying to get over a bad breakup.\n\nThe pilot starts with tension at a seven and ratchets it up as the episode goes along, rarely pausing between professional and personal emergencies.\n\nRather than focusing on a single crisis, each hour sends its characters to several. In Wednesday's premiere, Bobby's crew responds to a potential drowning, a woman being choked by her pet snake, a birth that goes criminally wrong, a car accident and a home invasion. They aren't solving murder or medical mysteries, and sometimes the audience doesn't get closure, because the first responders don't, either. They can't follow a victim into the hospital, because they have to go help someone else.\n\nThis unrelenting pace is a tad overwhelming, but makes for a fast-paced hour that never drags. 9-1-1's non-stop action serves as the series' spectacle, an antidote to the soapy melodrama Murphy employs elsewhere. .\n\nThe three strong performers elevate the sometimes too on-the-nose dialogue and plotting. Bassett, in particular, is a standout as a woman constantly on the edge, whether at home in her failed marriage or in the field dealing with men questioning her decisions. Britton has the most understated role as a melancholic 9-1-1 operator, but the actress makes her scenes, in which she's often at a desk, feel like a vital part of the action. Her home life, too, is ripe for dramatic potential.\n\nThe series feels different from other procedurals, but it stumbles when it falls into familiar narratives and character beats. Oliver Stark's Evan Buck Buckley borders on the cliché, a young hothead who takes foolish risks and doesn't respect authority, forcing Krause's Bobby to take on the role of disapproving father figure.\n\nUltimately, 9-1-1 may be a too-predictable and unremitting show, but when it takes off, it's quite the ride.\n\nLove talking about TV?

Britney Spears announced Friday she's indefinitely postponing her new Las Vegas residency show, Domination, because her father, Jamie Spears, has been so ill with a ruptured colon he almost died.\n\nIn a series of tweets, she said she was heartbroken about what's happened.\n\nI don't even know where to start with this, because this is so tough for me to say, her first tweet opened. I will not be performing my new show Domination. I've been looking forward to this show and seeing all of you this year, so doing this breaks my heart.\n\nHowever, it's important to always put your family first… and that's the decision I had to make. A couple of months ago, my father was hospitalized and almost died. We're all so grateful that he came out of it alive, but he still has a long road ahead of him.\n\nShe didn't say in her tweets what has ailed her father but asked for understanding.\n\nShe also posted about her father on her Instagram page.\n\nSpears' father is Jamie Spears, who has been in charge of his 37-year-old daughter's estate and finances for nearly a decade as her conservator. Spears has two sons, Sean, 13, and Jayden, 12.\n\nSpears' representative, Jeff Raymond, said Jamie Spears became ill two months ago and was rushed to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas.\n\nHis colon spontaneously ruptured and he was immediately admitted into surgery, Raymond said in a statement to USA TODAY. (He) spent the next 28 days in the hospital under the care of the amazing doctors, nurses and staff at the hospital, who the Spears family credits with saving his life.\n\nAfter a long, complicated post-operative period, he is recuperating at home and gaining strength, and is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nThe Grammy-winning Spears announced her new Vegas residency in October, and had planned to perform 32 shows at the Park Theater at Park MGM starting in February.\n\nHer new residency poster was projected onto the side of the Park MGM, paired with some of her greatest hits, including Toxic, ...Baby One More Time, Slave 4 U and Circus.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2018, she wound up her Piece of Me residency at Planet Hollywood in Vegas, with a record 248 shows.\n\nHer success as an artist and performer mirrors her success at stabilizing her personal life and mental health, after suffering a public breakdown in 2008 that put her on an involuntary psychiatric hold at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nBefore that, there were public breakups, one quickie marriage later annulled, a second marriage that later led to a toxic divorce, two kids, a custody battle, one shambolic reality TV show, and a split from a longtime manager. At one chaotic point in her life, she was photographed shaving her own head at a Los Angeles hair salon.\n\nBut over the last decade under her father's supervision, along with lawyer Andrew Wallet, Spears has stabilized, and her career has boomed.\n\nSince 2008, she's released multiple albums, done two world tours, been a mentor on The X Factor for a reported $15 million payout, joined the new era of Las Vegas residencies, and renewed her contract with RCA Records.\n\nPlus, her empire, including perfume and a lingerie line in her name, continues to grow.\n\nAnd she's still one of those polite celebrities, careful to say thank you to fans.\n\nI appreciate your prayers and support for my family during this time. Thank you, and love you all… always, she signed off in her final tweet.
The first photo of Kristen Stewart as Princess Diana in the upcoming film Spencer –and the actress' resemblance to the late royal is causing a jaw-dropping reaction.\n\nThe still, released Wednesday, from the Pablo Larraín' film shows Stewart with short blonde hair, dressed in a striking red coat and black fascinator-style hat with mesh covering her face as she looks out sideways.\n\nSpencer imagines one December 1991 weekend in Princess Diana's life where she spent Christmas with the royal family in Sandringham Estate and decided to leave Prince Charles.\n\nThe movie is a dive inside an emotional imagining of who Diana was at a pivotal turning point in her life. It is a physical assertion of the sum of her parts, which starts with her given name: Spencer, Stewart said in an emailed statement. It is a harrowing effort for her to return to herself, as Diana strives to hold onto what the name Spencer means to her.\n\nSpencer is expected to be released in Fall of 2021, ahead of the 25th anniversary of Princess Diana's death in 2022.\n\nPrincess Diana also made an appearance in Netflix's lavish retelling of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, The Crown, which contributed to the series' success in Season 4. Diana was played by Emma Corrin who, like Stewart, also bears a strong resemblance to the former princess of Wales.\n\nPrincess Diana and Prince Charles' marriage began breaking down soon after their 1981 wedding due in part to their age differences and incompatibility. She believed the Prince of Wales had returned to his former lover (and now his wife), Camilla Parker Bowles and meanwhile she embarked on affairs with other men.\n\nIn December 1992, the prime minister announced the couple's separation.\n\nIn November 1995, BBC's newsmagazine Panorama aired Martin Bashir's interview with Diana at Kensington Palace, which had been planned and carried out in secrecy. During the conversation, she gave her most famous quote in regards to the love triangle with her soon-to-be ex-husband and his longtime love, Camilla Parker Bowles: Well, there were three of us in the marriage so it was a bit crowded.\n\nBy the end of 1995, after each of them had done TV interviews that shocked the nation and embarrassed the monarchy, the queen ordered the couple to divorce. It was a step Diana always said she didn't want to take, but the couple were divorced in July 1996.\n\nThe following year in August 1996, the terms of the royal divorce are finalized. Diana is awarded a lump-sum settlement of $22.5 million in cash, as well as about $600,000 a year earmarked to maintain her private office in addition to receiving permission to continue living in their Kensington Palace apartment. She agreed to give up any future claim of being queen. However, she was stripped of the title Her Royal Highness and was henceforth referred to as Diana, Princess of Wales, seen as a petty move on the part of the palace.\n\nA little over a year later, in August 1997, Diana was killed in a car wreck in a Paris traffic tunnel.\n\nContributing: Elise Brisco, Maria Puente, Kelly Lawler and Jayme Deerwester, USA TODAY
Sandra Harwitt\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\n\nMELBOURNE - Venus Williams acknowledges that her sister Serena might be younger, but in many ways she's actually the more mature sibling.\n\nThat admission came to light when the elder Venus, fresh off a tough 7-6 (5), 7-5 first-round win over Kateryna Kozlova of Ukraine, was asked her feelings about baby sis beating her to the altar.\n\nSerena Williams spent part of the offseason in Rome where Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian popped the question at the very spot where the couple first set eyes on each other.\n\nShe's much smarter than I am, Venus said of her sister. She's a wise woman. She's actually getting a real life. She's paving the way, once again, for me. Maybe I'll grow up.\n\nIs it possible that Venus, unlike Serena, is holding herself back from finding true love?\n\nYou know, you can't plan these things, Williams said. You just have to live and see what happens.\n\nSerena Williams focused on winning, not her engagement\n\nThanks to Reddit, we can all now see Serena Williams' engagement ring\n\nAs has always been the case with the Williams sisters, jealousy just doesn't seem to have a place in their family dynamics. The 17th-ranked Williams not only appears genuinely happy for Serena finding her guy, but she offered a stamp of approval for the future husband.\n\nHe's a super nice guy, Venus said. You never know how the things are going to end. In this case, it's not gonna end, so it's great.\n\nWilliams even indicated she'd be open to the Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., abode she currently shares with Serena becoming the couple's official home, too, which seems sitcom scenario worthy.\n\nI haven't asked any questions, because that's kind of up to them,: Williams said. They don't need any pressure from me or family members, like do this, do that. They have to figure out life together. That's their job.\n\nI just kind of go with the flow, Venus added. I can always get to a plane if she moves somewhere else.\n\nDespite the fun of conversations about marriage, for Venus Williams on a Monday in Melbourne, the word love was only related to tennis.\n\nThis marked the second consecutive Grand Slam Williams played the 101st-ranked Kozlova. Williams won both first-round encounters, although the U.S. Open outing required three-sets to acquire victory.\n\nWilliams posted 38 winners to 48 unforced errors in the 1 hour, 59 minute match in which she trailed 4-2 in the first set, and initially squandered a 3-1 lead in the second set, before winning the final two games of the match.\n\nI really have to give it to her for playing a match that was not a lot of errors and just relentless,Williams said. I guess when I walk out there I have to expect that from my opponents. It's not an easy first round, but a great first round to get through, for sure.\n\nBeyond love and marriage talk on the day, the prominent issue related to Williams is that she's still happy to grind it out on the tennis tour at age 36. A seven-time Grand Slam champion, Williams' conquered the energy-zapping auto-immune disease Sjogren's syndrome diagnosed in 2011 to return to the upper echelon of the game.\n\nAnd for now she's planning on staying put.\n\nEvery player who is here wants to be here, Williams said. Each player in the draw has an unbelievable ability to play tennis. There are some that have won more championships than others, but it's because we know how to play this game, and it's pretty serious stuff for us.\n\nI will (retire) at some point, she added. I just don't know when.\n\nMaybe she's waiting to move on until the time she finds her own love match.
Robert Powell\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ: I am 73 and receive Social Security. My wife passed away in January 2015. She was receiving her own Social Security. After I reported her death to the local Social Security office I never was told if I should receive a spousal benefit from her Social Security.\n\nShe and her deceased husband had owned their own business for many years. Her benefits increased in 2008 after we married and changed her status.\n\nShould I have been getting a spousal benefit added to my Social Security based on a percentage of hers? Once we reported her death to the local office, her benefits ceased in February 2015. I have not received anything after that. After we were married in 2008, she did receive a large lump sum payment of several thousand from Social Security. Can I still have this corrected if I am entitled to anything? – Ron Angus\n\nA: So, it's common for beneficiaries to confuse spousal with survivor benefits. And your questions, says Rob Kron, a managing director with BlackRock, are a perfect illustration of this confusion.\n\nIndividual benefits are payable based upon your own work record, while spousal and survivor benefits are payable based on someone else's, says Kron.\n\nNow, given the information you provided, Kron can't be certain of your exact circumstances. But he was able to clarify some things. If your wife were collecting or eligible to collect an individual benefit when she passed away, then you would have become eligible for a survivor benefit rather than a spousal benefit, says Kron. Given that survivor benefits and individual benefits can't be combined, when she passed away, you probably continued to collect your own benefit because it was larger than the survivor benefit you would have been entitled to receive from her.\n\nNow it's hard to determine what type of benefit your wife was collecting when she passed away. The large lump sum she received when they got married in 2008 leads me to believe it was a survivor benefit, based on the work history of her deceased husband with whom she owned the business, says Kron. Large lump sums usually come from correcting a mistake. It is possible that she was not collecting the survivor benefit after the previous husband passed away and that fact came to light when reviewing her benefit options after the 2008 marriage. Not only could that have resulted in an increased monthly benefit, but also a lump sum for some – and possibly all – the missed payments. This assumes she was over the age of 60 when they got married in 2008.\n\nThere are other possible scenarios, but it's hard to be certain, says Kron.\n\nAs for your question about getting a spousal benefit added to your benefit after you got married, it is important to understand that spousal and individual benefits are not added together. They are actually netted against one another, says Kron. So, unless her individual benefit was significantly larger than your benefit, you would not have been able to take advantage of a spousal benefit. Additionally, you would have had to wait a year after your marriage to be eligible.\n\nAll that being said, Kron recommends that you make an appointment with your local Social Security office to review your situation and see if you are missing out on benefits you could be collecting. For instance, you might able to receive a special lump-sum death payment of $255 if your meet certain requirements.

WASHINGTON — Sen. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg found out what it's like to finish at the top in Iowa: you're targeted by your rivals in New Hampshire.\n\nThe Vermont senator and the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor were often on the receiving end of attacks from the other five candidates on the debate stage at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H.\n\nSanders had to defend his electability as a democratic socialist and the expected large price tag on his proposals, such as Medicare for All.\n\nButtigieg had to defend his record on race as mayor and his relative lack of political experience on the national stage.\n\nAnd former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg took hits even though he wasn't on stage, as rivals criticized him for spending tens of millions to win the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nI don't think anybody ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said in a line that drew hearty applause from the audience. I don't think a billionaire ought to be able to do it and I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to do it.\n\nMore:A New Hampshire primary win is key for multiple Democrats. Here's what we know\n\nThe debate comes four days before New Hampshire holds the first-in-the-nation primary.\n\nIn the first few minutes of the debate, former vice president Joe Biden, who stumbled to a fourth-place finish in Iowa, acknowledged he won't win New Hampshire.\n\nI'll probably take a hit here, said Biden who is pinning his hopes on stronger finishes in Nevada (Feb. 22) and South Carolina (Feb. 29) where more diverse populations could give him a boost.\n\nThe debate could also be the last for long shots Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, who also got the least amount of speaking time.\n\nHere are some highlights from the night.\n\nKlobuchar on Trump: 'He blames the king of Denmark, who does that?'\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar said that she believes the United States' needs friends in the world.\n\nHer comments came after billionaire Tom Steyer criticized Trump's strategy of isolating the United States.\n\nKlobuchar said that instead of having allies, we have a president that literally blames everyone in the world.\n\nHe blames Barack Obama for everything that goes wrong, Klobuchar said of Trump. He blames his federal reserve chair he appointed himself. He blames the king of Denmark, who does that?\n\nHe blames the prime minister of Canada for, he claims, cutting him out of Home Alone 2, who does that? she continues. That's what Donald Trump does.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nCandidates team up against Bloomberg — and his money\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg wasn't on stage but the candidates were eager to talk about the billionaire presidential candidate who is spending tens of millions to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nI don't think anybody ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination or to be president of the United States, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a line that drew hearty applause from the audience. I don't think a billionaire ought to be able to do it and I don't think people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns ought to do it.\n\nThe Massachusetts senator known for her consumer activism also criticized her rivals for accepting money from PACs that can spend without limits.\n\nPut your money where your mouth and say is and say not to PACs, she said as she asked viewers to send $5 to her campaign and bemoaned the influence of big money in campaigns. Understand this, our democracy hangs in the balance.\n\nI can't stand the big money in politics, Sen. Amy Klobuchar agreed.\n\nI just simply think people don't look at the guy in the White House and say, 'can we get someone richer? the Minnesota senator said.' I don't think they think that. They want to have someone they can understand.\n\nBernie Sanders tried to turn the criticism of wealthy people to Pete Buttigieg.\n\nI don't have 40 billionaires, Pete, contributing to my campaign.\n\nButtigieg responded that Donald Trump and his allies raised $25 million just on Friday.\n\nWe need to go into that fight with everything we've got, the former mayor said.\n\nButtigieg also disputed the suggestion that his campaign is fueled by rich people. As the only person on stage who is not a millionaire or billionaire, Buttigieg said, he knows something about building a movement. Because mayor of South Bend is not exactly a powerhouse fundraising position. Buttigieg said he is standing on the stage because of the thousands of average people who contributed.\n\n-- Ledyard King, Savannah Behrmann and Maureen Groppe\n\nSteyer pushes Biden on supporter's 'racist' comments\n\nTom Steyer took Joe Biden to task for a comment made by one of his backers in South Carolina. State Sen. Dick Harpootlian questioned what was behind Steyer's payments to another state legislator.\n\nMr. Money Bags a.k.a @TomSteyer has paid S.C. State Rep. Jerry Govan almost $50,000 for a month worth of work? Is he pocketing the dough or redistributing the wealth? cc: Steyer FEC report, Harpootlian tweeted\n\nSome members of the state's black caucus thought that was a racially charged attack by implying Govan had done something illegal or wrong.\n\nSteyer challenged Biden to come with me and the Legislative Black Caucus and disavow Dick Harpootlian.\n\nBiden countered that Steyer should join him in the overwhelming support he has from that black caucus. Biden said he has double the support that Steyer or anyone else has, which prompted Bernie Sanders to interject that several members of the black caucus support him.\n\nSteyer called Harpootlian's remarks openly racist and again called on Biden to do the right thing.\n\nBiden said he's already talked to Harpootlian and I believe he's sorry for what he said.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nButtigieg says 'systemic racism' part of why drug arrests went up in first mayoral year\n\nPete Buttigieg pointed to systemic racism as one of the reasons why marijuana drug arrests went up in the first year he was mayor of South Bend, Indiana.\n\nThere is no question that systemic racism has penetrated to every level of our system and my city was not immune, Buttigieg said.\n\nBut when asked specifically why marijuana drug arrests went up during the first year of his tenure, Buttigieg said that one of the strategies that his community adopted was to target gun violence and gang violence.\n\nWe adopted a strategy that said that drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder, Buttigieg said. These are all connected. But so are all the things that need to change.\n\nWarren was then asked whether it was a substantial answer from Buttigieg, who has been struggling to gain support among black voters.\n\nWarren simply said: No, which was followed by a wave of applause.\n\nYou have to own up to the facts, Warren said. And it's important to own up to the facts of how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system.\n\nIn addition, Yang used the moment to plug his Freedom Dividend which would provide $1,000 per month to every American over 18.\n\nWe can't regulate (racial disparity) away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos, and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities, he said addressing Warren.\n\nBillionaire Tom Steyer teed up the questioning, taking the discussion away from the Supreme Court to questioning why race wasn't being discussed more substantially.\n\nWe have not said one word about race, Steyer said. Not one word.\n\nThe night is still is young, many questions to come, a moderator said, before throwing it over to Linsey Davis, who asked a question about race.\n\n-- by Rebecca Morin and Ledyard King\n\nSpeaking time halfway through the debate\n\nHalfway through the three-hour debate, Pete Buttigieg was leading the pack with nearly 16 minutes of speaking time.\n\nFollowing closely behind were Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, with nearly 15 minutes each.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren followed at 11 minutes, while Tom Steyer and Sen. Amy Klobuchar were both at almost nine minutes.\n\nAndrew Yang, who received only 1% in Iowa, had only spoken for five minutes.\n\n-- Savannah Behrmann\n\nStrong support for Roe v. Wade\n\nThe candidates came out strongly in favor of abortion rights, with Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren saying their Supreme Court nominees would have to support abortion rights.\n\nIt's a woman's right to do that. Period, Biden said.\n\nAmy Klobuchar said she would only appoint judges that respect precedent, and that includes Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision saying women have a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe candidates also all backed legislation enshrining that right in law.\n\nButtigieg was asked about his proposal to expand the Supreme Court. He said it's not a partisan move because he wants to also change the structure of the court so not all the justice are chosen through a political process.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nDrug crisis front and center in New Hampshire\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, who has often talked about her father's alcoholism, said she would put a special emphasis on substance abuse treatment as president.\n\nSpeaking in a state where 467 people died of drug overdoses in 2017, the Minnesota Democrat said she would devote nearly $100 billion to combat opioid addiction. She explained how she would raise the money from closing tax loopholes and using money from n upcoming.\n\nThe people of New Hampshire and the people of our country deserve better, she said. I will get this done. And it's personal for me.\n\nAndrew Yang was asked how he would implement his required three-day treatment for those arrest for drug use. There aren't enough beds in New Hampshire or the nation to handle that, he was told.\n\nYang said he could take money from drug companies that have profited from the addiction epidemic.\n\nThe epidemic, he said, is not a money problem but a human problem.\n\nPete Buttigieg was asked about his proposal to decriminalize drugs: Does that include heroin, meth and cocaine?\n\nButtigieg said it still wouldn't be lawful to produce or distribute such drugs. Without explaining how he would deal with drug users, Buttigieg talked about holding responsible drug companies who suppressed evidence of the addictiveness of their opioid medicines.\n\nThat has to happen, he said, even as the nation realizes that drug addiction is a medical issue, not a moral failure of those battling addiction, he said.\n\n-- Ledyard King and Maureen Groppe\n\nSanders pressed about his record on guns\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders was asked about his gun control views in the past, including voting against background checks and a waiting period for buying firearms in his past.\n\nI come, like New Hampshire, from a very, very rural state Bernie explained. In Vermont, until last ... two years ago, we had virtually no gun control legislation at all. I represented that perspective.\n\nHe continued that The world has changed and my views have changed.\n\nThe bottom line is that I will not be intimidated by the NRA, he concluded. We're going to run the gun policy that the American people want.\n\nHowever, Biden continued to hit Sanders on his track record, slamming him for voting against the ability to sue gun manufacturers, and the Brady Bill That mandated federal background checks on firearm purchasers.\n\nThink of all of the thousands and thousands of people who died! Biden declared. While you were representing your constituency, in a gun state, in fact, all those folks in California, New York, Pennsylvania, they're getting killed by the thousands during that same period.\n\nWe have to be held accountable for the things we did, Biden continued.\n\n-- Savannah Behrmann\n\nCandidates show love for Bernie following Clinton criticism\n\nSanders' fellow candidates showed him some love when the moderates brought up 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's criticism of his track record, saying Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done.\n\nBiden gave Sanders a quick side hug, the pair lightly laughing.\n\nKlobuchar also quipped, I like Bernie just fine!\n\nThe two Senators then joked about whether it was the Sanders-Klobuchar amendment or Klobuchar-Sanders on a bill they worked on together\n\n--Savannah Behrmann\n\nButtigieg avoids attacking Biden in moment of unity\n\nPete Buttigieg passed up a chance to attack Joe Biden over the issue of impeachment and the fact that Republicans are continuing to delve into Biden and his son's activities in Ukraine. Buttigieg was asked if it's risky for Democrats to nominate someone under investigation.\n\nNo, he said. And we won't let them change the subject.\n\nButtigieg said he and Biden are competitors but we've got to draw a line here. Republicans' efforts to turn a father against a son, he said, is the kind of dishonorable behavior that shows why Democrats need to win in November.\n\nBiden thanked Buttigieg and agreed that Republicans are trying to create a diversion.\n\nHe brought up Trump's firing today of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine policy officer on the National Security Counsel. The nation should give Vindman a medal, Biden said, not Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio talk show host honored by Trump at Tuesday's State of the Union address.\n\nBiden encouraged the audience to stand up and clap for Vindman. That's who we are, Biden said, and it's not what Trump is.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nSteyer questions Buttigieg's ability to go 'toe-to-toe' with Trump\n\nBusinessman Tom Steyer, who is polling near the bottom of the field, took on Pete Buttigieg, who is surging following his strong showing in Iowa.\n\nThe issue here … is not about who has the best health care plan. All the health care plans are better. A million times better, Steyer said. The question is who can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Trump. Who can take down Mr. Trump because he's the real threat to the country.\n\nAnd let me say you have to have experience to take him down, Steyer continued, directing his criticism to the 38-year-old, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor. This is not a question of 'he's nice guy who's going to listen.' We need people with experience that's why I'm worried about Mayor Pete. You need to be able to go toe- to-toe with this guy and take him down or we're going to lose.\n\nButtigieg responded he can win based on his military service and his experience running an industrial Midwest city that is the exact kind of community that (Trump) pretends to speak for but turns is back on.\n\nIf we want to beat this president we've got to be ready to move on form the playbook we've relied on in the past,' Buttigieg said. And unify this country around a new and better vision.\n\nSteyer is also running an ad this week in New Hampshire calling Buttigieg an untested newcomer.\n\n-- Ledyard King\n\nSenators highlight Romney's 'courage' after impeachment trial\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar dismissed former mayor Pete Buttigieg's assertion that non-Washington experience is best for meeting the moment for the White House, highlighting the experience and courage that came from the Senate impeachment trial.\n\nWe had a moment these past few weeks, mayor, and that moment was these impeachment hearings Klobuchar said. There was courage that you saw from only a few people.\n\nThere was courage from Doug Jones, our friend of Alabama, who took that tough vote. There was courage from Mitt Romney, who took a very, very difficult vote [on impeachment], Klobuchar said, highlighting that Buttigieg said the trials were exhausting to watch.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney was the sole GOP vote for convicting Trump on one count earlier this week, while Sen. Doug Jones was considered a potential swing vote serving in a staunchly red state.\n\nThe other senators on the stage also mentioned Romney's vote Friday night.\n\nWarren stated that all-but-one of her GOP colleagues locked arms by voting for acquittal. Sanders declared Republicans knew Donald Trump is a crook but didn't have the guts, with the exception of Romney, to vote against him.\n\n--Savannah Behrmann\n\nAndrew Yang says throwing presidents in jail is not an 'American tradition'\n\nEntrepreneur Andrew Yang said that he is not opposed of presidents being investigated, but there should be limits to it and you have to see what the facts are on the ground after you assume office.\n\nThe question came after Sen. Elizabeth Warren was asked whether investigating President Donald Trump is the best way to unify the country. Warren said she believes that no one is above the law.\n\nWe need to reestablish the rule of law in this country, Warren said.\n\nYang was asked about his past comments where he said that a leader throwing a past president before them in jail is not the way things are done in the United States.\n\nDoes that mean that any alleged conduct by the president or his administration should not be investigated? said moderator Linsey Davis.\n\nYang said that countries that have thrown past presidents into jail have generally been developing countries.\n\nUnfortunately that's a pattern that once you establish is very, very hard to break, he said. What's a more American tradition, we move the country forward, we don't focus on the mistakes of the president leaving office.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nBiden, Sanders spar on Medicare for All — again\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden slammed Sen. Bernie Sanders for his signature policy, Medicare for All, saying that the Vermont senator has yet to say how he is going to pay for it.\n\nBernie says you have to bring people together and we have to have Medicare for All, Biden said. And he says he wrote the damn thing, but he's unwilling to say what the damn thing is going to cost.\n\nBiden claims that Sanders has said we'll figure it out later in terms of how much his bill will cost. Biden also doubted that Sanders could get Medicare for All passed, noting that he busted my neck to get the Affordable Care Act passed.\n\nSanders, however, said that if we do what Joe wants, the United States will spend $50 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nWe are spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country, Sanders said. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the health care industry last year made $100 billion dollars in profit.\n\nSanders said that Medicare for All would same the American people substantial sums of money.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar also piled on, saying Medicare for All does not have widespread support like Sanders has said it does.\n\nI keep listening to the same debate, and it's not real, she said, adding that two-thirds of the Democrats in the Senate have yet to sign onto Sanders' bill.\n\n-- Rebecca Morin\n\nThe debate over old vs. new\n\nPete Buttigieg made the case for generational change, arguing for a perspective that will leave behind the politics of the past and turn the page.\n\nJoe Biden had a wide grin on his face when Buttigieg said he's not the right candidate if voters are looking for the person with the most Washington establishment experience. But he is if they want a different perspective.\n\nThe politics of the past were not all that bad, Biden responded. He mentioned legislation he worked on to ban chemical weapons and fight violence against women. He also touted his early support for same sex marriage.\n\nI don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden is so bad, Biden said.\n\nButtigieg countered that the last Democratic administration was successful because it met the moment.\n\nNow we have to meet this moment, and this moment is different, he said.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nSanders: Trump 'lies all the time'\n\nBernie Sanders was asked if Democrats should fret if he wins the nomination given how President Donald Trump has already gone after the Vermont senator who describes himself as a democratic socialist.\n\nThose hits are going to keep coming if you're the nominee, moderator George Stephanopoulos asked the senator. Why shouldn't Democrats be worried?\n\nBecause Donald Trump lies all the time, Sanders retorted. He will say terrible things about Joe (Biden). He has (said) ugly, disgusting things about Elizabeth (Warren).\n\nAt the end of the day … everybody up here is united, Sanders continued. No matter who wins this damn thing, we're all going to stand together to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar raised her hand when the candidates were asked who would be afraid of a socialist running as the party's candidate in November.\n\nI think we are not going to be able to out-divide the divider in chief, and I think we need someone to head up this ticket that actually brings people with her, instead of shutting them out Klobuchar answered, continuing that, Donald Trump's worst nightmare is a candidate who will bring people in from the middle.\n\n-- Ledyard King and Savannah Behrmann\n\nButtigieg goes after Sanders\n\nPete Buttigieg wasted no time drawing a distinction between himself and Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying Democrats must unite the country, not divide it by saying if you don't go all the way to the end, it doesn't count.\n\nAre you talking about Sanders? he was asked.\n\nYes, Buttigieg replied.\n\nSanders disputed the description.\n\nNeedless to say, I've never said that, he responded.\n\nSanders said the way to bring people together is with an agenda that works for working people, not billionaires.\n\nBefore the debate, Sanders had accused Buttigieg of being beholden to wealthy donors.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden says he probably won't win New Hampshire\n\nIn the opening minute of the debate, former Vice President Joe Biden – already stinging from a poor showing in Iowa – acknowledged he also probably won't do well in New Hampshire Tuesday.\n\nI'll probably take a hit here, Biden said.\n\nHe pointed to the fact that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire in 2016 and represents a neighboring state.\n\nBiden said he considers not just Iowa and New Hampshire, but also Nevada and South Carolina, to be the starting point for the nominating contest. Biden is counting on his strong support from African American voters to do well in subsequent states.\n\nThe question that prompted his response was why he has criticized Sanders and Pete Buttigieg as too risky to be the nominee when they won Iowa.\n\nBiden said that Sanders' label of Democratic Socialist would hurt other Democrats lower on the ballot. And Buttigieg, Biden said, is a great guy and a patriot but is the former mayor of a small city who hasn't shown he can attract a broad spectrum of support.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nWill verbal punches be thrown?\n\nAnd now for the recurring question before each debate: Who will throw the most punches and which candidate will be the biggest target?\n\nWhen former Vice President Joe Biden was perceived as the frontrunner as the debates began last year, California Sen. Kamala Harris went after his record on busing. In the long run, the attack didn't help Harris, who dropped out in December. And Biden's poor showing in Iowa means he may go after the top Iowa finishers.\n\nBiden did that Wednesday in New Hampshire when he suggested both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg were risky choices. Biden said Sanders' identification as a Democratic Socialist would make it harder for Democrats farther down on the ballot to win. Buttigieg is a dicey choice, Biden said, because he's never held an office higher than mayor of a small city.\n\nFriday, Sanders accused Buttigieg of being beholden to rich donors.\n\nI like Pete Buttigieg, nice guy, Sanders said at an event in New Hampshire. But we are in a moment where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life.\n\nHis campaign started promoting #PetesBillionaires on Twitter.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nKey milestone:A New Hampshire primary win is key for multiple Democrats. Here's what we know\n\nVeterans courting veterans\n\nU.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who did not qualify for tonight's debate stage, is trying to get the attention of viewers in another way.\n\nGabbard launched an ad Friday morning promising to bring a soldier's values to the White House: dignity, honor, respect and service.\n\nIn her underdog campaign, Gabbard has been focusing most of her attention on New Hampshire. The state has a disproportionate share of veterans, which could help the Army veteran. But she's not the only candidate with military experience.\n\nVoteVets, the political action committee that backs liberal veterans running for office, has run ads in New Hampshire supporting Pete Buttigieg, a former Navy officer.\n\nOn Thursday, Buttigieg held a conversation with New Hampshire veterans at an American Legion Post in Merrimack.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nCandidates show force in walk up to event space\n\nAndrew Yang may be trailing distantly in the polls, but his campaign did turn out the most young enthusiasts on the two-lane road leading to Saint Anselm College, waving signs and encouraging drivers in passing cars to honk their support. No. 2 in the highway straw poll were Elizabeth Warren supporters, chanting L! I! Z! The presence required a certain amount of commitment, given the freezing rain that was falling. (It is New Hampshire, after all, and in February.)\n\nThe media filing center, set up in a gym, was set up with work spaces for 414 journalists, plus a dozen TV crews lined up along one wall.\n\n-- Susan Page\n\nNew Hampshire voters are independent in more ways than one\n\nDemocrats may not be the only New Hampshire voters paying close attention to tonight's debate. The state allows independents – voters not registered as Democrats or Republicans – to participate in Tuesday's primary. And unaffilated voters make up the biggest chunk of the electorate.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won independents in his 2016 primary race against Hillary Clinton. But more moderate candidates -- like former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar – are targeting disaffected Republicans who've become independents. And outsider candidates like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and entrepreneur Andrew Yang could also grab some of the independent vote away from Sanders this time.\n\nNew Hampshire is independent in another way as well. The state has a reputation for going its own way by delivering surprises to the frontrunner. It famously made Bill Clinton the Comeback Kid when he finished second place during a turbulent stretch of his 1992 campaign. And just when it looked like Barack Obama had a straight shot to the nomination with his 2008 win in Iowa, New Hampshire Democrats gave the victory to Hillary Clinton instead.\n\nWhen Clinton was the frontrunner for the 2016 nomination, however, New Hampshire voters flocked to Sanders.\n\nThe latest Boston Globe/WBZ-TV/Suffolk poll released Thursday shows Sanders at 24% with Buttigieg close behind at 23%. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was the choice of 13% and Biden was picked by 11%. No other candidate was in double digits.\n\nIn an NBC News/Marist poll released hours before the debate, Sanders led with 25%, Buttigieg got 21%, Warren had 14% and Biden was at 13%.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nWho will be on stage and what's at stake\n\nWith the chaos of the Iowa caucuses (mostly) in the rear-view mirror, the top candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination appear on stage tonight for a debate in New Hampshire four days before the Granite State holds the first-in-the-nation primary Tuesday.\n\nNew Hampshire could be the moment where Iowa's top finishers – former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders – separate themselves from the pack. Or where Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden regain their footing after third and fourth places finishes in Iowa, respectively.\n\nIt could also mark the end of the line for Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang. Klobuchar out-performed her polling in Iowa but still walked away with only 1 national delegate. Yang left Iowa with 0.\n\nThe candidates' order on stage was determined not by the Iowa results but by averaging the results of polls taken nationally and in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nThat put Biden in the center, flanked by Sanders and Warren. They're sharing the stage with Buttigieg, Klobuchar, Yang and businessman Tom Steyer.\n\nYang, who was absent from the Iowa debate last month, met the qualifications for New Hampshire which included polling and donor thresholds.\n\nMore:In New Hampshire primary, could Pete Buttigieg end Joe Biden's 50-year political career?\n\nModerators include George Stephanopoulos, World News Tonight Anchor, ABC Managing Editor David Muir and ABC News Live Anchor Linsey Davis. Joining them will be WMUR-TV Political Director Adam Sexton and WMUR-TV News Anchor Monica Hernandez.\n\nThe focus on New Hampshire could be welcome news for Democrats who saw the Senate acquit President Donald Trump Wednesday and watched as Iowa's caucuses disintegrated into confusion following multiple issues that delayed election results.
The divorce between Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos and wife, MacKenzie, may be more complicated than originally expected.\n\nThe couple, who have been married 25 years, announced their divorce Wednesday over Twitter. They had been separated but are now making it official, their statement said.\n\nAs our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends, they said.\n\nSubsequent news reports suggest the timing of their announcement may have been forced. The National Enquirer is publishing in its latest edition, out Thursday, what it calls a four-month investigation tracking Bezos's time spent with former Fox L.A. TV anchor Lauren Sanchez, the wife of Hollywood talent agent Patrick Whitesell.\n\nMore:Target, Costco report strong holiday season sales to round out year\n\nMore:January specials: Your monthly guide to freebies and meal deals\n\nMore:10 Amazon products under $30 that people are obsessing over\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox every morning.\n\nSome considered it an unlikely coincidence that the Enquirer, which has in the past cozied up to President Trump, would invest such time investigating Bezos who has been a Trump target. Trump has lumped The Washington Post, owned by Bezos, within the a mainstream media that is the enemy of the people. And he has attacked Amazon, saying it has taken advantage of too-low shipping delivery rates from the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nDavid Pecker, chairman and CEO of the Enquirer's parent company, American Media, has told prosecutors he helped deal with negative stories that could have hurt Trump's presidential campaign. He and Dylan Howard, American Media's chief content officer, whose name was among those included in the byline of Thursday's Enquirer story on Bezos, were among those given immunity by federal prosecutors in the criminal case against former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nIt was thought that Pecker has turned on the president, suggested a story last month in The Washington Post. This new development suggests maybe not? posed New York magazine in its own story Thursday.\n\nWhen New York magazine asked American Media whether the piece was done to please Trump, the company responded with a statement that the story underscores the kind of investigative reporting that the publication has long been known for.\n\nTrump weighed in on the Bezos' divorce Thursday telling reporters: I wish him luck. It's going to be a beauty.\n\nSanchez and Whitesell are also divorcing, according to several outlets including People.com. The couple owned a home in Seattle and have socialized with the Bezoses in the past, the New York Post reported.\n\nSanchez, 49, also a helicopter pilot with her own aerial production firm, was hired to shoot aerial shots for Blue Origin, a private space company Bezos founded in 2000, the Post reported. She served as the initial host on Fox's So You Think You Can Dance, and has been a contributor to TV shows including The View, Larry King Live, Showbiz Tonight, and The Joy Behar Show.\n\nSanchez and Whitesell married in 2005 and have two children, but have not filed for divorce as of now, Fox News reported. She has a teenage son from her first marriage to former NFL player Tony Gonzalez.\n\nShe and Bezos were seen together in Los Angeles on Sunday, the day of the Golden Globes and at Amazon's after-party, the Post reported. Bezos made the announcement about the divorce Wednesday because he knew photos of the two would become public, the Post reported.\n\nHowever, Bezos' wife, MacKenzie, knew the two were dating, the Post quotes an unnamed person close to Bezos as saying. The news today was not a surprise to her. Lauren was with Jeff at the Golden Globes because they are dating, the person said.\n\nTMZ reported Thursday that the Bezoses did not have a prenuptial agreement and plan to file for divorce in Washington. While Washington state divorce law considers all that the couple builds and accrues during their marriage as community property, that doesn't necessarily mean a 50-50 split of assets – including six homes, according to Business Insider – but the court attempts to split assets (and debts), fair and equitably.\n\nThe couple could have devised a postnuptial agreement to do so on their own and likely have a deal meant to not rock Amazon. It's unlikely there's any risk to the company, said Stuart Slotnick, chairman of the matrimonial department of law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney in New York City. When you are talking over $100 billion there is enough to go around.\n\nEven if MacKenzie Bezos should eventually depart with half of Bezos' wealth, valued at $137 billion atop Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, the Amazon founder would remain among the top four most wealthy.\n\nAnd, should Amazon's shares continue to rise, Fortune noted, he could again overtake Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the world's richest man.\n\nMore:How much could Mackenzie Bezos get in divorce with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos?\n\nMore:Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and wife MacKenzie to divorce after 25 years of marriage\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.
James S. Robbins\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nIs America ready for a socialist presidential candidate? Democrats squared off on the issue Wednesday night in Las Vegas. Democratic front-runner Bernie Sanders embraced the label of democratic socialist and said that in many ways the country is socialist already, if you are among the wealthy. Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg stood up for capitalism, as did, surprisingly, Elizabeth Warren. Other Democratic candidates might prefer to self-describe as progressive or to avoid labels altogether, but the exchanges on stage illustrated the longstanding stresses in the party over terminology, tactics and the balance between ideology and pragmatism.\n\nRegardless of the label, socialist ideas clearly have a home in the Democratic Party. Every candidate in the debate promoted plans that would increase government management of the economy, in some cases dramatically. And a recent Gallup poll found that 76% of Democrats would back a socialist for president. Socialism is also more popular among young people than with older generations.\n\nBut socialism is far less attractive to the American public generally; the same Gallup poll showed that 53% of Americans would oppose a socialist as chief executive. In fact, socialist ranked lowest of all the characteristics Gallup tested, whether age, gender, race or religion, and was the only one facing majority opposition.\n\n'New Democrats' faction\n\nSanders' critics in the party acknowledge that his ideas fire up the progressive base but they also limit his broader appeal. For example, half the Democratic voters in the New Hampshire primary thought Sanders' policies were too liberal. But pollsters were asking the wrong question, since for progressives who support Sanders liberal is a dirty word, more appropriate for old-school compromisers like former Vice President Joe Biden. And Sanders' backers can point out that national support for their candidate has grown while Biden's has begun to collapse.\n\nSanders noted during the debate that a Wall Street Journal poll showing two-thirds of voters have reservations or are very uncomfortable with a socialist candidate also showed him with a double-digit lead over his Democratic opponents.\n\nTimes have certainly changed. At the end of the Cold War, it would have been unthinkable for a major party candidate to even mention socialism, except to condemn it.\n\nBack in 1988, only 15% of voters even identified as liberal.\n\nIn that campaign year, then-Vice President George H.W. Bush tried to court centrist Reagan Democrats by tagging Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis a tax and spend liberal. Dukakis fed the issue at first by trying to avoid the liberal label, then finally admitting it a few days before the election. Whether this cost Dukakis votes or not, the liberal brand emerged severely tarnished.\n\nDemocrats' Bernie Sanders problem:They are damned if they nominate him and damned if they don't\n\nThis helped give rise to the New Democrats faction that sought to project a more moderate image for the party. They talked up centrist triangulation and pursued policies that are anathema to today's Democrats. Archetypical New Democrat President Bill Clinton backed restricting immigration, putting more police on the streets, passing broad tax cuts, restrictive welfare reform and the Defense of Marriage Act.\n\nThen-Sen. Biden supported these policies in the 1990s and now has been forced to flee his record.\n\nA 'socialist' vs. a 'communist'\n\nThis is the background to a recent tiff between Sanders and James Carville, the stalwart New Democrat strategist who helped put Clinton in the White House. For Carville, the Sanders campaign represents the type of threat the New Democrats had sought to prevent, an ideologically driven movement that would propel an unelectable candidate to the Democratic nomination, resulting in a rout potentially as decisive as when ultra-liberal George McGovern lost 49 states to incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972.\n\nMore on Bernie:Sanders was ridiculously naive about the Soviet Union. The Trump ads write themselves.\n\nCarville said he is scared to death of the ideological drift of the party, remarking it's like we're losing our damn minds.\n\nSanders clapped back that Carville was a political hack, and Carville embraced the term, saying he is not an ideologue or a purist and adding, perhaps unfairly, at least I'm not a communist.\n\nIn this respect, Carville was echoing President Trump, who said in a pre-Super Bowl interview, I think of communism when I think of Bernie.\n\nMichael Bloomberg also brought up communism in the debate Wednesday, which Sanders called a cheap shot.\n\nSanders responded to Trump that obviously he was not a communist and added maybe the president doesn't know the difference. But does it really matter if the president can summarize the fine points of political theory distinguishing two varieties of far left-wing ideology?\n\nThis is hardly a winning issue for the Democrats. If the November election comes down to debating whether Bernie Sanders better fits the definition of a socialist or a communist, the Trump campaign has nothing to worry about.\n\nJames S.

Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNew laws take effect at the state and federal level\n\nA slew of new laws take effect in 2020. At the state level, there's mandatory composting in Vermont and child abuse registries in Georgia. But a new Labor Department rule could see a pay raise for 1.3 million workers across the country. Starting Jan. 1, more workers can qualify for overtime pay as rules raise the threshold at which employees are exempt from being paid overtime. Also Wednesday, a landmark law in California will grant consumers the right to see the personal information that companies collect about them and stop them from selling it. If companies extend these new rights to consumers outside the state, or if other states follow California's lead, the law could effectively become a national law, privacy advocates say.\n\n#MeToo for the boardroom: California gender diversity law could lead to more women quotas nationally\n\nPrefer to listen?

For those who long to reach their goals, the task is not impossible. Experts say this is how to keep your resolution: get specific (set an appropriate, measurable goal), start when you're ready (which might not be Jan. 1), and learn from your mistakes.\n\nDivorce rates spike in January\n\nJanuary has earned the nickname Divorce Month in legal circles because many couples wait until just after the holiday season to divorce. Stressors of the holiday season – including travel and spending lots of time with family – can ultimately fracture the marriage. However, it is important to note that divorces (and marriages) are on the decline. There were approximately 8% fewer divorces and annulments in 2017 compared to 2007, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nGas prices expected to stay steady in 2020\n\nFor American motorists, $3-per-gallon gasoline is becoming a distant memory. Americans are expected to pay an average of $2.60 per gallon in 2020, according to fuel-savings app GasBuddy's annual forecast, out Wednesday. Drivers haven't paid more than $3 nationwide since 2014, when prices averaged $3.36, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The highest national average price of gas was $4.11 on July 17, 2008, according to AAA. The nation's oil boom, coupled with increases in output in other countries, have kept gas prices low. The U.S. is now producing so much oil that it exported more than it imported in September, the first month that's ever happened in recorded history.\n\nIs today the start of a new decade?\n\nThe new year has been widely heralded as the start of a new decade: the 2020s. But an old timekeeping conundrum has led some to contend we're celebrating too early and that we should actually wait until Jan. 1, 2021. There is no zero in our calendar year, so the lack of a year zero means the only consistent way to measure decades — or centuries or millennia — is to start them in years ending in one, according to the 2020 new decade naysayers. Regardless of whether its the start of a new decade or not, here's a look back at some of the biggest things that happened in the 2010s:

Once again, I beg the question: Why do inane laugh-track shows get renewed (too many to list) and thoughtful, creative shows get prematurely axed?\n\nI'm also quite broken up about Downward Dog, which was a surprisingly insightful and affecting show, especially since it revolved around a talking dog. But I would say that it's not that all multi-camera sitcoms (shows with laugh tracks filmed in front of an audience) get renewed while all single-camera shows (filmed, like Dog, without an audience) get canceled. The Carmichael Show, a really excellent multi-camera show that often spoke to serious and social issues, was just canceled by NBC after three seasons. It all comes down to money, and ratings and acclaim aren't the only factors in a series' renewal or cancellation anymore. A multi-cam show like The Big Bang Theory gets renewed because it's still raking in ratings and money for CBS.\n\nHow do you feel about Steve Harvey's many shows? I do like them, but on some, the producers constantly keep showing his response to the acts ... I want to see the act, not just so much of his reaction.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of Steve Harvey in general, in part because when he hosts anything it becomes more about him than anything else. But that is a big part of his brand and appeal to his loyal fans. It's not Funderdome, it's Steve Harvey's Funderdome, for instance. If you're looking for a game show or a reality show that focuses more on the performers, I'd recommend America's Got Talent if you like singers and other weird acts or American Ninja Warrior if you like athletics. Both shows tend to focus more on the story and accomplishments of the contestants.\n\nWill wrestling fans like Netflix's GLOW?\n\nThey absolutely will. Wrestling is a cheesy sport with dedicated fans, but there are still plenty of people who don't understand what makes it so special. GLOW creators Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch (Nurse Jackie) are among the former. The show never makes fun of the wrestlers it depicts, although some of them take longer than others to come around to the idea of the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling league. Wrestling, in all its stages, celebrated repeatedly, and even for someone like me who has never really gotten into it before, is so much fun to watch. I've also heard from die-hard wrestling fans that the moves depicted are realistic for the time period and the storylines and characters are true to what used to air.\n\nWhat happened to I'm Dying Up Here? It's terrible!\n\nI never thought I'm Dying Up Here, a Showtime series about comedians trying to make it in the 1970s comedy club scene, was great to begin with. It's a drama that deals with darkest parts of trying to make it as a performer, and sometimes that includes poverty, drug abuse and serious mental-health problems. If you were intrigued by the first few episodes, the persistent melancholy can start to get depressing as the season progresses. Things are pretty bleak, and at least in the first six episodes, they don't get much lighter. This might be one of the shows where the format (hour-long drama) and subject matter (the comedy world) just don't quite mesh.
Doug Sanders, 26, of Lima, Ohio, always figured he would buy a house after getting married one day.\n\nI thought it would take two incomes, he says.\n\nAfter graduating from college, he lived at home with his parents and got a sales job that left no time for vacations or going out with friends, allowing him to sock away much of his paycheck. A year ago, he landed a job as a sales representative for a top beermaker that came with a roughly 30% raise.\n\nWhen his savings grew to $20,000, he started thinking big.\n\nI realized I had enough to put down on a house, he says. I would much rather buy than rent.\n\nLast October, Sanders, who is single, purchased a three-bedroom ranch house for $120,000 in the small, affordable city between Dayton and Toledo, putting down 20% with a little help from his parents. They say there are three big decisions in life – who you marry, buying a house and career choice, Sanders says. Having one of those knocked out early … it definitely feels good.\n\nHow to manage your 401(k):Here's what smart investors do when the stock market is hitting highs\n\nHotel on wheels:Tables, footrests, smart speakers: Self-driving cars will be loaded with creature comforts\n\nHow is the housing market?\n\nThe share of U.S. homeowners who are single hit a record 38.4% in 2018, the latest data available, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data by Haus, a company that partners with individuals to buy homes to reduce their costs. The trend largely reflects rapid growth in the portion of Americans who are single. It also highlights an improving economy and job market and the willingness of buyers to set up households in untraditional ways to overcome sharply rising housing costs.\n\nThe shift, if it persists, could shake up the housing market as builders put up more affordable homes tailored to singles and first-time buyers. From 2015 to 2018, the share of new houses less than 2,400 square feet rose to 51% from 47%, according to an analysis of census data by the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nDelaying marriage\n\nThe portion of Americans ages 18 to 34 who are single hit a record 72.3% in 2018, up from 67.2% a decade earlier and 47.6% in 1980, according to the Haus study.\n\nPeople are getting married later in life, says Ralph McLaughlin, the chief economist for Haus.\n\nSince the late 1940s, women increasingly have entered the workforce, prompting many to delay marriage, McLaughlin says. Although the share of women working or looking for a job peaked at about 60% in 2000, more are rising to higher-level positions that may require longer hours, further leading them to put off marriage and children, he says.\n\nMany older millennials struggled to land the jobs they wanted during and after the Great Recession of 2007-09, spurring them to defer marriage while they set their careers on the paths they envisioned.\n\nTop cars:These are the top 10 best new cars, trucks, SUVs of 2020, according to Consumer Reports\n\nHousing prices\n\nMany such singles still want to wait on marriage and build wealth through homeownership, taking advantage of a substantial run-up in housing prices since values hit bottom in 2012 after the real estate crash.\n\nOwning a home is a better deal than renting in most of the country, McLaughlin says.\n\nJust 35% of Americans said they would have to be married to buy a home, according to a homes.com/SurveyMonkey poll last month.\n\nAlso swelling the population of singles is the gray divorce trend. In 2018, a record 16.1% of people 55 and older were divorced, up from 13.8% a decade earlier and just 5% in 1980. Many baby boomers married early in life and sever ties after their kids reach adulthood and leave home, McLaughlin says. A divorce often produces two single homeowners as one spouse stays in the house while the other buys a condo or smaller house, or both make new purchases.\n\nSolid economy\n\nA healthy economy also fuels the rise in single homeowners. The 3.6% unemployment rate is just above a 50-year low. Annual wage growth has averaged about 3% or better since mid-2018. Unemployment in Lima, where Sanders landed the beer sales job that helped him buy a house, stood at 3.8% in December, down from 4.7% a year earlier.\n\nNationally, the share of singles ages 18 to 34 who own a home rose from 47.1% in 2014 to 48.5% in 2018 – the highest level since 2009, according to the Haus report.\n\nMaking a purchase isn't necessarily getting easier. The national median home price has climbed 54% since 2012, compared with 20% growth in average wages during that period, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). As a result, single homeowners are far more prevalent in markets with less expensive housing. In the Des Moines, Iowa, area, the average adult under 35 spends only about 19% of their monthly income on housing costs. Not surprisingly, nearly a quarter of all young adults are single homeowners in Des Moines, tops in the nation.\n\nBy contrast, less than 10% of young people are single homeowners in markets such as New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Jose, the study says.\n\nMore singles are buying homes despite the financial challenges. For single-earner households, the median single-family house cost five times as much as median income in 2018, up from four times as much in 2011, according to Fannie Mae. For dual-earner households, a single-family home cost 2.57 times as much as household income, up from 2.03 times nine years ago.\n\nJoining forces\n\nMany singles team up with partners or friends. Unmarried couples made up 9% of home purchases last year, up from 8% in 2018, according to an NAR survey. Other arrangements, such as roommates, comprised 3% of purchases in 2019, up from 2%. In some cases, both occupants own the home. In others, one owns while the other pays rent or contributes to household expenses, says Jessica Lautz, NAR's vice president of demographics and behavioral insights.\n\nPeople are getting creative, she says. It's the American dream.\n\nAfter renting together in Washington for several years, Bethany Bennett and Elizabeth Darlington, who are both in their early 30s, separately started looking for two-bedroom condos in town at prices averaging about $400,000.\n\nIt was a lot of money for a little bit of space, Bennett says. We realized if we joined forces we could get a house we really wanted.\n\nAnd I really liked the idea of having extra space I could rent out, Darlington says.\n\nIn May 2018, they bought a four-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot house in Northeast Washington for $650,000. Their individual down payment and monthly mortgage costs are about what they would have been if they had bought separate condos, but the larger space lets them have a roommate whose rent offsets about one-third of the mortgage expenses.\n\nDarlington figured the bigger home will increase in value, providing at least as much profit for each of them at resale. They've divvied up tasks: Bennett deals with certain contractors, and Darlington handles roommate searches.\n\nTax theft scheme:Tax scams try new tricks to steal refunds\n\nNicole Roeberg, an agent at Redfin, which brokered the sale, says she routinely sees such setups in Washington, one of the nation's pricier housing markets.\n\nI had a client who bought a $1 million home and was all ready with a pack of three friends who were going to pay rent, Roeberg says.
Happy birthday, Jennifer Aniston! Somewhere out there, we hope the former Friends star is sipping some bubbly and toasting her 50 years on this planet.\n\nMuch has changed for Aniston since she burst on the Must-See TV scene in 1994. As Rachel Green, she became a household name and then a bona fide movie star; she saw her love life become incessant tabloid fodder; married Brad Pitt, then famously divorced him; and years later gave matrimony another go with Justin Theroux.\n\nNow sizzling and single, Aniston has taken the reins of her narrative, pushing back when the headlines get nasty and having a heck of a time living her life in Hollywood.\n\nHere are her most inspiring quotes on life in honor of her milestone birthday.\n\nOn turning 50\n\nI don't think life stops after 50. If anything, it gets more and more exciting. For some reason, we don't honor or pay respect to aging. It's something that we look at as a negative, and yet every single person on this planet does it. ... I don't understand why it's not something that's celebrated, why there's some sort of an expiration date on who you are as a person worth watching and a story being told about you. – Glamour, 2017\n\nMore:Was Brad Pitt at Jennifer Aniston's 50th birthday party? Tongues wag over the possibility\n\nOn her house being her friends' gathering spot\n\nMy house was always like the clubhouse. I love entertaining. I always have food. I think I probably got that from my mom, who always had her girlfriends over. I picked it up from my childhood – just always hearing girls in the house and learning how to make a good cheese board. – Elle, 2018\n\nOn decades of tabloid pregnancy rumors\n\nFor the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment' and 'celebrity news.' ... The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing. The way I am portrayed by the media is simply a reflection of how we see and portray women in general, measured against some warped standard of beauty.\n\nHere's where I come out on this topic: We are complete with or without a mate, with or without a child. We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone. Let's make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples. – Huffington Post, 2016\n\nOn having children\n\nYes, I may become a mother some day, and since I'm laying it all out there, if I ever do, I will be the first to let you know. But I'm not in pursuit of motherhood because I feel incomplete in some way, as our celebrity news culture would lead us all to believe. I resent being made to feel 'less than' because my body is changing and/or I had a burger for lunch and was photographed from a weird angle and therefore deemed one of two things: 'pregnant' or 'fat.'  – Huffington Post, 2016\n\nOn her divorce from Justin Theroux\n\nWith all due respect, I'm not heartbroken. - InStyle, 2018\n\nOn her two marriages\n\nI don't feel a void. I really don't. My marriages, they've been very successful, in (my) personal opinion. And when they came to an end, it was a choice that was made because we chose to be happy, and sometimes happiness didn't exist within that arrangement anymore. Sure, there were bumps, and not every moment felt fantastic, obviously, but at the end of it, this is our one life and I would not stay in a situation out of fear. Fear of being alone. Fear of not being able to survive. To stay in a marriage based on fear feels like you're doing your one life a disservice. – Elle, 2018\n\nOn the early, early days of 'Friends'\n\nIt was called 'Friends Like Us,' at the time. I was doing (another show). We had only done six episodes and the network didn't think it was going to get picked up, so I went on auditions for second position, as they call it. I read the script, and I had never had a reaction like that to a show. It was my contemporaries, it was in New York City, it was funny, it was interesting, and I had never read anything like it. This guy named David Schwimmer was already cast, and Courteney Cox was already cast. I had seen David Schwimmer at a play at Northwestern because my friend was going there.\n\nYes, 'Friends' is leaving Netflix:How Warner streaming could affect your shows\n\nAnd then, (that other show) ended up getting picked up, even though they had cast me in 'Friends.' So, there was a period where I had to stand out the group photographs. I had phone calls from girlfriends saying, 'I'm auditioning for your part in Friends. Do you have any ideas?' I was actually surprised that they were considering replacing me. But then, thank God, they didn't find anyone. They just took the chance that (the other show) would fail after the two episodes that they had picked it up for. I just did this back and forth with Sony and Warner Bros. for two weeks, and then it went away, poof, and 'Friends' went great. I had 10 years of the best schooling in the world. – Collider, 2015\n\nOn 'The Rachel'\n\nI was not a fan of the 'Rachel.' That was kind of cringe-y for me. Looking back – honestly, even during that time – I couldn't do it on my own. I needed (my hairstylist) Chris (McMillan) attached to my hip. Left to my own devices, I am not skilled with a hairbrush and blow-dryer. – Glamour, 2015\n\nOn liking what she likes, OK?\n\nI'm a creature of habit. A weird creature of habit. I don't fix what's not broken and I don't care what people think and I don't care if people want me to change my hair. I like Californian blonde highlights. It's just cozy and it makes me feel better. And every time I tried other ones – that bob – I just go, Why did I do that? I've got very wavy hair so it creates a challenge when styling but when it's long, I can go wavy or natural or straight and it will sort of just behave. I don't know, I like what I like. It's sort of comforting – the consistence. – Vogue, 2017\n\nOn being pro-'Friends' reunion\n\nI fantasize about it. It really was the greatest job I ever had. I don't know what it would look like today, but you never know. So many shows are being successfully rebooted. ... I know Matt LeBlanc doesn't want to be asked that question anymore. But maybe we could talk him into it. Or we just give it some time and then Lisa (Kudrow), Courteney (Cox), and I could reboot 'The Golden Girls 'and spend our last years together on wicker furniture. – InStyle 2018
Jim Obergefell\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nFor years, Valentine's Day has been the target of the modern pessimist's wrath. It has become the focus of the cynic's ire, an unnecessary moment that foists obligation upon millions of consumers to prove their love with purchases of chocolates and flowers.\n\nBut for millions of same-sex couples and LGBT people everywhere, it's about so much more.\n\nIt's a day to honor and embrace the legacy of love created by a series of landmark Supreme Court decisions that recognize the virtues of all loving relationships in the eyes of our government. It's a moment to remind ourselves that we are free to love whom we love, to celebrate and embrace that love, and to understand what it truly means to achieve equal dignity in the eyes of the law.\n\nThe greatest Valentine's Day messages aren't found in a greeting card or scribbled on the back of a heart-shaped box. They're enshrined in decision after decision that the court has set forth, decisions that protect our dignity and common humanity.\n\nMore:For Valentine's Day, my wife gave me a marriage performance review\n\nMore:Attention Valentine's Day shoppers, that jewelry might have a bleak backstory\n\nRising from the most basic human needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes and aspirations, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his 2015 decision in my case, which was brought with dozens of other same-sex couple plaintiffs. Same-sex couples, too, may aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage … They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\n\nTwo years earlier, in the decision in United States v. Windsor, Kennedy wrote, For same-sex couples who wished to be married, the State acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful status ... worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages. He further concluded that the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, which required the federal government to treat married same-sex couples as though they were not legally married, (imposed) a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States, and therefore violated the Constitution.\n\nKennedy's words are more important today than ever before, now that many LGBT people feel their rights are becoming increasingly vulnerable. These words and these decisions, taken together, have created an America that has come closer than ever before to lifting up and celebrating humanity, kindness, respect, and equality for everyone — including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\n\nThese words have cemented a legacy that reinforces the very best of our nation's values: an undying commitment to the pursuit of equality, fairness and liberty, for everyone.\n\nAnd these decisions have helped usher in an era of greater understanding and acceptance of LGBT people, and have helped to trigger a larger cultural shift in the conversation around LGBT rights and protections.\n\nFor me personally, Kennedy's words recognized and legitimized my own loving relationship as one that is worthy and deserving of the same protections and privileges afforded every other couple. It was bittersweet that his words came after my husband John had passed. Still, Kennedy's decision reinforced a commitment by the high court to recognize the virtue of all loving relationships, and to protect the dignity of all citizens when they fulfill their own desires to commit themselves, as I did — in this life, and beyond — to the person they love.\n\nThese words have real and lasting impact on me and millions of people who understand that we are all protected and served by the Constitution.\n\nAnd in the coming months, the Supreme Court will again hand down a decision, this time in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, that will also have real and lasting impact on millions of LGBT people — myself included.\n\nDespite the extraordinary progress cemented by the Supreme Court, this case illuminates the reality that progress will continue to be challenged by those who seek to dictate which couples are deserving of fair and equal treatment under the law, and which aren't.\n\nMore:Listen to Nick Foles, not social media. Failure helps you succeed.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nThe case will ultimately decide whether a business owner can cite personal religious objections to refuse service to same-sex couples. The decision could seriously undermine the court's earlier rulings, including my case, in favor of the freedom to marry and equal dignity.\n\nCould a restaurant turn away two women who want to eat dinner? Could a flower shop refuse to sell me a Valentine's Day bouquet because I am purchasing flowers for the man I love?\n\nThe opportunities for discrimination are virtually limitless, and could ripple far beyond the LGBT community as well. Could a photography studio say it will do head shots only for men, not women, based on its religious belief that women should not work outside the home?\n\nIf the court sides with the bakery, it would undermine the court's prior assertions that the Constitution protects the dignity and equality of same-sex couples.\n\nAnd although the court's decision remains to be seen, there is hope and optimism that it will continue building on its legacy, adding another brick to the fortress that it has built to shield millions of loving couples from discrimination, humiliation and indignity.\n\nI have faith that the court will reinforce its legacy and ensure that Valentine's Day will continue celebrating the love, fidelity and devotion of all couples.\n\nSo this Valentine's Day, when the cynics rattle off tired talking points of a holiday that preys upon the pocketbooks of people, just remind them that the greatest gifts are those that we cannot purchase.\n\nFor its part, the Supreme Court has gifted a legacy of love — and that is a gift that has been given to us all.\n\nJim Obergefell was the lead plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage across the United States in 2015. Follow him on Twitter: @JimObergefell
The Matthew Stafford-Detroit Lions marriage is coming to an amicable separation.\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation told the Detroit Free Press on Saturday that Stafford approached the team after the season ended and suggested that a trade might be in the best interest of both parties. The team has agreed to explore a deal. The person requested anonymity because the Lions had not yet made a public announcement.\n\nStafford has two years and $43 million remaining on his five-year, $135 million contract signed in 2017. He is due a $10 million bonus on the fifth day of the league year in March.\n\nQuarterback-needy teams include New England, Indianapolis, Washington and perhaps New Orleans, among others.\n\nWith the Lions set for a rebuild under a new regime after three straight last-place finishes in the NFC North, Stafford presumably is ready to move to a contender. He passed for 26 touchdowns and 10 interceptions with a 96.3 QB rating in 2020 for the 5-11 Lions, playing through injury late in the season that seemed likely to bench him.\n\nHe missed the final eight games in 2019 after fracturing bones in his back for the second straight year. The Lions went 0-8 without Stafford in 2019 and finished 3-12-1.\n\nThe Lions hired Dan Campbell as head coach Wednesday and Brad Holmes as general manager last week and face an overhaul, particularly with a defense that set franchise records for ineptitude in 2020.\n\nDetroit has the No. 7 overall pick in April's NFL draft. After presumptive No. 1 pick Trevor Lawrence, other QBs potentially in play include Ohio State's Justin Fields, BYU's Zach Wilson, North Dakota State's Trey Lance and Alabama's Mac Jones.\n\nStafford, who turns 33 in February, was the Lions' No. 1 overall pick out of Georgia in 2009. With him at quarterback, the Lions made the playoffs three times in 12 seasons — 2011, 2014 and 2016 — but lost road games in the wild-card round each time. Before Stafford's arrival, the Lions' last playoff appearance was 1999.\n\nThe Lions have not won a playoff game since the 1991 season, losing nine consecutive postseason games, and it remains their lone postseason win since 1957. Only the Cincinnati Bengals have a longer playoff winless streak.
If you've been wanting to raise your hands, bend your wrists and ask Wendy Williams How you doin'? you may finally get your answer.\n\nThe New Jersey-born talk-show host, now in her 13th season interviewing celebrities and dishing unfiltered opinions during her Hot Topics segment, is the subject of two Lifetime projects debuting Saturday: Wendy Williams: The Movie, a biopic (8 EST/PST), and documentary, Wendy Williams: What a Mess! (10 EST/PST).\n\nWilliams is an executive producer for both projects, which cover similar ground. The star, who got her start in radio, tells USA TODAY she wanted her story told because life was getting more interesting than I could possibly tell in a book or during Hot Topics. She also wanted to share the lessons she's picked up along the way. I like to share, the 56-year-old says. It's what I do.\n\n'This is the worst':Wendy Williams' mother Shirley has died, she announced\n\nHer fate is sealed!:'The Masked Singer' reveals Wendy Williams, kisses 'Lips' goodbye\n\nThe movie and documentary trace her life, including miscarriages, cocaine use, rape and the crumbling of her marriage to Kevin Hunter, a former producer on her talk show. The couple ended their nearly 22-year union in 2019 after reports surfaced that Hunter had fathered a baby with another woman. Williams seemingly confirmed these reports in an interview with The New York Times Magazine, saying Kevin has a daughter.\n\nAlthough the movie and the documentary cover similar ground, the documentary has the added benefit of stories from Williams herself in her signature tell-it-like-it-is style. She says no topic was off limits for the projects, which show her fighting my way through surviving 35 years of a career that I wanted since I was little girl.\n\nThe movie encompasses a woman's struggle to balance and be all things to people in her life that matter, she says. It's not easy.\n\n'I can only be me':Wendy Williams is 'happier than ever' heading into Season 12 of talk show\n\nWendy Williams: The Movie opens with Williams (Ciera Payton) backstage at her talk show. Now, it's time to dish my own dirt, she says to the camera, and honey, nobody does it better. The story then flashes back to Williams' hometown of Ocean Township, New Jersey, in 1975, where a young Wendy struggled with her weight and criticism from her parents about her appearance and demeanor.\n\nAs an adult, she describes her cocaine habit as a new diet. It suppressed my appetite and gave me all the chemical courage I thought I needed while working in radio in Washington, D.C. in 1987, she says in the film.\n\nIn an interview, Williams says she was addicted to the stimulant and surprised herself with her ability to later quit cold turkey.\n\nI had a big career, and I didn't want a splashy headline where I had to take off for a month to go to some rehab, she says. I stopped because I wanted to. Didn't even know that I had the strength within me, but I love me and my career more than I loved cocaine.\n\nWhen it came to quitting her marriage, Williams says she was methodical and planned her separation for years from her once great love, for years, hoping to minimize damage to the couple's son, Kevin Hunter Jr. and her career.\n\nOnce we got to the television level of my career, I was juggling private detective firms, she says. I was Googling the best divorce lawyers, I was Googling, 'How to get a divorce.' I was Googling, 'What's the difference between a divorce in New Jersey and a divorce in L.A.?'\n\nWilliams says her ex was a bully, and I took his verbal abuse because I had to be strong for my son and because I wanted to win. I was not trying to get divorced and put all of my belongings in a storage unit until I found the perfect apartment.\n\n(Hunter, who couldn't be reached, issued a statement to Lifetime through a representative, calling Williams' allegations either inaccurate or false.)\n\nHe inconvenienced my life with his attitude, a baby and a lot of affairs, she says. And now I'm going to inconvenience his by letting him know that I've got the best apartment, I've got the best view, I've got the best concierge, I live the best life, I eat the best food. I have the best of the best.\n\nWendy Williams: The Movie and Wendy Williams: What a Mess! will be available for streaming on Lifetime's website beginning Sunday.\n\nWendy Williams gets emotional during talk show's finale, says season has been 'hell'
Gregg Zoroya\n\nUSA TODAY Opinion\n\nOsama bin Laden was desperate to see his third wife, missed her terribly and was obsessed with whether a tiny tracking device was secretly implanted in her so the world could find the 9/11 mastermind, according to new documents released Tuesday.\n\nPersonal letters from bin Laden to his family were among more than 100 documents seized in May 2011 when bin Laden was killed during the U.S. military raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The documents were released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nThe terrorist leader is believed to have had 20 children by five wives. Three of his wives were with him when he was killed.\n\nTwo of those women joined him during the last year or so before his death. Among the documents released Tuesday are what appear to be letters to one of those two women, Khairiah Sabar, a former teacher of deaf children in Saudi Arabia who had been under house arrest in Iran. The letters from her husband were written after she was released by the Iranians and before she reunited with him.\n\nBin Laden warned Khairiah, who was eight years older than her husband, that spies could plant a tracking device in the tooth filling she received from a dentist in Iran. We ... horribly fear the filling you were given, he wrote.\n\nHe also cautioned that during any medical procedure she might be injected with a surveillance device. They can insert a small chip in it (a syringe) to implant under the skin. The size of the chip is about the length of a grain of wheat, he wrote.\n\nNew documents show bin Laden was warned of ISIL's brutality against Muslims\n\nHe stressed these concerns repeatedly.\n\nIn terms of caution, I ask you to report to me in detail anything you find suspicious from any doctor in Iran, like if the syringe is the usual volume and its head has a slightly larger diameter than normal, bin Laden wrote. They can, as I told you before, put a small SIM card to plant it under the skin.\n\nThe letters to his wife, which appear to have been written a year or two before his death in 2011, say how much he missed her and wanted to see her.\n\nPlease trust me that I am working very hard to live with you, bin Laden wrote. She would later join him in Abbottabad and be there during the raid.\n\nI have received the great news of your release from the Iranians, thank God, he wrote. He asked about their son Hamza, his children and his new wife. I am delighted to hear about his marriage.\n\nThe U.S. military initially reported that Hamza was killed in the raid, but he actually escaped and is now suspected of working with al-Qaeda.\n\nI have been living for years in the company of some brothers from the area and they are exhausted — security-wise — from me staying with them and what results from that, bin Laden wrote. Consequently, it is hard for them to do some of the things I ask them to.\n\nBin Laden said his protectors, including Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, his most trusted courier, initially balked at allowing more family into the compound.\n\nIf I am not able to secure your return in the next weeks, I will come to visit you, God willing, bin Laden wrote to his wife, adding that he might change the people who accompany me, to make the reunion with her happen.
The woman President Donald Trump has picked to fill the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is coming under fire from liberal advocacy groups for her past writings on issues ranging from rape to race.\n\nSeveral of judicial nominee Neomi Rao's controversial opinion pieces were compiled by the liberal judicial activist group Alliance for Justice and shared with journalists. Rao has been nominated to fill the seat left vacant by Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he joined the Supreme Court.\n\nBuzzfeed News first reported on the Rao's op-eds, which she wrote in college and shortly after her graduation. Rao graduated from Yale University in 1995 and the writings were from 1993 to 1996.\n\nRao has not previously served as a judge. She currently heads the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. According to Politico, she is on Trump's short list for the Supreme Court if another seat on that bench opens up during his administration.\n\nHere are some examples of what Rao wrote:\n\nOn date rape\n\nIn an October 1994 column for the Yale Herald, titled Shades of Gray, Rao warned of the hysteria over date rape. She questioned laws that say an intoxicated person can't give consent and argued, a good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober.\n\nUnless someone made her drinks undetectably strong or forced them down her throat, a woman, like a man, decides when and how much to drink, she wrote. And if she drinks to the point where she can no longer choose, well, getting to that point was part of her choice.\n\nImplying that a drunk woman has no control of her actions, but that a drunk man does strips women of all moral responsibility, she continued.\n\nIn an April 1993 article titled The Feminist Dilemma, Rao wrote that she agreed with feminist critic Camille Paglia, who accurately describes the dangerous feminist idealism which teaches women that they are equal. Women believe falsely that they should be able to go anywhere with anyone.\n\nAlthough I am certainly not arguing that date rape victims ask for it, when playing the modern dating game women have to understand and accept the consequences of their sexuality, she said. Some feminists chant that women should be free to wear short skirts or bright lipstick, but true sexual signals lie beyond these blatant signs.\n\nOn race\n\nIn a 1995 cover story for The Yale Free Press that focused on differences between men and women, Rao said that gender discrimination in Yale classrooms was virtually non-existent.\n\nBut this should come as no surprise. Over the past decades, Yale has dedicated itself to a relatively firm meritocracy, which drops its standards only for a few minorities, some legacies and a football player here and there, she wrote.\n\nAnd in a 1994 piece for the Washington Times titled, How the Diversity Game is Played, Rao – who described herself as Asian Indian –assailed multiculturalists, who separate and classify everyone according to race, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nThose who reject their assigned categories are called names: So-called conforming blacks are called 'oreos' by members of their own community, conservatives become 'fascists.' Preaching tolerance, multiculturalists seldom practice it, she wrote.\n\nOn multiculturalism\n\nIn the same Washington Times piece, she wrote that multiculturalists are not simply after political reform.\n\nUnderneath their touchy-feely talk of tolerance, they seek to undermine American culture. They argue that culture, society and politics have been defined - and presumably defiled - by white, male heterosexuals hostile to their way of life. For example, homosexuals want to redefine marriage and parenthood; feminists in women's studies programs want to replace so-called male rationality with more sensitive responses common to women. It may be kinder and gentler, but can you build a bridge with it?\n\nOn homosexuality\n\nIn a 1994 article for the Yale Herald titled Queer Politics, Rao again explored the ideological rigidity she says is expected of members of minority communities, in this case people who identify as LGBT.\n\nShe said that while gays have established themselves as a minority group fighting against discrimination and trendy political movements have only recently added sexuality to the standard checklist of traits requiring tolerance, there was a major difference between sexuality and race or gender:\n\nPeople who tolerate women in the workplace and blacks and Hispanics as neighbors view homosexuality as a behavior – and behaviors, unlike gender and race, are subject to change, she said. No one knows whether sexuality is a biological phenomenon or a social construct. The truth may lie somewhere in the middle.\n\nThe reactions\n\nMany judicial experts question the utility and fairness of looking at nominees' old writings from college (or sometimes even high school), arguing they likely matured, changed and evolved in the ensuing years. But Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron told Buzzfeed she rejected that argument in this case because Rao had decades to retract the views expressed in her writing.\n\nNeomi Rao's views are completely disqualifying for someone seeking a lifetime seat on one of our nation's highest courts, Alliance for Justice's Aron said in a statement. The Trump administration in the past has tried, and failed, to ram through nominees with hostile writings and activities like this in their records.\n\nJess Davidson, the executive director for End Rape on Campus, agreed that Rao's past opinions were disqualifying.\n\nHer comments condone victim blaming and perpetuate the rape culture in our schools and society that are dangerous to all individuals, Davidson said.\n\nTodd A. Cox, policy director at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said we should be alarmed that Rao's nomination progressed and that she is on the Supreme Court short list, given her inflammatory language around LGBTQ rights and date rape, to her idea that affirmative action is a 'hot, money-making idea.'\n\nJustice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement to BuzzFeed that the views Rao expressed a quarter century ago as a college student writing for her student newspaper were intentionally provocative, designed to raise questions and push back against liberal elitism that dominated her campus at the time.\n\nMore than two decades later, her views can be found in her numerous academic articles and speeches. We are confident Ms. Rao will make an exemplary judge on the D.C Circuit, Kupec said.
Morgan Stanley said Thursday that it is buying online brokerage E*Trade for about $13 billion, a sign that Wall Street banks continue to covet Main Street customers.\n\nThe deal, analysts say, gives Morgan Stanley access to brokerage customers, employees with company stock and low-cost retail bank deposits, which are the lifeblood of financial services.\n\nThe trend of zero trading commissions, competitive savings account yields and cash management products shows the competition for consumers' cash and investments is as fierce as ever, Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said in a note. This deal, he continued, reaches a broad spectrum of households and signals it isn't just the ultra-wealthy that are in demand.\n\nE*Trade has over 5.2 million client accounts with over $360 billion of retail client assets, adding to Morgan Stanley's existing 3 million client relationships and $2.7 trillion of client assets.\n\nCoronavirus:Economic fallout from virus deepens, threatening tech, retail and autos\n\nDeals:What a Franklin Resources-Legg Mason marriage means for investors\n\nE*Trade provides a suite of digital banking services, including direct integration with brokerage accounts, checking and high-yield savings accounts, which could significantly accelerate Morgan Stanley's digital banking efforts. The transaction adds about $56 billion of low-cost deposits, which is expected to provide funding benefits to Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe deal follows a wave of consolidation in the industry. On Tuesday, asset manager Franklin Resources announced a deal to buy Legg Mason for $4.5 billion. In November, brokerage firm Charles Schwab agreed to buy TD Ameritrade for about $26 billion.\n\nIn the all-stock deal announced Thursday, E*Trade shareholders will receive 1.0432 Morgan Stanley shares for each share they own.\n\nShares of E*Trade surged 22% Thursday after the deal was announced Thursday. Morgan Stanley's stock fell more than 4%.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.\n\nAs Goldman Sachs has grown their online bank Marcus, and as Schwab has acquired TD Ameritrade, the trail was blazed for Morgan Stanley's pathway into financial services for mass affluent and the up-and-comers that will be tomorrow's affluent households, McBride says.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.
Craig Harris\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nPHOENIX — All Bob McGuire wanted was to cash out his wife's modest retirement account and use the money to pay the mounting bills that have accompanied her dementia diagnosis.\n\nAfter nearly a year, the 75-year-old Surprise resident and Navy veteran has racked up $6,000 in legal bills and court fees to access the $25,000 individual retirement account.\n\nAnd his ordeal — navigating probate in Maricopa County Superior Court to obtain guardianship and conservatorship of his wife, Linda — isn't over: McGuire is contesting roughly another $2,000 in legal fees from a court-appointed attorney, designated by a court commissioner to represent and protect the interests of his wife.\n\nWhen it's all settled, the family could end up losing one-fourth of his wife's IRA to legal fees and bills, McGuire said.\n\nMore:3 unexpected retirement costs that can shake up your finances\n\nMore:Returns falling short? Hidden investing costs you can't afford to ignore\n\nProbate court is designed to preserve the respect and dignity of vulnerable adults and to assure their proper care and protection of assets, said Bryan Bouchard, a court spokesman.\n\nCourt officials would not comment on McGuire's case.\n\nBut Bouchard said Maricopa County's court system does everything possible to keep fees to a minimum. And in cases where one party questions the fees being charged by a court-appointed lawyer, the court will hold a hearing to determine whether the fees are appropriate to the task and cost effective, he said.\n\nMcGuire is currently appealing the court fees he has been charged.\n\nRick Kilfoy, who was appointed to represent Linda McGuire and check on her well being, said a person who is incapacitated must have legal representation and the same lawyer who represented Bob McGuire could not represent his wife. Kilfoy declined to discuss the case further.\n\nProbate cases on the rise\n\nThe term probate refers to the establishment or validity of a will, but probate court in Maricopa County handles guardianship and conservatorship cases as well as formal and informal disputes over wills and adult adoption.\n\nThere are about 22,000 probate cases in Maricopa County, and that number has steadily increased by between 6% and 7% annually over the past few years, according to court officials.\n\nCurtis Chipman, an attorney at Udall Shumway in Mesa, said people can avoid the challenges and expenses of probate court by doing estate planning or by obtaining a durable power of attorney when all those involved have their mental capacities.\n\nChipman has handled estate planning for 20 years. He does not represent McGuire.\n\nHe said if the McGuires had previously obtained a durable general power of attorney, then the husband would have access to his wife's assets solely listed in her name, including her IRA.\n\nChipman said his office typically charges between $200 and $300 to draft durable general power of attorney documents. He said he also advises clients to create a trust for their assets as a way to avoid probate court.\n\nUnder Arizona law, anyone who dies with assets in excess of $100,000 for land or more than $75,000 in personal property will likely end up in probate court if their assets are not held in a trust and are not otherwise subject to a non-probate transfer on death designation.\n\nThe state Attorney General's Office and the state Supreme Court also offer guidance on probate issues on their websites.\n\nCouple never thought it was needed\n\nThe McGuires moved to Surprise a few years ago from San Diego, where Bob had retired after a career in the Navy.\n\nDuring their 50 years of marriage, Linda had tucked away a small nest egg while working for a greeting-card company.\n\nBob said the couple never considered creating a trust or obtaining a power of attorney. He said he thought only rich people do such things and that his wife, five years his junior, would outlive him.\n\nThe health problems began about a year ago, Bob said, when his wife started losing her faculties. She couldn't communicate and wasn't eating properly, he said.\n\nAround that time, Bob placed Linda in an adult group home and sought to access her IRA to help with the costs.\n\nBecause Linda lacked the mental capacity to sign the paperwork, Bob needed more than a power of attorney. He pursued a guardianship and conservatorship for his wife, which he found cost thousands of dollars.\n\n'No one should have to go through this'\n\nThe adult care home where Linda lives is about 3 miles from Bob's home, allowing him to see her regularly.\n\nOn a recent visit, Linda was having lunch with a few women when Bob walked through the door. He waved at her.\n\nShe excitedly waved back and got up to give Bob a hug.\n\nBut when he asked if she knew who he was, she shook her head and said, No.\n\nThe two held hands as they walked down a hallway to her room, where they chatted for a bit.\n\nSoon it was time for Bob to leave for a probate court hearing.\n\nBob said it's difficult to see his wife in this situation but he's more frustrated with the court experience.\n\nAt the most, I can see paying $500. What you are doing is telling a judge that my wife is sick, she has dementia and had an IRA that we can't get access to without the courts, he said. Older people need help on Arizona probate laws. ... No one should have to go through this.\n\nFollow Craig Harris on Twitter: @charrisazrep
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is firing back at National Enquirer owner American Media Inc. (AMI) over what he is calling an extortion and blackmail attempt by the tabloid.\n\nIn a lengthy post on Medium Thursday, Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post and is also the world's richest person, details alleged correspondence between the lawyer for his lead investigator, Martin Singer, and Dylan Howard, the chief content officer for AMI.\n\nIn emails posted by Bezos, Howard says the Enquirer would post a series of images it has of Bezos and former Los Angeles news anchor Lauren Sanchez, the Amazon founder's love interest.\n\nIn a separate email, AMI attorney Jon Fine said that the company would not publish the unreleased emails and text if Bezos released a statement affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM's coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces. The emails also demanded Bezos and his investigator agree that they would stop referring to such a possibility.\n\nThe images, according to Howard's email posted by Bezos, include a variety of private pictures of both Bezos and Sanchez such as a below the belt selfie of Bezos and a picture of Sanchez smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene.\n\nBezos shared the Medium post from his official Twitter account. Amazon has separately confirmed the authenticity of the post, but declined to comment further. AMI and Howard did not immediately respond to USA TODAY requests for comment.\n\nThe National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and Sanchez's relationship, including romantic text messages the two had sent one another. The Enquirer posted the text after Bezos' announced last month that he and his wife, MacKenzie, would be getting a divorce after 25 years of marriage.\n\nThe leak of the texts, which Bezos confirmed in his post, prompted the Amazon founder to have Gavin de Becker from his security team investigate how the Enquirer got its hands on the messages.\n\nBezos claims that AMI CEO David Pecker was apoplectic over an investigation The Washington Post was doing into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year ahead of the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nA few days after hearing about Mr. Pecker's apoplexy, we were approached, verbally at first, with an offer, Bezos writes. They said they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn't stop our investigation.\n\nBezos also notes in his blog how Pecker recently entered into an immunity deal with the Department of Justice related to their role in the so-called Catch and Kill process on behalf of President Trump and his election campaign, linking to a New York Times report that said Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest that the Times describes as having important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn his note to Bezos attorney Singer, Fine requested that the Bezos statement would be made through a mutually-agreeable news outlet.\n\nIn his Medium posting, Bezos said his ownership of The Washington Post has been a complexifier for him before continuing to say that he does not regret his 2013 purchase of the company for $250 million.\n\nMy stewardship of The Post and my support of its mission, which will remain unswerving, is something I will be most proud of when I'm 90 and reviewing my life, if I'm lucky enough to live that long, he writes, regardless of any complexities it creates for me.\n\nGiven his position, Bezos says he felt he was in a place to stand up the Enquirer. I was made an offer I couldn't refuse. Or at least that's what the top people at the National Enquirer thought, he writes.\n\nI'm glad they thought that, because it emboldened them to put it all in writing. Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.\n\nThe Pecker-Trump relationship\n\nPecker is a longtime ally of President Donald Trump. Trump has been a critic of Bezos, Amazon and The Post frequently targeting all three on Twitter.\n\nTrump tweeted about Bezos' personal life following the National Enquirer's reveal that Bezos was seeing Sanchez, calling the Amazon founder Jeff Bozo and writing that he was so sorry to hear the news about Bezos being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post.\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York have accused AMI of participating in a scheme to help him win the presidency by paying women to keep silent about alleged extramarital affairs before the election. More than a year before the election, Pecker met with Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen and an unnamed member of his campaign to discuss ways the company could help bottle up damaging stories about Trump.\n\nIn August 2016, AMI struck a deal with former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal to pay her $150,000 for the rights to publish her claim to have carried on an affair with Trump a decade earlier. Prosecutors said the company's principal purpose in entering into the agreement was to suppress (her) story so as to prevent it from influencing the election.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty last year to orchestrating that payment and another, to the pornographic actress Stormy Daniels, both of which violated federal campaign finance laws. Soon after, prosecutors promised not to bring charges against AMI in exchange for its cooperation with their investigation, one of two criminal probes now encircling the president. U.S. District Judge William Pauley said in a decision on Thursday that the probe of the campaign finance violations is ongoing.\n\nContributing: Brad Heath and Jefferson Graham.\n\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal
Welcome to Valentine's Day, the most loaded holiday of the year.\n\nWhether you're in a long-term relationship, just starting to date someone or single, the Feb. 14 holiday comes with a lot of baggage. What kind of gift will you buy? How much money will you spend? Your mother wants to know why you're spending the day alone!\n\nIf you prefer not to fight for a reservation for an overpriced pink-and-red-tinted meal at a local restaurant, we highly recommend you stay at home, cozy up on the couch and watch TV series or films that suit your mood and relationship status. Whether you want to be whisked away by a fantasy love story or prefer a few hours that make you forget people pair up at all, we have five recommendations that will keep you happy this weekend, no matter how many cards and how much candy you receive.\n\nMore to watch:The best TV shows and movies to stream in February 2020\n\nIf you want a love story that will make you swoon: 'Lovesick'\n\nRomantic, laugh-out-loud funny and sharply written, Netflix's Lovesick (formerly called Scrotal Recall, if you can believe it) is the platonic ideal of a romantic comedy. The series centers on Dylan (Johnny Flynn), who has to contact his former girlfriends after he is diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease. The series flashes back to the time Dylan was with each girl on his list. In the present, however, he's desperately in love with his best friend Evie (Antonia Thomas, The Good Doctor). The short, very British series is smart about its will-they-won't-they couple, and only takes a few seasons to wrap up its story nicely.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\nIf you want to bond with your partner over a new shared obsession: 'Battlestar Galactica'\n\nThere's nothing quite like finding a new show for you and your special someone to devour together. If you haven't already watched, Syfy's Battlestar Galactica, which ran from 2004-09, is the perfect kind of binge-worthy TV show to spend days devouring. The space drama, about a war between humans and the robotic cylons they created, has the kind of intensity that makes you click on next episode. There's some good romance sprinkled throughout its four seasons, but the bigger draw is just how addictive and satisfying it is. Check out this masterful version of the story before NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service reboots it.\n\nStream on Syfy.\n\nIf you like 'The Bachelor' but hate this season: 'Love Island' (U.K.)\n\nIf reality TV is the lens through which you prefer to see attraction, sex and maybe actual love, this smash British series is a must-watch. More daring and explicit than CBS's American remake (a ratings disappointment last summer), Island mixes reality dating tropes with strategic game play and more than the usual audience voyeurism. A group of swimsuit-clad singles is dropped in an exotic locale and told to pair up, and things become wild and weird from there. A new season just became available in the U.S., and it's worth watching every juicy minute.\n\nStream it on Hulu.\n\nIf you liked 'Marriage Story': 'The Last Five Years'\n\nNot all love stories end happily: it's just a fact of life. If you appreciated Noah Bambauch's take on a marriage that didn't work out, and you enjoy singing, try the 2014 film Years. The movie, based on the off-Broadway musical, follows five years in the relationship between Jamie (Jeremy Jordan) and Cathy (Anna Kendrick), from their early days to the end of their marriage. Jamie's story moves forward in time, while Cathy's goes backward, which offers context on their every victory and failure in a nuanced way. The music, by legendary composer Jason Robert Brown, is also wonderful, and you may find yourself streaming the soundtrack for weeks.\n\nRent or buy it on Amazon, Google Play, YouTube, Vudu, iTunes and more.\n\nIf you want nothing to do with romance: 'Inside Man'\n\nRomance is a staple of most movies. Even action and horror films have a stray kiss or two before the credits roll, which is why Spike Lee's 2006 bank-heist thriller Inside Man, starring Denzel Washington, Clive Owen and Jodie Foster is such a treat. A deliciously twisty film, Man is all about the robbers, the cops and the cat-and-mouse game they play. There's no time for googly eyes here. It's the perfect antidote to a world that constantly tells singles they need to pair up with someone.\n\nStream it on Starz.
Bob Mehr\n\nThe (Memphis) Commercial Appeal\n\nMEMPHIS — Priscilla Presley is caring for her twin granddaughters Finley and Haley, as a nasty and public divorce battle between daughter Lisa Marie Presley and her estranged husband, Michael Lockwood, plays out. Priscilla Presley took to Facebook on Sunday dismissing media reports that surfaced late last week that the children had been taken into protective custody by California's Child Protective Services.\n\nAccording to a Feb. 7 filing in Superior Court of Los Angeles County cited by the Associated Press, Lisa Marie Presley claims child welfare officials intervened after she found inappropriate photos and videos of the couple's children on Lockwood's computer. I was shocked and horrified and sick to my stomach, Presley wrote of the discovery of the images in court documents. The allegations were first reported in The Daily Mail.\n\nIn a separate filing on Feb. 14 Lockwood said he was disgusted by Presley's unproven allegations about me. Lockwood added: It is particularly distasteful that (Presley) has placed more value on trying to damage my reputation than on the fact that her false statements may be brought to our daughters' attention.\n\nElvis Presley auction: Jewelry, guns, photos net big numbers\n\nLockwood's lawyer, Jeff Sturman, told the AP that his client denies the highly sensational and inaccurate charges.\n\nLockwood's attorneys have suggested Presley included the damaging allegations in the publicly accessible documents as a way of forcing him to back off financial claims he is making against her in their divorce. In her court filing Presley suggests she has gone through her multimillion-dollar fortune, which has previously been estimated between $60 million and $300 million. Presley says she is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and has been forced to borrow money from friends to pay creditors.\n\nThe Commercial Appeal reached out to representatives for Lisa Marie Presley at her publicity/management company XIX, but they had no comment.\n\nThe 49-year-old Presley and Lockwood, 55, married in 2006 in Kyoto, Japan. Lockwood, a Hawthorne, Calif., native, is a veteran musician, having been a member of EMI-signed band Lions & Ghosts, and worked with artists including Carly Simon and Aimee Mann. Lockwood also collaborated with Presley on her music career, playing guitar in her band on stage and in the studio, before the couple separated last summer.\n\nThe Memphis-born Presley — the only child of American music icon Elvis Presley and Priscilla Presley — has two other adult children from previous marriages. Presley has been married four times, including high-profile unions with singer Michael Jackson and actor Nicolas Cage. Presley entered rehab in August 2016, following her split from Lockwood.\n\nElvis Presley's birthday kicks off big year of remembrances\n\nIn the Feb. 7 legal filing against Lockwood, Presley expressed concern about allegations of sexual abuse and neglect that originated when I disclosed my concerns about the hundreds of inappropriate photos that I discovered on [Lockwood] had taken as well as disturbing video footage and behavior, wrote Presley. I had no idea [Lockwood] had taken these photos.\n\nPresley also alleges that the Beverly Hills police department found 80 of Lockwood's devices, and have not fully examined all of them.\n\nLockwood's Feb. 14 filing argues that Presley's allegations are false and unfounded. As I experienced during our more than 10-year marriage and as I believe this court will learn (Presley) has great difficulty being honest and she rarely, if ever, accepts personal responsibility for her own wrongdoing, he wrote.\n\nLockwood's attorneys also claim the judge in their divorce case issued an order last fall that the couple was prohibited from discussing the allegations.\n\nOn her personal Facebook page Priscilla Presley posted a pair of messages and photos of her granddaughters, thanking the public for their support and assuring them that the children had never been in care of the state, but with her. There is lots of confusion, commotion and concern from all the talk circulating, Presley wrote. Let me put this to rest... the girls have not been in foster care and never will be. The girls have been with me and will be until all this is sorted out.\n\nAccording to legal documents, a court date to determine the fate of Presley's and Lockwood's daughters will be held in Children's Court in Los Angeles next month.\n\nAs part of the divorce, Lockwood is seeking $40,000 a month in spousal support and $100,000 in legal fees. Presley claims she should not have to pay, due to terms of a post-nuptial agreement Lockwood signed in 2007.\n\nAlthough Presley earns $100,000 a month from a trust established by her late father, and more than $4,000 a month from a position at Graceland, she characterizes her current financial situation as dire.\n\nIn court documents, Presley alleges that Lockwood spent over a million dollars of her money without her knowledge, and further alleges extreme misappropriation by her former managers.\n\nShe adds that she been forced to move in with her daughter, actress Riley Keough, and borrow money from friends to pay her outstanding debts.\n\nA spokesman for Elvis Presley Enterprises also declined to comment.\n\nFollow Bob Mehr on Twitter: @BobMehr
WASHINGTON — When Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley agreed to run for the Senate last fall, Republicans crowed that they'd snagged a top recruit and rising GOP star to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.\n\nBut Republicans now seem to be a bit nervous about Hawley's campaign.\n\nIf Hawley doesn't gear it up and get with it, he'll not beat her, said former Sen. Christopher Kit Bond, a top Missouri Republican. I think a lot of people who want to see Hawley elected (are) wishing he'd get to work, doing fundraising and getting out and campaigning actively.\n\nKyle Plotkin, Hawley's campaign manager, sharply disputed the suggestion that the attorney general is not mounting a strong Senate challenge.\n\nJosh raised the most of any Republican challenger to an incumbent across the country this last quarter, Plotkin said, adding that Hawley also had slightly more money in the bank than the average GOP Senate challenger at the end of the last quarter.\n\nPlotkin said Hawley is focused on his job as attorney general and that has put him front and center in Missouri, while Claire campaigns non-stop. He said no amount of money will help McCaskill convince Missouri voters to give her another term.\n\nBond's comments, made in an interview with USA TODAY, come as Hawley's campaign hit a rough patch. The Kansas City Star reported last week that Hawley linked the current plague of sex trafficking to the sexual revolution of the 1960s, when women gained new freedoms and wider access to birth control and Americans' attitudes about sex and gender changed.\n\nThe sexual revolution has led to exploitation of women on a scale that we would never have imagined, Hawley told a group of pastors, according to audio obtained by The Star. In another recent speech, Hawley said the 1960s ushered in a denigration of the biblical teaching about the sanctity of marriage ... the appropriate place for sexual practice and expression within the family, within marriage, and we're living now with the terrible after-effects of this so-called revolution.\n\nThose remarks made news around the same time that Hawley's campaign reported raising $958,000 in 2017 and ending the year with about $1.2 million cash in the bank. McCaskill raised nearly $3 million in the 4th quarter of 2017, and she ended the year with a $9 million war chest.\n\nAlthough outside Republican groups are likely to help make up for any imbalance in the candidates' fundraising, Hawley's numbers were perceived by some as sluggish.\n\nThe news even led to some speculation that Rep. Ann Wagner, a St. Louis County Republican, was eyeing the Senate race again, after deciding last year not to run when GOP leaders began wooing Hawley.\n\nBond said he spoke with Wagner on Monday, and she was focused on her House re-election campaign. Asked if he would like to see Wagner get in the race if Hawley doesn't pick up his pace, Bond said: Somebody's got to get in there and win it.\n\nRead more:\n\nHawley on defense after linking human trafficking to sexual revolution of 1960s\n\nHawley makes Senate bid official, jabs McCaskill
Carol Memmott\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCloris Leachman, best known for her role as Phyllis Lindstrom on the 1970s sitcoms The Mary Tyler Moore Show and its spin-off Phyllis, died Wednesday at her home near Los Angeles. She was 94.\n\nHer manager, Juliet Green, confirmed Leachman's death in her sleep from natural causes, and remembered her as one of the most fearless actresses of our time ... With a single look she had the ability to break your heart or make you laugh till the tears ran down your face. You never knew what Cloris was going to say or do and that unpredictable quality was part of her unparalleled magic.\n\nThe Oscar- and Emmy-winning Leachman was born in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1926. She attended Illinois State University and Northwestern University, where she majored in drama. Before moving to New York, she was crowned Miss Chicago 1946 and acted with the Des Moines Playhouse.\n\nHer television career took hold in the late 1940s and early 1950s with appearances on The Ford Theatre Hour and Bob and Ray. She made her movie debut in 1955 playing femme fatale Christina Bailey in the classic noir film Kiss Me Deadly.\n\nCo-star's death:Remembering Valerie Harper, the best best friend TV has ever seen\n\nLeachman was primarily a TV actress in the 1950s and the 1960s but appeared in several movies including The Chapman Report (1962) with Shelley Winters, Jane Fonda and Claire Bloom and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) with Robert Redford and Paul Newman. She won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in 1971's The Last Picture Show. Director Peter Bogdanovich reportedly predicted during the movie's filming that she would win an Oscar for her performance as an adulterous high school gym teacher's wife.\n\nShe also appeared in three Mel Brooks movies including 1974's Young Frankenstein, in which the mention of her character's name, Frau Blücher, elicited a horse's loud neighing; 1977's High Anxiety, as crazed psychiatric nurse Charlotte Diesel; and 1981's History of the World: Part I in which she played Madame Defarge in a parody of Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities.\n\nBut it was in television that she gained most of her fame.\n\nLeachman received five Emmy nominations, and won two, for her role as Phyllis Lindstrom, Mary Tyler Moore's landlady and nosy neighbor on CBS' The Mary Tyler Moore Show and the spin-off series Phyllis. She won a Golden Globe for her work on Phyllis. In all, she won eight primetime Emmys.\n\nMoore died in 2017, and Valerie Harper, who co-starred as Rhoda Morgenstern and got her own more successful spin-off, Rhoda, died in 2019.\n\nHer first Emmy, in 1973, was for her leading-role performance in the TV movie A Brand New Life. She won two more awards for her supporting role as Grandma Ida on Malcolm in the Middle in 2002 and 2006, and played a demented grandmother on Fox's Raising Hope from 2010 to 2014.\n\nShe also played Beverly Ann Stickle from 1986-88 on NBC's sitcom The Facts of Life.\n\nIn recent years, the seemingly tireless actress appeared in the Lifetime miniseries Beach Girls with Rob Lowe and Julia Ormond, two movies starring Adam Sandler, and Sky High, a comedy starring Kurt Russell. In 2008, she cha-chaed her way into the hearts of millions when at 82, she became the oldest contestant on ABC's Dancing with the Stars. Other recent credits include Starz's American Gods, Spectrum's Mad About You limited series revival and voice work in animated shows and films including Elena of Avalor, Bob's Burgers, The Croods 2 and Justice League Action.\n\nShe was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nIn 2009, she published Cloris: My Autobiography. Her ex-husband director/producer George Englund was a contributor. They were married from 1953 to 1979 and had five children. She was also a lifelong vegetarian, Green said.\n\nIn Cloris, she talked about her marriage (including her husband's affair with Joan Collins) and the death of her eldest son, Bryan, as a result of a drug overdose in 1986, and shared anecdotes about friends and co-stars including Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, Meryl Streep, Sissy Spacek and Diane Keaton.\n\nLeachman most recently appeared in Jump, Darling, an LGBTQ drama, and When We Last Spoke with Melissa Gilbert (Little House on the Prairie).\n\nContributing: Gary Levin, Patrick Ryan, Cydney Henderson
It's hard not to go into Nick (Little, Brown and Company, 304 pp., ★★ out of four) with a skeptical heart. An expired copyright and mercenary timing will do that.\n\nThe Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald's slim and sparkling Jazz Age masterpiece, has entered public domain, opening the floodgates to imitators, fanboys and coattail riders to profit off Fitzgerald's intellectual property.\n\nAuthor Michael Farris Smith (Blackwood, Desperation Road) comes across as none of those things in Nick, the first of what is sure to be many prequels to The Great Gatsby. He doesn't tell the tale of Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan's whirlwind romance before her marriage to another man, or of Gatsby's descent into bootlegging or of Jordan Baker's escapades in golf swindling. Nor is Nick vapid fan fiction, all flapper dresses and fizzing gin rickeys as we learn the real story behind the ever-seeing eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.\n\nThat particular literary boogeyman, for now, remains unrealized. Instead, Smith sets his sights on the great observer himself, Nick Carraway, the mild-mannered Midwestern bondsman who pays witness to Gatsby's doomed romance and, if you remember your high school English lessons, the corruption of the American dream. Nick charts the evolution of the man he would become, following him through his own doomed romance to the battlefields of World War I to a bourbon-soaked New Orleans French Quarter before his ill-fated pilgrimage to New York City.\n\nThe result is a book so minimally tethered to the source material that save for the cover art and the inevitable specter of the blinking green light at the end of a dock, it hardly registers as a prequel at all, but rather as a literary exercise in unrelenting misery – for Nick and the reader.\n\nNick's life is not a happy one, even before he takes up with the damaged lot in Gatsby. His home life is bleak, shadowed by his mother's chronic depression and his father's emotional unavailability. In a desperate bid to avoid the Midwestern predictability and the inheritance of his father's dull hardware business, Nick goes to war.\n\nBook review:Parenthood examined in Peter Ho Davies' gemlike 'A Lie Someone Told You About Yourself'\n\n5 books not to miss:Feminist Western 'Outlawed,' Robert Jones Jr.'s 'The Prophets'\n\nSmith's depiction of war is harrowing, but it produces a man so wrecked with PTSD that he bears no resemblance to the Nick of Gatsby. Skulls are cracked. Men are shot and beaten and burned. Nick is nearly decapitated and plays dead for two days, lying motionless in a pit and covered in dead bodies. He is wracked by night terrors and his right hand begins to shake uncontrollably.\n\nHe gets some reprieve on leave from the trenches, embarking on a romance in Paris with a dreamlike romantic figure who, a bit risibly, plucks him off the streets and graciously teaches the inexperienced soldier the pleasures of the flesh (she is also, aside from Nick's mother, seemingly the only woman in the book who isn't a prostitute).\n\nThat temporary bliss ends in tragedy as traumatic to Nick as war, so he flees both for New Orleans – a location chosen by chance to avoid home – where he inexplicably pays witness to another romance between a war-scarred opium addict named Judah and his brothel madam wife, Colette, each of whom is trying to destroy the other. (Even in his own book, Nick is still the least interesting character.)\n\nIt's both too much and not enough. There are shades of Ernest Hemingway in Nick's Parisian jaunts, of William Faulkner in the Southern gothic grotesquery of New Orleans. But there's little Fitzgerald in content or style, Smith's prose engorged with overwrought metaphors, turgid dialogue and incantation-like repetition: Something vast and infinite opened inside of him and he drifted in that unbounded expanse like a mote of dust carried for thousands of miles and for thousands of years on the ceaseless wind that wraps the earth again and again. One longs for Fitzgerald's wry wit and musicality.\n\nIt would have benefitted Nick not to invite such comparison to Gatsby, down to its riff on the book's iconic cover art by Cuban artist Francis Cugat. That haunting image of a female face looking down forlornly on brightly lit merriment with yellow eyes is transformed here into a pair of anxious blue eyes nearly engulfed in flames. Even when you close the book to escape, you're invited to compare, cloaked as Nick is in borrowed prestige.\n\nNick would have been a stronger book if it had dropped the pretense of a prequel entirely. But then, that's a harder sell.

NEW YORK — Brad Pitt has kind words to say about Quentin Tarantino. But he also has plenty of jokes about the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood director and writer.\n\nPresenting Tarantino with the award for best screenplay at the 2020 New York Film Critics Circle Awards on Tuesday, Pitt recalled an old story that spoke to the filmmaker's work ethic. He jokingly recalled how Tarantino used to act out screenplays for what would eventually become 1993's True Romance on a jail cell floor, while serving time for unpaid parking tickets (a story that's since been disputed).\n\nAs you know, my man is very verbose. He's the only guy I know who needs cocaine to stop talking, Pitt said to raucous laughter.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio starred in Once Upon a Time as fictional fading star Rick Dalton opposite his faithful stuntman Cliff Booth (Pitt). The story, Tarantino's love letter to Hollywood, takes place in 1969 amid headlines about Sharon Tate's (Margot Robbie) horrifying murder.\n\nFinally, after all this time: A film that celebrates Hollywood, Pitt deadpanned.\n\nThe actor applauded Tarantino's unorthodox writing process, noting he writes chapters on his characters just to give himself and his actors any information they could possibly need, be it the character's backstory or favorite drink.\n\nYou know when you're out in public and you say something stupid ... and it's not until the drive home that you figure out what you should have said? His characters never suffer from that, Pitt said. There's something to the music, to the rhythm in his writing. I call it 'iambic Quintameter.'\n\nNew York Film Critics Circle Awards:'The Irishman' grabs another best picture, Joe Pesci supporting actor\n\nPitt concluded: Quentin is known for for a lot of things... shootouts and witty banter, but there's this inherent sincerity... At the end of the day, he's got a really kind heart.\n\nWinners of the NYFCC Awards were announced ahead of the ceremony, which was held at the TAO Downtown restaurant in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. Each winner was presented the award from a fellow big name in the business: Spike Lee presented best picture to Marin Scorsese for The Irishman, Reese Witherspoon presented best supporting actress to Laura Dern for Marriage Story and Little Women, among many other A-listers.\n\nThe famously media-shy Joe Pesci also made a surprise appearance to accept best supporting actor for Irishman, and was joined on stage by Scorsese and co-star Robert De Niro.\n\nI've had this guy telling me exactly what to do in his films, said Pesci, who also starred in Scorsese's Raging Bull and Goodfellas with De Niro. So I said, 'OK. Tell me how to accept the award.' 
A second White House official has resigned amid accusations of domestic violence, according to a report by The Washington Post.\n\nSpeechwriter David Sorensen resigned Friday, just days after staff secretary Rob Porter quit amid abuse accusations in two prior marriages.\n\nSorensen's ex-wife reportedly accused him of being violent and emotionally abusive, which he vehemently denied.\n\nJessica Corbett described their chaotic marriage to The Post, including allegations that Sorensen ran over her foot with a car, put out a cigarette on her hand and threw her into a wall.\n\nShe also gave the newspaper photos of the injuries to her hand from the cigarette, adding she told the FBI about the incidents when they spoke to her about her husband's security clearance.\n\nSorensen denied the claims and, instead, said he was victim of Corbett's abuse, which he said included fights and punching, according to The Post.\n\nThey were reportedly married for more than two years.\n\nPorter resigned Wednesday in the aftermath of his two ex-wives describing his alleged abuse. The reports also included a photo showing one of his exes with a black eye.\n\nPorter also denied the allegations but questions have lingered about why he was able to keep his job even after the allegations reportedly surfaced.\n\nMore:Trump says he was 'surprised' by abuse allegations against staff secretary Rob Porter\n\nFollow Christal Hayes on Twitter: Journo_Christal.
Erin Jensen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nKris Jenner joined her ex, Caitlyn Jenner, in New Orleans on I Am Cait Sunday night. And while in the city nicknamed The Big Easy, there were a few moments of tension between the former spouses.\n\nOver drinks with Caitlyn's fierce road trip warriors, Kris had some unsolicited advice for the Republican about how to handle the hot topic of politics.\n\nYou are really crazy about this one thing, she said. And no one wants to sit around and listen to this (bleep). So shut the (bleep) up and relax. A reaction shot showed that Caitlyn was a little stunned by Kris' bluntness.\n\nLater, while breaking some metaphorical and delicious New Orleans French bread together, the Jenners got into another heated conversation — this time over Caitlyn's honesty about her gender issues throughout their marriage that spanned more than two decades. Caitlyn has said she feels like she was very honest with Kris, but Kris maintains that she was unaware and cited a conversation the two had about possibly having more children before Kendall and Kylie Jenner were born.\n\nThere was no, 'I am transgender,' Kris said. It was, 'I took some stuff in the '80s, and my sperm isn't good.' Kris said her ex didn't mention estrogen and that she thought perhaps Caitlyn was referencing steroids because of her athletic past.\n\nMeanwhile, Caitlyn had a very different version of what happened. I said I had a condition that I had been dealing with forever. I said that I was on hormones, and that's the reason it might be tough to get pregnant. She maintained that she was truthful with Kris. I certainly said I had gender issues and that I was on hormones, and why I had boobs and the whole thing, she said.\n\nPersonally, we think each are telling their version of the truth. The girls left their spat at the dinner table and spent the rest of the evening dancing and having drinks. While throwing beads off a balcony, Kris brought up Caitlyn's love life. She said that her daughter, Kim Kardashian, told her that Caitlyn might be interested in dating men.\n\nIf I went through like final surgery and all of that. I wouldn't date a guy with..., Caitlyn said and then trailed off.\n\nKris was a little surprised and reminded Caitlyn that a date could just be drinks. She then offered her ex some advice which was better received than her words before. Let me just tell you that life is very short and you better figure it out really fast, the infamous momager said. Later, the exes sealed the night with a kiss.\n\nMinutes before the episode was over, Caitlyn revealed that she wanted to have a one-on-one with Kris before she left. But in order to see that conversation, you'll have to tune in to I Am Cait on Sunday at 9 p.m. ET because teasers.
Kate Hudson has goals in 2021: She wants to get in contact with her biological father's children.\n\nOn Friday's episode of her Sibling Revelry podcast with brother Oliver, the 41-year-old Almost Famous actress, whose mother is Goldie Hawn, revealed that she has been thinking about the other side of their family.\n\nYou know what I've been thinking about lately? Dad, Kate told Oliver (Splitting Up Together), 44, while discussing New Year's resolutions. We've got four siblings we don't spend any time with.\n\nShe wistfully noted that everybody's getting older and added that she has been having moments of thinking, It would be nice to connect a little bit.\n\nKate Hudson: The actress clears up her 'genderless' parenting approach with daughter Rani Rose\n\nWe've been talking so much about sibling relationships and distraught relationships or good relations. And we're sitting here like, 'We have the best family, we're so great,' and we don't ever acknowledge the fact that we have four other siblings. Four, she said. So I've been thinking about the Hudsons, and thinking it's important that we reach out with all of our siblings and maybe connect with them a little bit.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson for further comment.\n\nKate and Oliver are Hawn's oldest children, from her six-year marriage to Bill Hudson. Hudson has three more children: Emily and Zach (with his ex-wife, Laverne & Shirley star Cindy Williams) and Lalania (whose mother is former girlfriend Caroline Graham). Hawn has been in a relationship with actor Kurt Russell since 1983, with whom she has a son, Wyatt Russell, 34.\n\nThe Hudson family hasn't been on the greatest terms in recent years. Oliver posted a Father's Day photo on Instagram in 2015 captioned Happy abandonment day, effectively severing the relationship, and Bill Hudson subsequently told The Daily Mail that he wanted Kate and Oliver to stop using the Hudson name.\n\nBut in 2018, Oliver told Larry King that they'd seen each other for the first time in a dozen years and were text-friendly.\n\nI had posted something that was darkly comedic and it blew up into something, and actually it helped us with our relationship, he said. So now we're kind of keeping in touch.\n\nIn 2016, Kate told Howard Stern that she forgave her dad for losing contact.\n\nI did understand that it didn't have to do with me and Oliver. We did understand that, she said of his increasing absence from their childhood. I really do recognize whatever those issues are, it's just something that he has to live with. And that must be painful for him.
Sen. Joni Ernst, just days after details about her allegedly abusive marriage became public, said that she was sexually and physically abused by a man she dated in college.\n\nErnst talked about the previously undisclosed allegation in an interview with Bloomberg. The Iowa Republican said she knew the person who sexually assaulted her in college.\n\nI didn't want to share it with anybody, and in the era of hashtag-MeToo survivors, I always believed that every person is different and they will confront their demons when they're ready, Ernst said in the Tuesday interview, according to the report. And I was not ready.\n\nShe never talked about the incident publicly. Ernst told Bloomberg she was in a relationship with a man who was very abusive. He was physically and sexually abusive. She said he sexually assaulted her and then threatened to kill himself if she broke up with him, according to the Bloomberg report.\n\nErnst said she called the sexual assault counseling center's hotline at Iowa State University but never filed a police report.\n\nI was embarrassed, she said. I didn't know how to explain it. I was so humiliated. And I'm a private person, when it comes to those things.\n\nA man who was friends with Ernst said that she had told him she had been raped shortly after she said it happened, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAfter her court-filed allegations of abuse by her husband were made public, she addressed the matter with Iowa reporters.\n\nWhat I want people to understand is that I am the same person as I was last week. You just know more about what's inside of me now, she told reporters Wednesday in Iowa.\n\nIn the Bloomberg interview, Ernst went more in-depth about the alleged abuse in her marriage. She said Gail Ernst, her ex-husband, grabbed her by the throat in 2007 or 2008, threw her down on a staircase landing, and began pounding her head into the floor.\n\nIt was very sudden and very violent, she said. It scared me.\n\nThe 48-year-old said she is committed to defending her seat in 2020.\n\nI'm seeking re-election. I'm going to do it as a single woman, she told Bloomberg. People know my situation now. What I can do is be honest about what happened. And I can move forward. The problem is now I've been outed when I was not ready to talk about it. But now maybe it forces me to talk about it.\n\nErnst also discussed her support of Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexual assault.\n\nI do believe she experienced trauma, but the evidence and witnesses presented by her contradicted her story, Ernst told Bloomberg. I don't believe Justice Kavanaugh was the source of her trauma.\n\nThe senator said she can support the president, who has been accused of sexual misconduct, and support victims of sexual assault.\n\nIt's outrageous to suggest that anyone who has been the victim of sexual assault should therefore be a Hillary Clinton supporter, Ernst said.\n\nPreviously: U.S. Sen.

AP\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Billie Jean King thinks one of the main venues at the Australian Open should be renamed because of Margaret Court's comments about the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nKing, a trailblazer for equality and diversity in tennis, said she had initially been a proponent of having Margaret Court Arena named in 2003 in recognition of the 24-time Grand Slam singles winner's contribution to the sport.\n\nI was fine until lately when she said so many derogatory things about my community — I'm a gay woman — about the LBGTIQ community, King said at news conference Friday. That really went deep in my heart and soul.\n\nI personally don't think she should have (her name on the stadium) anymore.\n\nKing is attending the Australian Open for the first time in eight years, marking the 50th anniversary of her win over Court for the Australian title.\n\nKing said if she was still competing, she wouldn't play on Margaret Court Arena. King said she wouldn't promote a boycott of the stadium, but encouraged players to seek their own heart and mind before making a decision.\n\nOrganizers have recognized the American tennis great as the Australian Open Woman of the Year and launched its Open4All initiative to promote equality, diversity and inclusion to coincide with King's visit.\n\nKing, one of the original professionals in women's tennis and winner of 12 major singles titles in the Open era, said she had regularly met with Court at tournaments in the years since they retired after we grew up together playing each other.\n\nThe 75-year-old Court, who holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles across the amateur and Open eras, is a Christian pastor who lives in Perth, Western Australia.\n\nCourt's negative comments about gay people before Australia voted in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage were heavily criticized last year. Court also has called transgender children the work of the devil.\n\nMartina Navratilova, an 18-time Grand Slam singles winner, wrote an open letter last year criticizing Court and recommended that tennis officials rename the arena after another Australian great, Evonne Goolagong Cawley.\n\nKing said she lobbied on Court's behalf after Melbourne Park's center court was named for Rod Laver in 2000. Her show court was recently upgraded to add a roof and bigger capacity.\n\nCourt is a regular at the event, but is not attending this year's Australian Open, which starts Monday.\n\nTournament director Craig Tiley said Court had a standing invitation to the season-opening major, and would be welcome in the future as she had been in the past.\n\nHe said there had been conversation among stakeholders of Melbourne Park regarding the issue, but there was no process in place to change the name of the stadium. He said Tennis Australia — a tenant at the venue — would take the lead of the government on the issue.\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Tennis Association named the site of the U.S. Open, located in a public park in New York, the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.\n\nKing said she wished Court was in Melbourne so they could continue the conversation.\n\nYou can have discussion around it. I would be very welcome to Margaret, the 74-year-old King said. It's really important if you're going to have your name on anything that you're hospitable, you're inclusive, you open your arms to everyone that comes. It's a public facility.
Alice Marie Johnson\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nA year ago, I was sitting in a federal prison in Alabama as a nonviolent offender, hoping that my prayers for mercy from a life sentence would be heard.\n\nThis weekend, I will speak at a conference in Palm Springs, California, organized by the Seminar Network. Founded by Charles Koch, the group of philanthropists works to remove barriers preventing people from realizing their full potential.\n\nHow was my transition from prisoner to inspirational speaker possible?\n\nI owe a debt of gratitude to President Donald Trump, whose clemency led to my release from prison in June after I had served 21 years separated from my family and loved ones. And I am also thankful for people like Kim Kardashian West, Jared Kushner, Mark Holden of Koch Industries, Brittany Barnett, co-founder of the Buried Alive Project, and many others who advocated on my behalf.\n\nI am thankful for the second chance I was given. But I know that there are many other incarcerated people who also deserve a second chance.\n\nI want to use my freedom to advocate on their behalf.\n\nJustice is needed, but so is mercy\n\nOne of the most important things I learned while I was in prison is that justice has to be tempered with mercy. My story of incarceration is not unique.\n\nThe events that led up to my trial and life sentence make me no different from anyone else I mentored and sat beside during my confinement — mothers, grandmothers, sisters and daughters whose stories have yet to take the fortunate turn that mine did.\n\nI was married at the age of 15 — my husband was only two years older than me. It was the 1970s.\n\nThe marriage didn't last, and five children and a couple of decades later, I was out of a job (I had been a manager at FedEx) and out of money with no financial support.\n\nMy home was facing possible foreclosure when someone informed me about an opportunity to make money by relaying phone messages.\n\nI found myself involved in a drug conspiracy and my phone records reflected what I had been doing for some time — facilitating contact with dealers.\n\nAs a first-time, nonviolent offender, I was offered a plea deal but ultimately decided not to take it. I was told that I had a good chance of winning my case.\n\nWhen I was convicted in 1996 on drug conspiracy charges, I was shocked. I was not even aware that conspiracy charges were on the table.\n\nThe same dealers who were running the conspiracy testified against me in court, some to avoid prosecution while dooming me to life in prison.\n\nThe case against overincarceration\n\nThe United States has one of the highest incarceration rates in the world. And one in five people incarcerated is being held for a drug offense, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.\n\nRead more commentary\n\nCOLUMN:After creating mass incarceration, Barr seems ill-prepared to end it\n\nNEWSLETTER:Harris presidential run already in question.

Subscribe for new issue each Monday.\n\nPOLICING THE USA:A look at race, justice, media\n\nMy federal sentence without the possibility of parole made me one of those statistics, and I will be the first to say that I am not proud of what I did.\n\nMy first day in federal prison was the roughest. I was shipped from my hometown of Memphis to a women's facility more than 1,500 miles away in California. I was there for a year and never saw my children before I moved to a facility in Texas. My youngest child was 17. All but one of my grandchildren were born while I was incarcerated.\n\nBut I decided to use my time in prison productively.\n\nI drew closer to God and became an ordained minister. As a mentor, I had the chance to hear dozens of stories from other women, many of whom were also serving time for nonviolent crimes. They, like myself, posed no threat to public safety and were eager for a second chance.\n\nThey used their time in prison to continue their education. They worked on résumés and prepared for job interviews.\n\nI wrote and produced faith-based plays. And many of the women I served with took on starring roles.\n\nI told my story of incarceration to the outside world through a video that was broadcast on the news site mic.com. That decision changed my life.\n\nI had never heard of Kardashian West (I was in my 60s and had been in prison since the late 1990s) until my family told me that the reality TV star saw my video and pushed it out through a tweet that went viral.\n\nPrison staff wrote letters on my behalf about the positive work I had been doing while incarcerated. And in that sense, I was very much like thousands of women caught in a justice system that overincarcerates. Many of the women I served with sincerely want to make amends, and they have the ability to become productive, law-abiding members of their communities.\n\nNational campaigns are helping Americans realize that there is a face and a story behind every statistic.\n\nBusinesses are taking notice and making changes by hiring people with criminal histories. Some are banning the box, or removing questions surrounding criminal records from job applications.\n\nGreat things are possible when people put their differences aside and come together to do what's right for others, including those who need a second chance.\n\nWhen I get to Palm Springs, I'll tell my story. But I'll also talk about the mercy that's needed for others throughout the criminal justice system.\n\nAlice Marie Johnson is a grandmother who was granted clemency by President Donald Trump after serving two decades in federal prison.
Cincinnati\n\nIf drinking beer is good, and so is taking a long soak in a hot tub, then doing both at the same time is at least twice as good. That's the principle of the Bier Spa, which is coming to the Columbia-Tusculum neighborhood this summer. And it adds one more element: The tub is not filled with beer itself but with hops, both pellets and flowers, and other ingredients like essential oils to heighten the experience. Soaking with those ingredients supposedly offers benefits to the skin. Ben Homan says he has been thinking about creating a spa like this since his girlfriend came back from Europe having tried one in the Czech Republic. The tubs are made of cedar and filled fresh for each client, then emptied and cleaned. And customers can choose from four beers on tap.
LOS ANGELES – Brad Pitt has been the picture of appreciation and wisecracks during his many award season speeches.\n\nBut at the Oscars, Pitt surprisingly veered into politics during his best supporting actor acceptance speech for Once Upon a Time In Hollywood.\n\nThey told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week, said Pitt, referencing the former national security adviser who was not allowed to testify by the Senate during the proceedings that acquitted President Donald Trump.\n\nPitt, 56, joked that his Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino might do a feature on the controversial hearings.\n\nHallelujah! for Brad Pitt:Wins his first acting Oscar for 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'\n\nBrad Pitt forgets 'Fight Club' rule:Remembers passing up 'Matrix' role\n\nI'm thinking maybe Quentin does a movie about it and in the end, the adults do the right thing, said Pitt.\n\nBackstage Pitt added that he was dead serious about his criticism of the Senate proceedings and wanted to shine a light on it at the Oscars.\n\nI was really disappointed with that this week, said Pitt. When gamesmanship trumps the right thing, it's a sad thing. And I don't think we should let it slide. And I'm very serious about that.\n\nPitt also explained that he is not entirely comfortable speaking in front of crowds. So he worked especially hard on his speeches during awards season. But he insisted the words were his and that he didn't hire a writer.\n\nOscars backstage gossip: Brad Pitt coy about his Tinder profile, 'Parasite' goes (bleeping) crazy\n\nMore Oscars 2020: Laura Dern wins best supporting actress for 'Marriage Story'\n\nI put some real work into it.

I have some funny friends.\n\nNailing the speeches were one of his biggest triumphs of the award season. For me it was just about getting cozy in front of a mass of people. I know that's antithetical to my chosen profession, said Pitt.

AP\n\nMichael Phelps hasn't gotten the urge to return to swimming.\n\nNot yet anyway.\n\nThe winningest athlete in Olympic history is clearly enjoying marriage, fatherhood and a newfound willingness to speak out on contentious issues such as doping .\n\nBut, in a tantalizing concession that he hasn't totally closed the door on another comeback, Phelps told The Associated Press that it might be tough to stay away from the pool — especially if he attends the world championships in Budapest, Hungary, in July.\n\nThe true test will be, if I do end up going over to the worlds this summer, do I have that itch again? Phelps said Tuesday during a telephone interview.\n\nHe was already strongly considering his first comeback when he attended the 2013 championships in Barcelona, and there was no doubt he'd be back for his fifth Olympics when that meet ended.\n\nI was just like: 'This is a joke. How can these guys be swimming this slow?' recalled Phelps, who was especially motivated by a disappointing performance from the men's relay team. We'll see if I get that itch again.\n\nFor now, he's happy with his post-swimming life, which includes a new sponsorship deal with Colgate in which he is pushing water conservation.\n\nWhile Phelps still travels extensively, tending to various sponsors and business interests, he gets a lot more quality time with wife Nicole and their son, Boomer, who will celebrate his first birthday in a few weeks.\n\nHe has started standing by himself a little bit from time to time, Phelps said. He's on the move all the time now and loving it. He's killing it. It's so fun to watch him. Every day, it's something different, something special. It's a treat for me to see it face to face. It's wild. It's mind-blowing for Nicole and I. We still look at each other sometimes and go: 'Wow, we have a son. This is our son.'\n\nIf Phelps returns to competitive swimming, the demands of training would surely cut heavily into his family time. That's why, if he tries to predict what the future might hold, it doesn't include a sixth Olympics at Tokyo in 2020.\n\nI'm having so many amazing experience, so many cool experiences, with my family, he said. I don't see myself making a comeback. I have no desire right now to do it. I'm in the second chapter of my life. I have a lot of things I now want to accomplish. I'm realizing that more and more. This is a really cool opportunity for me to do some things I was not able to do when I was swimming.\n\nThat includes lending his still-considerable clout to issues that he considers important to swimming and the world.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Rio Games, Phelps talked for the first time about the scourge of doping, saying he wasn't sure if he had ever competed in a totally clean race, even while winning a record 23 gold medals and 28 medals in all.\n\nIn February, he took it a step further by testifying at a congressional hearing on improving anti-doping measures. He said athletes don't believe in the testing programs that are already in place, and he urged lawmakers to help ensure the system is fair and reliable.\n\nThroughout my career, I never spoke out about anything, Phelps conceded. I stayed in my lane and focused on what I was doing. To get out front and speak out on things that are passionate to me, to take different approaches to things I want to talk about in different walks of life, that's pretty cool and pretty special for me. The opportunities I have are absolutely amazing.\n\nHopefully, he added, I can change some things and make a difference.\n\nHe's doing a media blitz this week for his new deal with Colgate and the Save Water program, coinciding with Earth Day on Saturday.\n\nIt completely blows my mind to think about how much you can waste when you brush your teeth twice a day, Phelps said. If you leave the water running while you brush your teeth, it's wasting four to five gallons every time you do that. Every time. If we can get people to stop doing that, think how many millions of people in the world could contribute in just that small way.\n\nPhelps said this second retirement, coming after an Olympics in which he won five gold medals and a silver with his new family along for the ride, has enabled him to truly appreciate the enormous accomplishments of his career.\n\nHe still feels like Rio was the perfect ending .\n\nI never had that moment before to sit back and think about what I had done, Phelps said. I'm so stoked that I came back for (the 2016) Olympics. I finished exactly how I wanted.\n\nIs he really finished?\n\nStay tuned.
Constance Brinkley-Badgett\n\nCredit.com,\n\nIf you're expecting a big tax refund this year, you've probably already decided what you're going to do with that money. Whether it's a vacation, a new jet ski or a nice boost to your retirement savings, you're probably pretty excited about the extra cash. But here's the deal: Getting a big tax refund each year isn't necessarily a good thing. It means you haven't been putting that money to work for you all year long.\n\nIf you are receiving a refund this year, it means that you overpaid your taxes during the course of the year. Instead of giving the government your hard-earned money, think about all of the great things you could have done with that money, says Ron Weber, a senior marketing manager with Quicken Inc. You could have paid off credit accounts, invested it in your future, and/or spent it as you earned it. Money is always better in your pocket than in someone else's — even if that someone else is the government.\n\nMore tax help:\n\nDon't panic! A quick guide to everything you need to know as Tax Day approaches\n\nHow to make sure someone doesn't steal your tax refund\n\n10 bizarre claims people make to avoid paying taxes\n\nHere's how you can make sure you boost your bottom line this year by not overpaying your taxes and also not getting a refund.\n\nReview Your Withholdings\n\nSit down and review your paycheck withholdings and see if you can break even when it comes to the taxes you pay. You're looking for your Goldilocks zone. Not too little, not too much, but just right.\n\nIf you are unsure what to do, experiment until you get it right, Weber advises. Most people are unaware that you can change your number of payroll exemptions as many times as you wish.\n\nYou can also try using a tool to help you find your Goldilocks zone. The Internal Revenue Service has a withholdings calculator that can help you see how much difference a change in your withholdings will make. Certainly, you don't want to owe taxes next year if you can avoid it, but getting your tax refund as close to zero as possible means you can invest or spend the additional income on a regular basis instead of letting the Treasury Department store it for you.\n\nAs you review your withholdings, you'll want to be sure you …\n\nDon't Forget Your House …\n\nIf you own your own home, you probably know you can claim mortgage interest and property tax deductions, so take into account how much that will reduce your tax burden.\n\n… Or Your Investments\n\nIf you own investment property, you'll also want to consider any expenses you can deduct that might affect your taxes for next year.\n\n… Or Big Life Events\n\nThere are certain life events that you want to keep in mind when changing your exemptions such as marriage, having children or any situation where you decrease the number of dependents, such as divorce, Weber says. Also, keep in mind that while you are able to change the number of withholdings as often as you wish, your employer doesn't have to apply it until the first payroll ending 30 days after you submit the change, effectively limiting the number of times you actually can change. Other than these considerations, the ultimate goal each year is to get your refund close to zero. Make it a game and see how close you can come.\n\nBut You're Terrible at Saving Money, You Say?\n\nOf course, if saving isn't your forte and you're going to just end up spending whatever additional income you get throughout the year, letting Uncle Sam hold it for you might not be such a bad idea if you plan to put your refund directly into a retirement account like an IRA. The IRS will even help you keep your promise to invest the money by direct depositing all or part of your refund into savings, an IRA or even toward buying savings bonds.\n\nIf that's your situation, you can read our guide on how to maximize your tax refund. But investing that money into a 401K throughout the year could be a better alternative, especially if your employer provides matching funds.\n\nThose savings can pile up, especially if you start young. If you're planning to turn your refund into the start of a lifetime of saving, check out our list of 50 things young people can do to make sure they're set when it's time to retire.\n\nMore from Credit.com:\n\nThis article originally appeared on Credit.com.\n\nConstance is an editor at Credit.com.

Robert Powell\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nQ: I have been receiving Social Security disability benefits for the last two years. I am 62 and receive $2,200 per month. I know when I reach full retirement age 65 it goes to regular Social Security with no reduction of benefits.\n\nI want the maximum for my spouse now and after I pass. She will be turning 62 in November 2017. Is she entitled to half my disability benefit when she turns 62? She has applied for Social Security disability and was denied and she is waiting for a hearing. Both of us are in very poor health. Her estimated disability benefit is around $780 per month. Please advise what would be beneficial for us long-and-short term, based on that situation.\n\nMy next question pertains to my ex-spouse. Based on my disability benefit what would my ex receive , if anything? She is 64 and receives $500 per month based on her own claim. She never remarried, and we were married almost 20 years. How much would she be entitled to and at what age?\n\nA: You are correct that your disability benefit converts to a retirement benefit, says David Cechanowicz, a senior financial planner with REDW Stanley Financial Advisors.\n\nBut first, he says, you should know this: Whenever an ex-spouse has the ability to make a claim for Social Security benefits, it does not affect any of the benefits that are payable to a spouse or other auxiliary beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits.\n\nQ&A: Spousal issues with Social Security leave couples perplexed\n\nThat said, spousal benefits are limited to a maximum of 50% of your primary insurance amount (PIA) which is the amount you receive now as a disability benefit, says Cechanowicz. In your case, the maximum spousal benefit would be payable when your spouse reaches her full retirement age of 66, he says. If she claims a benefit early, the benefit will be reduced by what is known as an actuarial reduction. At age 62, the maximum spousal benefit is reduced by 30%.\n\nNow when your wife turns 62 next year, Cechanowicz says she'll be eligible for a spousal retirement benefit of $770 a month, just about the same as the disability benefit that she has applied for on her own work record. In the short run, if she is denied a disability claim on her own work record, she will become eligible for a reduced spousal benefit in November of 2017, he says. Even if she is granted the disability benefit before November, she will become eligible for spousal benefits if they will give her additional income in excess of her disability claim. The benefits should be automatically added to her benefit check.\n\nQ&A: Social Security spousal benefits raise questions about age\n\nAs for your ex-spouse, Cechanowicz says she is also eligible to file for a spousal benefit on your work record. Since she is already 64 years old, she is eligible for a benefit that is 83.33% of your current disability benefit, or $916 per month, he says. Since you were married for 10 years and she has never remarried, she could file immediately for the spousal benefit.\n\nOf note, the Social Security Administration treats the spousal benefit as an add-on to her existing retirement benefit and increases the amount she receives accordingly. However, depending on her personal circumstances, if she could afford to wait until her full retirement age of 66, she could file at that time and receive a combination of her reduced early claim and a portion of the maximum spousal benefit on your work record, says Cechanowicz\n\nNow, you spoke of wanting your spouse to be able to obtain the maximum benefit after you pass. That benefit is known as the survivor benefit and is equal to the amount of your current benefit, or $2,200 per month, says Cechanowicz. The full $2,200 per month survivor benefit is only available to your spouse when she reaches her own full retirement age.\n\nSo, for example, if you were to die two years from now, your spouse would be age 63 and subject to a reduction for claiming the survivor benefit early, says Cechanowicz. At that time, her age 63 Social Security benefit would switch from a spousal claim of approximately $770 per month (claimed at age 62) to a survivor benefit of approximately $1,886 per month for the rest of her life, he says, noting that the benefit will increase over time as cost-of-living adjustments are made.\n\nDeciding when to delay Social Security collection is tricky\n\nAs for spousal benefits, many people don't know that an ex-spouse is eligible for survivor benefits as long as the marriage lasted for at least 10 years, says Cechanowicz. So, in the example above, at the time your wife is eligible for a survivor benefit of $1,886 per month, your ex-spouse will be eligible for a benefit of $2,200 per month because she will have reached her full retirement age, he says.\n\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

PROTECTING THE SHIELD: Read our investigative series\n\nPhilip Seidle hates being called a killer cop.\n\nThe former Neptune police sergeant spends his days mostly alone, locked in a maximum-security cell at New Jersey State Prison, the facility for the state's toughest inmates.\n\nIt is true I killed and I was a police officer, Seidle wrote in an online message to the Asbury Park Press following a November court hearing in which a headline termed him a killer cop.\n\nINTERACTIVE GRAPHIC: Scroll towards the end of the story to explore the chain of events between Seidle and police officers during the shooting.\n\nThat particular phrase chaffed him. The term is unnecessary, Seidle wrote. It feels a bit like an attempt to disparage me.\n\nOnce entrusted with a badge and a gun to protect the town he called home, Seidle, 53, is no longer trusted with a real pen.\n\nIn evenly spaced, all-capitalized letters, Seidle wrote his life story on 27 yellow sheets of legal-size paper after being contacted by the Press in the summer to discuss his crime. The prison allows him to write with a flex pen – a crude ink tube with a rudimentary ballpoint used by inmates. The floppy writing tool is designed to not become a weapon in lockup.\n\nI killed my wife, and the mother of my children, the most horrific thing, Seidle wrote. I destroyed my children's lives. What I did is absolutely unacceptable. I can't forgive myself, and don't hold out any hope they ever will.\n\nExclusively for Insiders: Philip Seidle's thoughts - Inside the mind of a killer cop\n\nSeidle also spoke exclusively to the Press through phone calls facilitated by his one-time mistress. They still tell each other I love you on the calls.\n\nSeidle said he doesn't remember fatally shooting his ex-wife, Tamara Wilson-Seidle on June 16, 2015, in the middle of an Asbury Park street, in front of their 7-year-old daughter.\n\nI just think I had a mental breakdown. I just – because of all the stress that I was under and the anger that I had, Seidle said. I just blacked out that day.\n\nSigns of domestic problems in the Seidle home were long known to Seidle's colleagues, his supervisors, his chief, neighboring police departments, and the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, documents and interviews show.\n\nSeidle's department grew concerned enough to confiscate his service weapon in 2012 and again in 2014. His .40-caliber Glock, though, was returned to him. It was the weapon he used to gun down Tamara.\n\nIn his 22-year career, Seidle was the subject of 26 internal affairs reports conducted before the shooting.\n\nHis secret internal affairs file tops 600 pages.\n\nThe Press is suing Neptune to make the file public. A judge could decide the matter next month.\n\nWhat is known is that police responded to at least nine domestic incidents between the Seidles and 10 custody disputes – with police providing an escort during at least one custody confrontation.\n\nSeidle shared his psychologist's notes that detail the emotional devastation he said he felt during the custody battle with his ex-wife. Both Seidle and his ex-wife filed for domestic violence restraining orders, alleging past abuse.\n\nThis is a story about the two Phil Seidles.\n\nIn the community, Seidle was known as an upstanding officer – respected by citizens, looked up to by colleagues, a loving father of nine.\n\nBut beneath that public persona, Seidle's stress and frustration were no secret to his colleagues and supervisors. Both he and his ex-wife made claims of domestic violence.\n\nSeidle denied claims that he abused his ex-wife.\n\nTamara did not become a victim until I killed her that day, he wrote.\n\nThe Seidles' multiple domestic disputes were handled by authorities as isolated incidents, not looked at as a continuing pattern, public police records show.\n\nThe domestic issues caused Seidle to be suspended from his department at least twice and disarmed at least once, records show. Seidle said he was also disarmed a second time. He was sent by his department for psychological review at least three times.\n\nYet Seidle returned to duty, armed and frustrated.\n\nTamara's death at age 51 left their nine children without parents, prompted a multimillion-dollar legal claim by the kids and tainted the careers of two responding officers.\n\nBorn in Munich, West Germany, Tamara Wilson-Seidle often reminisced about milking cows and wearing traditional dirndl dresses as a child, her obituary said. She was a cheerleader and Neptune High School homecoming queen in 1982. She coached soccer. She was a devout Catholic, serving as director of religious education for the Mother of Mercy Parish.\n\nWhen Seidle was sentenced to 30 years in prison after pleading guilty to aggravated manslaughter, their eldest daughter described Tamara as the soul and the light of their family.\n\nHer killing shocked those in the community who knew Seidle as a police officer, a father of a large family, a teacher of Catholic faith and a kids' soccer coach.\n\nMonmouth County Prosecutor Chris Gramiccioni said the killing couldn't have been anticipated. He issued a report he touted as comprehensive and extensive. But that report excluded the Seidle divorce and police escorts during their custody dispute, a conflict that drove Seidle to kill.\n\nSeidle said he began to unravel during Tamara's pursuit of child custody, which he felt rose to criminal interference. The day he killed her, he shouted about his kids as he stood in the street with his pistol to his head.\n\nI'm tired of it! I'm tired of it! I got nine f------ kids she stole from me! Seidle ranted, all of it picked up on a police dash camera recording.\n\nSeidle said he was devastated by his fraying relationship with his children and the warming relationship between Tamara's new boyfriend and the Seidle children.\n\nAfter two years of fighting for your children, they don't want to be with you, Seidle wrote in an online message. You continue trying, but nothing works. Everyone acknowledges you're legally within your right to get them back, but nothing gets done. Then after 3 1/2 years of crying and wanting just to be a part of your children's lives, to talk to them, to see them, to know what's going on in their lives, to go to church, and do the things you used to. Then one day you find out they've been given away to someone else. Perhaps you take it lightly? Maybe you think I'm exaggerating? I'm not.\n\nYou tell me Mr. Ford. Tell me that isn't enough to bring someone to violence? I'm not saying it's right! I'm saying nothing stirs violence like a child. That's all I'm saying. I want this narrative of me being inherently violent to stop. Period. I want this idea that I was the one who needed to be stopped to cease. Tamara should have been stopped! Period. All I wanted was to share in my children's lives. If I had been allowed to, I'd have been fine. It was my right under every law on this earth, and I shouldn't have had to wait until she felt like abiding by the law.\n\nSeidle said he struggled to deal with stress at home. He said he should have been on medication, maybe an antidepressant or antianxiety drug. He should have moved away from the situation with his ex-wife.\n\nSeidle's chief acknowledged investigations uncovered major problems with Seidle, according to a court document.\n\nOne police internal affairs expert said the repetitive domestic tensions between the Seidles should have sent warning signs to his supervisors.\n\nBetween the work issues and the domestic violence complaints and the 911 calls to his house, someone, someone has to take the responsibility and tying all that together and saying there's a significant concern, said Michael D'Angelo, a retired police captain who served 23 years in South Miami Police Department, including performing internal affairs duties, and now works as a consultant on civil cases involving police.\n\nMore than three years before the shooting, Tamara filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order, court documents provided by Seidle show. She claimed Seidle put a gun to her cheek, gave her a black eye and kicked her stomach while pregnant. Seidle said in an interview those allegations were false. Tamara's quest for a restraining order was denied.\n\nThree years before the shooting, ongoing domestic incidents were discussed by a lieutenant in Neptune and a sergeant in Tinton Falls when they handled a confrontation between the Seidles, according to a police report. Higher ranking officers in both departments were notified of the incident.\n\nLess than a year before the shooting, Seidle tried to retire from the force in a fit of frustration over friction with his ex-wife and his deteriorating relationship with his children. He handed in his badge and gun. But Seidle said his colleagues encouraged him to return. He was put back on the job and rearmed.\n\nLess than four months before the shooting, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and restraining order of his own. He claimed in court documents that Tamara once threatened to kill him after he declined to have sex with her, she once threw items around their house, she involved the police in personal matters to embarrass him and in the past poked him in the chest and face, pushed him and slapped him. His restraining order wasn't granted either.\n\nTwo months before the shooting, Seidle filed a criminal complaint alleging that Tamara violated a judge's custody order by preventing Seidle's visits and phone calls, the court document shows.\n\nSix days before the shooting, a letter shows Bradley Beach Municipal Court Judge Richard B. Thompson found no probable cause for Seidle's criminal complaint, saying the issue was a civil matter.\n\nThen on the morning of June 16, 2015, Seidle learned Tamara's new boyfriend had been spending time alone with the Seidle children.\n\nSeidle said he doesn't remember chasing Tamara's car through the streets of Asbury Park with his 7-year-old daughter in his passenger seat. He doesn't remember running Tamara's car off the road in front of bewildered residents. He doesn't remember firing 13 rounds at close range in two volleys two minutes apart.\n\nHe does remember confronting his ex-wife in a church parking lot.\n\nThen he remembers staring at her limp foot hanging through the shattered glass of her car window.\n\nI realized I had shot her, Seidle said.\n\nSeidle was born to unmarried parents in April 1964 in Philadelphia.\n\nHe wrote that he felt his father abandoned the family.\n\nAfter high school, I didn't believe myself to be disciplined enough to go to college. Wanting to travel, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy in July of 1982 at 18, he wrote.\n\nI met Tamara in Oct. of '89 through a mutual friend of ours, with whom I'd been stationed with onboard both (U.S.S) Nitro and the Philly commissary. We talked on the phone for several months and began dating in February of 1990. She became pregnant in April 1990…\n\nThey were both 26. They married in August 1990, in St. Peter Claver Church in Asbury Park, court documents show. That's about half a mile from where Seidle shot Tamara.\n\nSeidle was honorably discharged from the Navy and hired by Neptune Township Police Department in July 1993.\n\nWithin a year of his hire, the department knew about Seidle's trouble at home. In March 1994, Seidle called Neptune police after Tamara allegedly threw a chair at him, according to a prosecutor's office report. But then, as it would happen several more times in the future, neither Seidle nor Tamara filed a criminal complaint.\n\nYou know, there were a lot of problems, Seidle said in a prison phone call. But we didn't believe in divorce and so we stayed together.\n\nBound by Catholic doctrine, the Seidle marriage was a cycle of faith, sin and reconciliation. For decades, there were showdowns documented by police and later in court between the Seidles, with each making allegations of domestic violence against the other.\n\nInternal affairs expert D'Angelo reviewed the special report on the Seidle shooting issued by Prosecutor Gramiccioni in 2016, a year after the shooting.\n\nSomewhere in here, there just reads of a complete – I don't know if it was a conscious decision – but just a complete disregard for her well-being, D'Angelo said. You investigated your officer several times. If you think that your obligation has ended when you complete that investigation and dish out whatever punishment that the higher ups have deemed fair to him, I mean, when there's domestic violence, the department knows that their obligation hasn't ended.\n\nEven Seidle acknowledged the repeated calls should have warranted further scrutiny, though he contends that his ex-wife was lying to the police.\n\nThe thing is that after all these complaints someone should have stepped in and done some kind of investigation and said: what is going on here? He said. Why is she constantly calling the police? Why does she continue to call the police for these matters?\n\nGramiccioni's report underscores a failing in New Jersey police policy.\n\nThis review and analysis disclosed a critical flaw in the domestic violence policies and procedures that currently exist statewide, the report stated. The report also raised concern with officers who are the subject of numerous internal affairs complaints.\n\nGramiccioni has since established an early warning system in which Monmouth County departments are required to report to the prosecutor's office if an officer meets criteria like being involved in a domestic violence incident.\n\nGramiccioni's report was produced by his office after the New Jersey Attorney General's office found no conflict of interest with the prosecutor's office investigating. The report largely absolves those who oversaw Seidle, including the prosecutor's office.\n\nWhile the law enforcement response to this matter had its flaws in some regard, none of them caused the death of Tamara Seidle. Philip Seidle did, Gramiccioni said at his 2016 press conference. With hindsight being 20/20, the unfortunate reality is that no alternative or additional police action that could have prevented Seidle from brutally killing Tamara Seidle on that fateful day in Asbury Park. It's simply a crime of passion that could not be anticipated.\n\nSeidle wrote from prison that Gramiccioni was protecting his office from legal liability.\n\nThat declaration was for the civil suit, Seidle wrote. And basically, their investigation covered all of the allegations made by my children in the suit. They cleared themselves in a case where they are my co-defendants. I think there's something wrong with that, and cannot understand why the Attorney General's Office allowed it.\n\nIn an interview, the prosecutor's office limited its comments on Seidle, pointing to the children's lawsuit.\n\nMany people surrounding the Seidles didn't respond or declined to comment, including the attorney representing the Seidle children in the lawsuit, the Seidles' priest, the Catholic Diocese of Trenton, the Seidles' divorce attorneys, the Neptune police chief, and former police director.\n\nDespite trouble at home, Seidle worked his way up the police ranks eventually earning $140,000 a year as a sergeant. He was the breadwinner, providing his family with a 2,286-square-foot home with a large yard on a quiet cul-de-sac in a recently-developed subdivision.\n\nI had a few bumps the first couple years, he wrote of his career. I had a number of car accidents (minor), and fell and cut my eye open. I studied on and off the job hard to learn the law, and how to survive on the streets as a proactive officer. I earned a reputation for being very knowledgeable in the law, and for making good arrests.\n\nSeidle worked in patrol, later as a detective and as a sergeant. He was credited for police work in Asbury Park Press stories. He helped make arrests in a car theft ring in 1995, he was among officers who booked several people after a shooting in 1997. While patrolling in an unmarked car in 1998, he arrested a man who tried to sell him cocaine. He received a commendation from the 200 Club of Monmouth County – an organization that supports the police – in 2007 for his role as a detective on the department's quality of life team.\n\nHe provided letters of support citizens wrote on his behalf.\n\nIn the last week I had occasion to be in touch with your Patrolman Philip Seidel (sic) on three occasions and I wanted to let you know that I found him to show good judgment and professionalism on each occasion, Ruth E. Buck, proprietor of The Shelburne Hotel, wrote in June 1994.\n\nSeidle wrote often about his children. He was there for each of the nine births, he wrote. He coached sports, chaperoned class trips and attended their parent-teacher conferences and religious sacraments. Seidle's younger half-brother provided photos of Seidle with his kids at a wrestling match, a soccer game, in an ice cream shop.\n\nThere were many good times, Seidle wrote. To most people on the outside, we had the perfect family, because we were always together. We did everything as a family…But the marriage was dysfunctional.\n\nAnd his department knew about that dysfunction.\n\nIn 2001, police responded to a screaming match that escalated to Tamara pushing Seidle, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nProblems persisted, and worsened, Seidle wrote.\n\nTamara stopped working to stay home with the kids after their sixth child was born, Seidle wrote. She nearly died during the birth of their seventh child and underwent a gall bladder surgery in 2002, Seidle wrote. She lost her mother and father within a year.\n\nShe shut down and stopped tending to her responsibilities, Seidle wrote.\n\nTheir problems deepened, but still they stuck it out.\n\nI grew impatient over the next couple years, and in the later part of 2004, I had an extramarital affair, Seidle wrote. It lasted three months. I ended it because I knew it was wrong, and did not want to continue to mislead my wife, and commit adultery.\n\nSeidle wrote that he believed Tamara also had an affair.\n\nThey went to marital counseling.\n\nSeidle considered a separation in 2006, he wrote, but Tamara was opposed to it. Neptune police came to their home in March that year for a verbal dispute, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nBy April 2010, I'd decided to leave, Seidle wrote. I had told myself I would stay for the kids, and being a Catholic, divorce was frowned upon. I was making an effort to live my faith. But I reached the point I resented being around her, and even living in my home.\n\nHe planned to leave in January 2011, wanting not to spoil the holidays. But in October 2010, Tamara told him she had breast cancer.\n\nSeidle helped Tamara with her treatment, feeding her, helping her in and out of bed, to the toilet and shower, taking her to surgeries and chemotherapy and radiation treatments, he wrote. Seidle was photographed standing with his family for the high school graduation of their eldest son, with Tamara wearing a head covering consistent with the hair loss that comes with cancer treatment.\n\nBut after an ordeal that might draw couples closer together, the Seidles grew further apart.\n\nAnd then came more calls to the police.\n\nSeidle began seeing Gloria Patricia Chavarriaga. A divorce document filed on Tamara's behalf claimed this happened during her cancer treatment, which ended in June 2011.\n\nChavarriaga told Tinton Falls police she suspected Tamara once flattened four tires on Chavarriaga's car because of who Chavarriaga was dating, according to a December 2011 report. But Tamara denied it and Chavarriaga later told police she wasn't sure who caused the damage.\n\nSeidle met Chavarriaga through church. Chavarriaga, 54, knew Seidle for years professionally before they were involved romantically, she told a reporter. She was a single parent and Seidle helped with her daughters. She admired the way Seidle loved his children.\n\nThey walk straight, Chavarriaga said of the children. They are good kids. That says a lot when children behave because obviously, someone is teaching them the right thing.\n\nSeidle mentored Chavarriaga's daughter, Samantha Rittman, who is now 24 and living in Virginia Beach.\n\nSeidle was stern with Rittman when she got in trouble as a teenager, Rittman recalled. He was supportive of Rittman when she struggled later in life following the birth of her first son.\n\nHe never turned his back on me, she said. Ever.\n\nShe recalled that Seidle was distressed about not being with his children.\n\nHe was constantly a mess over his kids, Rittman said. That's one thing, he always tried to be there for his kids.\n\nRittman never expected violence from Seidle, she said. Seidle didn't seem like that kind of person.\n\nI was angry for a while, I was really angry, she said. Angry because Seidle hurt Chavarriaga. He made Chavarriaga happy and Rittman thought they'd have a future together.\n\nI just feel like what he did was selfish, she said.\n\nSeidle left Tamara in January 2012, he wrote.\n\nPrior to doing so, I took the six oldest (children) and spoke to them, telling them I was leaving because I was unhappy, and that their mom and I were not getting along, he wrote. I did nothing to embarrass either of us, and wanted to do nothing to make the children feel responsible, or be in the middle.\n\nThen there were two reports of domestic incidents involving Seidle in January and February that year, according to the prosecutor's report. Tinton Falls police responded to a confrontation between Seidle and one of Chavarriaga's daughters, according to the prosecutor's report. Seidle provided the Press with a letter showing the girl recanting her statement to police that Seidle put his hands on her.\n\nSix days later, Neptune Township police responded to a confrontation at the Seidle home. Seidle said he showed up to get a training document, the prosecutor's report shows the couple got into an argument. When police arrived, Tamara made allegations of past abuse similar to claims she would make when she filed for divorce and for a restraining order. Seidle said these were lies.\n\nSeidle said Tamara wanted to get back at him.\n\nShe wanted revenge for me leaving, he wrote. She knew there were two things important to me… my children and my reputation. She wanted to take away both of those things to hurt me the way I had hurt her by leaving.\n\nSeidle was suspended for two days in February 2012 because his department felt he interfered with the police response. Seidle said he was trying to make sure proper protocol was followed. Seidle was sent to a police psychologist. Seidle was deemed unfit for duty.\n\nSeidle said he told the doctor that I was extremely upset by Tamara's lies, and did not want to be at work during this time, as I would have trouble focusing.\n\nHe wrote that he was found unfit because he asked to be. His unfitness was not on any finding of psychological dysfunction, or disorder, Seidle said.\n\nHe remained off duty until May 2012.\n\nI was ordered by my chief to 'stay away' from Tammy for my 'own good,' he wrote of his return to work. Then-police Chief Robert Adams could not be reached for comment.\n\nTamara filed for divorce in June 2013, claiming abuse. Seidle denied those claims in court and interviews.\n\nTamara's allegations were made in publicly available documents that were later obtained by the Press, but the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office ignored them in its final report.\n\nAllegations made by Philip and Tamara Seidle in the context of their divorce or any other civil actions were not a part of this analysis, as those fall outside the purview of any law enforcement agency and cannot be verified, the prosecutor's report stated.\n\nTamara sought sole custody of the children. At the time, six were younger than 18. Seidle was ordered in October 2013 to pay $3,000 in alimony and $2,606 in child support each month, based on earnings in 2012 worth $11,930 before taxes, according to a court document.\n\nSeidle said the fight over child custody hurt him deeply.\n\nI couldn't cope, he wrote. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate. I suffered from depression, anger, anxiety, high blood pressure. I was a mess. My emotional well-being spiraled out of control.\n\nPolice reports show Neptune officers acted as escorts for two incidents involving the Seidles, including a custody dispute. Both Seidles and the Seidle children made note in publicly available legal filings of the practice of officers making escorts.\n\nBut Gramiccioni's report made no mention of police escorts and set aside the calls for custody disputes, saying they do not constitute incidents of domestic violence.\n\nSeidle explained how the fight over the children led to the ultimate tragedy.\n\nIt went wrong from day one, from the minute she was allowed to keep the children away from me, Seidle said. That's where it went wrong. It was just a continuum. There was a buildup and a buildup and a buildup… I love my children, my children were everything to me, they were my life. More than anything in the world I cared about my children and it was important for me to be a father to them. I wanted to be the father that I never had.\n\nSeidle provided notes from a psychologist, Raymond Hanbury, who counseled Seidle and documented his struggle starting in 2012, after he was found unfit for duty by a department psychologist. Hanbury didn't respond to calls seeking comment.\n\nHe does get emotional when he talks about his lack of contact with the children because Tammy makes it difficult, Hanbury wrote in an entry dated March 28, 2012.\n\nHanbury wrote in May 2014 that Seidle's issues with Tamara, the children and the divorce appeared to be affecting the officer's performance at work. Hanbury shared findings with another psychologist, who worked for Seidle's department, according to legal testimony from current Neptune Police Chief James Hunt.\n\nSeidle was very emotional and tearful when he was talking about his relationship with the children, Hanbury wrote in November 2014.\n\nDivorce is finalized, Hanbury wrote in an entry two weeks before the killing. However, he was upset with Tammy because she reportedly threw his personal items out. They include Navy papers, training certificates and personal items that meant something to him.\n\n\n\n'But they're gone,' the psychologist wrote, apparently quoting Seidle. 'I need to focus on the children.'\n\n\n\nIn an undated final entry, Hanbury wrote: On June 16, Phil shot his ex-wife, fatal, and was arrested. There were no indications or signs of something like this to happen. He denied in sessions that he would do anything to jeopardize his being with the children, especially the younger ones.\n\nSeidle dismissed the effectiveness of the therapy.\n\nSending me to counseling was stitching up a wound week to week, to have her rip it open every time, Seidle wrote. I would go to counseling to talk about what she did, and how it upset me, to leave the sessions and have her do the same thing through to the next session. So where was the healing to take place? Tell me? Every day I missed being a part of my children's lives was a day neither her, nor anyone else could give me back. There was no amount of money, or anything else she could compensate me with for the loss of that time. Missing my son's first communion, because she couldn't have the courtesy to tell me, because she couldn't swallow her gall, couldn't ever be gotten back. Having people constantly tell me about events my children participated in, that I missed simply for her inability to be civil, or of accomplishments they had, that she wouldn't tell me about for her spite, couldn't in a lifetime be made up for. My children would never be able to say, 'my dad was always there.' Not because I left, but for her malice.\n\nThe dispute over child custody led to more police calls to the Seidle home, departmental discipline for Seidle and rising tension between the Seidles.\n\nIf they say that when you find out someone's cheating on you – your husband or your wife is cheating on you, you can be driven to violence – you can't be driven to violence when your children are taken away from you and kept away from you until the point where finally, one day, you just snap? Seidle asked. Doesn't matter whether I was a cop or not, any man would have done the same thing, would have felt the same way.\n\nLocal law enforcement – from fellow officers to the prosecutor's office – were long aware of problems in the Seidle household.\n\nSeidle said his colleagues knew of his troubles.\n\nCapt. Lawrence Fisher was there for me in every way during this whole ordeal, Seidle said. He saw me crying and things that went on with me emotionally when nobody else was around. Fisher could not be reached for comment\n\nSeidle said department supervisors knew of his problems.\n\nThe line supervisors, they were all aware, Seidle said. They knew what was going on, they knew that there were problems…you know there were times that I came to work late. I reported late because I had to be, I was in court. I had to be in court. And then just all the police reports that I made. And I spoke to them constantly.\n\nOver a period of two years, my performance suffered, and I received poor evaluations for what was described as poor decision making (lack of focus). On the evaluations they repeatedly indicated I was an outstanding officer with a good reputation, but my performance was suffering due to personal problems.\n\nSeidle's chief knew.\n\nPolice Chief Hunt took over in September 2014 from Chief Adams, who retired.\n\nIn legal testimony, Hunt said he became aware of Seidle's issues before the shooting.\n\nHe didn't disclose in depth that he was having – it was kind of everyone knew he was having problems, Hunt said. He was close to certain officers in the police department, but he didn't come to me and say hey, Chief, I am having major league problems.\n\nHunt said in the deposition: Just through our investigations into this and internal affair investigation is where we learned what the major problems were.\n\nHunt described three issues with Seidle at work: one in which he screwed up with evidence, one in which he screwed up the readings on a breathalyzer test, causing the department to dismiss a DWI case, and the incident in which he argued with township police officers who responded to a custody dispute between him and Tamara.\n\nFor those issues, Seidle agreed that he would take a 30-day suspension, Hunt said in the deposition, spreading that time off over one week per month for six months. Seidle agreed that he'd keep seeing his psychologist and that his psychologist would report back to a township doctor.\n\nThe prosecutor's report acknowledged the incident in which Seidle argued with officers, and his suspension, but didn't mention the issue Seidle had with evidence or the botched DWI case.\n\nPunitive measures like suspensions and disarmament compounded the stress he was under, Seidle said. The punishments hindered his ability to pay child support, alimony and his own bills because suspensions cut his six-figure pay, he said. He said he leaned on Capt. Fisher for sympathy and, at one point, to pay the rent.\n\nHis department's reactions didn't address the real problem, he said from prison – stress related to his troubled access to his children.\n\n\n\nThe chief thought the answer was to punish me, Seidle said. You know, if I forgot to do something or he saw me under stress – and he knew why – but his answer was: punish Phil and then that's going to make him, you know, somehow magically not, or make me perform or do better; when the problem wasn't with me not wanting to do it or not being able to, it was the fact that I was under stress and I was just having trouble coping. Having trouble with what was going on in my personal life. And he knew that, he knew that.\n\nIn one incident about 11 months before the shooting, Seidle approached two of his children at their job at a snack stand on the Ocean Grove boardwalk. He said one of his daughters hadn't been returning his calls. He told the Press that he told the 16-year-old he wanted her to call him, and if she didn't there would be consequences.\n\nThe teen's employer called police, according to the prosecutor's office report. Police interviewed the children, who said they didn't want a relationship with Seidle, according to the report.\n\nSeidle said he was called into Hunt's office to talk about the incident and that the chief told Seidle his daughter accused Seidle of harassing her at her job. Seidle felt the kids had been put up to this by Tamara.\n\nSeidle became frustrated.\n\nI'm tired of being intimidated and threatened by my wife every time we have a disagreement or something goes on between the kids, he recalled telling the chief.\n\nSo, he said he was retiring.\n\nI gave him my badge and my gun and I told him: 'that's it, I'm going to resign because I'm just fed up,' Seidle said.\n\nAfterward, he said he talked to two colleagues, Capt. Fisher and Sgt. J. Hunter Ellison. Ellison also couldn't be reached for comment. Fisher would later respond to the scene the day Seidle shot Tamara.\n\n…They all tried to convince me not to leave, they told me it wasn't a good idea, Seidle said.\n\nSeidle was cleared by a psychologist after an evaluation in August 2014.\n\nHe returned and the department gave him back his .40 Glock.\n\nTrouble spread beyond Neptune.\n\nIn Tinton Falls one night in 2012, Tamara admitted she had been drinking and followed Seidle to the gym because she thought he was headed to see his mistress. Seidle called the police, she left by the time they arrived and Seidle declined to file a complaint.\n\nThe responding Tinton Falls officer contacted Sgt. Doug McEntegart. McEntegart spoke by phone with a Neptune Township lieutenant, a police report shows.\n\nHe informed me that there has been ongoing domestic incidents with the Seidles, and after a brief discussion on that, I assured the lieutenant that a report for harassment would be written documenting the incident, McEntegart wrote.\n\nBoth McEntegart and the Neptune lieutenant notified higher-ranking officers. McEntegart also briefed an assistant Monmouth County prosecutor. In an interview, First Assistant Prosecutor Lori Linskey said this was a police officer asking for legal advice, which doesn't mean a case was opened by the prosecutor's office.\n\nIn Asbury Park the year before the shooting, Seidle said he and Tamara got into a custody dispute at Our Lady of Mount Carmel, a church and school where Seidle would later confront Tamara the day she died.\n\nThe argument prompted an Asbury Park police response, according to Seidle. He provided a copy of a report showing a custody dispute at the school on the date Seidle claimed it happened, though the report doesn't name who was involved in the dispute. The city denied having access to the document.\n\nThe next day, Seidle filed for a domestic violence civil complaint and temporary restraining order, detailing the custody dispute and alleging past abuse by Tamara.\n\nAt least three times, the Seidle drama reached as high as the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, the top law-enforcement agency in the county.\n\nIn addition to being notified about the Tinton Falls incident, the prosecutor's office was notified of the 2012 argument at the Seidle home in which Tamara alleged past abuse and they signed off when Seidle was later rearmed.\n\nThe prosecutor's office was notified of a 2014 incident in which Tamara reported to police that Seidle was harassing her, then Seidle began screaming profanities at the officers who responded, according to the prosecutor's report.\n\nTheir report shows Seidle wasn't disarmed after this incident. Seidle told the Press that his gun was taken away again around this time.\n\nNeptune township officials refuse to release documents showing what they knew about Seidle's problems and when they knew it.\n\nThe township denied the Press access to the 682-page internal affairs report on Seidle on the grounds that it was a confidential employee record. Seidle's internal affairs history was not released in Gramiccioni's report.\n\nThe Press sued, saying the public deserves to see the documents to examine how Seidle's case was handled by police in the years leading up to the shooting.\n\nIn a Nov. 3 hearing, Monmouth County Assignment Judge Lisa P. Thornton remarked on the number of internal affairs incidents.\n\nAs a lay person, it seems to me like an excessive amount, she said.\n\nWhile his IA file remains secret, documents did emerge publicly showing two citizens complained in 2004 that Seidle used excessive force during arrests, according to documents attached to a lawsuit alleging excessive force during a 2015 arrest. That lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge and Seidle was cleared by his department in the 2015 incident.\n\nOne complaint in 2004 claims Seidle threw a man on top of the police cruiser then punched him in the jaw and kicked him in the ribs. The second claims he hit a man on a bicycle with his police car then kneed and kicked him. The official outcomes of those complaints remain obscured by Neptune's denial of records. These complaints aren't mentioned in Gramiccioni's report.\n\nI never, you know, was written up or had any incidents where I abused my authority or where I used excessive force against someone, Seidle said generally about his discipline. I never was punished for anything like that.\n\n\n\nA reporter sought official copies of documents provided by Seidle and his half-brother, though many were denied by the government.\n\nIn addition to denying the hundreds of pages of Seidle's internal affairs history, Neptune also denied access to 15 police reports naming Seidle, including 11 which also name Tamara, saying they are criminal investigatory reports. The purported criminal investigations were dated within the last four years of Seidle's career. Seven of the police reports correspond with short incident reports the township did provide which indicate the obscured documents relate to custody disputes.\n\nSeidle insists he didn't plan to kill his ex-wife.\n\nThe morning of June 16, 2015, Seidle said he drove past the family's house. He had a few hours before he had to report to duty that day and he was going to take his girl to buy a dress for a father-daughter dance on Father's Day.\n\nHe was supposed to pick up their youngest daughter at the family home on Heritage Court but she didn't come outside. Tamara was already at work.\n\n\n\nA congratulations banner was still over the door. The family threw a party the weekend before for two of the eldest children. They were the first in Seidle's lineage to graduate from college.\n\nSeidle, though, was suspicious of a car with Georgia plates in the driveway. He jotted down the license plate number. He assumed it was her boyfriend.\n\nHe called Tamara.\n\nWhose car is that in the driveway? He asked.\n\nNone of your business, he recalled Tamara saying.\n\nIt is my business. If this guy is living there, that's a problem, Seidle said.\n\nHe said she wasn't supposed to have someone living there if he's paying alimony. And he was concerned about another man around their children.\n\nSeidle's eldest daughter dropped his youngest daughter off at his home on Walnut Street in Neptune. Seidle deduced that a man had been spending time with Tamara and the children. The kids had mentioned his last name before, his parents spent time with the kids. He was at the graduation party.\n\nThen all of this started just hitting me, Seidle said. That was where the emotion started spiraling out of control.\n\n\n\nSeidle left his home with his 7-year-old daughter and his gun belt. The off-duty 6-foot-4, 230-pound police sergeant was dressed in a peach polo shirt, navy shorts and brown sandals on the sunny day. He wore a Bluetooth earpiece.\n\nHe called Tamara as he was walking out of his home.\n\nIs this guy living there? He asked.\n\nShe was busy and couldn't talk, Seidle recalled.\n\nIf he's living there, there's going to be a f------ problem, Seidle said.\n\nI've got to go, Tamara replied, he said. She told Seidle that one of their children would have a father with or without you.\n\nSeidle was shocked and hung up the phone.\n\nTamara told her boyfriend and her eldest daughter that Seidle threatened to kill her, according to grand jury testimony Seidle provided to the Press.\n\n\n\nSeidle said he drove up Route 18 in his silver Honda Pilot, heading toward Monmouth Mall.\n\nHe spoke to his daughter, who confirmed Tamara's boyfriend had been staying at the house for two weeks.\n\nSeidle slid into an emotional tailspin because her boyfriend was being left alone with Seidle's kids, taking over the role of the father, Seidle said.\n\nSeidle thought he would never get his kids back.\n\nI believed she was jeopardizing my children's safety, as well as my ability to repair my relationship with them, he wrote.\n\nHe said he called Tamara several times.\n\nShe texted him back: What do you want.\n\nSeidle cut off the highway at Route 66 and drove to the church.\n\nShe didn't answer the phone, Seidle said. I said 'OK, well if she won't answer the phone I'm gonna go to the job and I'll talk to her and get her to talk to me and see what's going on.'\n\nHe said he didn't expect to find her in the parking lot. When he saw her there, he thought they would talk, but she pulled away in her car.\n\nEverything just went downhill from there, Seidle said. I just blacked out. Spiraled. My emotions were – I just got overloaded with the emotions.\n\nSeidle said he doesn't remember what happened next.\n\nJust emotionally it all just piled up on me, he said. And I just broke down and just, I don't know, just flew off the handle and just lost my mind.\n\nHe chased her west on First Avenue, south on Central and west on Asbury Avenue, grand jury testimony shows. His car struck her car near Jimmy's Restaurant, knocking off the front license plate of Seidle's SUV.\n\nThree people lingered on their home porch on Sewall Avenue in Asbury Park. A worker ate a sandwich in his nearby car. An employee at a plumbing supply company down the street retrieved tools from a truck.\n\nResponding to a fender bender on the corner, Asbury Park Patrol Officer Ahmed Lawson followed the routine procedures, asking for driver's license, insurance and registration.\n\nThen a car horn, screeching tires. The two Seidle cars tore around the corner of Ridge Avenue, nearly hitting Lawson as he jumped out of the way.\n\n\n\nSeidle's SUV smashed into the rear of Tamara's black sedan, ramming it into another parked car.\n\nOnce he exited the vehicle, he began shooting, Lawson told investigators.\n\n\n\nThe camera on Lawson's patrol car recorded the sounds of the shooting. Eight shots can be heard in the video in quick succession, then a ninth shot.\n\nLawson can be seen in video ducking behind his patrol car, away from Seidle.\n\nProsecutor Gramiccioni said Lawson was too far away to effectively shoot Seidle.\n\nLawson recognized him. He begged for Seidle to drop his weapon.\n\nHey Phil! Drop that gun Phil! Lawson yelled before ducking back behind his patrol car.\n\nSeidle's voice can be heard on the video.\n\nNow what!? Seidle shouts.\n\nLawson gave the location over the radio, shouting for backup, noting that Seidle had the gun to his head and that he was a sergeant from Neptune. Seidle's daughter ran to responding officers and Asbury Park police Capt. Marshawn Love. Love had been their neighbor for more than a decade and recognized the cars as belonging to the Seidles. He drove Seidle's daughter away from the scene.\n\nSeidle fired another volley of four shots through the front window two minutes after the first.\n\nHe fired all but one round in the magazine of his Glock.\n\nWith his left hand, Seidle held the gun to his head. For about 45 minutes, officers held their fire, trying to coax Seidle into surrendering. He shouted profanity, furious about being kept apart from his nine children.\n\nWith his right hand, he typed a text message to the children:\n\nYour mother is dead because of her actions…\n\nGoodbye forever.\n\nNearly 70 officers from four agencies surrounded Seidle within minutes.\n\nOfficers begged Seidle to put the gun down, many calling to him by his first name.\n\nA Monmouth County prosecutor's detective, Asbury Park Detective Lt. David DeSane and another officer removed Tamara from her car, the grand jury testimony shows.\n\nShe was pronounced dead minutes later at Jersey Shore University Medical Center.\n\nNeptune Capt. Fisher pleaded with Seidle to drop his gun, the grand jury testimony shows. Fisher had worked with Seidle for years. Seidle said Fisher had seen him cry.\n\nHim and I were very close over the years, Seidle said. And I wanted to kill myself. But at that moment I just felt like I couldn't do it because him and I were very close and I didn't want to leave him with that memory.\n\nYou owe me that much, Seidle recalled Fisher saying at the scene.\n\nOfficers told Seidle if he dropped the gun he would get to see his kids.\n\nDeSane left the scene to get Seidle's kids, sending a photo of them to another detective who remained at the scene. That detective slid his phone to Seidle.\n\nThey said they'd take his kids to a prosecutor's satellite office in Asbury Park. Ten minutes later, they showed him another photo of the children.\n\nSeidle lowered his gun. He placed it on the ground.\n\nSeidle and Fisher embraced.\n\nWhen it was all over, I just felt like falling out, like collapsing, Seidle said. And I remember when he came, when he came into the street I just, I don't know, I fell into his arms.\n\nSeidle was taken to the prosecutor's outpost in Asbury Park and escorted into a conference room, grand jury testimony shows.\n\nThe prosecutor's detective explained that he would let Seidle speak to the children, but Seidle couldn't mention what he did to their mother.\n\nSeidle agreed.\n\nHe was placed in a chair and given a bottle of water. They led his children into the room in two groups.\n\nFor years, Seidle had fought in court to get more time with his kids. The custody disputes with Tamara derailed his career. The thought that another man was moving into their lives triggered a breakdown.\n\nSeidle had wanted to be the father figure he never had.\n\nBut there he was, arrested on a murder charge the week of Father's Day.\n\nSeidle and the children exchanged few words.\n\nI just told them that I love them and that I only wanted to have a relationship with them and that I was sorry, he said.\n\nThen he was led away to jail.\n\nThat was their last conversation.\n\nSeidle was taken to the Monmouth County Jail a few miles away in Freehold. His clothing, his photograph and his fingerprints were taken. It was a process the veteran cop had performed on detainees many times, but now Seidle was on the other side. Besides training at the police academy, he said that was the only day he had been in handcuffs.\n\nAll of it was unbelievable, he said.\n\nAs reality sank in for Seidle in his cell, shock and outrage radiated from Sewall Avenue, making headlines across the region.\n\nThe first thing he did in jail was to ask for a priest. Seidle said he confessed his sin and asked for absolution.\n\nThe week after the shooting, hundreds of people attended Tamara's Catholic funeral, where her nine children followed her casket out of a church about a mile from the crime scene. The children later filed a lawsuit alleging negligence by the law enforcement agencies responsible for overseeing Seidle and responding to the shooting. A notice of claim showed they are seeking $10 million in damages. Neptune, Asbury Park and Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office have filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit.\n\nThese days, Seidle is locked alone in a prison cell. He is let out for a few hours each day to perform tasks as a runner, passing out juice and hot water to inmates, collecting their trash after dinner, picking up their laundry. He takes an antidepressant. He gets recreation time with other inmates, indoors, separated in individual cages with a port through which they can play cards or chess.\n\n\n\nHe telephones Chavarriaga, who he called his partner, in the morning and evening. He sleeps well at night. He thinks about his children, especially on holidays and birthdays.\n\nHe unsuccessfully appealed his sentence. He said he didn't deserve 30 years, but declined to say what would have been an appropriate sentence.\n\nThis firm defended Phil Seidle under extremely difficult circumstances to the very best of our ability, said his attorney, Edward Bertucio. He avoided a murder conviction with a possibility of a sentence he could not outlive. Instead we negotiated aggravated manslaughter and the sentence he received was lengthy. We appealed it. We did everything we could for him. I wish him the very best.\n\nSeidle found fault in how many people treated him. He said his ex-wife's abuse claims were lies, he dismissed his first divorce attorney, he felt the divorce judge merely warned Tamara for violations of orders, he described how his police chief's punishments just created more stress for him.\n\n\n\nBut he doesn't pass blame for the killing.\n\nI carry the guilt every day of what I've done, the life I've taken, and the lives I've ruined, he wrote. I know I've written a lot about how I was wronged, and what I went through. I can sound like I'm trying to justify what I've done. That's not at all true. I want you to know I hate what I did. I am horrified and deeply saddened. It is reprehensible, and unjustifiable. I killed the woman who at one point I loved, and even though I hated what she did to me, I didn't hate her. I still cared for her as the person who I spent almost twenty-two years raising nine beautiful children with. Although our marriage failed, there were many good times.\n\nSeidle hopes someday he can apologize directly to his children.\n\nI don't expect them to forgive me, he said. But I just want them to know how sorry I am.\n\n\n\nHe said he does believe in an afterlife.\n\nI believe that God forgives us for all of our sins, especially when we ask him, he said. And I think that one day, you know, I will have the opportunity to tell Tamara, hopefully, how sorry I am for what I did to her.\n\nSeidle will become eligible for parole in December 2040, when he'll be 76.\n\nHe plans to make it there.\n\nThere's no doubt about it, Seidle said. I will walk out of these walls one day.\n\nDesign and development by Felecia Wellington Radel.

Mark Curnutte\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nCINCINNATI — The wedding is back on for a man who's sitting in an Ohio jail while his lawyers try to prevent his deportation.\n\nLess than a day after saying he would not allow the jailhouse wedding of Yancarlos Mendez of Springdale and his fiancée, Morrow County Sheriff John L. Hinton said he will let the ceremony take place in his jail.\n\nFirst, though, he told lawyers for Mendez, he needs permission from federal immigration officials.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have requested a letter from Mendez and Sandra Mendoza that states their desire to get married, said attorney Nazly Mamedova. It will be sent Friday.\n\nMore:Despite social media outcry, paraplegic boy's 'Daddy' to be deported\n\nMore:Ohio sheriff blocks jailhouse marriage of immigrant facing deportation\n\nThe couple had hoped to be married Friday.\n\nThat time I got too excited, so I am not going to get too excited this time, Mendoza said. I want to be excited when the moment happens.\n\nMarriage could improve Mendez's chances of being allowed to stay in the United States.\n\nThe auto mechanic has been living with his fiancée and her 6-year-old son, Ricky Solis, since 2014, financially supporting both and helping to care for the boy since he was badly injured in a car crash last year.\n\nMendez spoke Friday afternoon with The Cincinnati Enquirer.\n\nI am trying to be fine and good today, but in here nobody is good, Mendez said. I miss my future wife and Ricky. I miss Ricky so much. He is everything to me. My life changed (for) the better the day I met Ricky.\n\nWhen Mendez was arrested in Butler County in November for driving without a license and then scheduled for deportation, he requested a hardship waiver to stay in the United States. Mendez and Mendoza are the only people trained to provide the complex care Ricky needs.\n\nAfter ascertaining that Mendez is not the boy's biological father, ICE denied the waiver. However, being married to Mendoza would make him Ricky's stepfather, a legally recognized relationship.\n\nThe couple had been planning to marry since February, but the wedding was delayed because of Ricky's health. The child remains hospitalized at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where he awaits abdominal surgery related to his injuries.\n\nEvery day he asks for his daddy, Mendoza said. He wants to come home. He wants us to be together like we used to be.\n\nThe sheriff's change of mind came after Mendez's attorneys sent him a letter late Thursday. It included case law that prohibiting jailhouse weddings violates the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.\n\nMendez isn't at immediate risk of being deported, because the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay last week. On Thursday, the court set a schedule for his court case moving forward with his appeal of the deportation order that could keep him in the United States at least until April.\n\nMendez, who originally entered the country on a 90-day Visa Waiver Program, is a native of the Dominican Republic with dual Spanish citizenship.
WASHINGTON – Chasten Buttigieg, husband to 2020 Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg, said that he has been dealing with the likes of Rush Limbaugh my entire life\n\nThe comments come after the longtime conservative radio host, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom during President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech, said that despite all the great wokeness, Democrats and America are not ready to elect a gay guy kissing his husband.\n\nChasten Buttigieg told ABC News that he had to deal with a multitude of Rush Limbaugh's walking through the hallways of high school everyday, but that he is mostly worried about the young people in this country watching the likes of the historic nature of this campaign.\n\nMore:Bloomberg attacked, Warren fights back, Sanders holds steady: How each candidate fared in a rowdy debate\n\nMore:George Zimmerman sues Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg for defamation, seeks $265 million\n\nWatching how they talk about it, watching how people react to it and treat it, he continued. And they're wondering if this country is actually a safe place for them to be.\n\nIf Buttigieg won the Democratic nomination, he would be the first gay candidate to represent a major party in an election. He and Chasten, a former middle school teacher, have been married since 2018.\n\nWhen discussing the issue during CNN's town hall on Tuesday, Pete Buttigieg took his previous comments about Limbaugh's statement one step further.\n\nMore:Donald Trump at Phoenix rally weighs in on Democratic debate, criticizes Michael Bloomberg\n\nThe idea of the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Donald Trump lecturing anybody on family values? the former mayor said. Sorry, but one thing about my marriage is, it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse with him or her.\n\nTrump, as a then-Republican presidential candidate, and some of his top aides, work accused of trying to silence pornographic actress, Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an extramarital affair with him years earlier.\n\nLimbaugh said on his Monday show following blow-back from his comments on Buttigieg that Trump advised him never to apologize about them.
Things were looking up for the rapidly growing Asian American electorate after the 2020 election.\n\nVoter turnout in the community had been bigger than ever before, and Joe Biden, the candidate most had supported, had won the presidency. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris, Biden's vice president, was of South Asian heritage.\n\nSo when Biden – whose Cabinet is shaping up to be the most diverse in U.S. history – failed to name a single Cabinet secretary of Asian American or Pacific Islander descent, the backlash was bitter – and compounded by a longstanding sense of feeling left out of federal decision-making. Every presidential Cabinet since 2000 has included an Asian American until now.\n\nIt's insulting and frustrating, said Madalene Mielke, president and CEO of the Asian Pacific American Institute of Congressional Studies. Part of the reason Asian Americans vote is that they're looking for people who can represent them. And it stings, because it looks like we're regressing.\n\nThe omission is particularly galling, Mielke and others said, after an election in which the Asian community played a pivotal role – and at a time when Asian Americans are keenly affected by issues such as immigration and the disproportionate effects of an ongoing pandemic, including racism.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden signed an executive order condemning racism, xenophobia and intolerance against the country's Asian American and Pacific Islander community as part of a broader plan to combat racial injustice nationwide.\n\nThere's no question that President Biden has put together an incredibly diverse Cabinet, and he deserves credit for that, said Gregg Orton, national director for the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans.\n\nBut those appointed to Cabinet-level positions, Orton said, have an enormous amount of influence and power. It's important to make sure that those deciding the trajectory of the future have a real understanding of our communities – not that that's impossible if they're not in our community, but we have seen time and time again that we are left out.\n\nBoth the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans and the Asian Pacific American Institute of Congressional Studies issued statements noting their displeasure early this month once the omission became a certainty; in her statement, Mielke wrote that the brazen exclusion of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders abandons and erases the AAPI community.\n\nA 'history of exclusion'\n\nConcerns that Biden would fail to name an Asian American/Pacific Islander Cabinet secretary had been growing since December, when more than a hundred lawmakers signed a letter crafted by California Rep. Judy Chu, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, urging otherwise.\n\nThe need for diversity at the highest levels is not for the sake of optics, the letter said. It's about ensuring all experiences are reflected in our decision making. ... When we have diverse leaders in positions of power, it leads to more inclusive policies that better serve the entirety of our country.\n\nThe letter also noted a long history of exclusion rooted in discriminatory laws like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the internment of close to 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II, saying, This painful history of exclusion is one that is still often felt today.\n\nAs of last year, the number of eligible Asian American/Pacific Islander voters had more than doubled since 2000 to 11 million-plus, according to the Pew Research Center. That makes Asian American/Pacific Islander voters the fastest-growing U.S. voting segment among major racial and ethnic groups and represents nearly 5% of the country's eligible voters, the center said.\n\nIt shows that our community cares, that we are getting more politically engaged, said Orton of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans. But it also translates to a desire to have a seat at the table.\n\nIncluding Harris, three major candidates of Asian American/Pacific Islander heritage campaigned for president in 2020.\n\nAsian Americans have been represented at the Cabinet secretary level ever since 2000, when President Bill Clinton appointed Norman Mineta as commerce secretary.\n\nDuring his campaign, Biden had pledged to build a team that looks like America, and his Cabinet picks do represent a number of historic firsts, including five women – among them Janet Yellen, the first woman to serve as treasury secretary, and Deb Haaland, the first Native American nominated as interior secretary. The list also includes Alejandro Mayorkas, the first Hispanic nominated as homeland security secretary, and Lloyd Austin, the first Black to be named as defense secretary.\n\nIt seems clear that the Biden team is on track to assemble the most diverse set of Senate-confirmed appointees in American history, wrote Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institute, in a report examining diversity among presidential Cabinets going back to the Reagan administration.\n\nBiden announced this month that he would appoint former Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, the British-born son of Indian immigrants, to the same position in his administration but balked at demands from Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus to elevate the position to Cabinet level.\n\nThe lack of top-level Asian American/Pacific Islander representation makes us feel like we're still on the menu, but not at the table, said former California Rep. Michael Honda, who co-chairs One Nation Commission, an Asian American/Pacific Islander advocacy group. Historically, we've always tried to get our communities out to vote for Democratic candidates – and so the expectation that he had drawn for us falls short, in my mind.\n\nA head start on pandemic's economic pain\n\nThe misstep is crucial, Honda and others say, when the community remains beset by earlier exposure to pandemic-related financial struggles than most as fears about the virus' Asian origins – stoked by former President Donald Trump, who referred to the coronavirus as kung flu – prompted many to avoid restaurants and small businesses owned or managed by Asian Americans.\n\nThere was a tremendous amount of racism against the community because of the previous administration, said Mielke of the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies. People were afraid to go into Asian American-owned businesses. So there was an ongoing effect, even before the quarantines.\n\nAsian Americans/Pacific Islanders are the racial group most likely to own small businesses, according to ethnic studies professor James Lai of Santa Clara University.\n\nMany of them are immigrants with limited skills, which makes them particularly vulnerable to the economic crises of the pandemic, Lai said.\n\nSome leaders are hopeful that Harris' role as vice president will help keep the community's profile high when it comes to making decisions that affect it.\n\nHonda hopes Harris can play as significant a role as Biden did for President Barack Obama. Biden was the most senior level official to back gay marriage at one point, prompting Obama to later also support same-sex marriage.\n\nHe pushed the envelope in a lot of ways, and I think the expectation of Vice President Kamala Harris would be the same, if not greater, because of her ethnicity, he said. There's a great expectation among women of color that her level of sensitivity will be high and that she will surround herself with people that can help her.\n\nNeil Makhija, executive director of the Indian American Impact Fund, agreed.\n\nImmigrant communities are used to working twice as hard for half the credit, said Makhija, whose Philadelphia-based group worked to boost the Asian American/Pacific Islander vote in Georgia's critical Senate runoff races early this month. And we need to stop accepting that, but I'm hopeful that having Vice President Kamala Harris in office means we will be seen and heard in a way we simply haven't been before.\n\nIn the meantime, advocates said they'll continue to work with the president on issues such as voting rights and immigration reform. But they'll also employ a squeaky-wheel approach as Biden fills out his administration, with an eye on Asian American/Pacific Islander nods in roles such as non-Cabinet agency directors, deputy secretaries and White House personnel, as well as key commissions, boards and ambassadorships.\n\nI have full faith that the president understands what we're saying, Honda said. But unless we keep the fire underneath the pot at the verge of boiling, people will forget.
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The city will pay a $25,000 fine for obstructing the view of a Confederate monument, a judge ordered last week under the direction of the state Supreme Court. Circuit Judge Marshell Jackson Hatcher imposed the fine that had been ordered by the state's high court. Justices in November ruled that Birmingham violated a state law protecting historic monuments and directed the circuit judge to enter an order declaring that Birmingham violated the 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act and to fine the city $25,000. Alabama sued Birmingham in 2017 after municipal officials in the majority-black city erected a wooden box obscuring the inscriptions on a 52-foot-tall obelisk honoring Confederate veterans. The 2017 Alabama Memorial Preservation Act prohibits relocating, removing, altering or renaming public buildings, streets and memorials that have been standing for more than 40 years.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Legislature failed to override more than $70 million in vetoes dealing with school construction projects and the state ferry system. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued the vetoes last summer, after lawmakers had adjourned. The veto override session was announced late Thursday, with no clear indication of sufficient support. House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, an independent from Dillingham, said in a statement that Alaskans deserve to know where their elected officials stand. House Minority Leader Lance Pruitt, in response, said the vote was about nothing more than creating material to use against other members in the next election cycle. Lawmakers attempted to override a $5 million veto of funds for the ferry system and vetoes of funds for school debt reimbursement to municipalities and a construction fund for rural schools. The issues were considered as part of one vote.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A 62-year-old man was cited last week after trying to disguise a fake skeleton as a passenger just to use the HOV lane. The Arizona Department of Public Safety says a trooper pulled over the man Thursday after noticing he had placed a fake skeleton in the passenger's front seat. The skeleton was sitting upright, wearing a hat and tied to the front seat. Department spokesman Raul Garcia said troopers cite about 7,000 HOV lane violators every year. Last April, a man was pulled over after driving in the HOV lane with a mannequin wearing a sweatshirt, baseball cap and sunglasses.\n\nArkansas\n\nSalem: Thieves have stolen the old school bell that hung at the top of the steps at the historic Old Main schoolhouse. Friends of Old Main Board of Directors member Ron Plumlee recently discovered the bell was missing while checking on maintenance at the old schoolhouse. The bolts holding the bell in place were apparently sawed off, Plumlee said. The theft is suspected to have required at least two people because of the bell's size and weight, he said. The bell has been at the top of the steps for at least 70 years. The school was built in 1930 and is now operated by Friends of Old Main as a nonprofit activity center. The bell was brass with an inscription around the top and has many marks from ringing over the years. Anyone with information that might lead to the recovery of the bell or the apprehension of those responsible is asked to contact the Fulton County Sheriff's Office at (870) 895-2601.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The western monarch butterfly population wintering along the state's coast remains critically low for the second year in a row, according to an environmental group. The count of the orange-and-black insects by the Xerces Society, a nonprofit environmental organization that focuses on the conservation of invertebrates, recorded about 29,000 butterflies in its annual survey. That's not much different from last year's tally, when an all-time-low 27,000 monarchs were counted. By comparison, about 4.5 million monarch butterflies wintered in forested groves along the California coast in the 1980s. Scientists say the butterflies are at critically low levels in the western United States due to the destruction of their milkweed habitat along their migratory route as housing expands into their territory and use of pesticides and herbicides increases. Researchers also have noted the effect of climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A research center at Colorado State University dedicated to studying the chemical compounds in hemp is expected to open this spring, school officials said Thursday. The announcement comes after the university received a $1.5 million donation from a Golden-based company that makes products out of CBD, a popular cannabis compound with unproven health claims. The money would be used to fund research, cover operating costs and purchase equipment, university officials said. The facility would allow faculty and undergraduate and graduate students to study the formulation of cannabinoids, separation efficiencies, efficacy testing and more, The Denver Post reports. Researchers at the facility would work in partnership with Panacea Life Sciences, a company founded by university alumna Leslie Buttorff that manufactures CBD products for people and pets.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The state Department of Motor Vehicles will soon allow a nonbinary gender designation on driver's licenses. Starting Monday, three gender options will be available for state-issued license and identification cards – male, female and nonbinary, denoted by the letter X, according to the New Haven Register. We want to be sure that we're fair for everyone, to respect people's gender identity, Deputy Commissioner Tony Guerrera said. Connecticut will be one of 12 states that allow nonbinary gender identification on driver's licenses, he said. The move was one of the department's top priorities when Guerrera and Commissioner Sibongile Magubane were appointed, he said. State Sen. Matt Lesser said Saturday that it would be important for people who identify as nonbinary and revenue-neutral for everyone else.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The public needs to keep a safe distance from the seals that will be present along beaches and other waterways through April, according to the state's official marine mammal and sea turtle stranding response organization. The MERR Institute recommends the public stay at least 150 feet from seals and always keep pets on a leash and at a safe distance because seals are wild animals that can bite if they feel threatened. It is common at this time of the year to see seals on area beaches, docks and other locations where they can rest, the Delaware State News reports. Four species of seals may visit Delaware. Oftentimes these animals are healthy, but at other times they may be suffering from illness or injury and in need of veterinary care, officials said. Anyone who encounters a seal is asked to contact MERR as soon as possible at (302) 228-5029. More information can be found on MERR's website.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The public is invited to the coronation ceremony for the newly crowned Miss Black D.C. USA this Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. The pageant's new titleholder, Amini Bonane, is a Harvard graduate student who says one of the reasons she competed for the crown was to expand her platform on mentoring and efforts to find missing women of color. She has a campaign called Find My Sister that's dedicated to raising awareness. Her coronation ceremony will be coupled with a charity fundraiser for the cause. According to Black and Missing in America Inc., nearly 40% of missing people are persons of color. Bonane's coronation ceremony and charity fundraiser will be held Saturday from 7:30 to 10 p.m. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other D.C. government officials and professionals are expected to attend the evening of networking, performances and philanthropy.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Eighty Burmese pythons were caught during a 10-day pre-Super Bowl hunt, designed to raise awareness about the invasive species decimating the Everglades. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission announced Saturday that 80 pythons were caught during the competition. Pro grand prize winner Mike Kimmel won an ATV for capturing eight pythons, and rookie grand prize winner Kristian Hernandez removed six pythons and also won an ATV. Pro grand prize winner Tom Rahill won $2,000 for bagging a 62-pound python. Several other cash prizes were also awarded. The game's organizing committee worked with Florida to promote the Python Bowl. The pythons, which can grow to 20 feet, are descended from pets released starting five decades ago. Wildlife officials estimate the population may exceed 100,000. The big serpents have been devouring native mammal and bird populations.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Hundreds of people have shown their support for an armless street artist whose artwork, supplies and donation box were stolen near the University of Georgia. Nearly $42,000 had been raised online as of late Sunday for Michael Davenport, who is known in Athens for sketching the university's bulldog mascot. He holds a pen in his mouth to create his art because he lost his arms as a child. Davenport, 53, said his belongings were stolen Jan. 15 when he took a break to use the restroom at a nearby business. Athens-Clarke police said detectives were looking to identify the suspect, seen on surveillance video in what appears to be a gold-colored minivan. Stephen Frazier, the general manager at Budget Host Inn in Athens, said he set up the online fundraising account in Davenport's name. Davenport told WAGA-TV he plans to use the money for a truck to carry his supplies and for medical treatment for his leg, injured in an attack last year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office has identified the remains of two people found in a burnt-out home where a man allegedly shot and killed two Honolulu police officers and attacked a neighbor before setting the house ablaze last weekend. Officials on Friday released a statement identifying the homeowner, Lois Ann Cain, 77, as one of the two people found in the house that was destroyed by fire in an upscale neighborhood near Waikiki Beach. A tenant, Jaroslav Jerry Hanel, is accused of shooting police who were responding to the home after he allegedly attacked and stabbed a woman who also lived in the house. Cain was in the process of evicting Hanel when the violence erupted Sunday. The medical examiner also identified the second set of remains but withheld a name pending notification of next of kin.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The number of residents who have signed up for Medicaid under the state's voter-approved expanded coverage has passed 60,000. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare posted updated numbers Thursday. The agency estimates 91,000 residents meet requirements. Coverage started Jan. 1, but enrollment is year-round. Those who sign up for Medicaid will be covered for doctor visits that occurred earlier in the same month. Voters authorized Medicaid expansion in 2018 with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote after years of inaction by state lawmakers. But legislators in 2019 added restrictions requiring five waivers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Waivers are required when states want to deviate from Medicaid rules. Federal officials have yet to approve any of Idaho's requested waivers.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Marijuana was stolen last week from a box placed at Chicago's Midway International Airport for travelers who dispose of their marijuana before they board a plane, police said Friday. The marijuana amnesty boxes were placed at Midway and O'Hare International Airport after it became legal this year to possess marijuana in Illinois. The boxes, owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police, were installed so air travelers can be in compliance with federal law as well as the local laws at their destination. Police officers regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana. Tampering with them, or attempting to remove anything placed inside, is a crime, said Chicago police spokesman Antony Gugliemi, who added that an investigation is underway.\n\nIndiana\n\nTaswell: The state's newest nature preserve features dramatic limestone outcrops and a cave inhabited by rare animals adapted to life in total darkness. The Natural Resources Commission recently approved the creation of the Patoka Hills Nature Preserve, which spans nearly 27 acres in southern Indiana's Crawford County. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources said the new preserve contains one of Indiana's finest paleontological sites in a small cave that the agency calls highly significant. Staff from the Indiana State Museum have been excavating inside that cave since 1987, and their discoveries have shed light on Indiana's past climate, plants and animals during the latter part of the last ice age. The DNR said the cave is also home to a springtail insect and a cave millipede, both of which lack eyes and pigmentation and are rare worldwide.\n\nIowa\n\nCouncil Bluffs: Leaders in western Iowa say lingering floodwaters and damage from last year's Missouri River flooding have led them to again cancel Loessfest. The Council Bluffs City Council said Friday in a news release that restoration work on Tom Hanafan River's Edge Park, which connects to neighboring Omaha, Nebraska, via the Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge, can't begin until after the spring thaw. There isn't enough time between the thaw and the Memorial Day weekend event to get the work done, the council said. Loessfest was established in 2013 and has become the community's traditional kick-off to summer. Last year, Loessfest was initially postponed to Labor Day weekend, then canceled altogether due to ongoing flooding. Other locations were considered before canceling this year's festival, officials said. But it was ultimately decided that a critical component of Loessfest was its easy proximity to Omaha.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Local police are looking into using genetic genealogy databases to help solve cold murder and rape cases. Capt. Jeff Weible said the department isn't ready to decide whether it will use the technique, which has revolutionized cold-case investigations across the U.S. while also raising legal and privacy concerns. But to help find out how the technique could be used, the department co-hosted a two-day training conference on it last week. The Wichita Eagle reports it drew more than 60 people from law enforcement agencies and other organizations across the state and nation to downtown Wichita. The conference's co-host, Gene by Gene, is allowing law enforcement agencies to submit DNA samples and lab data files from certain kinds of cold cases. Gene by Gene then queries its DNA database, Family Tree DNA, for any matches that investigators can use to track down suspects or identify remains.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State colleges and universities will ask for their first funding increase since the 2007-08 budget, lawmakers have been told. Aaron Thompson, president of the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education, said public colleges will seek a 6.2% increase next fiscal year and an 8.8% increase in the 2022 fiscal year over current base funding levels. Thompson said he is not sure whether the budget Gov. Andy Beshear presents to the General Assembly on Tuesday will include the request but is optimistic. Kentucky has cut higher education funding in each two-year budget since 2008, leaving colleges and universities to increase tuition rates. Thompson told legislators that after more than a decade of higher education cuts, we are down to the point where we are cutting into the bone.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Dozens of protesters marched from the site of the partially collapsed Hard Rock Hotel on the edge of the French Quarter to City Hall on Friday, demanding that something be done about the hotel and that the two bodies still inside be recovered. The Hard Rock Hotel was under construction when it partially collapsed Oct. 12, sending plumes of dust into the air, killing three people and injuring dozens. The bodies of two of the three workers who died are still inside what is left of the building, which city officials have decided to take down through implosion in March. People in the city were outraged last week when a tarp at the site shifted, exposing the remains of one of the workers who died. The tarp has since been replaced, but it sparked cries for greater accountability. City Council member Jason Williams addressed the crowd, specifically questioning why a worker who had been in the building when it collapsed was later deported.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Maine home sales surged at the end of 2019, which was a record-breaking year for real estate in the state. The Pine Tree State set records for sales volume and median sales price, the Portland Press Herald reports. Home buyers finished strong at the end of the year, as December sales increased 23% compared with the same month the previous year. Total sales for 2019 reached 18,140 homes, which was a 1.5% increase from the previous year, according to the Maine Association of Realtors. The median sales price increase 4.7% from the previous record of $215,000 to $225,000, the association said. One of the factors helping spur the increase in price is a lack of inventory in Maine. Houses also aren't staying on the market very long.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Lawmakers hope to repeal archaic provisions in the state's spousal defense for sex crimes and sodomy laws with the reintroduction of legislation this session. Lawmakers on Thursday expect to hear a Senate bill that would repeal the use of marriage as a defense to prosecution of some sex crimes, and last week the House introduced a bill that would repeal the crimes of sodomy and unnatural or perverted sexual practice. Under current state law, a person may not be prosecuted for first- or second-degree rape or third- or fourth-degree sexual offenses if the victim is the legal spouse of the assailant at the time of the offense. The bill's lead sponsor, Sen. Susan Lee, D-Montgomery, told Capital News Service she thinks current law treats a spouse as property. It's really disrespectful, it's wrong, and it's antiquated, Lee said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Lawmakers are planning to hold a public hearing this week for a sweeping bill filed by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker that would overhaul the state's health care system. Baker said the bill would cut down the hidden costs that currently blindside consumers and would require walk-in clinics to treat low-income patients on Medicaid. He said the bill would also hold drug companies accountable for excessive prices and unjustified price increases, as well as support distressed community hospitals and community health centers. The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at the Statehouse. When he unveiled the legislation in October, Baker said it would address the challenges associated with supporting an aging population, individuals with a chronic illness, or those in need of behavioral health services. The proposal would outlaw surprise bills for emergency room care and rein in certain hospital fees.\n\nMichigan\n\nGanges Township: The owners of a home along Lake Michigan decided to demolish it before nature did the job. Relentless waves and high water have scoured the lakeshore, destroying or threatening properties that have been in families for generations. Helen Curtis-Foster and family members decided to bring their house down in Allegan County's Ganges Township, between Saugatuck and South Haven. The house was just feet away from the edge of a collapsing dune. We really felt we were in the fight against time, Curtis-Foster told MLive.com. It was getting scary. The demolition was completed last week, leaving only a cement pad. The job cost less than $20,000, Curtis-Foster said, compared to hundreds of thousands of dollars necessary to move the house or recover the pieces if it collapsed into the lake. The family plans to put a gazebo on the site.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRobbinsdale: A man scaled a fence at a hospital last month and shut off oxygen to the entire facility, according to a search warrant affidavit filed in Hennepin County. No charges have been filed in the Dec. 27 incident at North Memorial Hospital, and the search warrant affidavit filed Friday makes no mention of injuries. But the Star Tribune reports the document says the situation could have been deadly under different circumstances. Hospital spokeswoman Katy Sullivan says hospital officials quickly identified the issue and resolved it without harm to patients. According to the affidavit, after the oxygen was shut off, engineers detected a pressure drop in the hospital's oxygen levels and discovered the vandalism. A 39-year-old man has been identified as a possible suspect. He was also seen inside the hospital the previous month unplugging computers and televisions.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Protesters outside the Capitol on Friday condemned conditions in state prisons where inmates have died violently in the past month. People with relatives in the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman said at a rally that some prison cells have no working lights or toilets, and inmates are given sparse meals sometimes served with cockroaches on the trays. Parchman is a prison farm plantation, said Jaribu Hill, a longtime Mississippi human-rights attorney. Shut it down! A few hundred protesters responded: Shut it down! Shut it down! Their voices echoed in downtown Jackson, but many of the state's top policymakers were not in town to hear it. Most members of the Legislature left the Capitol on Thursday and won't return until Monday. At least 10 inmates have died in Mississippi prisons since late December – most of them at Parchman. The rally Friday was organized by Team Roc, the charity affiliated with entertainment mogul Jay-Z's company Roc Nation.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri is tracking all new students on campus this semester through a cellphone app to learn whether they're attending class. It's a test expansion of a program the university has used for four years to track class attendance of freshmen student athletes and athletes in academic trouble. Supporters of the program say it helps attendance, which in turn improves students' academic performance. Critics worry the university could someday add uses for the program that will violate student privacy, The Kansas City Star reports. The expanded use of the program began Tuesday on a test basis. Faculty volunteered to use the program in their classes, but students won't have a choice about participating. Every student in the program will be told attendance is being monitored, said Jim Spain, vice provost for undergraduate studies. The university will help students who don't have a phone participate.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The University of Montana is working to learn from criticism after four white students won an essay contest about Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy, the school said. A majority of the 1,000 comments posted on social media were critical of selecting only white students, The Missoulian reports. The contest sought submissions from students, faculty and staff on how they had worked to implement King's legacy at the university. Only six submissions were received, all from white students, the university said. The university deleted the photos and names of the contest winners out of concern they could be targets of harassment, the school said. Many commenters noted the lack of people of color entering the contest may have indicated they did not believe it was a productive use of their time or energy. African-American Studies program head Tobin Miller Shearer and Murray Pierce, special assistant to the provost and adviser to the Black Student Union, speculated that many of the union members were likely busy planning the Black Solidarity Summit, the group's upcoming keystone event.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The mayor wants voters to decide whether they're willing to raise their property taxes to fund a long-term plan for improving city streets – often the objects of residents' wrath and complaints. Mayor Jean Stothert announced Thursday that she will ask the City Council to put a $200 million bond issue on the May 12 ballot. It would cost owners $35 more a year in property taxes for every $100,000 in valuation. We can stop the deterioration of our infrastructure, Stothert said. But it will take all of us to agree that it's worth the expense. The city spends $41 million a year on street repairs, she said, but needs to be spending at least $75 million a year. The $200 million in bond funding would cover only part of what's needed, and Omaha would need a series of voter-approved bond issues to keep the initiative going, Stothert said. Councilman Pete Festersen said he thinks the street repairs need to be part of a comprehensive plan that improves public transit and bike and pedestrian infrastructure.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: The Silver Dollar Club, an iconic bar dating to the Prohibition era in one of the city's oldest buildings, is closing after 86 years of stories and songs rooted in the Wild West days. Sam Horvitz, the club proprietor, told the Elko Daily Free Press he's closing Jan. 30. I've been waiting to buy the building for years now, Horvitz posted Jan. 3 on his Facebook page, and my faith and patience have finally run out. The brick building was Elko's first bank, founded in 1880. Henderson Bank moved in 1929 to a four-story building across the railroad tracks, and the old bank became a grocery store. Local historian Jan Petersen, director of the nearby Cowboy Arts and Gear Museum, said the building became a soft drink parlor during the Prohibition era of the 1920s. Robert Doby Doc Caudill, anticipating constitutional approval for the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition in December 1933, opened the Silver Dollar Club a month earlier, in November 1933.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLangdon: A meeting house originally built in the early 1800s has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Georgian-style Langdon Meeting House was a two-story space that served both town and church functions. In order to comply with New Hampshire's Toleration Act of 1819, which called for physical and financial separation of religious and government public spaces, the town sold 10 feet at the west end of the building and the second-story gallery space to the Universalist Society of Langdon in 1851. That year, a renovation partitioned the spaces and added a three-story Greek Revival steeple over the church entrance that included a belfry with louvered shutters and a 5-foot weathervane. Langdon residents have held their annual town meeting on the first floor from 1803 to the present, the longest-running record in the country.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A former top aide to Gov. Phil Murphy alerted him to allegedly inappropriate behavior by his former campaign manager, including rank misogyny and retaliation, according to documents released Sunday. The campaign manager, Brendan Gill, who is now one of Murphy's closest advisers, also notified Murphy directly that he apologized to that aide for losing his temper and using language and tone he regretted, according to an email. The documents appear to contradict Murphy's own words in an interview last year. When asked if he was personally aware of any incident of sexual harassment or complaints of a toxic work environment during the campaign, Murphy said: Not that I know of. No. Murphy was included on at least two emails that showed Gill had acted inappropriately. The campaign said it conducted an investigation and found that the behavior happened only once with the woman who made the allegation, Julie Roginsky, who left the campaign in July 2017.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Trappers now have to complete an education course, and new restrictions will be imposed on setting wildlife traps and snares around designated trailheads and on select tracts of public lands in New Mexico, under a measure adopted by the state Game Commission. State wildlife managers suggested they tried to strike a balance, but trappers argued that the changes will be burdensome, requiring them in some instances to walk a mile roundtrip to set a trap. Environmentalists also were displeased with the decision, calling the practice inhumane and indiscriminate. They had pushed for the commission to end trapping all together, saying pets and endangered species such as the Mexican gray wolf have been inadvertently caught. Trapping and snaring triggered emotionally charged debates during last year's legislative session.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Some 85,000 artifacts that tell the story of the Chinese migration to the United States may have been lost in a fire that struck a building in the heart of Manhattan's Chinatown, a museum official said Friday. The president of the Museum of Chinese in America told The New York Times most of the thousands of historic and artistic items in its collection were probably lost in the fire that started Thursday night and tore through a building where the museum's acquisitions were stored. One hundred percent of the museum's collection, other than what is on view, said Nancy Yao Maasbach, the president of the museum. She said the collection was one of a kind, and she was just distraught after receiving the news. The fire started in a former school that more recently housed a senior center, the Chen Dance Center and a number of community groups. The museum is nearby and stored its collection in the structure that was hit by fire.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBakersville: The world's worst cat is available for adoption at the Mitchell County Animal Rescue organization. The shelter about 55 miles northeast of Asheville is waiving adoption fees in the hope that someone will take the cat named Perdita off its hands. The group says on its Facebook page, We thought she was sick. Turns out she's just a jerk. A tongue-in-cheek profile of the foul-tempered feline says her dislikes include dogs, children, the Dixie Chicks, Disney movies, Christmas and last but NOT least … HUGS. It says she likes lurking, pretending to be sick and staring into your soul until you feel as if you may never be cheerful again … She's single and ready to be socially awkward with a socially awkward human who understands personal space. Her Facebook post has drawn thousands of likes – and a follow-up post indicated more than 50 applications to adopt her had already been submitted.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State officials say it's time for property owners in flood-prone areas of the Red River Valley to think about buying flood insurance. The push comes as early signs suggest a heightened risk of flooding this spring. The Red River Basin in eastern North Dakota has seen record precipitation totals for the fall and winter period starting Sept. 1, National Weather Service spokesman Greg Gust said Friday after the agency released its first flood outlook of the season. This year's flood could be a top five event, although it's still too early to predict hard numbers, and much is left to be determined, Gust said. The state Water Commission and Department of Emergency Services have scheduled flood preparation meetings this week in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown that will focus on insuring homes and other structures.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state prison system wants to replace or renovate some of its high-security prisons in the near future, saying its current facilities for violent inmates are functionally obsolete and creating security risks for the agency, the Associated Press has learned. More low-security inmates are now being housed at community facilities instead of prisons at the same time more violent inmates are being housed in state prisons, and for longer terms, the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said in its capital budget request to Gov. Mike DeWine. Furthermore, this population is particularly violent and disruptive while in prison and requires unique programming needs, the agency said in its budget documents. The agency wants approval for a two-year design study of its options, with construction possible by mid-2023.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Leaders in this conservative state say they are looking for more legislative progress for LGBTQ people this year after notable strides in 2019. Tulsa and Oklahoma City updated their personnel policies to ban discrimination against city employees based on gender identity or expression, The Oklahoman reports. Norman went further and became the first in the state to amend its civil rights ordinance to ban discrimination against LGBTQ people in housing, employment or public accommodations. Oklahoma City also elected its first openly gay council member, and the mayor declared the city's first official Pride Week to celebrate LBGTQ accomplishments. Allie Shinn, executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, an advocacy organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, said 2019 was a landmark year. A top priority in the upcoming legislative session is pushing for a ban on the widely discredited practice of conversion therapy.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: U.S. Justice Department lawyers said Friday that they've found the Portland Police Bureau in substantial compliance with 190 reforms required as part of a city settlement adopted six years ago. The settlement came after a federal investigation determined officers used excessive force against people with mental illness. Now that a community oversight group is staffed and has met regularly for more than a year, the Justice Department said the city meets the settlement's accountability requirements. The bureau also has instituted needed changes to its use-of-force policies, training, crisis intervention tactics and employee information system developed to identify officers with excessive complaints or uses of force, the Justice Department said in court documents. The community oversight group will discuss the Justice Department's findings at a Tuesday meeting, according to the group's co-chair Lakayana Drury.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMount Carbon: A 44-acre community with fewer than 90 residents may soon end up absorbed by an adjacent city because there isn't enough citizen interest to keep its government functioning. No one except the newly elected mayor of Mount Carbon showed up this month for a reorganizational meeting, The Morning Call of Allentown reports. The Schuylkill County borough's fate has hung in the balance since last year, when all three council members quit and the borough secretary resigned. Retired railroad worker John Raess was elected mayor in November with two write-in votes. The newspaper said it is possible Mount Carbon might end up as part of the 15,000-resident city of Pottsville, a merger both communities would have to OK. Merging with Pottsville would mean higher taxes for Mount Carbon's residents.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawmaker proposed letting legislators and other officials tint their windshields to shield them from unhappy constituents. Rep. Anastasia Williams, a Providence Democrat, introduced a bill Thursday that would carve out an exception for the state's lawmakers and officials to travel around behind tinted glass, The Boston Globe reports. The bill would allow members of the General Assembly, state and municipal police officers, firefighters and state judges to be exempt from state law that says most car windows must allow 70% of the light in. We have a lot of disgruntled individuals, Williams said. In the court system, law enforcement, and the General Assembly, we tend to get a bum rap, and we can face retaliation when we least expect it. When folks are on personal time, we are targeted.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nIsle of Palms: The owner of an island home is suing Airbnb, claiming it only reimbursed him for a fraction of the damages that a guest who threw a big party did to his home. In a federal lawsuit filed this week, Scott Shaw said the party left his home smelling of a mixture of marijuana, cigarettes, beer and vomit. Blood and vomit were found on the walls, towels and bedding, the lawsuit states. Shaw says he believes he is owed about $150,000 in both property and punitive damages. He did not say what the company paid him. He said Airbnb claims in its marketing materials that it guarantees up to $1 million reimbursement for property damage. Airbnb's 'host guarantee' is nothing close to any type of 'guarantee' and in fact it is false, misleading and deceptive, the lawsuit says. The company says it plans to vigorously defend against these allegations. Shaw says aside from the smell, the guests also left holes in the walls and broke a staircase railing, door and countertop, among other things.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem says she has concerns about a bill in the House that would make it illegal for physicians to administer gender-change treatments to children under 16. But she declined Friday to offer full support or disapproval. The bill would allow for physicians who perform surgeries, administer hormone therapy or prescribe puberty-blocking medication to minors to be prosecuted with a misdemeanor. The Republican-dominated House will debate the bill this week. When you take public policy and try to fill parenting gaps with more government, you have to be very careful about the precedent you're setting, Noem told reporters. Democrats and LGBT activists say the bill targets transgender children and could lead to an increase in suicides. Supporters, including many Republicans in the House, say the bill would prevent children from receiving ideologically motivated treatment that harms them.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state has become the latest to assure continued taxpayer funding of faith-based foster care and adoption agencies even if those organizations exclude LGBT families and others based on religious beliefs. Republican Gov. Bill Lee signed the bill Friday without fanfare or an official announcement, making it the first law to be implemented in Tennessee this year. Previously, Lee said he endorsed the law because he believed defending religious liberty is very important. The Republican has often cited his Christian faith throughout his first term as governor. The protections afforded to religious agencies have sparked criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, which has raised legal concerns surrounding the proposal because it authorized the use of a religious test to participate in a government program.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The mayor and others say they will work to provide assistance to residents whose homes were damaged after a massive explosion at a warehouse that killed two workers and injured 20 others. Mayor Sylvester Turner on Saturday walked through the impacted neighborhoods in northwest Houston and spoke with residents who were cleaning up after Friday's explosion. Cleanup and repair efforts continued Sunday. The explosion happened about 4:30 a.m. Friday inside a building at Watson Grinding and Manufacturing, which makes valves and provides thermal-spray coatings for equipment in various industries, authorities said. Employees Frank Flores and Gerardo Castorena were killed. More than 200 homes in surrounding neighborhoods were damaged as the force of the blast shattered windows, knocked down ceilings, bent garage doors and moved some homes off their foundations.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state's unemployment rate is now the lowest ever recorded at 2.3%, which also ties for lowest among U.S. states, state officials said Friday. The milestone comes in December data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The job market is humming along at a feverish pace and is absorbing as much labor as possible, said Mark Knold, chief economist at the Utah Department of Workforce Services. Utah was also a leader in job creation for 2019, up about 3%. The fastest growth by percentage occurred in construction, education and health services, and leisure and hospitality services. Washington County had the biggest job growth, followed by Rich and Iron counties. The national unemployment rate was 3.5% in December. Utah tied Vermont and South Carolina for the lowest unemployment rate in the nation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bill in the state would take vanity license plates into new territory with the introduction of emojis. State Rep. Rebecca White, a Democrat from Windsor, introduced the proposal to let drivers add one of six available emojis to their license plate, MyNBC5 reports. Her bill went before the Committee on Transportation last week. The symbols would not replace letters or numbers assigned by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, nor those selected by a vehicle's owner. At this point, it's unclear what the new plates would would look like or what emojis would be allowed. Of the state's current vanity plates, the most expensive for cars and trucks is the state conservation series, which carry a $26 annual fee.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: With a newly empowered Democratic majority at the General Assembly, abortion-rights advocates say the state has a chance to roll back decades of restrictions and become a safe haven for women in neighboring conservative states. Abortion-rights groups laid out their legislative priorities last week, emphasizing a measure to undo Republican-backed laws including a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion, as well a requirement that women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound and counseling. A Senate committee passed that bill Thursday morning, a day after a House committee advanced that chamber's version. The bills, which are part of Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's legislative agenda, would also roll back the requirement that an abortion be provided by a physician, allowing nurse practitioners and physician assistants to perform them, and undo strict building code requirements on facilities where abortions are performed.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools has agreed to pay almost half a million dollars to resolve a claim involving a former student who said he was hospitalized after his elementary school released him to the wrong parent in 2010. The former student, then 8, was picked up by his father following an incident at the school and seriously assaulted, according to the settlement authorization document, which was unanimously approved by the Seattle School Board this week. The father was criminally charged and convicted after the incident, the document said. The former student and his mother filed a claim against the district in March, The Seattle Times reports. The district said the mother and former student will drop the claim in exchange for a $475,000 settlement, pending approval by King County Superior Court.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University is investigating three separate incidents of hate graffiti on its campus. A statement from the school said its police department is trying to identify who wrote the graffiti. Disciplinary action up to expulsion or dismissal could be taken if the incidents are linked back to a student or employee, the school said. The college didn't specify what exactly was written but said two of the markings were found Thursday, and one was reported earlier this month. All three were found in restrooms on the Huntington campus. School staffers have since removed the graffiti. This hate speech is against everything we stand for. We will do everything we can to identify the perpetrators, President Jerome Gilbert said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nThree Lakes: A school district in northern Wisconsin has refurbished an old photography dark room into a place where the basic needs of its students are met. Teachers at the Three Lakes School District raised money to furnish the room with a washer and dryer to help students who might not have access to one at home. WJFW-TV reports special education teacher Nicole Lewis makes sure the room is stocked with personal essentials such as shampoo, soap, deodorant and toothbrushes. Not many students, or adults for that matter, are able to concentrate and learn if those basic needs aren't met, Lewis said. I think it's one of those things that's a necessity in a school. The room is also stocked with spare clothing.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Grand Teton National Park stayed near its highest visitation levels in 2019, while Yellowstone National Park had its slowest tourism year since 2014, officials said. Grand Teton's 2019 attendance trailed only 2018 for tourists visiting the park, The Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. A Grand Teton park spokeswoman credited increased visits during historically slow shoulder seasons, the periods between peak and off-peak seasons. Grand Teton attracted 3.4 million recreational visitors, a category excluding people who only passed through, such as commercial truckers, officials said. July was Grand Teton's busiest month, with 776,000 visitors, while February, November and December saw fewer than 50,000 recreational visits each, officials said. Yellowstone, also in Wyoming, attracted slightly more than 4 million recreational visitors last year, a 2.3% decrease since 2018 and 5.6% decrease from the all-time high in 2016.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
Is this progress?\n\nMonday morning's Oscar nominations delivered more frustrating certainties than happy surprises.\n\nBlack British actress Cynthia Erivo was the lone person of color nominated across 20 acting categories. And out of five directing nominations, all nominees were male.\n\nOr as Oscar nominations announcer Issa Rae put it: Congratulations to those men, a subtle dig after she and actor John Cho revealed the list of directing nods.\n\nVoters lauding Harriet star Erivo while leaving equally worthy people of color behind smacks of tokenism, says Tom O'Neil, founder of awards prognosticating site Gold Derby. It just does. To have snubbed Eddie Murphy in one of the marquee performances of his career was outrageous. And no 'Parasite' actors – none of those Asian actors got nominated! That's a slap.\n\nSpanish star Antonio Banderas, whom the U.S. Census identifies as European, also surprised with a nod for best actor for Pain and Glory.\n\nBiggest Oscar snubs:Jennifer Lopez, Robert De Niro shut out of nominations\n\nOscar nominations:'Joker' leads with 11 nods, including best picture\n\nBut the snubs. They span Jennifer Lopez (Hustlers), Eddie Murphy (Dolemite Is My Name), Awkwafina (The Farewell), Lupita Nyong'o (Us), Song Kang-ho (Parasite), Alfre Woodard (Clemency), Jamie Foxx (Just Mercy) and Zhao Shuzhen (The Farewell).\n\nTo put the shock in perspective, 28 out of 32 industry experts on awards prognosticating site Gold Derby predicted Lopez would receive a nod, and 20 out of 32 predicted Awkwafina's name would be among nominees.\n\nThe rest of the acting nominations were white. Riding two critical hits, Scarlett Johansson was double-nominated for best actress (Marriage Story) and supporting actress (Jojo Rabbit). (An even more potent fracas erupted last week with the British Academy's BAFTA nominations, when Margot Robbie was double-nominated for Bombshell and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood but zero people of color were tapped for acting nods across four categories.)\n\nThis is the up-and-down part of the work. Everyone who got nominated is completely worthy, says academy governor-at-large DeVon Franklin, while acknowledging disappointment around the snubs.\n\nHe notes that a record 30% of nominees overall this year were women, while 20% of nominees were people of color (on par with last year). There's the feelings and the facts. The facts are there is progress and that progress is sustaining itself, Franklin says. The feelings are, with every Oscar season, there are going to be these surprises that remind us that there's still more work to be done.\n\nOn social media, users were quick to laud Erivo but point out that she was acknowledged for a film that depicts slavery.\n\nI am happy for Cynthia but another biopic (and about a slave) over an original horror movie where Lupita has to pull double duty? Ideally both should have been recognized but if I was forced to pick one, it's 100% Lupita, @ArchAndTiger tweeted.\n\nHollywood loves a slave tale, @PushaCee observed.\n\nWho's up for an Oscar? See the complete list of nominees\n\nThe telecast:The Oscars will have no host again for 2020 ceremony\n\nFilmmakers share a responsibility\n\nWhen reading the tea leaves, consider how Oscar watchers parse nominations.\n\nThe Oscars is a good annual cheat sheet on what Hollywood is doing, says O'Neil, noting this year's crop provides proof of a continuing crisis within the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Once a year, we get a snapshot of the real quality movies, we see there's an absence of diversity and we get outraged by it. The problem needs to be solved all year-round on an ongoing basis.\n\nBut the answer, experts say, is more convoluted than pointing fingers at the membership of the academy. It's also on filmmakers to make sure movies – particularly stories set in present-day – look like the world as we know it.\n\nCompare it to television.\n\nYou would never see what you see in 'Marriage Story' on any television show now, says Melissa Silverstein, founder of the Women and Hollywood website, which advocates for parity across the entertainment industry.\n\nShe points out that along with the leads, even all of the film's lawyers are white. Think about it. Any television show, there are people of color everywhere in all different jobs. What we're seeing on television is a deep understanding of how you need to be reflecting the society that's watching your shows. ... What I think the film business is constantly fighting is this white, male sensibility of our (everyday) culture.\n\nHow the academy has diversified its membership\n\nThe academy has made strenuous moves since #OscarsSoWhite became a siren call for change within the industry five years ago, annually diversifying its membership and adding more women and people of color.\n\nAfter the first #OscarSoWhite scandal, the academy announced a goal of doubling the number of women and minority members by 2020. Including 2019's new invitees, the academy said 32% of its members would be female (up from 25% in 2015) and 16% would be people of color (8% in 2015).\n\nStill, this year's best director nominations featured just one person of color, Bong Joon-ho (Parasite), and four white male directors: Sam Mendes (1917), Quentin Tarantino (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), Todd Phillips (Joker) and Martin Scorsese (The Irishman). All five tales deal with war or violence.\n\nThe nominations made no room for Greta Gerwig, who helmed the successful Little Women remake, The Farewell director Lulu Wang and A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood director Marielle Heller, among other notable entries.\n\nThe shutout, which follows a stellar year where films directed by women have seen such great success at the box office as well as critically, it seems that the awards season is a place that is continually stagnant for women, Silverstein says.\n\nWhich brings us to the inevitable bias toward content, and how that content finds an audience.\n\nFailed campaigns and technical difficulties\n\nWho gets to decide what an awards-worthy movie looks like?\n\nVanity Fair's Mike Hogan wonders what the word 'best' means to many (Academy) members on Twitter. I think Greta Gerwig nailed it when she said there is a hierarchy of what 'matters' and 'male violence' is at the top, he wrote. And I think the unconscious nature of the belief system makes it all the more stubborn.\n\nAnd there remains confusion behind the scenes in Hollywood on how to market smaller, powerful films that feature minorities like The Farewell, Queen & Slim and Waves, says Claudia Puig, a festival programmer and president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association (and formerly USA TODAY's film critic).  'Queen & Slim' is a great movie that just fell by the wayside. Ditto for 'Waves,' one of my favorite movies of the year. A lot of people don't know about it.\n\nSimilarly, Us, which marked another hit for filmmaker Jordan Peele, was more overtly a horror film than his directorial debut Get Out (nominated for four Oscars, including best picture), which made it harder for people to embrace it, she says.\n\nTechnical difficulties also played a factor this year, with the nominations process hobbled by a confusingly shortened season.\n\nWith the Oscars telecast moved up two weeks to Feb. 9, a compressed awards season meant balloting closed two weeks earlier than normal. That left many of the academy's about 9,000 voting members scrambling prior to the close of voting Tuesday, just two days after the Golden Globes.\n\nDid some members miss the memo? IndieWire editor-at-large Anne Thompson thinks so. I think a lot of (voters) didn't see all the films, she says.\n\nIt's not all bad news: The South Korean comedy Parasite earned six nominations, including best director, best original screenplay and best picture.\n\nThe bottom line is you're not going to please anyone and I don't think the Academy wants to get in the business of pleasing groups of people, says Gil Robertson, co-founder and president of the African-American Film Critics Association.\n\nBut experts agree there's a two-pronged solution to the annual #OscarsSoWhite hand-wringing: Keep Hollywood's feet to the fire on delivering movies year-round that embrace inclusion. And put more women and people of color in leadership positions.\n\nIt's about having enough people so that it's not about just one person holding the candle for everybody, Silverstein says. This is about changing the culture.
Catastrophe star Rob Delaney shared devastating family news on Facebook Friday.\n\nHis two-year-old son Henry has died of brain cancer.\n\nI have very sad news. My two and a half year year old son Henry has passed away, wrote Delaney. Henry had been diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2016, shortly after his first birthday, following persistent vomiting and weight loss. He had surgery to remove the tumor and further treatment through the early part of 2017. Then the cancer returned last autumn and he died in January.\n\nDelaney and his wife, who live in London (where his Amazon series shoots), have two other children.\n\nMy wife and Henry's older brothers and I are devastated of course, he continued. Henry was a joy. He was smart, funny, and mischievous and we had so many wonderful adventures together, particularly after he'd moved home following fifteen months living in hospitals. His tumor and surgery left him with significant physical disabilities, but he quickly learned sign language and developed his own method of getting from A to B shuffling on his beautiful little bum. His drive to live and to love and to connect was profound.\n\nMore:Inside Sharon and Rob's troubles on Season 3 of 'Catastrophe'\n\nDelaney says he is determined to embrace his family and continue on, despite his grief.\n\nI am astonished by the love-in-action displayed by Henry's mom and his brothers, he writes. They are why I will endeavor to not go mad with grief. I don't want to miss out on their beautiful lives. I'm greedy for more experiences with them.\n\nHe thanked the nurses and doctors who assisted his family. Delaney directed those who wanted to help to make donations to U.K. organizations Rainbow Trust and Noah's Ark.\n\nDelaney and Sharon Horgan co-created and star in Catastrophe, a brutally honest comedy that explores the realities of marriage after a fling turns into an accidental pregnancy.
A day after David Schwimmer opened up about how he pushed for diversity on the hit sitcom Friends, Living Single star Erika Alexander is reacting.\n\nIn an interview with UK's The Guardian, Schwimmer, 53, said he made conscious efforts to have more people of color on the show.\n\nI was well aware of the lack of diversity and I campaigned for years to have Ross date women of color. One of the first girlfriends I had on the show was an Asian American woman, and later I dated African American women. That was a very conscious push on my part, he said. Maybe there should be an all-black 'Friends' or an all-Asian 'Friends.'\n\nAlthough he acknowledged that parts of the show were problematic, Schwimmer, who played Ross on the show, stood up for the series in pushing boundaries in other ways.\n\nThe truth is also that show was groundbreaking in its time for the way in which it handled so casually sex, protected sex, gay marriage and relationships. The pilot of the show was my character's wife left him for a woman and there was a gay wedding, of my ex and her wife, that I attended, he said.\n\nAlexander tweeted an article of his comments with a message for the star.\n\nHey ⁦@DavidSchwimmer @FriendsTV⁩ - r u seriously telling me you've never heard of #LivingSingle? We invented the template! Yr welcome bro, she tweeted with a winky face.\n\nLiving Single ran from 1993 to 1998 and followed a group of black friends, four women and two men, in Brooklyn. In addition to Alexander, the show starred Queen Latifah, Kim Coles and Kim Fields.\n\nSchwimmer took to Twitter Wednesday to respond to Alexander's comments in a lengthy statement.\n\nI didn't mean to imply Living Single hadn't existed or indeed hand't come before Friends, which I knew it had, he said. Please remember in an interview quotes are often pieced together and taken out of context... I assure you I meant no disrespect.\n\nIn response to her comment about Living Single inventing the template for the show, Schwimmer said It's entirely possible that Warner Brothers and NBC, encouraged by the succss of Living Single, gave the Friends pilot a green light. I honestly don't know, but seems likely! If that's the cas (sic), we are all indebted to Living Single for paving the way.\n\nMore 'Friends' fun:Watch Jennifer Aniston hilariously surprise fans visiting the iconic coffee shop on set\n\nThrowback! Courteney Cox shares rare behind-the-scenes 'Friends' photo\n\nThe show's representation of Judaism was another example that Schwimmer said he found interesting in his interview.\n\nI don't think that was earth-shattering or groundbreaking at all, but I for one was glad that we had at least one episode where it wasn't just about Christmas. It was also Hanukkah… he said. I was glad that we at least acknowledged the differences in religious observation.\n\nHe also reminded those who criticize the show to remember when it was made. The show ran from 1994 to 2004.\n\nI feel that a lot of the problem today in so many areas is that so little is taken in context. You have to look at it from the point of view of what the show was trying to do at the time, he said. I'm the first person to say that maybe something was inappropriate or insensitive, but I feel like my barometer was pretty good at that time. I was already really attuned to social issues and issues of equality.\n\nMore 'Friends':As it prepares to leave Netflix, why we won't shut up about it, 25 years later\n\nRelated:'Actor Stan Kirsch, who starred on 'Highlander' and appeared on 'Friends,' dies at 51
WASHINGTON — What Democratic debate? On Wednesday night, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and female camaraderie took center stage in D.C.\n\nThe Notorious RBG, 86, was honored with the DVF Awards' Lifetime Achievement Award for being a trailblazer, contributing to gender equality and supporting women's issues.\n\nSupermodel Iman, along with Priti Patkar, who is working to stop the cycle of intergenerational sex trafficking in India, and Saskia Nino de Rivera, who provides services to those in Mexico's prison system, were also honored for their contributions Wednesday.\n\nThe 11th annual DVF Awards, which are normally in New York and held around springtime, traveled to the capital and were held at the Library of Congress for the first time — all for Ginsburg. Diane von Furstenberg said that in order to honor RBG, they had to work around Ginsburg's schedule.\n\nI'm so happy we did; it's the least we can do, she told USA TODAY prior to her namesake event. It's actually given us the idea that we can make these awards travel; they don't have to only be in New York.\n\nThe DVF Awards were created in 2010 by von Furstenberg, 73, to honor extraordinary women who are making an impact on other women's lives: Women who have had the courage to fight, the strength to survive and the leadership to inspire, she explained.\n\nThe theme of the evening was women uplifting other women, and it permeated every aspect of the awards.\n\nIt's hard to believe that I'm going to be at the Library of Congress, at the same time there's two exhibitions honoring women (Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words and Shall Not Be Denied: Women Fight for the Vote), von Furstenberg said. This is the 100th anniversary that women can vote... all of those things all tied together make an incredible energy around this evening.\n\nShe was right. The energy at the Library of Congress was palpable.\n\nAccomplished women like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were in attendance, and there was a sense of camaraderie among the guests.\n\nThere were small but noticeable moments that exhibited the respect and kindness shared among the big names in attendance: Iman and von Furstenberg fan-girled when speaking about Ginsburg and being in her presence.\n\nYour mother raised you well, Iman told fellow supermodel Karlie Kloss between interviews.\n\nTo All the Boys I've Loved Before star Lana Condor shared that von Furstenberg helped her fix her jumpsuit before she walked the carpet: She literally came and tied it herself... I tied it wrong, Condor, 22, told USA TODAY.\n\nBut RBG was the true rockstar of the evening, as Iman noted.\n\nClinton, 72, presented the award to the Supreme Court Justice and shared a few humorous anecdotes while praising Ginsburg's landmark case.\n\nAdvancing the rights of women and girls is the great unfinished business of the 21st century and no one has done more to push it into reality than Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Clinton said. Every step of the way throughout her career, she has sent a clear message that women belong in all places that decisions are being made.\n\nWhile speaking about Ginsburg's efforts in the fight for gender equality, Clinton recalled how a Harvard professor once told her we don't need any more women in the university's law program.\n\nClinton, author of The Book of Gutsy Women, also took a playful jab at her husband to illustrate how much of a difference Ginsburg's pioneering work made in her personal and professional life.\n\nI couldn't get a credit card after I got married. I made more money than my husband, Clinton joked. A common experience throughout our marriage.\n\nWhen Ginsburg took the stage to accept her award, there was a thick silence that fell over the audience.\n\nFlipping the script, Ria Tabacco Mar, the director of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project asked Ginsburg what advice she has for men who are balancing work and kids.\n\nGinsburg left the crowd with a few words of wisdom: One of the saddest things about men's lives is that they're out there working to turn over a buck and one day their children are grown and they didn't have any real part in raising them.
Kristin Cavallari and Jay Cutler confused fans this weekend after the pair shared the same photo of them together to their respective Instagram accounts — the mysterious caption didn't help either.\n\nCavallari posted a photo of her and Cutler together Friday. In it she's wearing a white tank top and posing with her arms folded, leaning against Cutler, who's sporting a black and white plaid shirt.\n\nThe world is full of users. 10 years. Can't break that, Cavallari captioned the photo.\n\nCutler shared the same photo with an identical caption to his page.\n\nThe couple called it quits in April last year after 10 years together and almost seven years of marriage. Since their split, neither Cutler nor Cavallari have appeared on the other's Instagram page, aside from respective Mother's and Father's Day posts.\n\nTheir selfie created quite the stir in the comments section as fans speculated what the photo meant.\n\nBut wait. What. Does. This. Mean, asked Instagram user payt_wineman.\n\nUser Kaylatolbert_ asked Are you guys not DUNZO?!\n\nCavallari's friend, quarantine partner and hairstylist Justin Anderson commented there's a calmness in the nashville air tonight lovies. love you guys.\n\nOmg what's the tea girl, wrote Justin Mikita along with an emoji of popcorn.\n\nA few people speculated the photo meant that Cutler and Cavallari are just good friends.\n\nHonestly, y'all are probably just rocking the (expletive) out of co-parenting and dealing with this hot mess as best as you can. But ima (sic) ignore that and pretend this means y'all are staying together because that's what makes me feel better. OKAY, commented an Instagram user viewofthenew.\n\nThebabeafpod said it may just mean that love is respectful and mutual even if their marriage is over.\n\nSome just liked the picture as is.\n\nHere for whatever this is, wrote Jaime Primak Sullivan.\n\nCaroline Lunny commented that she doesn't know what's going on, but loves whatever this is.\n\nIn September, Cavallari opened up about her divorce from former NFL quarterback Cutler, as well as why her reality show, Very Cavallari, came to an end.\n\nIn an interview with ET, the reality star revealed Very Cavallari was ended so she wouldn't have to address the divorce on television.\n\nThe decision to end the show was that I didn't want to have to talk about my divorce on camera and have to expose that, she said. I think that some things should be kept private.\n\nAccording to Cavallari, she and Cutler did their best to make their marriage work. The two were married for nearly seven years before announcing their split this spring.\n\nCavallari's rep declined to comment.\n\nContributing: Charles Trepany
Larry Wilmore knew Netflix viewers were in for something remarkable when he watched Mahershala Ali speak the words of abolitionist Frederick Douglass.\n\nBeautiful is the only word I can use, he tells USA TODAY. Ali performs as Douglass during Netflix's new six-part documentary series Amend: The Fight for America (now streaming), which aims to educate audiences about the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Wilmore and Will Smith serve as executive producers; Smith hosts.\n\nSection 1 of the Amendment guarantees equal rights to all, and reads in part: No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nThe 14th Amendment promised equality – but history shows true equality has yet to arrive for marginalized communities in the U.S. Achieving that equality can't happen without education; Wilmore, who also appears in Amend as a commentator, says everyone could stand to learn more.\n\nIt was an education for us while we were making it, he says. The first half of the series focuses on Black history, from slavery and abolition through the modern fight for civil rights, and the second on women's rights, the LGBTQ community and immigration.\n\nGiven the intersectionality of some of these identities – a term coined by professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, who is interviewed – topics and themes inevitably overlap.\n\n'We have to engage with our past':MSNBC's Trymaine Lee on 'Into America' podcast, our future\n\nWhen we did the marriage equality episode, the first thing that struck me was the similarities between the civil rights for Black Americans and the struggle for LGBTQ rights, Wilmore says.\n\nAmend uses a multimedia mix of animation, drawings, historical footage, news clippings and photographs, along with interviews from historians, activists and professors. Ali and other actors like Laverne Cox, Diane Lane and Samuel L. Jackson read the words of historical figures.\n\nWhile the series focuses on the 14th Amendment, Wilmore says we can – and should – look at every constitutional amendment for guidance.\n\nWhether it's the First Amendment or the 14th, there's meaning in them for us now.\n\nAdd to your watch list:25 powerful movies to stream in honor of Black History Month, from 'Da 5 Bloods' to 'One Night in Miami'\n\nWhile the series at times feels like a rehash of a high school history class, expect to get a clearer picture of important historical figures – and to learn about others for the first time.\n\nMany may not know, for example, that Abraham Lincoln and Douglass didn't always see eye to eye, or about figures from politician John Bingham, who was considered the Father of the 14th Amendment, to civil rights pioneer PauliMurray.\n\nThere are so many nuances in the movements that get lost, Wilmore says. We'll know about the movements themselves, but a lot of the tugs and pulls and pushes that happen within certain movements were really kind of eye-opening and interesting.\n\nWilmore acts as comic relief amid the seriousness of the topics – something he's used to doing. Unfortunately, that's kind of just how my brain works, he says.\n\nOf course, he wanted to make sure he struck the right tone. You have to honor this material, he says. You don't want to trivialize it.\n\nBlack History Month TV guide:10 shows that'll teach you a thing or two about the Black experience\n\nThe same concerns came up when figuring out how to use actors as part of the documentary. Should they be in costume, for example? Wilmore says they landed on simplicity and letting the words of historical figures speak for themselves.\n\nFor Wilmore, Ali personified that idea as Douglass: It was the first time realizing that this could be something special.
Like millions of other Americans, Franklin Graham watched the disturbing images of last week's riots at the U.S. Capitol with swelling concern and anger.\n\nGraham, son of the late evangelist Billy Graham and head of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said he was sickened to see people attack my Capitol and break down the doors of my Capitol and was dismayed to see how President Donald Trump riled up the protesters.\n\nI don't think it was the president's finest moment, he said.\n\nBut Graham said he doesn't expect the tumult at the Capitol to deter evangelical Christians from supporting Trump.\n\nI don't think he had any understanding in that moment of what was going to take place, he said. None of us did.\n\nGraham added, He regrets it.\n\nSince his victory in a very competitive Republican primary in 2016, Trump has relied on evangelical Christians and other influential religious groups as powerful voting blocs to shore up his influence. He has appointed more than 200 federal judges and three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who support limits on abortion and gay marriage and other policies favored by many conservative religious leaders. In the presidential election in November, 76% of white evangelicals voted for Trump and 24% for Joe Biden, according to Edison Research exit polls.\n\nThousands of protesters broke into the Capitol as Congress tried to finalize the Electoral College vote count and acknowledge Biden as the election winner. The attack led to five deaths and nearly 100 arrests and motivated House Democrats to introduce articles of impeachment against Trump for allegedly inciting the crowds. During a speech before the violence broke out, Trump told his followers, We're going to have to fight much harder.\n\nIf you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore, he said hours before rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, threatening Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other lawmakers.\n\nTuesday, before leaving on a trip to South Texas, Trump said calls for his impeachment were divisive and his comments to supporters before the Capitol insurrection were totally appropriate.\n\nNone of the turmoil has eroded much of his support among evangelicals, experts and religious leaders said.\n\nFor the past four years, evangelical leaders created an echo chamber where they blamed all of Trump's digressions and missteps on the Democratic Party or the mainstream media, said Sarah Posner, an investigative journalist and author of Unholy: Why White Evangelicals Worship at the Altar of Donald Trump.\n\nAfter the deadly Capitol riot, evangelical leaders deflected blame from Trump, while those who have been critical of the president denounced the riots and blamed him for playing a role, she said.\n\nEvangelicals are so conditioned not to trust the media, it's going to be really hard to convince them of the truth of what happened on Wednesday, Posner said.\n\nIn the wake of the Capitol riots, many evangelical leaders have continued fueling Trump's baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud in last year's elections, she said.\n\nBecause it's the leaders who are again churning the same conspiracy theories, I don't see a lot of progress in changing anybody's minds, Posner said.\n\nRobert Jeffress, senior pastor of the 14,000-member First Baptist Church of Dallas, said Tuesday he had absolutely no regrets over his enthusiastic support of Trump over the past four years.\n\nHe is without doubt the most pro-life and pro-religious president in history, Jeffress said in an e-mail. The president has every right to hold the view that the election was fraudulent and to invite those who share that belief to peacefully protest. He neither called for nor condoned the despicable actions of those who invaded our Capitol and assaulted the police.\n\nIn an editorial published over the weekend on Fox News, Jeffress called the storming of the Capitol not only a crime but a sin against God.\n\nPeaceful protest is a vital part of our political tradition, and it has long served us well, he wrote. What happened on Wednesday when a mob infiltrated the Capitol building was not a protest. It was lawlessness. … Celebrating evil is evil. It corrodes the soul.\n\nJeffress said he would discuss in his sermon Sunday how Christians dismayed by the election results should respond to Biden.\n\nIf we are ever going to heal our country, he said, we must learn how to lay aside the anger and bitterness that are tearing our country apart without demanding that people surrender their deeply held convictions.\n\nTrump has also courted support from Orthodox Jewish leaders, who applauded when he moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem two years ago. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, brokered the signing of peace accords with a handful of Mideast countries.\n\nAccording to a survey by the American Jewish Committee published in October, Trump was preferred by 74% of Orthodox Jews. Biden was favored by 83% of secular Jews.\n\nAmong the mob at the U.S. Capitol were Orthodox Jews who supported the president, even though there were anti-Semitic images in the crowd, including a man with a T-shirt emblazoned with Camp Auschwitz. One rioter arrested Friday was the son of a prominent judge in New York's Orthodox Jewish community.\n\nRabbi Mendy Mirocznik, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Alliance of America, a national organization that represents more than 900 Orthodox clergy members, called the events at the Capitol very painful. The Rabbinical Alliance of America does not endorse any political candidates for office.\n\nThis is more than the straw that broke the camel's back, said Mirocznik, whose parents are Holocaust survivors from Poland. America needs to begin to heal.\n\nA poll by the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization that tracks extremism nationwide, found approximately two-thirds of Americans say Trump and members of groups with white supremacist beliefs were responsible for the violence.\n\nMost Americans now see the direct connection between the dangerous rhetoric from President Trump, others on the far right and extremist groups, said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the ADL.\n\nDuring religious services this past weekend, Jewish clergy took to the pulpit to speak out against white supremacy, anti-Semitism and the attack on democracy.\n\nAs Rabbi Rachel Timoner began reciting the blessing, Baruch Atah Adonai, to welcome the sabbath in Congregation Beth Elohim in New York City's Brooklyn borough, she attempted to comfort her congregation.\n\nWe are going to kindle light because the world needs light, she said, lighting two white candles.\n\nJoseph W. Daniels, Jr., pastor of Emory Fellowship, a United Methodist church in Washington, cited the attack on the Capitol during his sermon Sunday and urged congregants to call out wrongdoing when they see it.\n\nFor our nation to heal, for America to heal, we have to call out the fact that the behaviors and habits and attitudes of this past Wednesday were not of God but were of a white supremacy and privilege that are not healthy for anybody, Daniels said. We cannot be afraid. We have to have courage. ... We have to call out demons.\n\nSome conservative religious leaders called for the nation to move forward behind Biden.\n\nIn an article in the online portal The Gospel Coalition, Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, condemned the attacks on the Capitol and called on Christians to reject the falsehoods surrounding the elections and embrace the truth.\n\nEnough is enough – and indeed was enough a long time ago, Moore wrote. It will take decades to rebuild from the wreckage in this country. But, as Christians, we can start now – just by not being afraid to say what is objectively the truth. Joe Biden has been elected president.\n\nHe said, If Christians are people of truth, we ought to be the first to acknowledge reality.\n\nFor other evangelicals, Trump's role in the Capitol attack will be minimized because many see him not just as an elected official but one anointed by God, Posner said.\n\nThey feel he should remain president because God wanted him to be president, she said.\n\nContributing: Deborah Berry\n\nFollow Jervis on Twitter: @MrRJervis.
Adelle M. Banks\n\nReligions News Service\n\nFor many this year, Feb. 14 is a day of mixed messages.\n\nIt's Valentine's Day, a time for chocolate, roses and perhaps a dinner date. But it's also Ash Wednesday, which for many Christians is the start of Lent, a period of penitence that precedes Easter Sunday.\n\nHow do clergy reconcile this calendar clash, the first of its kind since 1945? Approaches abound, but many feel the church must come first on this dual day.\n\nIn Upper Marlboro, Md., as Valentine's Day and Ash Wednesday approached, the Rev. Peter Antoci, pastor of St. Thomas' Episcopal Church, was talking with members of his parish about the seeming conflicting themes of love on Valentine's Day and the penitence of the Lenten season.\n\nWhat are we going to do — put this out under the theme, 'I love you; I'm sorry'? he said he joked with church members. But the more I thought about it the more I thought sometimes when something is odd or uncomfortable the best thing to do is to lean into the discomfort.\n\nHe combined the prayers and ritual of Ash Wednesday with Scriptures about love — including the romance of Song of Solomon and the God is love verse from 1 John — and encouraged his music minister to choose selections more appropriate for a wedding than for Lent. The choir, along with his spouse, agreed to celebrate Valentine's Day some other time this week so its members can sing at the 7:30 p.m. evensong service.\n\nIt's love in all of its senses, said Antoci, who plans to say Remember that you are beloved, and to love you shall return, during the imposition of ashes (instead of the traditional Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return).\n\nTaking a different approach, Catholic bishops such as Buffalo's Richard J. Malone have opted to stick with traditional Ash Wednesday plans and said church members should make the small sacrifice of fasting that day as they consider the great love he said was demonstrated through Jesus' suffering and death.\n\nThose who are accustomed to celebrating Valentine's Day might do so ... [on a] nonpenitential day, he said in a Required Fasting video posted on his Twitter account.\n\nAndrew W. Lichtenwalner, executive director of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' department dealing with laity, marriage and family life, said Ash Wednesday takes precedence as a day of fasting and abstinence even as the church marked the U.S. celebration of National Marriage Week that concludes on Feb. 14.\n\nThe coincidence of Ash Wednesday and Valentine's Day is a way for Catholics to reflect on the true meaning of love, an act of self-giving, he said.\n\nLent also ends with another coincidence: Easter Sunday falls on April 1, or April Fools' Day.\n\nIn an Episcopal Cafe column titled This is no time to be cute, the Rev. Andrew T. Gerns of Trinity Episcopal Church in Easton, Pa., argued that neither day bookending Lent should leave tradition behind.\n\nAnd this is not a moment for cuteness, it is (a) moment of humility, he wrote, adding that six and a half weeks later, it won't be a time for pranks, but for awe.\n\nOther columnists recommended ways to live out the spirit of the day — named for more than one St. Valentine, the first of which was no patron of love — as well as the Christian obligation to begin Lent.\n\nCanadian writer Clare Lazzuri, writing in The B.C. Catholic, a newspaper for British Columbians, offered options that started with each letter of the word heart — from helping around the house to talking to God each day.\n\nRobert Carnes, writing for ChurchMarketingSucks.com, suggested 15 ways churches could connect the two occasions, from sending handwritten love notes to houses within a one-mile radius to working on a service project.\n\nBut one idea on his list that was separately debated on Twitter did not get a lot of love from some clergy: heart-shaped ashes.\n\nDrawing a cross is hard enough, Rev. Eilidh Lowery, pastor of Trinity United Methodist Church in Portland, Ore., said of the gooey ashes-and-oil combination she imposes on people's foreheads.\n\nAntoci agreed: You can't stay inside the lines.\n\nHe took another approach: chocolate candies with a Scripture passage on each wrapper.\n\nAs people leave the church on Wednesday, I'll greet them at the door as they leave and I'll give everybody a piece of Valentine's chocolate, he said, with the advice that they should read it and eat it on Sunday, which is not a fast day.
AP\n\nJulie Ertz has a world championship and Player of the Year honors in her sport. So she's already got an edge on husband Zach — that is, if they were competitive.\n\nShe says the athletic couple doesn't really try to one-up each other all that much.\n\nMaybe in board games, she says with a laugh.\n\nJulie and Zach are currently the sporting world's It couple. Julie is a midfielder for the World Cup-winning U.S. national soccer team, while her husband Zach is a tight end for the Super Bowl-bound Philadelphia Eagles. The joke is that they both play football, just different kinds.\n\nJust as Zach was in Canada for the 2015 World Cup final cheering on Julie, she'll be rooting for him on Sunday in Minneapolis. In fact, she's already there, acting as a correspondent for the U.S. team's Twitter feed .\n\nThe couple was married last March after a romance that started when Julie, then Julie Johnston, was an emerging soccer star at Santa Clara and Zach was playing at Stanford.\n\nJulie's career took off in 2015, well before Zach reached the NFL's biggest stage, when she was selected by national team coach Jill Ellis for the World Cup roster. At 23, she was the second-youngest player on the squad for soccer's premier tournament.\n\nYou train as if whenever you're called upon you're ready, she said. I think that was a huge mentality that was important for me. I know I really wanted to make the team, but I knew that I had a long way to go. So I tried every day to take it day by day and really learn anything I could at practice, and do every extra thing that I thought I needed to do.\n\nJohnston played on a backline that included Meghan Klingenberg, Becky Sauerbrunn and Ali Krieger. The defense was anchored by Hope Solo, who was spectacular in goal. The group went 540 minutes during the tournament without conceding a goal on the way to a 5-2 final victory over Japan.\n\nWith her trademark baby-blue headband, Johnston quickly proved she was one of the sport's fastest-rising stars. Today, she's introspective about her world championship.\n\nI could give you 1,000 moments that were special, but looking back it was the journey, and everything that I learned about myself and what I didn't think I could do, she said. I learned a lot, and it really pushed my love for the sport even more than I already loved it.\n\nShe shifted to a defensive midfielder position with the national team last year and did well. At the Tournament of Nations she came in as a substitute and scored the winner of a 4-3 victory in the 89th minute.\n\nShe played at that position the rest of the season, scoring six goals, including two against New Zealand. In December she was selected the national team's Player of the Year, earning more than half of all the votes.\n\nBut probably the happiest thing she did last year was marry Zach. The two tied the knot in March in California.\n\nZach, 27, is in his fifth season with the Eagles. He broke out this season with 824 receiving yards, behind only New England's Rob Gronkowski (1,084) and Kansas City's Travis Kelce (1,038) among the ends. His eight touchdowns were double his previous career high, and he had eight catches for 93 yards in the NFC championship game.\n\nThe two were apart when the Eagles clinched their spot in the Super Bowl with a 38-7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. Julie was in San Diego for a national team match against Denmark. She was among the players who scored in the 5-1 victory.\n\nAfterward, when she was told Zach was going to the Super Bowl, she burst into tears .\n\nZach knew I was there obviously in spirit and I was praying for him and I was excited for him and cheering him from miles away, she said. It's a part of our job and we sacrifice a lot, and time's the biggest thing. But to find out that they are going to the Super Bowl was amazing, exciting, emotional. It's really cool to see your loved one's hard work pay off.\n\nThat's part of the mutual respect their marriage is built on.\n\nShe understands how hard I worked and how hard this team worked to get to this point. We're each other's No. 1 fan. Our relationship wasn't built on the athletic success. We truly love each other and that's the most important thing, Zach said.\n\nTo that end, Julie said it's Zach's turn in the spotlight.\n\nThis is his time, she said. I'm here. I'm a fan! I'm going to be in the stands, cheering with everyone else.\n\n___\n\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL
Sarah Birnbaum\n\nPRI.org\n\nHundreds of Israeli rabbis, including the sister of comedian Sarah Silverman, have announced a bold initiative: They say they will personally hide African asylum-seekers in their homes, to protect them from a new Israeli immigration policy.\n\nTens of thousands of African asylum-seekers, largely from Sudan and Eritrea, live in Israel. The government has announced the refugees have 90 days to accept $3,500 in cash and a one-way ticket home to an unnamed third country in Africa, or go to jail.\n\nHuman rights groups and news reports have reported that the unnamed third country is Rwanda or Uganda. And there's evidence to suggest that once there, the migrants face exploitation, abuse and trafficking.\n\nRabbi Susan Silverman — an activist, writer and rabbi who immigrated to Israel from Boston in 2006 — says it's time to fight back. That's why she came up with the Anne Frank Home Sanctuary Movement to house refugees in private homes.\n\nMore:Israeli government to tell 38,000 Africans to leave or face arrest\n\nSilverman says the name comes from a story she heard about an Eritrean refugee who came to Israel.\n\nWhen he left Eritrea, he was in an Ethiopian refugee camp where, in the library, he read The Diary of Anne Frank. He had never heard of her before. Silverman says.\n\nShe says the man was so moved by the story that he translated the book into the African language Tigrinya and decided to make the treacherous journey to Israel. And as he was heading for Israel on this harrowing, harrowing trip he said to himself, 'the people of Anne Frank will protect me.'\n\nNot everyone shares Silverman's point of view. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the African refugees illegal infiltrators. He has called the influx of migrants a threat to Israel's social fabric and Jewish character. One government minister has referred to the refugees as a cancer. And polling conducted in 2012 found widespread support for that statement.\n\nSilverman says she's aware of the risks of opposing the government's position on immigration. And there's the concern she and other activists could face jail time for harboring African refugees. But as she sees it, there's no other choice.\n\nMy dad taught Holocaust Studies, she says. And he always said, 'If you want to know what you would have been doing in Germany, ask yourself what you're doing for people at risk in the world today.' And I always thought that's a pretty good rule of thumb.\n\nTo hear Susan Silverman's entire interview with The World's Marco Werman, click here.\n\nThis article originally appeared on PRI.org.

Andrea Mandell\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nHow do you fit a life like Miles Davis' into a 100-minute movie?\n\nIf you're Don Cheadle, you find another rhythm with Miles Ahead, a film that steers away from a conventional, chronological biopic.\n\nI didn't want to tell a story that felt like it was just checking off the boxes, the highlights and lowlights of his life, says Cheadle, 51, who produced, co-wrote, directed and stars in the film about the jazz great. I wanted to make a movie that, to me, felt like something that Miles Davis would want to have starred in, as opposed to a movie just about him.\n\n7 startling facts behind Cheadle's Miles Davis film\n\nThe result is a movie (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, nationwide April 22) that moves like Davis' experimental records did. Laced with the notes of Sketches of Spain and Kind of Blue, Cheadle's directorial debut is as much a look inside the world of the composer, bandleader and trumpet player as it is a (fictionalized) gun-wielding caper in which a Rolling Stone reporter (Ewan McGregor) tags along one cocaine-fueled night as Davis hunts down his stolen session tape from a shady music executive.\n\nThe tale bounces between Davis' prolific years and his marriage to Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi) to a five-year span in the 1970s when the musician put his talent on ice, as he wrestled with drugs and chronic pain from a degenerative hip condition. The silence fascinated Cheadle. How does that happen? he asks. And how do you come out of that?\n\nIt's a luxury that the actor, who stars in Season 5 of Showtime's House of Lies (which returns April 10) followed by Captain America: Civil War (in theaters May 6), has never been afforded. There are very few people that comfortably say they've 'made it 'or or feel like they don't have to hustle anymore, says Cheadle. It was a necessity for me to keep working. I was never able to shut it down and go, 'OK I'm just going to chill out for three or four years and not doing anything' ... but I understand feeling blocked. I understand exhaustion. And I think that's what was happening for him during that time.\n\nDon Cheadle is better than Saoirse Ronan at Catchphrase, but just barely\n\nCritics are raving about Cheadle's portrayal. This is probably Cheadle's most electrified performance since the one (in Devil In a Blue Dress) that made him a star, wrote New York magazine. The Hollywood Reporter said Cheadle not only nailed the rasp (Davis permanently damaged his voice by yelling after a throat surgery in 1955), eccentric irritability and paranoia but expertly conveys the idea of a man who was always composing and arranging in his head, haunted as much by past successes as personal failings.\n\nYet it took 10 years for Cheadle to get Miles Ahead to theaters, and the story is now infamous how Cheadle had to write in a major white character to get the movie made. Until we had Ewan McGregor, until there was the white co-lead in the movie, there was nothing that was going to happen, says the actor, who strung together financing from investors, friends, crowdfunding and his own wallet.\n\nAnd watch his hands carefully: That's really Cheadle playing the trumpet. The actor began playing in his youth and started studying seriously again four years ago for the role. The trumpet is one of the meanest and hardest instruments that there is, he says. I still practice every day.
David L. Marcus\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nMy cousin Roy Cohn taught Donald Trump the art of denying, deflecting and distracting. While Trump mastered all those, he failed to learn Roy's most important lesson: A lifetime of bullying and cheating has a way of catching up with you.\n\nAs Trump seems to shrink before our eyes, I've been thinking of Roy's final months, in 1986. By then, Roy was a recluse, his body wracked by disease, his mind reeling from dementia. His friends abandoned him. Emboldened, his enemies sought revenge.\n\nTo understand how far he fell, you had to see Roy Marcus Cohn at his zenith. For several decades, he seemed invincible, first as a prosecutor of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, then as the red-baiting aide to Sen. Joe McCarthy in the 1950s, then as a powerbroker and Mafia lawyer, and finally as a key supporter of President Ronald Reagan.\n\nBold, unethical and successful\n\nWhen he first met Trump in 1973, at Le Club on the Upper East Side, Roy was already known as an attorney who relied less on the formalities of the law than on shady connections.\n\nTrump, then 27, asked Roy for advice: The U.S. Justice Department was suing him for violating the Fair Housing Act and discriminating against Black tenants. Roy came up with a typically bold, unethical plan: Even though the government had damning evidence, Trump should countersue for $100 million.\n\nThe bluff worked: Trump settled without admitting guilt and crowed about his victory — for the first of many times.\n\nRoy imparted three strategies to his favorite apprentice: When you're attacked, counterattack harder. Find someone weaker than you to scapegoat. Daze and confuse everyone with a fog of lies.\n\nMy father was Roy's first cousin. In 1985, a year before Roy died, I started shadowing him for a magazine story. Roy boasted about his work for Trump. Through City Hall contacts and Mob ties, Roy had recently ensured that Trump Tower was built in spite of a concrete workers' strike.\n\nCorruption:Trump's pardons show his separate justice system for friends and allies\n\nLike Trump, Roy grew up with parents who had a dysfunctional marriage. Like Trump, he needed adulation. I watched politicians and developers waiting for an audience with him, sitting in the hallways of the six-floor townhouse off Park Avenue that doubled as Roy's office and home. Regular visitors included Roger Stone and Terence Cardinal Cooke, the archbishop of New York. And John Gotti, aka the Teflon Don — before he was convicted of five murders.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1985, shortly before Roy turned 59, he threw a party thatI and the other guests sensed would be his last. Carmine DeSapio, the Tammany Hall boss, mingling with Norman Mailer, William F. Buckley and Steve Rubell. Andy Warhol stood in a corner. As usual, Trump arrived late and stayed just long enough to give a toast and get photographed for the gossip columns.\n\nNever a bottom:The defining phrase of Donald Trump's presidency was 'new low'\n\nTrump boasted that he kept a photo of Roy in his office, to intimidate people. Roy is a terrible lawyer, he told the laughing crowd. But I only need to mention his name and people are too scared to challenge me.\n\nRoy shuffled unevenly, clutching his young partner, Peter Fraser. No one mentioned the rumor that Roy denied, but that all of us knew to be true: He had AIDS.\n\nDisbarred for deceit and fraud\n\nSoon after, the epidemic that Roy had scoffed at caught up with him. He fell asleep in the middle of conversations. He tried to overdose but couldn't open the pill bottle. New York tabloids — the Twitter of the 1980s — stopped featuring him.\n\nIn June 1986, New York's top court disbarred Roy for dishonesty, deceit and fraud. Roy went ahead and hosted a private dinner, but Trump and other close friends didn't show. He died in August with only one person by his side, Peter. It was far from the sendoff Roy had envisioned, with senators, judges and celebrities cheering him.\n\nIf Roy's carelessness about the AIDS epidemic led to his demise, Trump's cavalier attitude about the COVID-19 pandemic brought about his downfall. Now, after a humiliating election defeat, plummeting approval ratings and two impeachments, even corporate America has acknowledged Trump's toxicity.\n\nAlthough Trump is not known for introspection, in stressful times he has wondered aloud, Where's my Roy Cohn? Here's the answer: Your Roy Cohn died in ignominy. He's buried in my family's mausoleum, behind a marble slab marked LAWYER AND PATRIOT. Every so often, one of us pushes open the heavy door to leave flowers or notes for a beloved relative.\n\nNo one leaves anything for Roy.\n\nDavid L.

Daryl Dragon of '70s pop sensations Captain & Tennille died of renal failure Jan. 2 at a hospice in Prescott, Arizona, with former wife Toni Tennille by his side, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.\n\nHe was 76.\n\nMore commonly known as the Captain, Dragon was a member of the Beach Boys from 1967 to 1972 before forming a duo with Tennille in 1974.\n\nHe was a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly, Tennille said in a statement. I was at my most creative in my life when I was with him.\n\nDragon and Tennille met in the early 1970s and soon began performing together, with Tennille singing and Dragon on keyboards. (He would later serve as Captain & Tennille's producer.) Their breakthrough came in 1975, when they topped the Billboard Hot 100 with a cover of the Neil Sedaka-Howard Greenfield song Love Will Keep Us Together, which became the biggest-selling record of the year and won a Grammy for record of the year.\n\nMORE:Why Tennille left the Captain\n\nTheir best-known hits included The Way I Want to Touch You, Lonely Night (Angel Face), Shop Around, Muskrat Love, You Never Done it Like That and second chart-topper Do That To Me One More Time. They also briefly starred in their own television variety show before their careers faded in the 1980s.\n\nDragon and Tennille divorced in 2014 after nearly 40 years of marriage. But if love couldn't keep them together, it did keep them close enough for Tennille to move back to Prescott to care for Dragon in 2017.\n\nMORE: Captain & Tennille back in Arizona, but not back together\n\nIn 2016, Tennille published Toni Tennille: A Memoir, which presented their marriage as far removed from their cheerful hits. They wed in 1974, but Tennille recalled that their marriage was announced in advance – and to their surprise – by their record company. The couple, who had been living together, made it official in November of that year.\n\nTennille would allege that the marriage suffered from lack of intimacy and blamed it on what she described as Dragon's very, very difficult family and famous but overbearing father.\n\nA Los Angeles native, Dragon was the son of Oscar-winning composer Carmen Dragon and singer Eloise Dragon and was himself a classically trained musician. Before he was with Tennille, he played keyboards for the Beach Boys and was dubbed The Captain by singer Mike Love, who noted Dragon's fondness for sea captain caps.\n\nHe is survived by his older brother, Doug Dragon, and two nieces, Kelly Arbout and Renee Henn.\n\nOriginal Beach Boys member Brian Wilson tweeted that he's so sad to hear about Daryl Dragon, adding that he was a great guy and a hell of a musician and keyboard player.\n\nSinger/songwriter Sedaka, who first recorded Love Will Keep Us Together with Greenfield, offered his sympathies to Tennille and Dragon's family.\n\n#RIP Daryl Dragon, The Captain, a great musician, keyboard player and friend for over 40 years.

PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Jayson Terdiman compares doubles luge to a marriage, and it has nothing to do with the 46 or so seconds they spend literally laying on top of each other on a sled going 70 mph.\n\nIt's five months a year living tougher, and the other seven months we're training together, Terdiman said. We don't live together in Lake Placid but we see each other five days a week in the weight room, the start house, the recovery areas.\n\nAnd, if all goes well Wednesday, Terdiman and his partner Matt Mortensen may see each other on the podium.\n\nThe Mortensen-Terdiman team represents the best chance the U.S. has had to win a medal in doubles luge since taking the silver and bronze that year. Since pairing in 2014, Mortensen and Terdiman have consistently improved their performance on the World Cup circuit and feel like they're finally ready to do some damage at the Olympic level.\n\nMORE:USA's silver medalist Chris Mazdzer dreamed about it and called his shot\n\nMORE:Russian offered sled to Olympic silver medalist Chris Mazdzer\n\nMORE:Adam Rippon, Mirai Nagasu lead USA to team figure skating bronze\n\nThat confidence could only have improved on Sunday as they posted the fourth-fastest times in their first two training runs at the Alpensia Sliding Centre.\n\nWe have a very high level of determination, Mortensen said. If we have an opportunity, we seize it.\n\nContrary to what it might look like on television, doubles luge isn't just putting two random guys on a sled. Even in bobsled, the relationship between driver and brakeman doesn't require the same amount of synchronization between partners through every curve. A slight shift in body weight that doesn't align with the other could be catastrophic, and partners are often chosen specifically to mesh their physical characteristics.\n\nThey tend to do a small guy and a tall guy, said Terdiman, who will be on the back of the sled at 5-8, 155 pounds while the 6-0, 187-pound Mortensen will be in the more gravity-friendly position up front. That's an aerodynamics thing and a sled driving thing. The tall guy having more leverage on the front end of a sled, and the shorter guy kind of hiding, like trying to engulf me so the air flow work a little bit better. Matt's height and my height kind of mesh well together.\n\nBut to get to this point was a four-year process that began after the Sochi Games when their former partners decided to leave the sport competitively to pursue other interests. They had talked prior to those Olympics about training together in Lake Placid, just to see how the chemistry would work. In a sport where the luger on the bottom of the sled has to react to his partner 100% of the time in order to simply avoid crashing, that isn't easy to find.\n\nIt's definitely different on a doubles sled, said Andrew Sherk, who makes up half of the other U.S. doubles entrant alongside Justin Krewson. Being a bottom man, I can't see anything going down the track. I have to rely on Justin's movements to do anything. If there's a curve coming up I have to rely on his head movements and body movements going down the track.\n\nWhen Mortensen and Terdiman made 19 runs at Lake Placid without crashing, that was good enough to formulate a four-year plan to make it to Pyeongchang.\n\nDoubles has a steep learning curve, especially when you're jumping on a sled with a new teammate, Terdiman said. So we traveled the world trying to gain experience on each track because the lines he'd drive with his previous teammate and the lines I'd drive with my previous teammate wouldn't really work as well for the two of us on the same sled.\n\nTheir first year together on the World Cup circuit, they focused on simply gaining experience and familiarity and wound up seventh. The next year, they were fifth. And by 2016-17, they had improved to No. 3 in the world, earning medals at Lake Placid, Park City and Altenberg.\n\nThere's a bit of balance that goes on when you pair up with a new doubles teammates, Mortensen said. I didn't have medal aspirations (in Sochi). This time, especially with how Jason and I have done the past couple seasons, I really hope we can make something special happen here. I definitely think we have a shot at getting on the podium. If we can get down the track cleanly, anything can happen.\n\nRegardless of how it turns out, however, the marriage, so to speak, continues on.\n\nLuge is an individual sport, but doubles gives you that team aspect, Terdiman said. It's great, when you have a great run, you can kind of celebrate with somebody. We both work hard together and it's great to be able to celebrate victory together and get through defeat together. It's great to have someone to go through these emotions with.
WASHINGTON – The late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia was asked in 2013 whether the Second Amendment's right to bear arms stood on equal ground with other constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech.\n\nWe're going to find out, aren't we? he quipped.\n\nThat Scalia — who wrote the high court's landmark 2008 decision upholding gun rights — could not define the reach of that right was telling. Now, three years after his death, the court appears ready to put some teeth into an amendment that some justices say gets no respect.\n\nThe case, on tap to be heard this fall, challenges obscure New York City rules that prevent gun owners from transporting their weapons outside the city, whether to second homes or shooting ranges. There's nothing else like it among state and local gun restrictions.\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nYet from such outliers are major Supreme Court decisions of national import often born. And here, the court's conservative justices could clarify that all gun restrictions must clear a high bar, or state that the right to bear arms extends beyond the home.\n\nThis could be a huge decision, says Adam Winkler, author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America and a UCLA School of Law professor. This case is going to end badly for gun violence prevention advocates.\n\nGun control groups are so worried about the court's direction on the Second Amendment that they would prefer to see New York City change the challenged rules. That could render the case moot and prevent the court from hearing it.\n\nJonathan Lowy, director of legal action at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, says if the rules were changed, it certainly would not be an issue worthy of the Supreme Court's consideration.\n\nOtherwise, he says, There is a potential that this case will lead to a discussion by some justices, and perhaps by a majority, about whether the right to a firearm extends outside the home into public places.\n\nUSA TODAY is on WhatsApp!

He succeeded retired Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose position on guns was viewed as more equivocal.\n\nBefore that personnel change, the court had declined at least eight opportunities to take on Scalia's challenge over the past five years. It had let stand Chicago's semiautomatic weapons ban and a variety of prohibitions against carrying guns in public, from New Jersey to California. It had refused to second-guess age limits for carrying guns in Texas and requirements for disabling or locking up guns when not in use in San Francisco.\n\nScalia's most famous opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller never defined the breadth of the right he declared. In fact, it made clear the court was not upholding a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.\n\nThere are doubtless limits, Scalia said in that 2013 appearance at George Washington University. What they are, we will see.\n\nSeven ranges, 8.5 million residents\n\nWhatever the limits should be, the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association doesn't think they should ban taking guns outside city limits – even when they're unloaded, locked up, and separate from any ammunition. The group, an affiliate of the National Rifle Association, wants the right to transport guns to upstate homes, target ranges and competitions.\n\nThe city has seven ranges that meet the police department's approval but 8.5 million residents. For some, the closest or most convenient range is in the suburbs.\n\nPaul Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general representing the gun owners, said in court papers that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's ruling forces petitioners to choose which constitutional right they would rather exercise: their right to travel or their right to keep and bear arms.\n\nHe went further, urging the justices to use the New York City case to strengthen the Second Amendment and halt the spread of irrational and draconian restrictions such as purchasing rules, fees and taxes.\n\nSeventeen states led by Louisiana warn that upholding New York's restrictions could have an economic impact elsewhere.\n\nWildlife tourism, which includes hunting, practicing, and competitive shooting, is a multibillion dollar industry in the United States, they said in court papers. If New York's regulatory scheme is allowed to stand and is copied by cities around the United States, it could undercut state economies dependent upon those tourism dollars.\n\nCity officials contend a ruling in their favor would not set a trend. They belittle the gun owners' complaint that similar travel restrictions would be unfathomable if placed on golfers or musicians.\n\nUnlike golf clubs and musical instruments, firearms present public safety risks that the city has a legitimate interest in protecting against, they told the court. Limiting their possession and use in public minimizes the risk of gun violence.\n\nConservatives' frustrations\n\nIf it isn't negated by New York City's actions, the gun case will shed light on the Supreme Court's transformation under President Donald Trump.\n\nFor years, the court has been divided between conservatives and liberals, with one or more conservatives often switching sides on issues such as abortion, affirmative action and same-sex marriage.\n\nBut last week, the court's conservatives allowed Trump's partial ban on transgender troops in the military to take effect. And over the next few months, those conservatives may control court decisions on religious freedom, partisan gerrymandering and the power of government agencies to interpret ambiguous regulations.\n\nWhen it comes to the Second Amendment, their frustration has been building for years.\n\nThe last time the court refused to consider a restriction on carrying guns in public, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that it was extremely improbable that the Framers understood the Second Amendment to protect little more than carrying a gun from the bedroom to the kitchen. He was joined by Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nWhen the court reversed a Massachusetts court that had upheld banning stun guns, Associate Justice Samuel Alito added that unless the Second Amendment applies outside the home, then the safety of all Americans is left to the mercy of state authorities who may be more concerned about disarming the people than about keeping them safe.\n\nKavanaugh's addition to the court in October may have given the other conservatives the vote they need to win future cases. As a federal appeals court judge, he dissented in 2011 from a decision upholding the District of Columbia's ban on semi-automatic rifles, insisting that courts should assess such regulations based solely on text, history and tradition.\n\nThat makes Chief Justice John Roberts the likely swing vote in the New York City gun case – or the next such case, if this one is declared moot before oral argument.\n\nIt's all about 'WWRD,' Winkler says. What would Roberts do?\n\nMore:President Trump bets big on Supreme Court to uphold controversial policies after lower court losses\n\nMore:Supreme Court's inaction leaves DACA program for young migrants intact for now\n\nMore:Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg absent from Supreme Court while recovering from surgery, a first in her career
John Bacon\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe man accused of supplying guns to the San Bernardino, Calif., terror attackers pleaded not guilty Wednesday to conspiracy and other charges.\n\nEnrique Marquez Jr., 24, is charged with two counts of lying on forms in the alleged straw purchases of two assault rifles used in the attack Dec. 2 at the Inland Regional Center. Marquez is also accused of conspiring with shooter Syed Rizwan Farook in 2011 and 2012 to provide material support to terrorists.\n\nTwo other charges — fraud and making false statements on immigration documents — are related to an alleged sham marriage. His trial is now set for Feb. 23.\n\nMarquez is not charged with direct involvement in the attack last month that left 14 people dead and more than 20 wounded. He denies any prior knowledge of the tragedy.\n\nFarook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, died in a shootout with police following the Dec. 2 attack. After the attack, Marquez called 911 and told an operator that he wanted to kill himself.\n\nMy neighbor. He did the San Bernardino shooting, Marquez said, according to a transcript. They can trace all the guns back to me.\n\nFriend of San Bernardino shooter indicted on terror-related charges\n\nFBI: Killers were 'radicalized,' no evidence of global plot\n\nMarquez is accused of plotting at least two other assaults with Farook in 2011 and 2012 that were not carried out. Prosecutors said Marquez told investigators that he and Farook planned to assault the library or cafeteria of the Riverside Community College, where both had been students.\n\nA second plot involved lobbing pipe bombs at motorists during rush-hour on California State Route 91, which services the greater Los Angeles area. It then called for the two to open fire on stranded motorists, and for Marquez to target law enforcement officers from a nearby hillside as they came to assist.\n\nProsecutors said Marquez immersed himself in radical ideology shortly after meeting Farook in 2005 while the two lived in Riverside, Calif. By 2011, Marquez and Farook supported the militant rhetoric of now-deceased al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlak, according to court documents.\n\nDefendant Marquez's extensive plotting with Sayed Rizwan Farook in 2011 and 2012 and his purchase of explosive powder and two firearms provided the foundation for the murders in San Bernardino, U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said in announcing the indictment last week.\n\nContributing: Kevin Johnson; Associated Press
Bryan Alexander\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLAS VEGAS — DC Comics brought out the biggest, baddest superhero collective this side of the Avengers on Wednesday night.\n\nBen Affleck (Batman), Ray Fisher (Cyborg), Ezra Miller (The Flash), Henry Cavill (Superman) and Jason Momoa (Aquaman) all rumbled on the stage for Justice League at CinemaCon. This was the moment that theater owners, who are gathered for their annual national convention, have been waiting for all week.\n\nAnd the superheroes didn't say a word.\n\nWarner Bros. was happy to let the footage from Justice League and director Zack Snyder do the talking during the highlight in the studio's presentation.\n\nVin Diesel promises 'Furious 8' is 'best film you ever saw' at CinemaCon\n\n'Justice League' trailer unites Zack Snyder's supergroup\n\nWith the supergroup at his side, Snyder noted that the project is the culmination of a journey of seven years.\n\nHe added, I would throw to the cast, but they are too awesome.\n\nAffleck, who in January pulled out of directing the solo Batman outing, wore a natty suit that would make billionaire Bruce Wayne jealous. In his first major outing since announcing earlier this month that he underwent treatment for alcohol addiction, he stayed silent, giving a slight wave and mouthing Thank you from the stage. Then the group exited for a private jet flight back to Los Angeles.\n\nThe extended footage shown from Justice League, which built upon the trailer released earlier this week, went over well in the packed auditorium.\n\nAffleck's Bruce Wayne was seen working in a warehouse with Diana Prince (Wonder Woman) entering. The two banter back and forth with Wayne saying there's a battle coming. Not coming, Bruce, she says. It's already here.\n\nThis was followed by extended battle scenes and another moment showing Prince, Wayne and Barry Allen (The Flash) talking in street clothes as the famed Bat-Signal flashes in the sky behind them.\n\nAwesome, that's the Bat-Signal, that means we have to go now, Allen says. It's so cool.\n\nJustice League hits theaters Nov. 17.\n\nHere's how DC Comics' other movies played out at CinemaCon:\n\nWonder Woman: Gal Gadot wasn't at the convention, having given birth to a daughter two weeks ago. Instead, Gadot sent a video greeting. But Chris Pine (Steve Trevor), sporting a freshly shaven head, and director Patty Jenkins filled in.\n\nTheir clip featured details on the love relationship that develops between Trevor and Wonder Woman and an extended scene on a ship during World War I. As the two sail toward the war in Europe, Trevor gallantly and clumsily declines to lay down with Wonder Woman to rest. He says he does not sleep with a woman out of the confines of marriage.\n\nGiving new meaning to origin story, the Amazon princess declares that her mother didn't have sex with a man to create her.\n\nMother sculpted me from clay and I was brought to life by Zeus, Wonder Woman says, before the two bed down together for sleeping purposes only.\n\nWonder Woman arrives in theaters June 2.\n\nAquaman: Before joining his Justice League cohorts, Jason Momoa spoke for his solo superhero effort, announcing that filming was about to begin.\n\nWe haven't shot anything. I'm literally leaving tonight to start shooting in Australia, Momoa said.\n\nMomoa showed a sizzle reel of concept art featuring director James Wan and images of the underwater world of Atlantis, where inhabitants ride sharks and take part in dogfight-like battles.

SAVANNAH, Ga. – The house on Boykin Ridge Drive hasn't had a soul in it since February 23, 2020.\n\nIt was the place where Wanda Cooper-Jones raised her three children, Marcus, Jasmine and Ahmaud, and celebrated milestones: high school graduations, birthdays and the overall wholeness of family.\n\nWe grew up together in that house, a soft-toned but collected Cooper-Jones says.\n\nNow that house waits for a new family to create memories and Cooper-Jones is left to bear the emotional destruction from her last day there, the day her youngest son Ahmaud Arbery died.\n\nHe was the baby, but he was the one I knew would have my back through thick and thin, she said.\n\nAs the world races on, Arbery's family continues to wrestle with the unspeakable tragedy that befell them when Arbery was chased by three vigilantes and gunned down while on a Sunday afternoon jog last year in Brunswick, Georgia.\n\nRemembering Ahmaud Arbery: 'I cherish every moment we shared and I wish there could be more' Demetris Frazier talks about the bond he shared with his cousin Ahmaud Arbery and how he's working to make sure people know the man he was. Richard Burkhart, Savannah Morning News\n\nHe was 25 years old, with many miles behind him and a lifetime ahead.\n\nHe got to a place where he was like 'Look, I really got to focus on myself to better myself,' said his cousin, Demetris Frazier. He started exercising, writing down different goals as to what he wants to do.\n\nAnd then it was over.\n\nArbery was no different than many Black men in their mid-20s: entering their careers, perhaps contemplating marriage, some still deciding what the future holds.\n\nThe Savannah Morning News, part of the USA TODAY Network, spoke to five Black men around the same age as Arbery about the impact his death one year ago has had on them, how they're navigating life and how their experiences have formed their views on race and safety. They talked about what to do with the years they have, years Arbery does not.\n\nAhmaud Arbery is pictured here with his mother Wanda Cooper-Jones.\n\n'Ahmaud was my age'\n\nCorey Morgan drove nearly four hours from his home in Camilla, Georgia, to Brunswick to protest last year. For him, it was important to immerse himself in the city, get to know the people and show up for Ahmaud.\n\nI caught myself crying there because Ahmaud was my age. I looked at my best friends, my little cousins, that could've been any of us, Morgan said, adding that like Arbery, he too jogged frequently to relieve the stress of the pandemic.\n\nCorey Morgan of Camilla GA, drove to Brunswick to participate in the protests following Ahmaud Arbery was killed. Javetta Clemmons/Savannah Morning News\n\nAnd like Arbery, Morgan, 25, questioned where his life was headed. Morgan worried whether he would find a job after college. Arbery was trying to piece together parts of his life, too.\n\nAfter high school, Arbery attended a community college near Brunswick but left after feeling like he was stuck in one place, Arbery's cousin, Frazier, said.\n\nMorgan shared similar worries about his collegiate career. The worries were enough to lead Morgan to therapy.\n\nShortly after graduation Morgan became the associate director of recruitment for his alma mater, Albany State University, and most recently became a councilman in Camilla, a predominantly Black town which sits in Mitchell County and is about 230 miles west of Savannah.\n\nCorey Morgan I think we can see that that community wasn't playing and that they're going to continue until justice is served. Quote icon\n\nAs a city councilman, Morgan hopes he can be a part of the change in his community. But as he works to make a difference in his city, he is still left with the images he saw in Brunswick and the people working to keep Arbery's legacy alive.\n\nI think we can see that that community wasn't playing and that they're going to continue until justice is served, Morgan said. It's my hope that they continue with great oversight so that nothing like that happens again.\n\nRead more on race and identity: Sign up for USA TODAY's This Is America newsletter\n\nConsidering a future\n\nAt 22, Raydell Martin was playing football at Savannah State University and had begun thinking more seriously about his future. Martin grew up on the eastside of Columbus, Georgia, before moving to Savannah at 17.\n\nAs he tells it, his childhood neighborhood was rife with gang activity and playing a sport was a sure way to escape that environment.\n\nMartin, now 27, was athletic and began playing football seriously in seventh grade. When asked about how he'd envisioned 25, he said: I never really gave much thought to that because it was such an obstacle just getting to that 22-year-old age.\n\nRaydell Martin has sometimes been told to make deliveries in unsafe neighborhoods that his white colleagues weren't asked to go to. Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News\n\nGraduating high school was considered a milestone, he said. In Columbus, about 25% of the residents have college degrees and nearly 21% live in poverty. Attending schools with an International Baccalaureate program opened Martin to the possibility of what might exist for him beyond sports.\n\nWhen I got (in the program), I realized that a lot of people came from different backgrounds, he said. I saw my peers' parents' profession, and what was a reality to them were things that I was seeing on TV.\n\nLike Arbery, Martin contemplated what his life would look like, including going to the military. It wasn't until his senior year of college at Savannah State that he seriously considered a career in business. Now, Martin is a general manager for a finance company in Savannah and is working on his master's degree in business administration.\n\nTaking charge: Activists chart course for Black America's progress after a year of turmoil\n\nHis accomplishments don't shield him from racist microaggressions, however. When he worked in the restaurant industry, he said he often was asked to travel to rougher parts of town so that his white colleagues wouldn't have to.\n\nRaydell Martin I've definitely been in situations where it's been unfair. I think it's just because of how people think Black people are disposable. Quote icon\n\nI don't think it was a situation where they said, 'Let's put him here because he's more relatable to these people,' Martin said. I've definitely been in situations where it's been unfair. I think it's just because of how people think Black people are disposable.\n\nAs he speaks about Arbery's killing, his tone turns somber, frustrated even, when recalling the many athletes from Brunswick with whom he'd played football.\n\nWhen I first read up on the case and saw the video, it was astonishing how people can think some of those actions are justifiable, he said.\n\nUnwelcomed encounters\n\nFor Alexander Cook, the circumstances of Arbery's demise served as a reminder: Black men like him aren't always safe, even in their own neighborhoods or in their own homes.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, two months after Arbery was slain, Cook, 27, was sitting on his grandmother's porch in East Savannah when he saw police cars zipping by. They were looking for a robbery suspect they believed to be in the area.\n\nTwo Black officers stopped at Cook's grandmother's home and questioned him, claiming he fit the description of a suspect wearing khaki pants and a white shirt — identical to what Alexander had on. When they realized it wasn't him, they left. Two more officers, this time white, showed up, questioned him, and left once they realized they had the wrong person.\n\nThe third time, four white officers came and questioned him. It was enough for Alexander's aunt to drive home and bring him back a change of clothes so officers wouldn't keep questioning him.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Alexander Cook, like many young Black men, has had interactions with the police. Cook was once questioned by police while standing in front of his... Alexander Cook, like many young Black men, has had interactions with the police. Cook was once questioned by police while standing in front of his grandmother's home, because his appearance matched that of a suspect they searching for. Richard Burkhart/Savannah Morning News\n\nGood thing my aunt was on the porch because my fear is, what if I would have been out there by myself? What if I was leaving my grandma's house and they pulled up on me when I was trying to get in the car, he said. They probably would have followed me thinking I was that person not knowing who I was.\n\nThose kinds of interactions and other flashpoints – including Arbery's death and the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin in a Sanford, Fla. subdivision – triggered a changed behavior in Cook, making him acutely aware of potentially tragic consequences that can occur without provocation.\n\nSavannah man talks about life as a young Black man and the death of Ahmaud Arbery Savannah resident Alexander Cook talks about interactions with the police and the death of Ahmaud Arbery. Richard Burkhart, Savannah Morning News\n\nI can't get up real quick to walk to the store and come back, Cook said. I could get pulled over during a five-minute walk to the store.\n\nLike Arbery, Cook had the goal of going to college, but he was unable to find a job in his field, business information systems, after graduating. I couldn't get no one to hire me. I had the degree but not the experience.\n\nNow, Cook works in security for UPS, is a homeowner and helps take care of his little sister.\n\nI'm at a point in my life now where I'm thinking about (getting married). But getting into a career and putting my degree to work is the first step, he said.\n\nA story to tell\n\nBudding filmmaker Nathan DuConge, 26, is in a similar position as Cook. The University of Georgia graduate moved to Los Angeles to jumpstart his film career but when things didn't pan out, he returned home to Tucker, Georgia.\n\nWhile in Los Angeles in the summer of 2020, he participated in protests spurned by the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. He did so with Arbery fresh on his mind.\n\nI remember watching that video, and just like, between tears and anger and everything like that, it was it was extremely hard to deal with, he said of the Arbery footage.\n\nNathan Duconge lives in the Atlanta area, but participated in Black Lives Matter protests while visiting California. Porsha Antalan/Savannah Morning News\n\nDuConge knew then, as clearly as ever, that he wanted to share what his life is like as a young Black man.\n\nBy 25, I did envision myself already being a director. For pretty much my whole life, what I wanted to do is tell stories, he said, adding moving to Los Angeles gave him the confidence he needed to launch his film career in Atlanta.\n\nThe first time DuConge was pulled over by the police he was 21 years old, leaving the set of The Walking Dead in Sequoia, Georgia, where the popular AMC show was filmed. An officer pulled him over for a dim taillight. DuConge recalls being bombarded with questions unrelated to the traffic stop. It wasn't until an older white woman who worked on the set stopped and told officers that he worked with them that he was free to go.\n\nNathan DuConge For a long time, I was angry about it. I kind of tried to put that memory to the side, but it always kind of came back and crept up on me. Quote icon\n\nFor a long time, I was angry about it. I kind of tried to put that memory to the side, but it always kind of came back and crept up on me, DuConge said. But the way I'm sort of dealing with things now is striving for predominantly Black productions. Between the cast and the crew, my set is predominantly Black.\n\nHis experiences have led him to direct films about race, particularly a semi-autobiographical piece called Rancor.\n\nI feel like at this point, 'Rancor' is by far the most creative I've ever been on any project. I feel super free, and I feel like this is a story where I'm like, 'Yeah, this is exactly why I'm making movies in the first place.'\n\n'Stop killing us': Attacks on Asian Americans highlight rise in hate incidents amid COVID-19\n\n'Anything can happen anywhere'\n\nJustin Simmonds, a cartoonist living in Marietta, Georgia, has also had to grapple with racist interactions. A first-generation Black American, Simmonds is of Jamaican and British descent and spent part of his childhood in New York City before moving to the metro Atlanta area shortly after 9/11. In New York, Simmonds was used to diverse environments.\n\nIt was only after he moved that he says he truly experienced racism.\n\nEditor's Voice: Dismantling race and class discrimination are ongoing quests\n\nJustin Simmonds moved to the Atlanta area from New York and got a firsthand view of how different race played out in the south. Porsha Antalan/Savannah Morning News\n\nSimmonds remembers being on his way to a comic book convention with his friend. His friend's mother, who was white, was driving the pair when she was pulled over during a traffic stop.\n\nI remember this day vividly. She was pulled over for her tag. They checked her ID. But then they asked to check my ID. I didn't understand why or what the heck was going on. But she did, Simmonds said.\n\nShe was like, 'Well, do you want to check my son's ID' and they're like, 'No, it's OK.' So now they're running my ID and she was upset. She was livid. I was confused more so than upset, he said. I didn't understand the implications of what had just happened. I realized that it did have something to do with the color of my skin, and being in the front seat of the car, so to speak.\n\nJustin Simmonds It was a gruesome reminder that anything can happen anywhere, it doesn't matter how safe I feel, doesn't matter how comfortable I feel, or who I think I am. Some people just want to see you dead. Quote icon\n\nSince that day, Simmonds has expressed his views on race in his comics and cartoons and he's led protests in the Marietta area following the deaths of Arbery, Taylor and Floyd.\n\nI was mortified. I was truly mortified because this time, it wasn't necessarily police, it was just random people, Simmonds said of Arbery. Seeing this at the start of a lockdown was a heart-stopping reminder that it doesn't matter if it's police, it doesn't matter what accolades you received in your community, or whatever value that you think you have or contribute to society.\n\nIt was a gruesome reminder that anything can happen anywhere, it doesn't matter how safe I feel, doesn't matter how comfortable I feel, or who I think I am. Some people just want to see you dead.\n\nAhmaud's legacy\n\nSince Arbery's death, much of his immediate family has left the Brunswick area. His father, Marcus Arbery Sr., has two other who children have moved to other cities. Ahmaud's mother now lives in Augusta, Georgia. It's a cleansing that hurts his dad, who was used to a daily call from Ahmaud and his siblings.\n\nI'm just so worried because I got grandbabies. I still have nieces and nephews that stay here, he said.\n\nThe last conversation Arbery Sr. had with his son, Ahmaud, was brief.\n\nHe called me that morning, and I asked him what he was about to do. He said he was going for a jog, Marcus Arbery Sr. recalled. He said 'Pops, I love you and I'll call you later,' and he went on his jog.\n\nAhmaud Arbery with his sister Jasmine at her graduation. Special to Savannah Morning News\n\nThe 57-year-old truck driver would then make the four-hour drive to Perry, Florida, for a delivery. When he first got the call about Ahmaud, he wondered if it was a sickness or car wreck.\n\nNothing prepared him for how Ahmaud was killed: As he jogged down another part of Boykin Ridge Drive, Gregory McMichael and his son Travis McMichael armed themselves and chased Arbery down the street in their vehicles. The McMichaels and their neighbor, William Bryan, said they thought Arbery was a robbery suspect. Travis McMichael shot Arbery twice with a shotgun. Bryan Jr. filmed the incident.\n\nOfficer bodycam footage released in December of the crime scene showed officers tending to the McMichaels as Arbery lay in the street a short distance away, still fighting for his life.\n\nThe intricate details of the case were muddied at the start. Former Glynn County District Attorney Jackie Johnson recused herself from the case because Gregory McMichael previously worked as an investigator in her office.\n\nBut despite Johnson's recusal, Glynn County commissioners alleged her office advised Glynn County police not to arrest the McMichaels and Bryan. The case was later transferred to Waycross Judicial Circuit, where District Attorney George Barnhill cited Georgia's citizen arrest law to support the choice to not charge the men with a crime.\n\nThe Civil War era law allows for a citizen's arrest if a crime is committed within a citizen's immediate knowledge or there is reasonable ground of suspicion of a felony crime.\n\nWe knew racism was bad here, but not that bad, Arbery Sr. told the Savannah Morning News. It was the same sentiment shared by Ahmaud's mother, Cooper-Jones, who said the middle-class neighborhood was comprised of 60% white and 40% Black residents.\n\nThe case would be transferred to another district attorney office before the Georgia Bureau of Investigations stepped in and ruled Arbery's death a homicide. More than two months after the shooting, the McMichaels and Bryan were charged with murder and arrested May 7 and Bryan was arrested May 22. All three pleaded not guilty. No trial date has been set for the case, which has been filed in Glynn County Superior Court.\n\nArbery's death ignited calls for the repeal of Georgia's Stand Your Ground and citizen arrest laws. On Feb. 16, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp unveiled a proposed overhaul of the controversial citizen's arrest law that would repeal and rewrite it to protect residents while also providing them the right to self-defense and business owners the right to hold someone who commits a crime on their property.\n\nAhmaud Arbery SPECIAL\n\nDisheartened that it took Arbery's death to spark change, Cooper-Jones reflected on the potential repeal of the citizen's arrest law.\n\nIf they don't abolish it, they will modify the way it's written. So, that tells me his life is going to be about change, she said. It's sad that he had to lose his life for us to get change, but it's a bittersweet moment.\n\nWhile dealing with grief, Marcus remains deeply angry. He wants the McMichaels and Bryan punished.\n\nArbery's killing further exposed systemic failures within the criminal justice system and resurfaced the traumatic effects of racist, violent and biased interactions that can lead to shortened life expectancy for Black people. The fear of those kinds of encounters can influence the outlook on life for many Black men in their mid-20s.\n\nThe danger is anti-Blackness and that kind of hostility, and that violence occurs on a continuum, said Clark Atlanta University sociology and criminal justice professor Barbara Combs. That violence could be political; it could be economic. It could be social, it could certainly be physical. It could be psychological, but violence occurs on a continuum. Black bodies are subjected to that kind of violence daily.\n\nFamily struggles with personal loss: 'They don't truly know the side we know'\n\nSince October, Cooper-Jones has spent time in therapy working on being better not bitter. For her, every day is a mixed bag: Some days are better than others. Some days, I can barely get out of bed. Some days, I can really push through the day. But now, it's the month of February and I kind of rethink every day.\n\nBasically, I just try to take it day by day, hour by hour.\n\nTo honor her son, Cooper-Jones and her family will hold a public candlelight vigil 5 p.m. Tuesday at New Springfield Baptist Church in Waynesboro.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Wanda Cooper-Jones, the mother of Ahmaud Arbery who was killed in Brunswick, Ga. last February, has since become a leader in the protests for Black...

Aaron Young\n\nThe Des Moines Register\n\nAMES, Iowa - Talk about a fairy tale wedding engagement from one boyfriend in central Iowa.\n\nJoel Lynch, a 23-year-old graduate student at Iowa State University, brought his girlfriend Cara Szymanski's dreams to life last weekend when she became a princess.\n\nThe couple first met when they were members of a bridal party for a wedding. Over time, Lynch discovered that Szymanski, 24, of River Falls, Wisc., grew up admiring Belle from Beauty and the Beast. So when it came to his proposal, he wanted to bring his best friend and partner in crime's favorite scene from the movie to life.\n\nI decided to make her the dress to coincide with my proposal, Lunch said in an Imgur gallery post, which has more than 640,000 favorites since it was posted on Monday.\n\nAt first I was like, 'I'll just buy one, but then I realized it should be a labor of love, he told ABC News.\n\nBut get this: Lynch told The Huffington Post that he had no sewing experience whatsoever.\n\nHe began making the silky yellow dress with a cheap sewing machine and lots of coffee in October 2016. When the two were together in Ames, he was able to hide it in a closet or in the basement.\n\nHe spent as many as 14 hours some days working on it, according to WHO-TV, and had finished it last weekend — an hour before Szymanski arrived to visit him from Wisconsin.\n\nOn Jan. 14 — the day of the proposal — the couple wandered around the Iowa State Parks Library Periodical Room looking at books. Lynch's sister, Leah, set the gown on a dress form in a nearby room.\n\nAnd when Lynch opened the door to where the dress was standing, Szymanski burst into tears.\n\nAfter I helped her get it on, I told her to wait for the music to start, Lynch told The Huffington Post.\n\nThat's when Tale As Old As Time began to play and the two danced, surrounded in a room full of journals, magazines and scholarly articles.\n\nAs for the big moment? Lynch dropped down on one knee, and Szymanski said yes.\n\nThere's no doubt that this couple deserves a happily ever after ending following their fairy tale proposal.\n\nIt was a beautiful moment and a beautiful memory and I look forward to every moment I share with him, Szymanski told ABC News. One day, hopefully our daughter will be able to dance with Joel in the dress.
Mark Athitakis\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nPeter Ho Davies' third novel, A Lie Someone Told You About Yourself (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 240 pp., ★★★½ out of four), opens with a couple making the agonizing decision to abort a fetus that was likely to have serious medical issues if it came to term. The list of things the baby might have was four pages long, Davies writes. Single-spaced.\n\nLie, strictly speaking, isn't about abortion. The bulk of this slim, gemlike novel is about the son that the parents (all unnamed) do have, constructed from the brief scenes of joy, exasperation and fear that define parenthood. But the decision to terminate the pregnancy informs the entire novel as the parents process the feelings their choice left them with.\n\nEarly on, though, their son is enough to worry about. After struggling to breathe at birth, he has developmental issues, and Davies is an expert at showing how much attention parents apply to every movement and comment from an authority figure. The boy's preschool teacher has concerns, he writes. Later: The boy's kindergarten teacher has concerns. And then: The first time they meet with his first grade teacher, she has concerns.\n\nConcerns, Davies understands, is a grenade people lob into the lives of parents, exploding the fleeting moments they think they might be doing the right thing.\n\nMore:The books that got us through 2020: USA TODAY entertainment experts share their favorite reads\n\nMom and dad develop all sorts of ironic riffs to handle this, which both underscores their feelings and lightens the book's mood. They bemoan their toddler's Cheerio squalor and stock up on dad jokes. More directly, the father, a writer and teacher, sublimates his uncertainty by working as a volunteer at an abortion clinic, escorting patients past rows of pro-life protesters and absorbing their jibes. (Do you have kids?)\n\nMaybe the experience will provide writing fodder, he thinks, or allow him to make a karmic adjustment. But every emotion is tricky now: He will understand that he's not been at the clinic to do good, or even to gather material, so much as to find absolution. Lacking that, his supervisor at the clinic encourages him to let it go: Everyone has regrets. You know who has regrets? Parents is who.\n\nDavies' overall position is resolutely pro-choice: The lie of the title, which comes from a quotation by the writer Anais Nin, is shame. But he also wants to show how the decision to have an abortion lingers, and how the weight a father carries, while different from the mother's, is weight all the same. The novel's latter pages fall a little flat as Davies strives to reconcile this handwringing with the dad's growing child and declining father. Davies wants to avoid noisy, cliched reckonings, but Lie moved to its conclusion at almost too low a boil.\n\nThe heart of the novel, though, is a piercing depiction of a marriage under intense pressure – the fear for their child's future, the struggle for intimacy, the scorched whispers the couple argues in. Resolution is important in novels, but it can be a cheat in novels about parenting. The anxiety might alleviate, Davies knows, but it never quite goes away.\n\nBook review:There is no shortage of twists and turns in Tarryn Fisher's 'The Wrong Family'
Karen Weintraub\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nThe number of young, adult women medicated for ADHD has skyrocketed over the last decade – jumping by 344%, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe report points out that these women are of reproductive age, and that there is almost no research on the safety of medications for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder during pregnancy.\n\nThe report does not explain why the number rose so much, but experts in the field note that the public's understanding of ADHD has been transformed since the early 2000s.\n\nThe good news is that adult women are finally getting diagnosed, said Dr. Edward Hallowell, a psychiatrist who has written a half-dozen books on ADHD. I see women go from struggling and feeling so bad about themselves to – they burst into tears when they see how much better their life becomes.\n\nThe percentage of young women who filled at least one prescription for ADHD medication climbed from just under 1% of the population in 2003 to 4% in 2015, according to the report, which looked at women ages 15-44 with private insurance.\n\nRoughly 5% of the adult population is considered to have ADHD, so the increase among women suggests a rightsizing rather than over diagnosis, said Dr. Patricia Quinn, a developmental pediatrician in Washington, DC, who specializes in ADHD in women and girls.\n\nWe're kind of catching up now, Quinn said, noting that ADHD used to be diagnosed 10-times more often in men than women. Now, there's growing recognition in the field that both genders have it at nearly equal rates.\n\nThe rise in childhood diagnoses is also likely driving the spike among adult women, said Melissa Orlov, a marriage counselor who specializes in relationship issues in ADHD. As children with ADHD age into adulthood, they are taking their prescriptions with them, she said, citing her own daughter who was in fifth grade in 2001 when she was diagnosed with ADHD and is now 26 and still medicated.\n\nAlso, many women realize they have the condition after their child is diagnosed with it. That seems to be the most common way that adults figure out they have it, she said.\n\nOrlov said it took more than eight years after her daughter's diagnosis to realize that another family member had the condition, too. Now, doctors generally alert parents that ADHD is inherited.\n\nThe study found that almost all the growth in prescriptions came from women taking stimulant medications, which are considered the most effective drug treatment for ADHD.\n\nBut there are only a handful of studies, some contradictory, about the safety of these stimulant drugs during pregnancy.\n\nOne large study, published in December, found that babies born to women who used methylphenidate, a type of stimulant medication, during pregnancy, had a slightly increased risk of heart malformations. The study found no association between amphetamines, such as Adderall, and heart malformations. An earlier study had found no connection between methylphenidate and major malformations.\n\nOther research has found a potential link between ADHD medications and a lower Apgar score – a measure of health – at birth.\n\nHalf of all pregnancies are unplanned, so women with ADHD may be taking their medications for weeks or even months before they realize they are pregnant, according to the CDC study, which called for more research into the safety of these drugs during pregnancy.\n\nMany doctors – including Hallowell – advise their patients with ADHD to stop using the medications during or when they're planning a pregnancy, because the risks are so little understood.\n\nCraig Surman, a psychiatrist and associate professor at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, said he usually errs on the side of caution, and talks his patients out of medication during pregnancy.\n\nMost people say, 'it's harder than being on medication but I'm glad I did it that way,' he said, adding that he doesn't want them to regret their decision in 20 years when more will likely be known about the drugs' effects on the fetus.\n\nBut some women are emotionally erratic and struggle to function without their medication, he said, potentially endangering their child. In those cases, the immediate risk to both mother and child outweighs the long-term, hypothetical dangers from medication, said Surman. He co-chairs a professional advisory board for Children and Adults with ADD, a research and advocacy group, and has received consultation fees from a number of pharmaceutical companies.\n\nQuinn said doctors who prescribe ADHD medication should warn young women about the risks during pregnancy, and women with ADHD should talk with their prescribing doctors if they're thinking about getting pregnant.\n\nADHD can look different in women than in men. While most people associate the condition with people who can't sit still, women with ADHD are often underachieving daydreamers, quietly lost rather than making trouble like many boys with the condition, Quinn said.\n\nPrior to the early 2000s, these women were usually diagnosed with depression or anxiety. Correctly identifying them as having ADHD and getting them the right treatment has helped many women, said Hallowell, who has treated the condition for 30 years and has it himself.\n\nI know first-hand how amazingly helpful diagnosis and treatment can be…in women particularly, he said.\n\nMedication does not work for everyone, Hallowell noted, and anyone with ADHD needs more than just pills to function at their best. Medication should never be the entire treatment. Every treatment plan should include education about ADHD, coaching to learn new habits and organizational skills, a healthy diet, adequate sleep and exercise, positive social interactions, and meditation or mindfulness, he said.
Maeve McDermott\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLet's be clear: Jennifer Aniston doesn't want, or need, your pity.\n\nWhen the story broke Thursday that Aniston and Justin Theroux are separating after six years together, the dismaying reactions to the news included fans petitioning for a reunion with her ex, Brad Pitt, and headlines musing about how she just can't keep a man around.\n\nThis needs to stop.\n\nIt's been more than a decade since Aniston became Poor Jen in the public eye, the image of a scorned wife after Pitt split for Angelina Jolie. Aniston was often seen on magazine covers with Dumped! splashed across her face. Then, over the next decade, the media narrative shifted to portray the then-single Aniston as a different kind of so-called victim: a childless woman in her 30s, with tabloid covers speculating about her fertility and smearing her as pregnant and alone, with anonymous sources falsely claiming she was expecting.\n\nYet, in the many years since her split with Pitt, the actress' life has turned out just fine, as she continues to act and maintains her status as one of Hollywood's wealthiest women. So why do we continue to paint her as a victim, or fan-cast her life as if she's a character in a rom-com?\n\nThe Poor Jen trope has already returned this time around, with anonymous sources claiming that Aniston's reclusiveness caused the split and that Theroux was just too hipster for her, with headlines asking Why can't Jennifer Aniston keep a man? and claiming Theroux partied like a single man while Jen stayed at home. It's not hard to see a toxic narrative forming around this breakup, about the hot younger actor (he's 46) leaving the brittle older woman (she just turned 49) for greener pastures. With the ex-couple both fair game for the tabloids as newly single stars, it's disheartening to imagine the potential headlines that will accompany Theroux seeing someone new.\n\nMore:Jennifer Aniston, husband Justin Theroux announce separation\n\nAs gross as the media's dragging of Aniston was in 2005, it's even more distasteful now, in the middle of a news cycle dominated by stories about women fighting back against objectification in Hollywood. Two years before Me Too and Time's Up became red carpet talking points, Aniston wrote her own Fed Up manifesto for the Huffington Post, calling time's up on the sexist and ageist treatment she's seen over the years.\n\nFor the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I'm fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of 'journalism,' the 'First Amendment' and 'celebrity news,'  she wrote, before launching into some particularly astute media criticism.\n\nIf I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues, she wrote. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing. The way I am portrayed by the media is simply a reflection of how we see and portray women in general, measured against some warped standard of beauty.\n\n\n\nAniston's words echo the messages we've heard time and again on this season's red carpets — that society's mothers and daughters are people to be respected, not objects to be ogled. In her essay's final few lines, Aniston takes a cynical view of the tabloids, writing that she doesn't believe the women-hating media coverage will ever change. What can change is our awareness and reaction to the toxic messages buried within these seemingly harmless stories served up as truth and shaping our ideas of who we are, she writes, and maybe some day the tabloids will be forced to see the world through a different, more humanized lens because consumers have just stopped buying the (expletive).\n\nNow, with the news of her split with Theroux reverberating around the tabloidsphere, it's time to see whether her assessment is correct. In a Time's Up-focused climate in which women's empowerment is more in vogue than during the Brangelina days of 2005, the Jennifer Aniston pity party seems to already be making its return to the headlines, just as she predicted it would. What remains to be seen is whether consumers will treat Aniston like a product, or, as she's begged us, like a person.
Bill Keveney\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nOne generation is company. Three generations is Crowded.\n\nThat's the essence of NBC's new family sitcom, which gets a two-episode preview Tuesday (10 p.m. ET/PT).\n\nIn Crowded, Mike (Patrick Warburton, Rules of Engagement) and Martina (Carrie Preston, True Blood) are enjoying empty-nest life, complete with assignations around the house. Their escapades are abbreviated, however, as grown daughters Shea (Miranda Cosgrove, iCarly) and Stella (Mia Serafino, Shameless) move back home, leading Mike's father, Bob (Stacy Keach, Truth), and his wife, Alice (Carlease Burke, Switched at Birth), to decide against moving away to Florida.\n\nIt's a great portrayal of a marriage, and it's a positive one, says Preston, a standout as a quirky lawyer on The Good Wife. Mike and Martina like to have (their daughters) around, but we hope that they'll become adults and maybe find their own way and their own life. I think a lot of people nowadays are dealing with the boomerang generation. They've raised their kids to love being in the family, so they don't want to go. What do you do then?\n\nCrowded, which moves to its regular Sunday slot (9:30 p.m. ET/PT) on March 20, comes in one of TV's most recognizable styles, the multi-camera format filmed in front of a studio audience, but it doesn't dwell in the past, she says.\n\nIt's a very traditional sitcom, but it does have a contemporary bent to it, Preston says. Our daughters are openly sexually active. In the pilot, (Mike and Martina) are smoking a joint. Stuff like that nowadays is something a television audience can accept, but maybe a decade ago it wouldn't have been allowed.\n\nSpring TV preview: 6 new shows worth watching\n\nThe deep-voiced Warburton, remembered as Seinfeld's Puddy, finds Mike and his interactions with different characters appealing. His bar-owner father is more traditional, while his daughters are poles apart in personality. Shea is the brainy nerd, Stella is the popular rebel and each could use the other's expertise in negotiating adulthood.\n\nReview: 'Crowded' is packed with enough fun\n\nIn past roles, at least in the realm of sitcoms, I've never had an opportunity to play a character with much depth, Warburton says. Mike is a father who has a relationship with his father, his wife, his daughters. It was an opportunity to stretch, to be a little more well-rounded.\n\nCrowded features estimable talent behind the scenes. Suzanne Martin (Hot in Cleveland, Frasier) created the series and serves as an executive producer with Will & Grace's Sean Hayes and legendary director James Burrows. The finale of Crowded's 13-episode season was the 1,000th episode of TV directed by Burrows.\n\n'Friends,' 'Cheers' stars mark director Burrows' milestone\n\nKeach, a Burrows classmate at Yale Drama School, praises the director, who was honored with a recent NBC special for his work on such classic comedies as Taxi, Will & Grace, Cheers and Friends. Bob's bar in Crowded might remind viewers of Cheers' iconic watering hole.\n\nBurrows has an understanding, not only of actors and character and script, but he also knows how to use the camera, Keach says. He's hoping the director has another successful sitcom to add to his list: He's got the Midas touch.
Grant Suneson\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story misstated from whom Martha Washington inherited a substantial amount of property.\n\nWhile the presidency of the United States is a prestigious job, it does not pay as well as one might think.\n\nThe annual presidential salary is $400,000. While this is still within the top 1 percent of American earners, it is very little when compared to the typical compensation given to America's CEOs and executives.\n\nHowever, many men who have occupied the highest office in the land did not need any salary at all. The presidency has long been a position held by men who had already inherited fortunes or earned them during their lifetimes.\n\nIn America's early days, only property-owning white men were allowed to vote. Consequently, only the wealthy first participated in American politics, meaning the first presidents were all extremely well off.\n\nStart the day smarter:Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nWith time, voting restrictions loosened, campaign finance regulations tightened, and people with more modest backgrounds began to rise to the presidency. Several U.S. presidents were either poor or in debt when they were elected president.\n\nHowever, even as all these things have changed, the fact remains that the majority of presidents are independently wealthy and only a very small number could have been fairly called poor at any point in their lifetimes.\n\nFame and wealth continue to have an outsized impact on public perception. Wealth and the influence that can accompany it have not lost relevancy. President Donald Trump was able to use his personal wealth to fund the majority of his successful political campaign.\n\n24/7 Wall St. examined the finances of every American president, from George Washington to Donald Trump. For the purposes of comparison, we provided net worth figures for each president in current dollars. Because a number of presidents, particularly in the early 19th century, made and lost huge fortunes in a matter of a few years, we only provided each president's net worth at their peak.\n\nGeorge Washington\n\n• Term: 1789-1797 (1st president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $587.0 million\n\nHis Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, consisted of five separate farms on 8,000 acres of prime farmland, run by over 300 slaves. His wife, Martha Washington, inherited a substantial amount of property from her first husband. Washington made significantly more than subsequent presidents: his salary was two percent of the total U.S. budget in 1789.\n\nJohn Adams\n\n• Term: 1797-1801 (2nd president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $21.3 million\n\nAdams received a modest inheritance from his father. His wife, Abigail Adams, was a member of the Quincys, a prestigious Massachusetts family. Adams owned a handsome estate in Quincy, Massachusetts. The estate, known as Peacefield, covered approximately 40 acres. He also had a thriving law practice.\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\n• Term: 1801-1809 (3rd president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $236.8 million\n\nJefferson was left 3,000 acres and several dozen slaves by his father. Monticello, his home on a 5,000 acre plantation in Virginia, was one of the architectural wonders of its time. He made significant money in various political positions before becoming president, but was left mired in debt towards the end of his life.\n\nJames Madison\n\n• Term: 1809-1817 (4th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $113.3 million\n\nMadison was the largest landowner in Orange County, Virginia, with land holding consisting of 5,000 acres and the Montpelier estate. He made significant money as secretary of state and president. Madison lost money at the end of his life due to the steady financial collapse of his plantation.\n\nJames Monroe\n\n• Term: 1817-1825 (5th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $30.4 million\n\nMonroe's wife, Elizabeth, was the daughter of wealthy British officer. He made significant money during eight years as president, but entered retirement severely in debt and was forced to sell his Highland plantation, which included 3,500 acres.\n\nJohn Quincy Adams\n\n• Term: 1825-1829 (6th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $23.3 million\n\nAdams inherited most of his father's land. His father, President John Adams, owned a 40 acre estate known as Peacefield. His wife was the daughter of a wealthy merchant. He devoted most of his adult life to public service, notably after leaving office.\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\n• Term: 1829-1837 (7th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $132.6 million\n\nWhile he was considered to be in touch with the average middle class American, Jackson quietly became one of the wealthiest presidents of the 1800's. Old Hickory married into wealth and made money in the military. His homestead The Hermitage included 1,050 acres of prime real estate. Over the course of his life, he owned as many as 300 slaves.\n\nMartin Van Buren\n\n• Term: 1837-1841 (8th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $29.3 million\n\nVan Buren made substantial income as an attorney. He was one of only two men to serve as secretary of state, vice president, and president. He owned the 225-acre Lindenwald estate in upstate New York.\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison\n\n• Term: 1841 (9th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $6.1 million\n\nHarrison married into money – his wife's father was a prominent judge and landowner. When Harrison's mother died, he inherited 3,000 acres near Charles City, Virginia, which he later sold to his brother. He also owned Grouseland mansion and property, in Vincennes, Indiana. Despite his assets, Harrison died penniless, causing Congress to create a special pension for his widow.\n\nJohn Tyler\n\n• Term: 1841-1845 (10th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $57.7 million\n\nTyler inherited a 1,000-acre tobacco plantation. His first wife, Letitia, was wealthy. Tyler bought Sherwood Manor, a 1,600 acre estate, previously owned by William Henry Harrison. He became indebted during the Civil War and died poor.\n\nJames Knox Polk\n\n• Term: 1845-1849 (11th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $11.1 million\n\nLike his wife, Sarah Childress, Polk's father was a wealthy plantation owner and speculator. Polk made significant sums as speaker of the house and governor of Tennessee, and owned 920 acres in Coffeeville, Mississippi, as well as 25 slaves.\n\nZachary Taylor\n\n• Term: 1849-1850 (12th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $7.1 million\n\nTaylor inherited significant amounts of land from his family, which at one point included property in Mississippi, Kentucky, and Louisiana. He made substantial money in land speculation, the leasing of warehouses, and investments in bank and utility stocks. Taylor owned a sizeable plantation in Mississippi and a home in Baton Rouge.\n\nMillard Fillmore\n\n• Term: 1850-1853 (13th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $4 million\n\nNeither Fillmore nor his wife had significant inheritance. He founded a college that is the current State University of New York at Buffalo, and his primary holding was a house in nearby East Aurora, New York.\n\nFranklin Pierce\n\n• Term: 1853-1857 (14th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $2.0 million\n\nPierce's father was frontier farmer, and his wife was a well-to-do aristocrat. He served as attorney for 16 years and held property in Concord, New Hampshire.\n\nJames Buchanan\n\n• Term: 1857-1861 (15th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): < $1 million\n\nBorn in a log cabin in Pennsylvania, Buchanan was one of 11 children. He was the only president never to marry. He worked for nine years as attorney, and spent 16 years in public office, including four years as secretary of state.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\n• Term: 1861-1865 (16th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): < $1 million\n\nBorn in a log cabin, Lincoln served as an attorney for 17 years before his presidency.

He lost his entire fortune when he was swindled by an investing partner. Grant owned a modest home in Galena, Illinois. Although he died with little money, his autobiography, published posthumously, kept his family afloat.\n\nRutherford Birchard Hayes\n\n• Term: 1877-1881 (19th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $3 million\n\nHayes' father was a shopkeeper.

Carter improved his finances by writing books. He and his wife have published more than 25 books and now own 2,500 acres of land in Georgia.\n\nRonald Wilson Reagan\n\n• Term: 1981-1989 (40th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $14.2 million\n\nReagan had no inheritance, but made money as a movie and television actor for over two decades.

Bush, as part of the wealthy and powerful Bush family, has always been financially well off.

He made millions in the oil industry and even owned the professional baseball team Texas Rangers at one point. Bush has made tens of millions of dollars in speaking fees and a book deal since leaving office.\n\nBarack Hussein Obama\n\n• Term: 2008-2017 (44th president)\n\n• Peak net worth (in current dollars): $40 million\n\nIt's difficult to know exactly how much wealth Barack Obama actually has this soon after he left office, but he is certainly well off. Obama and his wife, Michelle, reportedly signed a $65 million deal for the rights to their memoir, but it is unclear how much of that money they have received, if any. Former presidents often make six figures for paid speeches, and since Obama is known as a great orator, many organizations are likely be lining up for his services. While Obama's net worth is somewhat unclear, it will certainly continue to climb. American University estimates the Obamas could earn up to $242 million in the coming years.\n\nDonald John Trump\n\n• Term: 2017- (45th president)\n\n• Peak net worth: $3.1 billion\n\nAmerica's current president is also the wealthiest by far. Donald Trump took over his father's real estate company and turned it into a massive success. Through his company, Trump owns billions of dollars worth of real estate and golf courses in the United States and abroad.\n\nDetailed findings\n\nWealth is no longer a de facto prerequisite for the presidency, but thanks to the lucrative opportunities afforded to those with the title ex-president, wealth for those who have finished their term may be a guarantee.\n\nSeveral presidents went into debt after their time in office, but that may never happen again. Recent presidents have received multi-million dollar offers for the rights to their memoirs about life in the Oval Office. Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, reportedly inked a deal worth over $60 million for the rights to their book.\n\nNet worth is always difficult to calculate, especially when comparing figures across four different centuries. In the early days of America, land ownership had significant social and political value, meaning those with the most land typically also had the most wealth.\n\nU.S. presidents have been anywhere from some of the wealthiest people in the country to being quite poor. Their wealth, however, does not seem to have an impact on the quality of their presidency. George Washington would have hundreds of millions of dollars in today's money. Abraham Lincoln never had much money and spent much of his life doing odd jobs before getting into politics. Both are regarded as great leaders and influential figures in American history.\n\n24/7 Wall St. analyzed the finances of U.S. presidents based on historical sources. The figures are adjusted for inflation to December 2017 levels, the most recent level available. We have accounted for hard assets such as real estate, estimated lifetime savings based on work history and inheritance. We also considered annual salaries, incomes earned from royalties on books, ownership of companies, yields from family estates, and other forms of income.\n\nFor deceased presidents, the ranking is based on peak net worth, or how much a president's combined assets were worth at the time in their life when they were the richest. Many presidents became impoverished or even went into debt after their time in office. For living presidents, the estimate is based on current figures.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

It seems even princesses can get cold feet.\n\nJapanese Princess Mako, the oldest grandchild of Emperor Akihito, has postponed her marriage to a commoner until 2020 instead of this year, Japanese media reported.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency issued a statement saying the delay in the wedding planned for November came when the princess recognized the lack of time to make sufficient preparations, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.\n\nIt is because of our immaturity and we just regret it, the palace statement added.\n\nMako and college classmate Kei Komuro announced their engagement in September to massive media and public attention.\n\nThe move means the wedding will take place after Emperor Akihito abdicates in April 2019, with Crown Prince Naruhito, Mako's uncle, succeeding the Chrysanthemum throne the next day.\n\nAccording to the Nikkei Asian Review, the princess and Komuro, both 26, were supposed to be formally engaged in a traditional court ceremony called Nosai no Gi on March 4, ahead of their Nov. 4 wedding.\n\nBefore his introduction as the royal fiancé, Komuro was better known as the Prince of the Sea, after appearing in a beach tourism campaign, CNN reported.\n\nThe Imperial Household Agency denied any link between the postponement and recent media reports of a financial dispute involving Komuro's mother and her former fiancé.\n\nIt is not because there were weekly magazine reports, an agency official told the Nikkei Asian Review.\n\nMore:Japan's Emperor Akihito to abdicate in April 2019\n\nMore:Royal wedding: Princess Eugenie, boyfriend Jack Brooksbank set ceremony date\n\nMore:Meghan Markle takes podium for first-ever royal speech\n\nMore:Princess Eugenie's engagement means another royal wedding!\n\nMako, who said that We believe we have rushed various things, added that her grandfather had approved the postponement. According to the BBC, the princess will lose her title after marrying Komuro.\n\nI wish to think about marriage more deeply and concretely and give sufficient time to prepare our marriage and for after the marriage, she said. We feel extremely sorry for causing great trouble and further burden to those who have willingly supported us.

Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nAnother week, another celebrity divorce involving legal jousting over — no, not the bank accounts, the houses or the luxury toys — but the custody of minor children. This week Scarlett Johansson and her French estranged husband have taken the path recently trod by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, and Robin Thicke and Paula Patton.\n\nThe two-year marriage of Johansson, 32, and Romain Dauriac, 34, is over but what happens next in their struggle over who gets custody of 2-year-old daughter Rose? Will they be able to work out a settlement in which they share custody, the usual ideal? Will she be able to take the child wherever she goes in her film-making career? Or will Dauriac be able to take the child back to his native Paris?\n\nLet the legal unpleasantness commence:\n\nWhat's happened so far: The two legal teams were negotiating a settlement behind closed doors, according to Dauriac's lawyer, Hal Mayerson. Then the famously private Johansson and her lawyer Judy Poller surprised them by filing divorce papers on Tuesday using the couple's real names, despite rules in New York family law court allowing use of anonymous captions, or fake names, for famous folk who want to avoid the attentions of Page Six and tabloid titters.\n\nJohansson then issued a statement on Wednesday declaring she would not be commenting and demanding privacy. Dauriac issued his own statement deploring that Johansson had made the matter public, and asking that she withdraw her divorce action and return to the negotiating table.\n\nWhat happens next: Divorce lawyers in New York and elsewhere scoff at the idea that Johansson would withdraw her divorce action. She won't go back to the negotiating table, says prominent New York divorce lawyer Lois Liberman, because she wants a New York court to decide the matter and not one in France.\n\nUnder the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act, the court of jurisdiction is wherever the child has resided for the previous six months. So I'm guessing she can claim she lives in New York and the child lives in New York and just hit the six-months deadline, Liberman says. That's why she filed to assert that claim, because she doesn't want to go to France where she would have to fight.\n\nShe will probably win this round, says Nancy Berg, a Minneapolis divorce lawyer and president of the International Academy of Family Lawyers. Dad does not really have strong case to prevent a New York court from deciding (the matter), Berg says.\n\nWhat if Dauriac files to have the case decided in Paris? Then there would be a bi-national jurisdiction conflict to be resolved, decided based on the six-months rule. But so far Dauriac hasn't filed elsewhere. Mayerson says his client wants to remain in New York as long as he and his ex share physical custody equally.\n\nCase remains in New York; next move: The case is assigned to a New York family judge who then has to confirm his jurisdiction, again based on the six-months rule.\n\nThen the judge could appoint someone to help evaluate the child. In all New York custody disputes, a psychiatrist or psychologist is appointed to do a forensic evaluation of what is in the best interests of the child, to help the judge decide who gets primary custody and where they would live, says Mayerson.\n\nBut celebs are different, says Berg, and not just because Johansson owns multiple homes around the world. Often, celebrities don't have what we traditionally know as a 'residence' even though the law assumes they do, Berg says. It would have to be a fact-intensive inquiry into where people intended to live and where they actually live.\n\nIs the child too young to be properly evaluated? It's possible, says Berg. That process (of evaluation) doesn't work very well when the child is so young, she says. The evaluator is looking to see if the disruption (of divorce) will have an adverse effect on children who need consistency, and many celebrity kids are being raised by nannies anyway.\n\nThere's also evidence that very young children who are away from their primary attachment figure for as little as a week start to forget. Is she too young to be away from her attachment figure and is it the dad or the mom or both? Berg says.\n\nHow might changes in family law affect this case? In the old days, says Los Angeles divorce lawyer Peter Walzer, who represented Katie Holmes in her 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, the law made it near automatic that mom always got primary custody and dad got lost. No more.\n\nAlso, he says there is a doctrine of tender years that suggests the best visitation schedule for a young child is to see the non-custodial parent every other day and later every two or three days. It's not practical to have a week in Paris and a week in New York, Walzer says. They're going to have to be flexible to take care of this child.\n\nAs a comparison, there is the long and bitter custody battle between Oscar-winner Halle Berry and Gabriel Aubry, the Canadian-born father of their now 9-year-old daughter. After they split up, Berry wanted to move from Los Angeles, where they lived, to France; in 2012 a Los Angeles judge nixed that because Aubry objected it would interfere with their shared custody arrangement.\n\nIf Dauriac won custody could he move back to Paris with her? Dad would have a tough time (doing that), Berg says. In the old days, the custodial parent could go where she wanted and the non-custodial parent would not have any say. Now, parents aren't allowed to move because that would remove regular access to the child from the other parent, and that becomes effectively dead to the child.\n\nSo the preference now is equal shared custody and equal access to both parents, Berg says. That means that both parents have a say in where the other parent goes and where the child goes and for how long.\n\nThese people would be very smart to negotiate this because both stand to lose a lot of freedom of decision making no matter what is decided, Berg says. That's why 99% of all family-law cases are settled.
MINNEAPOLIS – Not many people own a Super Bowl ring, and fewer still possess a World Cup winners' medal, but if the Philadelphia Eagles emerge victorious on Sunday, there will be one of each in the same household.\n\nEagles tight end Zach Ertz is trying to match his wife, Julie Ertz (nee Johnston), in the sporting hardware stakes by helping Philly to an upset over the New England Patriots. If that happens, the couple will have some serious bragging rights as perhaps American sports' most successful married duo.\n\nI feel like I am lagging behind, Zach Ertz told USA TODAY Sports. She (won the World Cup) a couple of years ago, and we just love doing what we do. Obviously, we are in a short season of our life just playing at this level -- eventually we will settle down and have to stop playing the sports -- but I am so proud of her.\n\nThe pair met during college, when Ertz was a football player at Stanford and Julie was playing soccer at Santa Clara. Ertz journeyed to Canada to watch Julie in the Women's World Cup in 2015, and they married in 2016.\n\nDuring the World Cup, Ertz cheered the team on as Julie starred on defense and the Americans cruised to the title.\n\nIt was a lot of fun, Ertz said. I had the Johnston name on the jersey. I just wanted go there and support her. It was a very unique time, so I hope she gets to do the same.\n\nMORE:Eagles stars Malcolm Jenkins, Chris Long making even larger impact off football field\n\nMORE:Eagles' Torrey Smith looks forward to Super Bowl near his second hometown\n\nDuring the NFC Championship Game in Philadelphia, Julie was playing for the U.S. in a 5-1 victory over Denmark in San Diego. After the match, she asked team officials what had happened and received the happy news that the Eagles had rolled past the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nI shook the other team's hands really, really fast and was looking around, she told The Philadelphia Inquirer. I had to hear it from at least three people just to make sure it was true and real, and I had some pretty raw emotion.\n\nErtz said Julie's obsession with stretching and yoga encouraged him find more flexibility and devote more time to his health. Her health-inspired cooking has also helped him remain in optimum shape, and it seems to be working.\n\nHe has not only been highly productive -- 824 receiving yards and eight touchdowns during the regular season -- but his popularity appears to be growing. Ertz's jersey was in the top 10 for sales across the NFL last week.\n\nErtz broke down in the Eagles' locker room when he watched video of Julie's reaction to the team reaching the Super Bowl. Next time he takes the field, she won't have to look on from afar.\n\nIt was tough not having her here, obviously, he said. There was the confetti going on, the other players had got their wives there. Hopefully, we will experience the same thing at the Super Bowl. She is definitely coming to the Super Bowl.\n\nShe has definitely helped with my development. She is always there for me off the field through the highs and lows, and that is all you can ask from someone that you love. I hope I do the same for her; we definitely motivate each other, but our marriage wasn't based off athletic success.\n\nPHOTOS: Best shots from 2018 Pro Bowl
WASHINGTON – Less than a week into her campaign for president, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard issued a lengthy apology for her past comments and actions against the LGBTQ community.\n\nSince Gabbard, a 37-year-old Iraq veteran, announced on CNN last Friday she was joining what's expected to be a crowded Democratic field for president in 2020, her past comments and actions have been under a microscope, including her work for an anti-gay organization and remarks calling LGBTQ activists homosexual extremists.\n\nIn my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to the people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones, Gabbard said.\n\nShe added that her views had changed significantly since that time and credited that to her time overseas in Iraq. She explained that she grew up in a conservative household and was raised to believe that marriage was between a man and woman. But, over the years, Gabbard said she formed her own opinions.\n\nI know that LGBTQ people still struggle. They're still facing discrimination, still facing abuse and still fear that hard-won rights are going to be taken away by people who hold views like I used to, she said. That cannot happen.\n\nGabbard previously apologized for her remarks on LGBTQ equality when she ran for Congress in 2012 but given her presidential aspirations, new revelations from her past surfaced, leading to a four-minute video apology Gabbard posted on her Twitter page.\n\nMore:Democrat Tulsi Gabbard announces 2020 run for president to take on Trump\n\nIn a story about her past, mostly in the early 2000s, CNN reported that Gabbard advocated that as Democrats, we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists, she said in 2004 while serving as a Hawaii state legislator.\n\nGabbard also did work for an anti-gay organization that considered homosexuality unhealthy, abnormal behavior that should not be promoted or accepted in society, according to CNN.\n\nThe news report noted the organization, the Alliance for Traditional Marriage, promoted conversation therapy, which aims to alter a person's sexual identity through therapy by treating it as a mental illness. The practice is banned in 15 states, including Hawaii.\n\nCNN reported that Gabbard was quoted in a news release from 2000 about LGBTQ activists who protested against her mother, Carol Gabbard, running for the state's Board of Education.\n\nThis war of deception and hatred against my mom is being waged by homosexual activists because they know, that if elected, she will not allow them to force their values down the throats of the children in our schools, Tulsi Gabbard was quoted as saying.\n\nCNN's report also delved into her father's work as one of the state's leading advocates against same-sex marriage\n\nSince the early 2000s, Gabbard's views on the LGBTQ community have changed. She's backed pro-gay legislation and was given a 100 by the Human Rights Campaign. Gabbard also serves on the Congressional LGBT Caucus.
The ex-wife of ousted White House staff secretary Robert Porter described their marriage as very strongly verbally and emotionally abusive but denied Friday that she is part of a coordinated smear campaign against her ex-husband.\n\nJennifer Willoughby, speaking to the Today show's Savannah Guthrie, said she hopes the blow to Porter's career and reputation will turn him around. She said it has been cathartic to discuss the emotional toll of her four-year marriage to Porter, for which she had largely blamed herself.\n\nShe said there were a lot of attacks on my character and my intelligence. Things that I felt to be true about myself were systematically and repeatedly attacked.\n\nShe recalled an incident in which Porter allegedly followed her to the bathroom during a prolonged fight, grabbed her by the shoulders and dragged her out of the shower to continue the rage.\n\nIn a second incident, she said, Porter punched a hole in the front door, prompting her to call police and get a temporary restraining order.\n\nPorter, 40, who coordinated the flow of documents to President Trump in the Oval Office, had been under fire since Willoughby and Colbie Holderness, another of Porter's ex-wives, publicly shared their stories of domestic abuse.\n\nThey described the marriages to the FBI last year as part of a background check for his job.\n\nA photo showed Holderness with a black eye, allegedly after an incident with Porter.\n\nIn his resignation statement, Porter said, These outrageous allegations are simply false.\n\nPorter acknowledged taking 15-year-old photos of Holderness with a black eye, but the reality behind them is nowhere close to what is being described. He did not elaborate.\n\nPorter operated with an interim security clearance at the time of his resignation Wednesday. According to White House deputy spokesman Raj Shah, the investigation into his background had not been completed, although he had been in the job for more than a year.\n\nIn her interview with Today, Willoughby rejected Porter's claim that her public statements about him were part of a smear campaign.\n\nThere was no coordination of this, she said. This is unexpected that I would have to be speaking about this and mentioning his name, and describing the details of my marriage is nothing that I wanted, and I have only recently been in contact with Colbie (Holderness) to discuss it at all.\n\nWilloughby said she, like Holderness, met with the FBI before her husband took the job last year and told them all the things that she has since discussed publicly.\n\nWilloughby said Porter called her before the FBI interview last year to find out what she planned to tell them. I told him I'm going to tell them the truth, she said.\n\nShe told Today that she was especially shaken by the front-door punching incident that prompted her to take out the temporary restraining order.\n\nThe police officers sort of pointed out that if he is able to do that, even though I didn't expect it, I really didn't know what else he was capable of, she said.\n\nWilloughby said she hopes that in the wake of losing his reputation and career and the things he values most that he will be able to go inside and find the things that actually do matter most about him.\n\nShe emphasized that she had not wanted Porter to lose his job over the scandal.\n\nI liked that he was in that administration, but this is a consequence of his actions, Willoughby said.
More than a decade ago, Joe Sielski and a few of his fellow gay friends were at a Wilmington, Delaware, bar together when they heard a comment from another bar-goer: I guess this is a gay bar now.\n\nIt was just one person in all of her bitterness, but it felt like the city was acting like we were not allowed to be there or needed to ask permission, Sielski says of his Trolley Square experience that night.\n\nIt wasn't too long before Sielski and friend Tony Catka co-founded Our Night Out Wilmington, a city-based LGBTQ social group, which just might be the most successful city social group you've never heard about.\n\nThe monthly gatherings have been a social lifeline for hundreds of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer Delawareans for 10 years, held at a different city bar each month until the pandemic hit in March, reports the Delaware News Journal, which is a part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nThe idea behind the group, which was formed three years before same-sex marriage was legalized in Delaware, wasn't just to gather, but to gather publicly en masse in a public space to help normalize something that startled at least that one bar-goer years ago.\n\nWe would be crowd storming typical establishments, remembers Wilmington's Joe Johnson, who has been attending the events since the beginning.\n\nA flash mob ... with reservations\n\nThink of it as a well-organized flash mob — one that calls, makes reservations first and can sometimes rack up one hell of a bar bill. That's especially true on its biggest nights, like the time they drew about 250 people to the former FireStone Roasting House, now Docklands Riverfront.\n\nIt's become quite the success story — a success story that couldn't be properly celebrated when its milestone anniversary came and went a few weeks back.\n\nBut Sielski says Our Night Out Wilmington will be back once it's safe. And its nearly 2,000 followers, which include several married couples and partnerships that have grown out of the group, will surely be there for it.\n\nUntil then, the legacy of the group lives on through the long-term friendships it has fostered, relationships that are helping some LGBTQ Delawareans weather the forced isolation of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEveryone needs a little extra support these days, Johnson says.\n\nSielski formed the group in late 2010 with former co-host Catka, who has since moved to Florida. Close attention was paid to making everyone feel comfortable.\n\nNew people are greeted at the door and introduced to other more established members. Keep in mind, some first-timers have just come out as gay, making this the first time they have openly ventured out to meet people like themselves.\n\nLGBTA Delawareans remember Stonewall:How it changed their lives\n\nFor Sielski, it's all about showing that everyone there is part of a bigger community — even among those who have never met. After all, being part of a minority group in the second-smallest state in the union has a way of tightening connections within social circles.\n\nWe didn't think it was only the responsibility of gay bars alone to hold up the community's social life on their shoulders, Sielski says.\n\nIn the bars\n\nDrew Davis, manager of Kid Shelleen's Charcoal House & Saloon, has set up several Our Night Out Wilmington events with organizers over the years.\n\nNot only do they hold their events at the bar from time to time, but some group members also now count themselves as regulars. Davis and some staff have become regulars of sorts as well, going to funerals when a member's spouse died or attending the group's vigil for Orlando nightclub shooting victims in 2016.\n\nDavis remembers one Our Night Out Wilmington night in particular, one that came early in the group's existence.\n\nAt the time, more people were showing up each month. Organizers were suddenly faced with not only 150 people, but also a double-booked venue that had to turn them away.\n\nI got a nervous call saying, 'I hate to ask you if you can host 150 people in 15 minutes, but can you host 150 people in 15 minutes? remembers Davis, who jumped into action to make it happen. There was a lot of appreciation going around that night. It was my favorite night in 20 years in the business.\n\nDavis, who has worked in Trolley Square-area bars since the '90s, says he can imagine the interesting reactions that Our Night Out Wilmington would have received back then. It was a different time, he says, noting how attitudes have largely changed.\n\nNot only do the meet-ups help the LGBTQ community connect, but the businesses get a boost from the large Thursday evening gatherings, which usually run from 6 to 9 p.m.\n\nAfter the events, which have drawn 180 to 200 people some nights at Kid Shelleen's, many attendees stick around for dinner and usually return on non-group nights with friends and family.\n\nI hadn't been cognizant of it, but a couple of people came up to me the first time we hosted and told me they were a little worried to come to Kid Shelleen's, Davis says. Maybe because it was a sports bar and a certain perception that probably came from experiences elsewhere. That's changed now.\n\n'You realize you're all part of the same family'\n\nSielski says the group found success pretty quickly. Sure, the first events had only a few people. But soon, they were growing by 10 to 15 people each month, hosting crowds of 100 or more by the end of 2011.\n\nThe group's early success came in part due to the age difference between Sielski and Catka. In many gay bars, younger and older groups tend to stay separate, Sielski points out. But with each drawing from their groups of friends and contacts, Our Night Out Wilmington was instantly multi-generational.\n\nCool:Wilmington transgender teen releases first book, 'My Rainbow,' with Penguin Books\n\nYou realize you're all part of the same family, even if you've never met, Sielski says.\n\nHe still remembers being in awe the first few times people showed up that weren't friends or acquaintances of any of the organizers. All of sudden we were like, 'Who are these people? Do you know them?' We made a point as hosts to find those new people and make them feel welcome.\n\nFor Wilmington's Joe Johnson, the group was formed right at a time when a long-term relationship was ending and he was looking to meet people.\n\nI was striking out on my own for the first time in 16 years, so having them there was a really a wonderful social outlet, he says. It was a great way to start over and it was really important to me. I've long recognized its value.\n\nLast year, Johnson got more involved in the group, helping to organize and advertise the meetings in an effort to draw more new faces. For him, part of the work is giving back to future members who may find the group at just the right time, like he did.\n\nIn the early years of the group, Johnson was like Sielski in thinking it was important for the group to meet in public at restaurants and bars, which have grown to include spots such as Piccolina Toscana, Trolley Tap House, Tonic Seafood & Steak, Stitch House Brewing, DE.CO and others.\n\nImportant:Wilmington's DECO offers inclusive 'restrooms for all'\n\nThe formula of visiting those spots has stuck even as attitudes have greatly changed over the past decade. For many in the local LGBTQ community, gone are the days of looking on a barroom door for a rainbow sticker to determine whether you're welcome.\n\nWhen gay marriage became legal, it changed a lot of perceptions, Johnson says. I think there was a little trepidation at first when we started. 'How are we going to be perceived?' It's a testament to how things have changed in society that there has not been one negative incident in 10 years.\n\nIt's just typical now that we're out there. It's everything we wanted as the gay community: to have open acceptance.\n\nA tough loss during the pandemic\n\nWith 11 straight Our Night Our Wilmington events cancelled amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no typical anymore for anyone, including group members. The social safety net of the group meetings are gone, even though many are friends and are still in touch.\n\nThe toughest part of the pandemic hiatus for many organizers and attendees came in August when co-host Josh Borin passed away at the age of 48 in August.\n\nHe did not die of the virus, but the Our Night Wilmington community was forced to grieve in private due to pandemic restrictions like so many have over the past year.\n\nBorin was oftentimes the first person new members would see. Short in stature with a inviting smile that would warm his entire face, Borin dutifully welcomed guests armed with a clicker to keep an accurate attendance count for years.\n\nHe's been our Recorder of Deeds, if you will, Sielski says. It really gave him a sense of purpose.\n\nSielski adds, It's so heartbreaking that he's not here.\n\nOpen to all (yes, even straight allies)\n\nLike Sielski and Borin, Wilmington resident Brian Lamborn attended the events at the beginning, thinking it would be a fun way to socialize and meet people. Fast-forward to a decade later and he's now an administrator of the group's Facebook page, usually taking photos at each event and posting them.\n\nHe was drawn to it because of the new people the group brought in — people he didn't usually see out at other local LGBTQ events. Since then, he's made real friends that remain to this day.\n\nEven though the events are held at a bar or restaurant, it's a bit of a different scene than a gay bar with live entertainment or loud music. It's more about making friendships and networking than partying — not that the group can't do that as well.\n\nMany of the participants don't go to bars or clubs and this event is the only opportunity they have to socialize outside of their own circle of friends, says Lamborn, who estimates he's attended about 80 events over the years.\n\nThe evenings draw mostly gay men, but lesbian, bisexual, transgender and straight group members also attend.\n\nIn fact, Lamborn remembers a particularly unique couple he met one night: a shy guy who had recently come out of the closet, who brought along his soon to be ex-wife.\n\nHe adds, And she became a semi regular at the event, too.\n\nGot a tip?

The claim: Richard and Mildred Loving were convicted for being in an interracial marriage and later won a 1967 Supreme Court case that declared a Virginia law prohibiting mixed-race marriage unconstitutional\n\nA viral Instagram post recounts the story of Richard and Mildred Loving, who were arrested and given a one-year suspended sentence because they were a married interracial couple.\n\nTheir union was a criminal act in Virginia because Richard was white, Mildred was black, and the state's Racial Integrity Act, passed in 1924, criminalized interracial marriage, the Jan. 6 post reads. The post included a photo of the couple with their attorney Bernard Cohen.\n\nThe Lovings later won the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case, Loving v. Virginia, according to the post.\n\nMore:Fact check: Post comparing Capitol riot to 2018 Kavanaugh protests lacks context\n\nLoving v. Virginia\n\nThe viral story about the Lovings is true.\n\nThe Racial Integrity Act of 1924 prohibited interracial marriage in Virginia and defined a white person as someone who has no trace whatsoever of any blood other than Caucasian, according to Encyclopedia Virginia.\n\nThe Lovings grew up in Caroline County, Virginia, and were neighbors, according to the county's website. They traveled to Washington, D.C., where interracial marriage was legal, and wed on June 2, 1958.\n\nAfter returning to Caroline County, local authorities forcibly entered their home at 2 a.m. and arrested the couple, The Washington Post reported. The Lovings pleaded guilty to violating the Racial Integrity Act on Jan. 6, 1959.\n\nJudge Leon M. Bazile then sentenced them to a one-year jail term, which he agreed to suspend if the Lovings would leave Virginia and not return for 25 years. The pair moved to Washington, but were unhappy there, according to the Post.\n\nWanting to return to Virginia, Mildred Loving wrote a letter to U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to ask for his assistance. Kennedy referred the couple to the American Civil Liberties Union, where attorneys Cohen and Philip Hirschkop worked and later represented the couple.\n\nAfter the original ruling was upheld by the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, Loving v. Virginia went to the U.S. Supreme Court, per Biography.com.\n\nIn a landmark decision, the Supreme Court declared the Virginia law prohibiting mixed-race marriage unconstitutional on June 12, 1967, which legalized interracial marriage in every state, NPR reported.\n\nThe photo of the couple included in the post is also authentic.

Ruby L. Bailey\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nEditor's note: This story originally was published in the Detroit Free Press on Oct. 26, 2005, as Washington's elite gathered to mark former U.S. Rep. John Dingell's 50th anniversary in the U.S. House. The Dearborn Democrat and his wife Debbie, who now holds his seat, were a powerhouse couple in Washington. John Dingell died Thursday.\n\nWASHINGTON – It has been going on so long now, it is nearly overlooked – the high-octane, high-ranking woman from General Motors working the room at a charity event while her towering husband, the dean of the U.S. House of Representatives, holds court with those who want a minute of his time.\n\nIn the nearly 25 years that Debbie and U.S. Rep. John Dingell merged lives and Rolodexes, they have created a loving marriage and a political union that rivals those of other beltway power couples with names like Dole, Clinton and Cheney.\n\nTonight, as Washington's elite gathers to honor John Dingell's 50th anniversary in the House at a gala that Debbie helped plan, they also will be saluting the woman who said no beginning in 1978 to his first 15 pleas for dates. The event will be held at the National Building Museum with Vice President Richard Cheney, one of the featured speakers.\n\nI think she's been the best thing that's ever happened to John, said friend Sandie Knollenberg, wife of U.S. Rep. John Knollenberg, a Republican from Bloomfield Township, Michigan.\n\nFeb. 7:Michigan's John Dingell, longest-serving member in Congress, dies at 92\n\nFeb. 7:John Dingell was a Twitter superstar. Here are his greatest hits.\n\nThe Dingells face the obvious conflicts that come when a politician and a corporate heavy hitter marry. She runs the General Motors Foundation, the company's charity arm. But friends say her own political savvy has helped remake the second quarter century of his career.\n\nShe has the best political head I've ever seen, John Dingell said last week. He refers to her so often as the Lovely Deborah, that staffers refer to her as TLD. She's a tremendous asset, and I'm smart enough to know it.\n\nAnd, added Dingell, 79, It's the greatest love affair of my life.\n\nLong before he met the then-Deborah Insley, Dingell was a Democrat in the mold of his late father, Rep. John Dingell Sr., a New Deal Democrat who held the seat his son won after his death in 1955.\n\nMany people called the congressman from Dearborn, Michigan, Big John, a nickname drawn from his imposing 6-foot-4 frame. The same year he married Debbie, he became chairman of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee, a post he held until 1994 when Republicans gained a majority of seats in the House.\n\nFeb. 7:John Dingell recalled as icon: Here's what colleagues, friends are saying\n\nFeb. 6:Former Rep. John Dingell in hospice with cancer diagnosis\n\nHe was both respected and feared, said Anne Wexler, partner in Wexler and Walker, one of the largest lobbying firms in D.C. Wexler worked as an assistant to President Jimmy Carter. He had a lot of opportunities to do a lot of digging. And he did.\n\nDebbie Insley came from the family dynasty that once controlled GM's Fisher Body. She had worked for General Motors five years when she met Dingell. She was an active Republican, having spent her youth as a member of the Teenage Republicans and hung out with people like former U.S. Sen. Spencer Abraham and former Michigan Gov. John Engler. She was 27 and never married when Dingell came calling.\n\nIt never occurred to me he would meet Debbie, said Nancy Barbour, a lobbyist who met Rep. Dingell when she worked for the late Rep. William Ford, a Democrat in a district adjacent to Dingell's.\n\nThen 55, Dingell was a divorced father of four and lonely, said friends. By his count, not until his 16th request, when he figured out that ballet was her soft spot, did she say yes.\n\nGod somehow put the two of us together, said Debbie Dingell, 51.\n\nThe issues were obvious. He was twice her age, had four kids, one older than her, and – gasp – he was a Democrat and a big-game hunter to boot.\n\nSept. 17:Former Rep. John Dingell hospitalized after suffering apparent heart attack\n\nDespite all that, they announced their engagement at a political breakfast on Capitol Hill.\n\nI saw the softer side from the moment I married him, she said. We have a love affair. We share everything.\n\nBoth take pains to avoid the conflict of interests that come from being two powerful people in Washington.\n\nEarly in their marriage, she said, she was a house mouse who stopped moving in political circles.\n\nBut that didn't last long – she joined her husband's party and quickly moved up within its ranks. By 2000, she was asked to coordinate Vice President Al Gore's presidential campaign in Michigan.\n\nI don't know that I've ever gone to an event where John is and Deborah is not present, said former Sen. Donald Riegle, of Michigan.\n\nDingell, who is known as the auto industry's most powerful advocate on Capitol Hill, still is sensitive to conflict of interest concerns.\n\nWe are very, very careful, said Debbie Dingell, who added that both consult attorneys about potential conflicts.\n\nHe says his wife's devotion to him and his career may have hurt hers, though he wouldn't elaborate and she dismissed the comment.\n\nWe're a team, she said.\n\nShe helped establish the bipartisan retreats for congressional members in 1995, lobbied for a family room in the House and often is the only spouse to hang around for late-night House votes.\n\nThere's no other spouse in the room all night long, but Debbie Dingell's there, said former Rep. Billy Tauzin, who served as chairman of the Energy and Commerce committee when the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives. She's not there for any other reason, but to lend him quiet support.\n\nThe Dingells often dine with Tauzin and his wife, Cecile, as well as the Knollenbergs, all Republicans, even during the worst of partisan fighting.\n\nOne issue where the couple agree to disagree: gun rights. Rep. Dingell is a hunter and for years had been a member of the National Rifle Association's board of directors.\n\nHe has mounts of big-game trophies in his congressional office.\n\nI thought the NRA was a bunch of nuts, Debbie Dingell said of her feelings for the group at the time.\n\nIn 1994, President Bill Clinton wanted a crime bill passed that included a ban on owning assault rifles. The NRA lobbied against it. Clinton called Dingell after midnight and an NRA lobbyist was camped outside the door. Dingell voted for the bill. He later resigned from the NRA board.\n\nThey have their moments where he will say, 'Woman …'  said Marda Robillard, Dingell's former chief of staff. And you'd just rather be someplace else.\n\nIn 2002, Debbie Dingell took six weeks off to help her husband's Democratic primary campaign against Rep. Lynn Rivers. Rivers cast herself as a progressive, single mother running against a relic.\n\nDingell recast himself, talking about the challenges of raising four children and stressing the benefits that come to constituents from his seniority in Congress. He won easily.\n\nOf her role, Debbie Dingell said, When you've got a little younger wife who knows what she's doing politically, she helps modernize him.\n\nJohn Dingell said he's relishing tonight's festivities more for his wife, who planned the affair, than for himself.\n\nWe just see ourselves as two people who love each other and want to be together with a shared sense of past, present and future, he said. The rest is just nice.\n\nFollow the Detroit Free Press on Twitter: @freep
Craig Shirley\n\nThe 52-year marriage of Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis began on a blind date, and they never stopped dating. She gave up a promising career as an actress, but they were in one movie together: 1957's Hellcats of the Navy. Her character told Reagan's character in the film that she knew a lot about the moon because she looked at it often when he was away.\n\nThe couple had met several years earlier when her name appeared erroneously on a list of suspected communists in Hollywood. She was making The Next Voice You Hear and was terribly upset. A friend, Mervyn LeRoy, said he would introduce her to the president of the Screen Actors Guild, Ronald Reagan, to look into the matter.\n\nThey went to dinner fully prepared to beg off if they didn't like each other, but 50 years later, she remembered what she ate (steak), what she wore (a black dress), and what show they took in after dinner (a ribald one-woman comedy show). He later proposed to her at Chasen's, and they often dined in the booth where she had said yes to his proposal of marriage.\n\nShe remembered everything about Reagan, and he remembered everything about her.\n\nWhen he was away, he wrote to her daily, letters that were tender, funny and touching. He'd depict himself in drawings crying over being away from her. When Reagan was running for president, he wrote her that maybe being in the White House wouldn't be so bad — you'd be right upstairs.\n\nThey were really best friends who slept in the same room and same bed for their entire marriage. They laughed together, celebrated together, cried together and when he died, a part of her died.\n\nThey loved entertaining but were also happy being alone with one another on their horses or in a canoe. She used to tease him about playing a ukulele while paddling. In the beginning, she wasn't wild about the ranch but over time, it grew on her. She ended up loving it as much as he did, in part because it was one of the few places she could have him to herself. When she sold it after Reagan's Alzheimer's took him another step downward, she was terribly depressed.\n\nNancy counseled her husband while he was president, although not on national policy. He used to love wearing a purple plaid suit while president. She hated it. After the 1981 assassination attempt and his recovery, they were on Air Force One and he was wearing the suit. Nancy complained, and he protested how much he liked it. She turned to friend and aide Mike Deaver, Tell the president what the staff says about the suit! Reagan looked at Deaver and asked, Mike, what does the staff say about my suit? Deaver replied, Mr. President, the staff says if you were going to be shot, why couldn't you be shot wearing that suit?\n\nIn his later years, she gave part of herself to him, like an O. Henry story. She ate less, slept less, worried more, cried more and, when he died, she mourned him greatly. She never stopped loving Ronald Reagan and never stopped mourning him.\n\nNow, at last, they are together again in eternity.\n\nNancy Davis Reagan, R.I.P.\n\nCraig Shirley, founder of Shirley & Banister Public Affairs, has written three best-selling books about Ronald Reagan, most recently last year's Last Act: The Final Years and Emerging Legacy of Ronald Reagan, and is at work on a fourth.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

Michael Kiefer\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nPHOENIX — The case is supposed to be about religious discrimination: The question is, who's discriminating against whom?\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice claims that a polygamous sect called the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints controls the Arizona-Utah border towns of Colorado City and Hildale, and that it denies housing and police services to non-church members.\n\nDuring opening arguments in U.S. District Court in Phoenix Wednesday, Justice Department attorney Jessica Clarke said that non-FLDS members in the two towns are denied some of the most basic rights of democracy ... freedom to live in a city governed by the laws of the land, not by the laws of religion.\n\nCivil-rights trial underway against polygamous sect\n\nBut attorneys defending the so-called Twin Cities, which share utilities and a police force, say, This case is about whether Colorado City and Hildale treat people fairly.\n\nThe federal government wants to make this case about religion, said attorney Jeffrey Matura, who represents Colorado City, Ariz.\n\nThe federal government wants to eradicate this religion, Matura said, to find the cities guilty of the sins of the church.\n\nThe two towns lie on a remote stretch of land called the Arizona Strip, isolated from the rest of Arizona by the Grand Canyon. Originally called Short Creek, it was settled in the early 20th century by fundamentalist Mormons who wanted, among other things, to continue to practice what they call plural marriage.\n\nThe church leader was traditionally called The Prophet, and in the early 2000s that title fell to Warren Jeffs, who, according to witness testimony, tightened control of the sect, excommunicated members and took away their homes and wives and children, and advocated underage marriage.\n\nWhen Jeffs became a federal fugitive, according to court testimony and arguments, the marshal's deputies, the towns' combined police force, obstructed the investigation by not cooperating with other law enforcement.\n\nJeffs was arrested and convicted of child sexual assault and sentenced to life in prison. The obstructive police officers were decertified, and the communal trust that controls most of the property in the two cities was wrested away from the FLDS church and placed under the control of a fiduciary agent.\n\nAt issue in opening arguments Wednesday was whether Colorado City and Hildale remain under FLDS control, and by extension, under the control of Warren Jeffs.\n\nThe U.S. government alleges that the two cities violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment — that is, refusing to separate church and state.\n\nHundreds gather for Utah flood victims' memorial\n\nThey are in violation of the Fair Housing Act and the Civil Rights Act because non-FLDS residents, the DOJ alleges, are denied housing through the cities' practice of stalling or denying housing permits and water connections. And they are in violation of the Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable search and seizure and the 14th Amendment requirement of equal protection under the law, the DOJ asserts.\n\nClarke said marshal's deputies serve as enforcers in the housing disputes and collaborate with FLDS security staff to spy on townspeople and outsiders alike. Surveillance cameras all over town, Clarke said, are monitored in the church meeting house.\n\nPeople the church does not like — an employee of the property trust fiduciary, for example — are harassed by townsfolk with no repercussions, Clarke argued.\n\nBut the defense attorneys told a different story.\n\nI do not represent Warren Jeffs or the FLDS church, said attorney Blake Hamilton, who represents the town of Hildale, Utah.\n\nWho is discriminating against who? he asked during his opening statement. He noted that the FLDS church is not named in the lawsuit.\n\nHamilton and his co-counsel, Matura, who represents Colorado City, claim that not all town employees or police are FLDS members and that those who are keep their religion separate from their job responsibilities.\n\nExiled polygamists gather to celebrate 4th\n\nThe federal government doesn't get to discriminate against the citizens of Hildale and Colorado City just because they don't like their religion, Hamilton said.\n\nThe defense attorneys called out several of the government's witnesses by name and broadcast their photos on closed-circuit TVs and called them liars.\n\nThe events that DOJ cites took place in the past, they claimed. The offending police were fired. And the housing problems are caused by the current fiduciary agent, they said.\n\nThe trial is expected to continue through the end of February.\n\nFollow Michael Kiefer on Twitter: @michaelbkiefer
Robert Powell, Special for USA TODAY\n\nQ: I got married in Vietnam after my first wife passed away in the U.S. My second wife was denied a visa to the U.S. Should I consider an annulment with my second wife in Vietnam so that I can receive my first wife's Social Security benefits when I turn 60?\n\n– Hank Nguyen, Texas\n\nA: An annulment may not be necessary in your case, says David Cechanowicz, a senior financial planner with REDW Stanley Financial Advisors. A divorce would work just fine.\n\nIndividuals that divorce after marriage are entitled to survivor benefits, he says.\n\nHowever, in your particular situation, the Social Security Procedure Manual (POMS for short) states the following: Generally, a claimant for widow(er)s or surviving divorced spouse's benefits must be unmarried in order to be entitled. Entitlement can begin with the month the subsequent marriage terminated regardless if the marriage ended by death or divorce.\n\nWhat that means is that if the subsequent marriage is terminated, either by death or divorce, and possibly annulment, then the survivor benefit would be available, says Cechanowicz.\n\nHowever, before embarking on that path, Cechanowicz says you should check just what benefits might be available based on a benefit for a worker that died so many years ago. Additionally, unless the death was accidental, the couple would have had to have been married long enough to qualify for Social Security benefits, he says. Under current law, that means the marriage must last at least nine months, or meets some other exception.\n\nCechanowicz also warns that benefit may be very small and not worth the trouble to try and collect. Plus, he says you will have to go to a Social Security office with a death certificate, marriage license and your deceased spouse's Social Security number at a minimum.\n\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

Ray Howze\n\nThe (Nashville) Tennessean\n\nFRANKLIN, Tenn. — When Clifford Smith was attending church in 1953 shortly after returning from his stint in the armed forces overseas, someone caught his eye.\n\nWilma Smith, a good-looking, blond-haired girl, as he described her, was sitting behind him. Clifford, though, was with someone else at the time and couldn't say anything just yet.\n\nBut he knew there was something special about Wilma.\n\nI said to myself, 'I might look into that,' and I did, Clifford said.\n\nOrdering flowers for Valentine's Day? Don't delay\n\nChocolate your chocoholic Valentine will love\n\nSixty-two years later, Clifford is still looking into Wilma. The two married in 1954 and have been by each other's side ever since. This week, they'll celebrate their 63rd Valentine's Day together.\n\nWe were very compatible to start with, Clifford said. We liked the same things and she came from a real good family. She's one of six girls and now she's the only one left.\n\nStaying together for as long as they have, though, has taken some work.\n\nPart of their key to the long marriage, the two said, has involved making sacrifices for each other at times.\n\nIt's never 50-50, Wilma said. Most of the time, somebody has to give one way or the other and if you do that, you'll be fine.\n\nWhile the both of them worked, Wilma always made sure Clifford had a lunch and fresh clothes to take to work, daughter Daphne Lynch said. Clifford often had to work seven-day weeks while with Norfolk Southern Railway. Wilma worked as an executive assistant in court reporting.\n\nLynch, who was born nearly a year after her parents were married, said she's seen them grow through their 62 years of marriage and has admired their connection.\n\nThey'll be at my house and... they'll always sit next to each other, not across, and hold hands, Lynch said.\n\nThe two lived in Chattanooga and moved to Franklin in 2010 to be closer to their kids and grandchildren.\n\nNow that they're both retired, Clifford, 87, is returning some of the love and care Wilma has always shown him.\n\nWilma, 83, has some difficulty getting around because of rheumatoid arthritis and macular degeneration. As a result, Clifford often helps her with her earrings, makeup and even the puzzles in the paper.\n\nThe letters are too small for her to read, so for the past three years, Clifford has written them down on a pad in bigger letters for her to see and unscramble.\n\nIf there's one I don't know, she sure does, Clifford said.\n\nThe couple also credits their family for their marriage's longevity.\n\nWe had a great family atmosphere, Wilma Smith said. The old saying is, 'If a son is good to the mother, he'll be good to his wife,' and that's very, very true. He's just an extra special man.\n\nFollow Ray Howze on Twitter: @rayhowze1
Paul Singer, and Fredreka Schouten\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON — The path to the Republican nomination this year could run through the Virgin Islands.\n\nThe tiny U.S. territory is one of a handful of places where Republicans can select unbound delegates who have the ability to cast a vote on the first ballot at the national convention for any candidate they choose. These hundred or so delegates nationwide — the Virgin Islands has nine — could emerge as critical power brokers at the party's convention in Cleveland if GOP front-runner Donald Trump fails to amass the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination beforehand.\n\nThis is not just hypothetical: That is how the 1976 Republican convention was decided as President Ford had less than a majority of delegates pledged to him but won the lion's share of uncommitted delegates in states such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, said Frank Donatelli, a former Republican National Committee official. These uncommitted delegates are where the leading candidate will look to get delegates to go over the top.\n\nElections 2016 | USA TODAY Network\n\nThe total number of unbound GOP delegates is a bit unclear, because each state sets its own delegate rules. But a furious shadow campaign is under way in several pockets of the country to influence who nabs these spots.\n\nThis weekend, North Dakota Republicans will meet in a convention to select 25 convention delegates who, in addition to the three state officials with already reserved delegate spots, can all be unbound in Cleveland. State GOP Executive Director Roz Leighton said presidential campaigns have been recruiting people in the state to run for delegate spots so they can count on having supporters in the delegation at the convention.\n\nPennsylvania will have 17 bound delegates selected in the state's April 26 Republican primary, but 54 Keystone State delegates will be unbound — though many may express which candidate they plan to support. Colorado selects delegates the first week of April who can choose whether to declare a preference. Any delegate doing so before being selected will be bound to that choice for the first ballot at the convention. Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli said it is likely the state's 37-member delegation will be mixed, but it's possible it could be almost completely bound or completely unbound. Guam has nine unbound delegates.\n\nNowhere is the fight for these coveted delegates more intense than the Virgin Islands.\n\nA Michigan political consultant, John Yob, moved to the islands last year and campaigned heavily to become an uncommitted delegate. His work paid off: He emerged as the top vote-getter among the 300 or so Republicans who participated in the islands' March 10 caucus. Despite a big contingent of other delegate candidates who were committed to presidential contenders, Yob and the five other unbound delegates prevailed, including his wife, Erica.\n\nYob, who worked on Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's unsuccessful presidential campaign and the White House bids of John McCain and Rick Santorum, has a bit of an inside track on delegate-selection process. He actually wrote a book on it, Chaos: The Outsider's Guide to a Contested Republican National Convention, published in February. In it, he singled out the unique role U.S. territories could play as free agents in a brokered convention.\n\nYob told USA TODAY he has been visiting the Virgin Islands since 2009 and had no ulterior motives in relocating to the territory last year. I started making offers on houses in 2011, he said. I was not thinking about the 2016 national convention in 2011.\n\nHis father, a veteran Michigan political strategist Chuck Yob, supports Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential bid, but the younger Yob insists that he has no preference. He called Texas Sen. Ted Cruz a solid candidate and praised Trump's ability to bringing in new people to the party.\n\nYob said he's already heard from all the presidential campaigns since the March 10 election but declined to discuss the details of his conversations.\n\nHis eligibility and residency are being challenged in court. The chairman of the local party, John Canegata, has moved to disqualify Yob and the other unbound delegates, citing a party rule that requires delegates to accept their positions in writing. He's replaced them with six alternates, four of whom are pledged to support Trump, Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nMarco Rubio's unprecedented plan to stop Donald Trump: Keep his delegates\n\nThe fight over whether to seat Yob and the other unbound delegates could drag on for months. But the battle has underscored how much clout a territory with roughly 105,000 residents and only a few thousand registered Republicans, could have in this year's wildly unpredictable GOP contest.\n\nHolland Redfield, the GOP's national committeeman from the territory, automatically gets a slot as an unbound delegate to the convention. Redfield, a local radio host, said Virgin Islands Republicans are reveling in all the attention from their party's presidential candidates and are using it to push local issues, such as boosting federal spending on Medicaid in the islands.\n\nWe are using the maximum leverage to make sure the candidate we elect understands the uniqueness of the U.S. territories, he said. If I'm uncommitted, and I'm dating three girls at the same time, I want to get the best deals for me and the best marriage.
Second lady Karen Pence has taken a job at a private Christian school that bans LGBT employees, gay students and the children of gay parents.\n\nPence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, started teaching art this week at Immanuel Christian School in Northern Virginia. She previously taught at the elementary school for 12 years while Pence was in Congress.\n\nHer decision drew attention – if not shock – from advocates in the LBGT community. Rick Sutton, an LGBT advocate who co-founded Freedom Indiana, said the Pence family's stance against LGBT rights is well known, so he's not surprised by her decision to join the school.\n\nI don't know that it hurts us, he said of LGBT advocacy. It's certainly not helpful. But there's almost nothing the Pences can do to redeem themselves in our eyes at this point.\n\nMike Pence, the former Indiana governor and congressman, has long maintained that marriage is between a man and a woman. As governor, he pushed a religious freedom law that put Indiana in the national spotlight. While Pence insisted he was protecting the rights of the faithful, many feared it was a thinly veiled attempt to allow businesses to refuse to serve gay, lesbian and transgender customers.\n\nA spokeswoman for Karen Pence said attacks against her for taking the teaching job are absurd.\n\nMrs. Pence has returned to the school where she previously taught for 12 years, her spokeswoman, Kara Brooks said in a prepared statement sent to multiple media outlets. It's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack.\n\nBrooks did not agree to a request from IndyStar for further comment.\n\nUnder a parent agreement posted on the school's website, Immanuel can refuse admission to students who participate in, support or condone sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bisexual activity. The school also can refuse admission based on similar activities of a parent or guardian or within a particular home.\n\nUnder an employment agreement posted on the website, the school requires applicants to agree that God intends marriage to be between a man and a woman. It also states unmarried couples should not live together, have any sexual activity outside of marriage and employees should not change their gender identity.\n\nThe school does not appear to use public funding. It recoups the majority of its costs through tuition and donations, according to the website, which costs parents north of $10,000 per school year\n\nPence will work at the Christian school twice a week through May, according to a news release.\n\nI am excited to be back in the classroom and doing what I love to do, which is to teach art to elementary students, she said in a prepared statement. I have missed teaching art, and it's great to return to the school where I taught art for twelve years.\n\nPence spent 25 years as a teacher before her husband was elected vice president. She has illustrated children's books about the vice president and advocated for art therapy programs in her current role.\n\nPence received her undergraduate and graduate degrees in elementary education from Butler University in Indianapolis.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY
The Associated Press\n\nFREDERICK, Md. – A former CIA technical operations officer who helped rescue six U.S. diplomats from Iran in 1980 and was portrayed by Ben Affleck in the film Argo, has died. He was 78.\n\nA family statement and his literary agent confirmed that Antonio Tony Mendez died Saturday at an assisted-living center in Frederick, Maryland. He had suffered from Parkinson's disease, according to the statement.\n\nSpecializing in covert operations, Mendez helped devise the plan under which six diplomats who were in hiding were disguised as a Canadian film crew so they could board a flight and escape the country amid the Iran hostage crisis.\n\nThe daring plot – for years a side note to the 52 people held hostage for 444 days – captured the public's attention in Argo, which won the 2013 Oscar for best picture.\n\nMendez, who joined the CIA after getting recruited in 1965, spent his 25-year career working undercover in Cold War battlegrounds, including the Soviet Union. Working as a chief of disguise, Mendez and his workers helped secret agents remain secret through creating false documents and disguises, according to a biography for his first book, The Master of Disguise; My Secret Life in the CIA.\n\nTony Mendez was a true American hero. He was a man of extraordinary grace, decency, humility and kindness, Affleck tweeted Saturday. He never sought the spotlight for his actions, he merely sought to serve his country. I'm so proud to have worked for him and to have told one of his stories.\n\nThe Argo screenplay, based on another Mendez memoir and also an Oscar winner, was liberally embellished for the big screen. The six Americans' passage through the Tehran airport and onto a plane was uneventful, Mendez wrote. But the movie portrayed a white-knuckle takeoff at the Tehran airport, with Iranian assault teams racing behind the jet down the runway.\n\nBorn in Nevada, Mendez moved to Colorado at age 14, attended the University of Colorado and worked for Martin Marietta on the Titan intercontinental missile, according to the online biography . He was recruited for the CIA in Denver through a blind ad. In less than two years, the biography says, he and his family had moved overseas while Mendez worked in South and Southeast Asia.\n\nHis wife, Jonna, is also a former chief of disguise in the CIA's Office of Technical Service. The two wrote a book about their agency work in Moscow in the final days of the Cold War and their romance, which led to their marriage after he retired in 1990. Mendez was also an accomplished painter.\n\nHis family says he will be buried in a private ceremony at the family graveyard in Nevada.
Jim Douglas\n\nWFAA-TV, Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nBENBROOK, Texas — The estranged wife of acclaimed pianist Vadym Kholodenko has been charged with two counts of capital murder after her children were found dead Thursday and she was found with stab wounds that are now believed to have been self-inflicted, police said Monday.\n\nBenbrook Police Cmdr. David Babcock said Sofya Tsygankova killed her daughters, ages 1 and 5, but she has not been arrested because she is undergoing a mental evaluation at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.\n\nTsygankova is charged with two counts of capital murder of a person under 10 years of age, a first-degree felony.\n\nThe children, Nika and Michela Kholodenko, were found dead Thursday morning by their father, renowned pianist Vadym Kholodenko, when he was scheduled to pick up the siblings. They had no obvious signs of trauma and police said Monday they were still unsure of what caused their deaths.\n\nCourt records reveal the Kholodenkos stopped living together in August after about five years of marriage. Citing a conflict in personalities, Kholodenko filed for divorce four months before the children were found dead inside the home.\n\nThe pair were supposed to exchange some financial documents regarding their pending divorce a week from Friday.\n\nVadym Kholodenko was gold medalist at the Fourteenth Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 2013. The quadrennial Cliburn is one of the world's most prestigious piano competitions. It not only identifies talented young pianists, but also nurtures their careers by arranging for winners to perform at recitals, festivals and orchestra concerts in the three years after the competition.\n\nBorn in Kiev, Ukraine, Kholodenko has performed with orchestras around the world. He was scheduled to perform with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra over the weekend, but another pianist filled in.\n\nTerri Messer, who shares a duplex with the family, said Tsygankova was a doting mother.\n\nVery attentive, Messer said. She played on the outside with them. If they were on the trampoline, she was on the trampoline.\n\nKholodenko issued a statement Friday that said, in part:\n\nThe loss of my children will be with me forever. But I would like to say that I feel the support of the Fort Worth community and all people who are sending me messages all over the world. [...] I would like to ask everyone who is going to the concerts this weekend at Bass Hall to think of the music. Wherever I go after this tragedy my heart will stay with the people here of Fort Worth and my daughters will rest in this soil.\n\nFollow Jim Douglas on Twitter: @wfaajdouglas
Saudi prosecutors on Wednesday demanded the death penalty for five Saudis linked to the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nEleven suspects attended their first court hearing in Riyadh, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported. Lawyers for the defendants requested copies of the indictment and sought more time to respond to the charges, the agency said.\n\nProsecutors also said they had sent two letters last month to the Turkish authorities seeking any evidence connected to this case. Turkey has said it is willing to share information in the case.\n\nNo response has been received to date and the Public Prosecutor's Office is still waiting for an answer, the Saudi prosecutors said in a statement.\n\nMore:'I can't breathe': Transcript of recording details Khashoggi's final moments\n\nMore:Jamal Khashoggi, journalists named TIME's 2018 Person of the Year\n\nKhashoggi, a U.S. resident, was a frequent critic of the Saudi royal family, He died Oct. 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to obtain paperwork for his upcoming marriage. His subsequent disappearance directed severe scrutiny on the kingdom.\n\nThe Saudis initially claimed Khashoggi, 59, left the consulate that day, and security footage shows someone wearing his clothes walking away. For weeks Saudi Arabia denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate.\n\nThe Saudis ultimately revised the story, saying Khashoggi died after a fight broke out during his interrogation. A Saudi prosecutor said more than a dozen people had been arrested in the incident. But Saudi leaders have rejected Turkish claims that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman either ordered or had advanced knowledge of the killing.\n\nKhashoggi's body, which Turkish officials have said was dismembered the day he died, has not been found.\n\nPresident Trump has refused to come down hard on Saudi Arabia over the killing, citing the kingdom's close political and economic ties to the U.S.\n\nIt could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event — maybe he did and maybe he didn't! Trump said.\n\nLast month, Khashoggi joined the Capital Gazette newsroom and three other journalists named as TIME magazine's 2018 Person of the Year.
Cutting into a tree reveals its inner rings, which tell a story of the tree's existence, how it grew and what happened around it. Cicely Tyson's new book cuts into her tree of life – and the legendary actress showcases the rings of her seven-decade long career in her first memoir, Just As I Am.\n\nIt would also turn out to be her last memoir: Just two days after the book's publication, Tyson died Jan. 28 at 96. The book she left behind is a parting gift to readers and chronicles an incredible life, lived fully.\n\nHer youth growing up in New York, life pre-fame and groundbreaking work span 400 pages in the book (HarperCollins, out now), written with collaborator Michelle Burford and broken into three sections: Planted, Rooted and Bountiful.\n\nMore:Legendary actress Cicely Tyson, who trailblazed in TV and film for more than seven decades, dies at 96\n\nViola Davis, Tyson's onscreen daughter Annalise Keating in the ABC drama series How to Get Away With Murder, pens the foreword, sharing emotional memories of her first discovery of Tyson's work and how it impacted her.\n\nThe famed nonagenarian, known for her roles as Rebecca in Sounder, the titular character in The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman and Binta in Roots, weaves together childhood memories and career highlights with musings about the state of the world today – making it clear that though much has changed, much also hasn't.\n\nTyson's text is rich with lived history, as well as historical notes that provide context to past and current unrest and racial strife. Being born to West Indian parents (both from Nevis) in New York, dealing with the ramifications of being Black, having her parents separate during her childhood and birthing a baby girl at 17 set the stage for bringing to life her form of activism through art.\n\nTyson raised her daughter, whom she calls Joan in the book, largely out of the spotlight, though she describes her daughter's birth and upbringing (and the way her career affected her lone child) in detail. Tyson said she and her daughter continue to work on our relationship, as fragile as it is precious, and she dedicated the book to her: the one who has paid the greatest price for this gift to all.\n\nWe've rounded up the book's most poignant moments, including stories about fellow Black trailblazers and her activist work.\n\nCicely Tyson dies at 96:Zendaya, Shonda Rhimes and more mourn 'the greatest to ever do it'\n\nTyson shares activism through art\n\nTyson begins the book's second act with a quote from Charles C. Seifert: A race without the knowledge of its history is like a tree without roots.\n\nHer roles as nuanced Black women are infused with the act of taking up space, changing the narrative and giving humanity back to Black communities in the same industry where it is simultaneously denied in other pieces of art. As a people, we've done what we've had to do to survive, and rather than feel ashamed of it, we should celebrate it.\n\nTyson also shares stories of using her platform to pay it forward, including the late-night ideation of opening the Dance Theatre of Harlem with Arthur Mitchell and Brock Peters or the phone calls that sparked the Cicely L. Tyson Community School of Performing and Fine Arts in New Jersey.\n\nMore:TCM honors Cicely Tyson with hand and footprint ceremony\n\nShe reveals an assault early in her career\n\nAs she began to act, Tyson didn't want to rely just on her emotional talents – she wanted the skills to back it up. Tyson wanted actor/director Lloyd Richards of Paul Mann Actor's Workshop to teach her the art behind acting. But an assault threatened to derail her career before it began.\n\nIn order to take classes and get mentorship from Richards, Tyson had to go through Mann's acting workshop. At an initial meeting with Mann, Tyson recounted that he rose from his desk and walked over to shut his door. I stood, as did every hair on my neck.\n\nTyson continued: Paul, a menacing tower of flesh, thrust himself toward me and began manhandling my breasts, attempting to remove my blouse as I shoved him away. 'No!' I yelled. 'Get off of me!' He tried to jam me against the wall and shove his hand under my camisole, but I somehow managed to break free.\n\nTyson wrote she was able to escape the encounter, but that she still had to interact with Mann as she took his acting workshop. Life is choices, and as I saw it, I had two. I could've fled from that man's office and never returned. Many, understandably, might have chosen that route. … I had arrived at that studio with the singular purpose of training with Lloyd. And though Paul, in a show of breathless lasciviousness, had attempted to thwart my mission, I was not to be deterred. Mann was later found guilty in a civil suit of harassing other women from his acting workshop.\n\nHer career connected her to theater, Hollywood greats (plus her famous godchildren)\n\nMaya Angelou. Oprah Winfrey. James Earl Jones. Sidney Poitier. Diahann Carroll. Viola Davis. Tyler Perry. All Black pioneers of the screen, stage and page, and all were close friends of Tyson.\n\nTyson shared personal details of her yearslong friendships with industry veterans: Angelou, the hostess who didn't need a special occasion to pull out her finest cutlery and Baccarat crystal; painfully shy Jones; her gossip sessions at New York Italian eatery Sardi's and her laughs with Carroll; Perry paying her double … even triple or quadruple on projects once he heard how underpaid she was for her landmark roles; and her cherished sisterhood with Winfrey. She also goes way back with Frank Sinatra and recalled a legal dust-up with Elizabeth Taylor.\n\nTyson's friendships throughout her stage and screen endeavors resulted in some equally illustrious godchildren. For instance, you may have heard of rockstar Lenny Kravitz, otherwise known as Tyson's godson thanks to her friendship with Kravitz's mom and The Jeffersons star Roxie Roker. Tyson was also a godparent to Denzel Washington's daughter, Katia, and Perry's son, Aman.\n\nCicely Tyson:At last, the legendary actress receives an (honorary) Oscar at 93\n\nHer romance with Miles Davis spanned two decades\n\nNot only did Tyson form friendships with future icons, but she also formed a relationship with legendary jazz musician and master trumpeter Miles Davis that lasted on and off for more than 20 years.\n\nThe two initially connected in 1965 after a chance meeting in Riverside Park, though Davis' struggles with addiction and infidelity ultimately drove them apart. They had other romances over the years, but Davis and Tyson reunited years later in their 50s, marrying at Bill Cosby's home on Thanksgiving Day in 1981.\n\nAt the start of their marriage, Tyson nursed Davis back to health after years of drug use had negatively affected his vital organs. But once Davis' strength improved, Tyson writes, he resumed the cycle of drugs and adultery that first split them up. An ongoing tryst between Davis and a woman in their New York apartment building – which led to a physical altercation between Tyson and the other woman – proved too much for the relationship, and Tyson filed for divorce. Of their relationship, Tyson insisted: I loved Miles and he loved me.\n\nShe didn't reveal her real age until she was 90\n\nIt wasn't until recently, at the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors ceremony where Tyson received recognition for her contributions to the performing arts, that she revealed her true age. For decades up to then, folks had been trying, and largely failing, to guess how old I was, she wrote, adding that she turned 90 in the months before the event.\n\nWhen Tyson began her acting career, at the advice of her then-manager Warren Coleman, she said she was 20 instead of 30. The change in age stuck throughout her career, with many thinking she was a full decade younger than she actually was. The truth is, I've always been quietly proud of my real age. … But when the Kennedy Center honor came around, I felt it was important to at last set the record straight, she writes alongside her birthdate: Dec. 19, 1924.\n\nMore:Cicely Tyson's giant hat turns heads at Aretha Franklin's funeral
Arlington\n\nOne of the most important species of fish in the ocean's food chain is getting a close look to help determine the health of its population. Two arms of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission are working on an assessment of the menhaden stock. The commission is an interstate board that regulates coastal fisheries. Menhaden are small, schooling fish that play a critical role in the ocean's health because they are important food for whales, larger fish, seabirds and others. They're also harvested commercially for use as fish oil and aquaculture feed. The Atlantic States commission says the health of the menhaden population will be the subject of meetings in Arlington in early April intended to inform the management of the Atlantic menhaden fishery.
USA TODAY Sports\n\nBy 2020, baseball's Athletics will be the last professional franchise standing in Oakland.\n\nAnd the A's wasted no time noting that fact in the minutes after the Raiders' move to Las Vegas was finalized.\n\nIt so happened the club had a rally planned to mark one week until Opening Day, but the proceedings took on a different feel in the wake of the Oakland Raiders receiving their ticket to ride out of town.\n\nIncoming club president Dave Kaval joined Mayor Libby Schaaf, A's mascot Stomper and other dignitaries on the roof of Oakland City Hall, raising an A's flag above the city and tweeting it all with the hashtag #RootedinOakland, a reminder the club has zeroed in on the city as a permanent site for a new stadium.\n\nThat process probably got much simpler with the Raiders' move.\n\nThe pair have shared the Oakland Coliseum – with its various corporate-branded pseudonyms – since the Raiders returned from Los Angeles in 1995 . It has been an uneasy marriage – the Raider return required the construction of Mt. Davis, a massive wall of seats to ensure the Coliseum met NFL attendance requirements.\n\nBut it also effectively ruined the Coliseum as a baseball park and saddled the city and county with crippling debt. In fact, as of late 2016, both entities owed $95 million to pay off debt related to expanding the Coliseum for the Raiders. That debt has significantly hampered the city's ability and motivation to cut new stadium deals for either the A's or Raiders.\n\nNow, however, the A's will be the only tenant at the Coliseum – and the lone team in the city once the Golden State Warriors move across the Bay to the $1 billion Chase Center; the Warriors are scheduled to open play in San Francisco for the 2019-20 NBA season.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that the A's and Oakland found themselves in a warm embrace on Monday afternoon. Kaval represents the club's new leadership, as he was appointed team president in November, when the club forced out previous owner Lew Wolff.\n\nIt was Wolff who ultimately felt a move to San Jose was the lone viable option for the A's, but a territorial fight with San Francisco's Giants were among the many reasons that did not come off.

Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nVILLANOVA, Pa. — With one primary win under his belt and a steep path to the GOP nomination, Ohio Gov. John Kasich tried to turn his Ohio victory into fresh political momentum at a standing-room-only town hall meeting outside Philadelphia on Wednesday.\n\nAn energized Kasich drew more than 600 attendees to a student center at Villanova University, where prospective voters offered clashing visions — some sketched out hopeful scenarios of a Kasich victory at a contested convention and others offered gloomy assessments that New York billionaire Donald Trump had the race sewn up.\n\nKasich's own remarks reflected the mashed-up atmosphere, saying he felt a palpable excitement around his candidacy even as he outlined an improbable political path. Then came the first question for Kasich from the throng of reporters: Wasn't he playing a spoiler in the race and blocking Texas Sen. Ted Cruz from taking Trump on in a two-man contest? Kasich shot back a sharp no.\n\nNeither of those guys can win a general election, Kasich said of Cruz and Trump. So maybe they're spoiling (the election) for the Republican Party and for the conservative movement.\n\nKasich's hope to become the anti-Trump\n\nIn his next breath, though, Kasich declined to criticize Trump for the tone of his campaign, which has included racially tinged and sexist comments. Today is the day after Ohio and a great win, Kasich said. I'm going to continue to talk about what I want to do, the future, my record ... and bringing people together.\n\nHe reiterated his message that he would not take the low road to the highest office in the land.\n\nThe crowd whooped in support when he talked about bipartisanship and ending the partisan warfare in Washington. They lapped up his tough talk about the need to balance the budget. And they applauded his call to take care of society's most vulnerable.\n\nIt was awesome, said 33-year-old Adam Gorski, an aerospace engineer. He's the only candidate with a real record of making change.\n\nEmily Clay, a retired attorney, said she has supported Kasich from the get-go. I like John Kasich for what he hasn't done, Clay said. He hasn't made irresponsible statements. He hasn't alienated people.\n\nShe said every other candidate in the race — on both sides — is too divisive.\n\nBut can Kasich win? Probably not, she conceded, but then most people didn't think he would make it this far.\n\nThe next Republican primaries are Tuesday in Arizona and Utah. Kasich's decision to come to Pennsylvania instead, where GOP voters will not go to the polls for another six weeks, illustrates his quixotic strategy: concentrating on a few moderate states where he thinks his compassionate conservative message will have appeal.\n\nIt's not a path to victory; rather it's an effort to block Donald Trump. And there's no question that Kasich's win in Ohio on Tuesday makes a contested convention more likely.\n\nI don't think anybody is going to have enough delegates, Kasich told reporters.\n\nContested convention? What you need to know\n\nWith his home-state win, Kasich still lags far behind Trump and Cruz in the delegate count. By Wednesday, Trump had 658 delegates to Cruz's 411 and Kasich's 138. Kasich argued he could increase his lead with wins in New Jersey, New York and other Eastern states.\n\nAfter the town hall, Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said the governor was headed to a fundraiser in Philadelphia and then back to Columbus. He has town halls scheduled Friday in Utah.\n\nEven in Pennsylvania — where Kasich grew up — the governor faces a challenge to his bid to get on the ballot. Schrimpf said he is confident Kasich will win that dispute but conceded it is ongoing.\n\nThe biggest question for Kasich in the next primary contests is whether he can bring in supporters of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the presidential race Tuesday night after losing his home state to Trump.\n\nOne voter at Tuesday's town hall described himself as a Rubio supporter shopping for a new candidate to support who is not named Donald Trump. The 18-year-old, who did not give his name, asked Kasich where in the Republican Party there was room for a socially moderate, fiscal conservative like himself.\n\nWhat is it you didn't hear in my speech? Kasich asked him, offering more of a scolding than a courtship. He switched gears quickly, telling the high school senior he was concerned about the environment and not a rigid ideologue on gay marriage. But it wasn't clear if Kasich swayed his vote.\n\nEven if Kasich picks up swaths of Rubio supporters and snags another win outside Ohio, it's not clear that voters and Republican delegates would rally to his camp at a contested convention in Cleveland.\n\nKasich wins one state and is happiest candidate ever\n\nMany supporters who came to hear him Wednesday conceded as much, even as they touted him as the best GOP candidate left in the race.\n\nHe is really the guy, said Dean Rosci, 57, who works in the trucking industry and came to the rally with his son, Greg, 26. Both men said they thought Kasich's experience as a governor and House Budget Committee chairman made him by far the most qualified to be the Republican nominee.\n\nBut Trump's victory is a done deal, said Dean Rosci, as his son nodded in agreement.\n\nI agree with a lot of things Trump says. I just don't agree with how he says them, said Greg Rosci. I can't see him in a meeting with other world leaders. The professionalism just isn't there.\n\nGorski, the aerospace engineer, said a Trump victory would be dangerous and embarrassing for America's global standing. He said he was convinced there would be a contested convention — and that Kasich would win the nomination that way.\n\nHe is going to be the one to walk away with it, Gorski predicted.
Jocelyn McClurg\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nNEW YORK – She's a news correspondent for ABC's 20/20 and Good Morning America. He hangs out the weather shingle for NBC's Today show.\n\nShe describes herself as a bit of a control freak. He's more laid back. She suffers from Mom guilt. As a parent, he's generally fairly laissez faire but somewhat old school.\n\nDeborah Roberts and Al Roker may have different styles – she is chatty and analytical, he likes to go for the pithy zinger – but they've just celebrated 20 years of marriage. And now they're sharing what they've learned along the way in their new book, Been There, Done That: Family Wisdom for Modern Times (New American Library).\n\nThe couple volley back and forth good-naturedly, a la Hepburn and Tracy, joking about whether they've read the chapters the other wrote (they alternate voices in the book). Friends who've witnessed their spirited debates suggested they either write it all down or have a reality show, but we're not going to do that, Roberts says.\n\nSo in the anecdote-filled Been There, they talk about growing up in large families with strong parents (Roberts went to a segregated school in Georgia until the fourth grade; Roker is from Queens, N.Y.); their careers and raising their kids. And they discuss the help they've received over the years from couples' therapy.\n\nIt should be required for every couple, says Roberts, 55. If nothing else, it's like having a referee or an impartial kind of judge, says Roker, 61. And they believe that communication – talk, talk, and more talk, says Roberts, advice from his mother – is key to a happy marriage. Especially when Deborah talks and tells me how I should feel, Roker quips. It's so much easier. I go, 'Yes, absolutely.'\n\nRoberts says they first started seeing a counselor because we were combining a family. Roker has a daughter, Courtney, 28, from his first marriage (she's part of the Today show's food team). Roker and Roberts are parents to Leila, 17, an aspiring singer and 11th grader, and Nick, 13. They write about Nick's learning disabilities, but also what a hard worker he is (he has a black belt in tae kwon do).\n\nOne of the things that's really wonderful about him, says Roker, is in a sense you kind of learn about yourself through him. You learn about patience, you learn about love, you learn about acceptance.\n\nAnd determination, says Roberts.\n\nLike all modern parents, they deal with issues such as helicopter parenting (they try not to practice it) and overreliance on technology (gadgets are not allowed at the dinner table).\n\nAs a couple, we've made some big mistakes, we've made some big discoveries, Roberts says. They might have high-profile television lives, but she thinks anyone can relate to their book. If we just offer a little bit of inspiration and a little bit of fun, I think we've done what we wanted to do.\n\nRoker pipes up: It's a good bathroom book.\n\nRoberts: Don't say that, I hate that.\n\nRoker: You don't have to read it all at once.\n\nRoberts: It is not (a bathroom book), but it's a quick, easy read about life, and I like that.\n\nRoker: It's a great bathroom book. In my house my mother always called it the reading room, the library.\n\nRoberts: I don't think we really want to hear that.
Laura Mandaro\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nSAN FRANCISCO — In this series of podcasts, USA TODAY talks to tech entrepreneurs about what it takes to build a successful business.\n\nSeveral are serial entrepreneurs, with some shifting between start-ups and big companies, and back. Tech editor Laura Mandaro is joined by Shruti Gandi, CEO founder of venture capital firm Array Ventures, to ask questions like: What's the best way to raise money? How do you scale? How did you know it was time to rebrand? When did you know it was time to exit?\n\nGUSTO'S JOSH REEVES: HOW WE LEVERAGE OUR DOZENS OF SEED INVESTORS\n\nGusto, a San Francisco-based payroll and human resources company that started as Zen Payroll, late last year become one of the most recent start-ups to achieve unicorn status, meaning it had an estimated valuation of at least $1 billion. It also has an unusual investor restructure — about several dozen founders, CEOs and individuals (from Box founder Aaron Levie to actor Jared Leto to Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang), invested in the company, as well as venture capital firms such as Google Capital.\n\nWe've always thought of fundraising as very much like hiring. Because every single person that's an investor in Gusto represents us, is an ambassador, and a result now is part of our community, Reeves said on the podcast.\n\nWhen we were deciding to do our seed round, we did take at that point about 20 individuals. We weren't ready to rush to the alter with a VC, he said. Gusto's management uses these numerous seed investors for strategic help. Their perspective on these topics, being able to talk to them through things like hiring, goal setting.. has been incredibly invaluable.\n\nReeves also lays out Gusto's goals to increase women in its workforce: hiring one female engineer for every male engineer.\n\nFor more: Read Gandhi's take Gusto's mission-driven culture.\n\nLATA KRISHNAN: HOW TO WORK AS A HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEAM\n\nLata Krishnan, now CFO of tech investment fund Shah Capital Partners in Santa Clara, Calif., was part of that select group, long before Silicon Valley entered its first dot com boom. In 1989, she started manufacturing firm Smart Modular Technologies with her husband and a co-worker with a classic boot-strap approach: For their only round of funding, they liquidated their IRA and turned to friends for help. Husband-wife leadership teams aren't the norm in Silicon Valley – but they exist. The founders of Flickr, Eventbrite and PopSugar all at one point ran their firms as husband-wife teams.\n\nWorking with a husband as a partner brings challenges: skepticism on the part of investors and a potential toll on the marriage. On the flipside, founders say you get implicit trust in the person you're working most closely with.\n\nI don't think this is a recipe for everyone, she says in this podcast. Being able to separate yourselves in the workplace, was key.\n\nCAMPAIGN MONITOR'S ALEX BARD: HOW TO OVERCOME THE FUNDRAISING 'NO'\n\nI learned, really from my Dad, that you have to fight for what you believe is right. You have to take risks, and you have to work hard. Those are the words that have stayed with Alex Bard, CEO of email marketing firm Campaign Monitor.\n\nBard has been part of starting four tech companies, and he sold his last two — Assistly and Gooey — to Salesforce and AOL, respectively.\n\nDespite a successful exit from Gooey, when he went to raise money for Assistly during the aftermath of the 2007-2008 crisis — a time of light venture capital coffers — he and his co-founder weren't greeted with open arms. We pitched 30-40 VCs. We got a lot of 'soft nos.' 'Soft nos' are 'we love you and the team but we don't know how big the market is.'\n\nWhat kept him going? He was committed to his idea. If you're deeply passionate about the things you're doing, all the no's in the world aren't going to stop you. If your'e not truly passionate and committed, you're going to fail, he says on the podcast.\n\nWhat do you want to hear from entrepreneurs of all stages? Tweet us or tell us in the comments below.
Mary Cadden\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt turns out that having serious trust issues can be a very good thing. At least when it comes to fiction.\n\nBest sellers The Girl on the Train, Gone Girl and Luckiest Girl Alive prove the point. Fiona Barton's The Widow (NAL, 324 pp., *** out of four stars) is a psychological thriller with enough twists and turns to fit perfectly on the shelf alongside the gaggle of aforementioned girls.\n\nThe Widow opens in an English university town four years after the alleged abduction and murder of 2-year-old Bella Elliott. The prime suspect remains Glen Taylor, a mild-mannered delivery driver whose professional aspirations are never realized and whose childless marriage is put under scrutiny. The only problem is, Bella has never been found and now Glen, released after an unsuccessful prosecution, is dead in an accident.\n\nThe result is even more press coverage, more police inquiries and much more pressure for the widow, Jean Turner.\n\nTold primarily from Jean's point of view, The Widow weaves back and forth in time. We also see the story from the viewpoints of Bob Sparkes, the detective who originally worked the case, and Kate Waters, the reporter angling for an exclusive with the widow. But it is only the widow's actions and thoughts we witness firsthand.\n\nAnd those thoughts, as well as appearances, can be deceiving.\n\nOld questions arise and new ones emerge. Was it really Glen? Was he innocent? What does Jean know? Is she in denial or was she in league? Was it all a big misunderstanding?\n\nBarton skillfully weaves a tale that reminds us that yes, we can be deceived by others, but we can just as easily deceive ourselves. Perception is a two-way street. A stranger or a loved one can play a role or act a part until it feels real.\n\nAnd here is where the brilliance of The Widow lies. Whom do you trust? Whom can you trust? And not just others but ourselves as well. The Widow reminds us that relationships are not black and white to those in them — they're forever grey.
We're getting closer and closer, Bachelor Nation: It's fantasy suite week in Gold Coast, Australia! But will one woman's request keep Peter from sealing the deal with her fellow contestants?\n\nLet's jump in.\n\nin Monday's episode of The Bachelor, Madison pulls Peter aside and tells him that if he sleeps with someone else, it would be hard for her to move forward. She insists she doesn't want to tell him what to do – but to any rational viewer, that's what is happening. She still doesn't mention that she is saving herself for marriage, making her ask all the more awkward.\n\nWhat's also awkward: Madison, Victoria F. and Hannah Ann will spend the week together while each goes on her fantasy suite date with Peter.\n\nFirst up is Hannah Ann. The pair go Jet Skiing, which made us jealous. (If you're reading this and want to take us on a Jet Skiing date, we're listening.) They reminisce about hometowns and she grows emotional explaining how she won't leave him after their date. (She's going to have to be patient when the other women have their turns.) Predictably, beach and ocean make outs ensue.\n\nPeter later thanks her for not allowing doubt to creep in. She says when she lets someone in, she's all in.\n\nWhen I look at him, it's like a reflection of my heart, she says. The pair head off to the fantasy suite and drink champagne – which, if she's watching, must twist the knife (cork?) for poor Kelsey.\n\nIt doesn't seem like the date is super PG, though we obviously don't know what happens. But Madison is right to be concerned.\n\nLast week:'The Bachelor' recap: Peter bails on Victoria F.'s hometown date but Kelsey goes home\n\nVictoria F., Peter finally communicate\n\nPeter and Victoria F. take a helicopter ride over Gold Coast and pop over to a beautiful waterfall. Peter thinks they've proven to each other they don't want to give up. But perhaps they should! To refresh your memory: Exes consistently (and mysteriously) show up on their dates and Peter and Victoria can't seem to communicate.\n\nStill, Peter feels horrible about not meeting her family and he says it meant a lot to him when she surprised him the next day.\n\nElsewhere: Madison tells Hannah Ann she told Peter she didn't know if she'd be able to continue if he slept with other women. Consider the pot stirred.\n\nAt dinner, Victoria tries to explain why she is the way she is regarding communication. She says that in her last relationship she wasn't asked about her feelings, so when Peter asks her things, she gets defensive. She wants him to tell her what she needs to give him. He says that he needs 100% confidence that he can count on her and lean on her even if he says something the wrong way. He doesn't want her to run away when that happens.\n\nShe explains she didn't feel good enough for her ex, and Peter says he wants her to feel like she deserves all the love in the world. Say what you will about Peter, but he is sweet.\n\nDespite a bit of a return to drama, the pair partake in the fantasy suite. We see Victoria and Peter cuddle in bed together the next morning (sorry, Madison) and she tells him she's in love with him.\n\nPeter matches that enthusiasm in an aside, plus a little extra: He admits he's in love with all three women. This isn't Big Love, Peter, you can't marry them all.\n\nThis indeed happened:'Bachelor' contestant Victoria Fuller apologizes for White Lives Matter controversy\n\nMadison tells the truth – and so does Peter\n\nMadison and Peter visit Skypoint (Australia's highest external building climb, according to its website). After a long elevator ride, they don harnesses and climb stairs to the top.\n\nSometimes the wind is against you and the world is against you, but you just keep going, you keep taking those steps, Madison says. This show is never subtle about metaphors.\n\nPeter later tells Madison that he's been torn about her request, as he has two other relationships. She says she was discouraged and disappointed before fantasy suite week and didn't want to put him in an uncomfortable position or give him an ultimatum.\n\nThen the truth: She tells him she's saving herself for marriage. Peter respects her commitment and asks what her expectations are from him. She says she wouldn't be able to say yes to an engagement (!) or continue if he's slept with the other women. She is not trying to come across as judgmental, but those are her expectations. Madison has pushed herself already but explains he's worth it. We ask again: Did she know about Peter's windmill escapades from The Bachelorette?\n\nPeter admits he's been intimate and that he can't lie about that. It's vague enough to keep us guessing about his sexual escapades this week but clear enough to show he didn't value her request.\n\nHe says he can see them together at the end, but can see it with others, too. Madison excuses herself, frustrated and mad.\n\nHe finds her and whispers that he's sorry. I can't lose you, he says. They embrace for an excruciatingly long time. She says that she can't change who she is and he tells her not to walk away … then, she does.\n\nWhat does that mean? We're going to have to wait until next week to find out.\n\nAh, yes, hometowns:'The Bachelor' recap: Peter picks final four women for hometown dates; pressure ratchets up\n\nWe love to see it:What is 'Bachelor Live on Stage' exactly?

PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. – In the latter part of 2017, Rory McIlroy couldn't wait to get off the golf course.\n\nNow he can't wait to get to one.\n\nThe last time I sat in an interview room on the PGA Tour I wasn't feeling too good about myself, McIlroy said Wednesday ahead of his debut in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. It's good to be back in the States and playing again. I'm feeling healthy. I'm excited to be back, I'm excited for this year.\n\nMcIlroy has had better years than the one he endured in 2017. He never got right after suffering a stress fracture of a rib, which led to other aches and pains, and basically the only highlights during the year were his marriage to Erica Stoll and the beginning of a relationship with TaylorMade when he changed equipment.\n\nHe never found a playing rhythm during the season as he missed significant periods of time that deprived him of playing opportunities and limited his training. For the first time since 2008, McIlroy, 28, went a year without winning anywhere in the world. And the four-time major champion hasn't won since he left Atlanta as the 2016 Tour Championship and FedExCup victor.\n\nBy the time he was done playing for the year in early October, the four-time major champion and winner of 22 worldwide events – 13 on the PGA Tour – was mentally and physically gassed.\n\nBut after nearly four months to rest, relax, rejuvenate and have just a recalibration of what I need to do to be at (an elite level), he said, McIlroy kicked off the new year in fine fashion.\n\nMore:Mickelson feeling the momentum swinging in his favor\n\nMore:Woodland beats Reavie in playoff to capture Phoenix Open\n\nIn January he finished in a tie for third in the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship and was second in the Dubai Desert Classic on the European Tour. While he was disappointed not to have won, he called them great building blocks.\n\nI was a little bit anxious to see how I was going to play, said McIlroy, the former No. 1 who is now No. 8 as he's gone 22 worldwide starts without a victory, although he's had 11 top-10s during the stretch. I was very happy to get into tournament mode quite easily and quite quickly. … I was really happy flying away from Dubai after those two weeks. I feel like where my game's at and how I'm feeling, if I do what I know I can do, I'll have chances.\n\nAnd he's feeling great about playing this week with his favorite playing partner – his father, Gerry. McIlroy, who beat his father for the first time when he was 11 or 12 – I remember feeling a little bad about it, McIlroy said – has played with his father in the European Tour's Alfred Dunhill Links Championship numerous times.\n\nOne of the reasons we came here is, obviously, I'm playing with my dad, McIlroy said. It's a tournament that I've always watched and I've always thought one day it would be really cool to play with my dad. And we've played the last three days and it's been a lot of fun and I just hope he hasn't tired himself out. He's got a lot of golf left over the next few days.\n\nMcIlroy has a lot of golf in front of him, too. No longer feeling worn out, he's mentally and physically fit to play six of seven weeks in a big run up to the Masters and he's once again ready to chase trophies and records.\n\nI want to be one of the best players to ever have played the game when I decide to call it a day, he said. And I know with the right dedication and working on the right things that that could be achievable for me.

There have been seven NFL coaching changes this offseason, some good, some bad, some so inexplicable they won't be believed in two years when the team is making another coaching change. (A spot usually reserved for the Redskins.) Here are FTW's rankings of the seven changes for the 2016 season.\n\n7. Philadelphia Eagles: Doug Pederson (offensive coordinator, Kansas City Chiefs)\n\nFrom the failed annals of don't fire for the sake of firing, we have the Philadelphia Eagles who, unhappy with all the power they bestowed upon Chip Kelly, were forced to fire a promising coach because, like a parent who gives a nine-year-old the keys to the car, then gets mad when the nine-year-old crashes, they couldn't take back that power and just let Kelly what he does best. So what did Jeffrey Lurie have in mind when he sought out to find Kelly's replacement? Well, he had to, uh, be a football coach. And knowing the game was a definite plus. And, I guess just wanting to come to Philadelphia to sign a contract was pretty much the main prerequisite. That's how you end up with the blergh hire of Doug Pederson, who was coaching in high school just eight years ago (the Eagles love those quick-risers, don't they) and served as offensive coordinator under Andy Reid for the past three seasons in Kansas City. And had never been interviewed by an NFL team. And was as nondescript as Kelly was high profile. Pederson might be perfectly fine, though I look at him and, I don't know why, just see a younger Norv Turner. INSPIRING! Oh, Pederson, who didn't call plays for Kansas City, was reportedly calling plays during the Chiefs' Reid-esque drive against the Patriots — the one that seemed to defy all conventions of space and time and felt like it lasted as long as The Revenant.\n\n6. Tennessee Titans: Mike Mularky (interim coach, Tennessee Titans)\n\nWhen you bring in a guy to coach a 1-7 team and he ends up going 2-6, there's really no way you can't hire him to be the full-time coach.\n\n5. Miami Dolphins: Adam Gase (offensive coordinator, Chicago Bears)\n\nUnless Bill Belichick suddenly resigns after a Super Bowl win and the Pats replace him with one of those kids from Modern Family, Gase will be the youngest coach in the league. The youth movement is great but being Peyton's sounding board for two seasons and turning Jay Cutler from a 5-11 quarterback into a 6-10 quarterback isn't exactly the resume of a future Don Shula.\n\n4. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Dirk Koetter (offensive coordinator, Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n\nIf you didn't know much about the Jacksonville Jaguars, Atlanta Falcons or Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the places Dirk Koetter has served as offensive coordinator over the last few years, you'd probably assume that a dude named Dirk, who was so coveted by the Bucs that they pushed out Lovie Smith for him after just two years, would be a hotshot young coordinator like Gase or someone else ranked high on this list. Well, surprise! Koetter is nine months younger than Lovie Smith (he'll be 57 when the season starts) which makes him about the same age as Marvin Lewis and Mike Smith and the 10th oldest coach in the NFL. Now, as Aalyiah taught us, age ain't nothin' but a number. And though Bucs management isn't exactly the model for which NFL teams should strive, the fact that they really wanted Koetter gives this some bonus points. Unlike in Philly, this wasn't a change for the sake of change.\n\n3. Cleveland Browns: Hue Jackson (offensive coordinator, Cincinnati Bengals)\n\nThe Bengals had to go through Mike Shula, Bruce Coslet and Dick LeBeau before striking silver with Marvin Lewis, a good coach who has seven wild-card appearances and seven wild-card losses. The Cardinals had to go through Gene Stallings, Joe Bugel, Buddy Ryan, Vince Tobin, Dave McGinnis and Dennis Green before Ken Whisenhunt had two years of glory, fell from grace, and then the Cardinals walked into the coach with the third-highest winning percentage in the last four years (behind Bill Belichick and just behind Pete Carroll). Is this the Browns answer? Hue Jackson is the second-best hire on this list, but I don't know if it matters. The Cleveland Browns could't even make Bill Belichick into a .500 coach. Since then its been Chris Palmer, Butch Davis, Romeo Crennel, Eric Mangini, Pat Shumur, Rob Chudzinski and Mike Pettine. The organization is such a mess that Jackson is set up for failure. I don't know if the return of Belichick could break this team from its losing ways.\n\n2. New York Giants: Ben McAdoo (offensive coordinator, New York Giants)\n\nSeven years before he got his crack at one of the 32 head-coaching jobs in the NFL, the 35-year-old was a defensive backs coach in college. Then he took the same job in the NFL, followed by a single season as a defensive coordinator before getting hired out of obscurity. That was Mike Tomlin, who has had great success (with one Super Bowl ring) in his nine years with Pittsburgh. McAdoo's path is similar: Now 38, he was a graduate assistant at Pittsburgh (the college) just 13 years ago. Then he had some quality control jobs until 2005 before serving as a tight ends coach for six years, then two seasons as a quarterbacks coach and two seasons as an offensive coordinator before getting his call. So, while Tomlin's rise was more meteoric, he and McAdoo rode a similar path (minus the defense vs. offense thing). That, of course, means nothing — they're two different men. But give me a young up-and-comer over a retread or a guy who's been passed over for more jobs than your hippie uncle any day. (Also, bonus for the facial hair and ill-fitting suit. Great coaches no longer are guys who look good in suits.)\n\n1. San Francisco 49ers: Chip Kelly (head coach, Philadelphia Eagles)\n\nOthers may end up being better coaches, but Chip Kelly is the best coach on this list right now. To use the Bill Parcells analogy for perhaps the three billionth time, Kelly's dishes in Philly were fine, it was the ingredients that stunk up the joint. I don't know how well he'll get along with the Niners front office — his ego seems similar to Jim Harbaugh's and look how long that marriage lasted. I'm not as quick to say that Colin Kaepernick's career will be brilliantly revived just from Kelly's mere gaze. But I believe that if Chip Kelly is left to coaching a team, he's going to be a top-tier NFL coach and San Francisco is as good a place to do that as any.

He said, 'I will destroy you, you can get all the lawyers you want, you've been warned.' \n\nAccording to the complaint, as reported by E!, Hoppy approached Frankel and boyfriend Dennis Shields at the school and said, Okay I see. This is how you want to do this. Okay. You can play your game. It doesn't matter. You can get 10 lawyers. There's nothing you can do to stop me. You'll be sorry. You've been warned. I can't help it.

Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\nBethenny Frankel opens up about her' divorce\n\nBethenny Frankel offers advice on how to keep your man\n\nAs the NYPD spokeswoman told People, the Skinnygirl mogul said Hoppy had sent numerous emails and FaceTime calls numbering in the hundreds, following her legal team sending him a cease and desist letter in November 2016.\n\nThere are no words to express how saddened Mr. Hoppy is over his ex-wife's unjustified actions, Hoppy attorney Robert C. Gottlieb told People. His only concern is his daughter and intends to vigorously fight these false charges.\n\nFrankel and Hoppy announced their split in December 2012 after three years of marriage, and endured a brutal four-year divorce battle before finally splitting last year, spanning seasons of RHONY and the Frankel-focused spinoffs Bethenny Getting Married? and Bethenny Ever After.\n\nIn a post-divorce interview with Us Weekly, Frankel claims Hoppy hacked into her computer, read her emails, secretly recorded their conversations and called her a witch in front of their daughter, telling Frankel, You're finished. You're done. I'm going to ruin you.'
Katrina Trinko\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nWhat women want is clearly not the current sexual climate.\n\nIn these months of the #MeToo movement, it's become clear that too many prominent men got away with sexual misconduct or assault. Women have come forward, speaking directly and powerfully about the terrible experiences they underwent.\n\nBut the latest entry in women telling their stories, an anonymous 23-year-old's account of her date with comedian and actor Aziz Ansari to the website Babe, suggests the issues women are grappling with are broader than outright sexual assault and inappropriate power dynamics in the workplace.\n\nMore:In the #MeToo era, the audience deserves a voice\n\nRelated:Readers' best comments on Aziz Ansari scandal\n\nThe woman (who goes by Grace in the piece) describes Ansari, after the two have dinner together, being aggressively sexual with her in his apartment: Everything was pretty much touched and done within 10 minutes of hooking up, except for actual sex.\n\nGrace used verbal and non-verbal cues to indicate how uncomfortable and distressed she was, wrote Babe. Grace explicitly told Ansari at one point, by her account, that, I said I don't want to feel forced because then I'll hate you, and I'd rather not hate you. While she thought Ansari got it, he soon after indicated he wanted her to perform oral sex on him again.\n\nAnsari, who has a reputation for being a comedian with respect for women and who wore a Time's Up pin at the Golden Globes, said in a statement he thought the activities during this date were completely consensual. He added that after Grace texted him her concerns following the date, he was surprised and concerned and took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.\n\nWe can change things\n\nBut like the viral December New Yorker fictional story Cat Person, about a girl who goes ahead with sex with a guy, even after she realizes she isn't interested, Grace's story seems to have widely resonated — an indication things aren't right in our culture.\n\nAnd it doesn't have to be this way.\n\nFirst, what if guys start approaching dates — and sex — less selfishly? Sure, there's an element of push and pull in a lot of romantic dynamics, but if more men started seeing dates as a chance to spend time with someone they were growing to care about and wanted to get to know better, instead of a mind game about how fast they could get to how many bases, it'd be well, a whole different ball game. It's hard to imagine the events Grace described, assuming her account is accurate, occurring if she had been on a date with a guy whose focus was her, not his own sexual gratification.\n\nMore from Trinko:'Merry Christmas' is bigger than ever under Trump\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nSecondly, what if we stopped rushing sex so much? Grace's account happens on the first date. That's just insane. You can't know someone well after one date, or even after a few dates. (First of all, hello, almost anyone who's not bonkers can hold it together for a few dates.) No wonder there's so many communication issues — how the heck could you know someone's communication style after one dinner?\n\nI know that there's just about nothing derided more by our current culture than prudishness, but delaying sex in relationships, until there's actually well, a relationship, or even marriage, could largely eliminate this kind of terrible encounter. In fact, a 2010 study published in the Journal of Family Psychology found that couples who waited later in the relationship or until marriage to have sex had better satisfaction, sex and, oh yes, communication.\n\nAnd lastly, women, it's OK to be rude. It's OK to not be nice. It's OK to hurt a guy's feelings. In the Cat Person story, there's this heartbreaking passage before the heroine decides to go ahead with sex she doesn't want:\n\nIt wasn't that she was scared he would try to force her to do something against her will but that insisting that they stop now, after everything she'd done to push this forward, would make her seem spoiled and capricious, as if she'd ordered something at a restaurant and then, once the food arrived, had changed her mind and sent it back.\n\nWomen, no matter what some horny guy tries to mansplain to you, you don't need to ever say yes to sexual contact you don't want.\n\nIn all the grief of this moment, there's also an opportunity: We can change things. Let's hope that this is the start of a new era where we start focusing on loving and valuing each other — not just having sex.\n\nKatrina Trinko, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is managing editor for The Daily Signal.

1. The Peyton coronation?\n\nEverybody seems to assume this will be Peyton Manning's final game in the NFL, meaning it'll be the last time we'll see the greatest quarterback who has ever, or will ever, live* on the playing field, fittingly in the biggest game of the season for a championship that has eluded him in all but one of his 18 seasons. Then again, the same folks making these assumptions thought the Patriots would roll over the Broncos, so assume at your own risk. But either way, big games need big players and Super Bowl 50 has the biggest one in the sport. He's 1-2 lifetime in Super Bowls, including a 43-8 shellacking at the hands of Seattle in Super Bowl XLVIII. How will Peyton react this time with it all on the line?\n\n* Others may end up with better numbers than Manning as the NFL increasingly becomes a quarterback-friendly league, but it's hard to fathom someone doing what he's done at such a high level for so long. And as we mentioned yesterday, Manning has done this largely by himself. Brady had the best coach of his generation helping out.\n\n2. Old versus new\n\nWhen Peyton and Cam Newton line up under center, they will have the largest age gap between any two quarterbacks in NFL history at 13 years, 48 days. Manning will also become the oldest QB to start the game, while Newton is looking to become the only Heisman Trophy winner to win the national championship, Super Bowl and MVP (this assumes Newton will be named NFL MVP, which he will). For what it's worth, Peyton didn't win a Heisman or a national championship, by the way.) Also, Peyton might crack a smile if he wins the Super Bowl while Newton might give the most entertaining MVP acceptance speech ever.\n\n3. A star becomes a superstar?\n\nCam Newton has been a star all his life, even while wallowing on the bench at Florida. Some guys just have that personality — that panache. So when he went to Auburn, won the Heisman, led the Tigers to a national championship and became the first player taken in the draft, it's all felt like a build-up to now, when Newton can turn himself into a legend. Doesn't this just feel like Cam's time, like everything is lining up perfectly for him to become one of the five biggest stars in sports? And win or lose, he's going to be entertaining as hell doing it. (This is what I don't get when people say they don't like Newton. I can see not liking the bravado and whatnot. But everything else? Are you against fun? Are you the preacher from Footloose? C'mon. Cam and the Panthers have fun and that alone is reason to watch on Feb. 7.)\n\n4. No. 1 vs. No. 1\n\nThere's a whole lot of No. 1s from which to choose, This is the third-straight year the two No. 1 seeds have played in the Super Bowl (one game was a classic, the other — not so much). It also pits the No. 1 scoring (and overall) defense against the No. 1 scoring offense. (But Carolina is a lowly 11th in yards, which speaks to their own defensive strength and a special teams that creates short fields from Cam and Co.) The last time the best offense and best defense met should be familiar to Denver: In Manning' second season, his high-powered, record-breaking, offense entered the game as a considerable favorite over Seattle's phenomenal defense. That time, with the shoes on the other foot, those offensive Broncos were offensive, getting embarrassed by Richard Sherman and the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII. So be careful before crowning the Panthers. Dennis Green knows what I mean.\n\n5. Cam Newton dominating media day\n\nSuper Bowl media day is the worst, most overrated day in sports, but it's even worse depending on the participants. Of the four title-game contenders, here's how they'd have ranked in terms of media day interest:\n\nNo. 947 — New England\n\nNo. 31 — Denver\n\nNo. 26 — Arizona\n\nNo. 1 — Carolina\n\nThe difference between New England and Denver is basically negligible because neither quarterback would say anything of note and Bill Belichick might as well have taken a vow of silence every Super Bowl week. Carson Palmer might have a personality, I'm not sure. There was only one team that could have made media day into something worth watching and that was the Panthers with Cam Newton, Josh Norman, a member of the 1985 Bears in Ron Rivera, a group of receivers who think they're far better than they are, Luke Kuechly (good for some aw shucks moments) and just a team that is feeling it right now. I don't think Cam is going to let his team come out like entitled idiots — everything he said on Sunday, a time to celebrate if there ever was one, was geared toward reminding everyone the job wasn't done. But with Cam's thousand-watt smile, we're due for a good line or two.\n\n6. The 50th\n\nOkay, first of all, let's have a semantical chat: This is not the 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl. This is the 50th Super Bowl. Anniversaries start one year after an event while an event takes a full year to have its first anniversary. (It's why a baby is zero years old until they turn one, but since they lived that year zero, the moment they turn one actually begins the second year of their life. Let's say a couple had been married on Jan. 15, 1967, the day of the first Super Bowl. Their 50th anniversary wouldn't have been until 2017, even though their 50th year of marriage would begin on Jan. 16, 1967. So, while you're guaranteed to hear some misinformation about anniversaries this week, remember this is only the 49th for the Super Bowl. The reason the NFL is celebrating something everyone else would wait another year to celebrate is because the league rigidly stuck to the idiotic numbering of Super Bowls, meaning its hand was forced because you can't celebrate a 50th anything at Super Bowl LI. It has to come at Super Bowl 50. That was a lot of words for one small plea: Don't call this the 50th anniversary game, please.\n\n7. Nostalgia\n\n\n\nThe NFL does a lot of things wrong and a lot of things right, but celebrating itself is in the latter category. Though the league hasn't revealed all that's in store for Santa Clara, I'd imagine a grand celebration of Super Bowl memories that includes famous stars and coaches of the game, plus Super Bowl MVPs. Thanks to the relative youth of the game, there's a surviving MVP from all 49 previous games. (Harvey Martin, who sadly passed in 2001, was an MVP of Super Bowl XLII, though his co-MVP — the only time that happened in history — Randy White is still with us.) Pomp and circumstance are every bit as much a part of the Super Bowl as throwing and running, but this time it'll be deserved and should be a great trip down memory lane. Oh, and there will be montages — montages as far as the eye can see.\n\n8. Coldplay\n\nApparently Beyonce will also be there, which means her publicist will be working full-time over the next three weeks.\n\n9. It's the best team from the AFC and the best team from the NFC.\n\nForget No. 1 seeds, they're only barometers of how a team played in the regular season, which has no bearing on play in the postseason. So while both the No. 1 seeds made it, what's more important is that the team playing the best football in the AFC is facing off against the team playing the best football in the NFC. And, really, what more could you want than that?
Bill Keveney\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nBryan Cranston's effort to get away from TV eventually brought him back there.\n\nThe Emmy winner's three-year voluntary moratorium on small-screen roles, an attempt to avoid being swallowed up by the phenomenon of Breaking Bad, led him to All the Way, Robert Schenkkan's Tony-winning play about President Lyndon Johnson's fight to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its potential effect on that year's election. It's now an HBO film (Saturday, 8 p.m. ET/PT).\n\nCranston, exhilarated by awards, enters next stage\n\nI read it and I went, 'Wow! This is phenomenal. This is what I should do,'  Cranston says. Johnson's harshly criticized management of the Vietnam War often overshadows his domestic agenda, where  he was as accomplished as anyone outside of FDR in the last century.\n\nAlthough LBJ had the public's support after President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, passing civil-rights legislation was no easy feat.\n\nThe president had to navigate between Southern segregationists, led by his mentor, Georgia Sen. Richard Russell (Frank Langella); the Northern liberal establishment embodied by Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey (Bradley Whitford); and activists seeking rights for African-Americans, led by Martin Luther King Jr. (Anthony Mackie).\n\nCompromise was not yet a dirty political word, Whitford says.\n\nThere's horrible cynicism about politics. One of the fundamental messages of this film is that politics matter, The West Wing alum says. It's important to see these flawed, complicated people doing more than just standing on principle. They were fighting to move the ball forward — in an imperfect way.\n\nKing had to compromise with Johnson and with his fellow activists.\n\nEven though (King and Johnson) saw the world differently, they had respect for each other. They compromised a great deal, Mackie says. With Dr. King, the idea of chipping away at the block was more understandable than trying to knock the block over. He realized that if he could get civil rights, the next step would be voting rights.\n\nJohnson felt he was doing the right thing, Cranston says, but there was a cost. He was willing to lose the South for the greater good of gaining the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, which came a year later.\n\nThe film expands the roles of King and Johnson's wife, Lady Bird (Melissa Leo), who was a remarkable woman, says Leo, who says she believes Lady Bird helped LBJ's political success. It was a partnership of a marriage.\n\nAdapting the play required a trade-off, Cranston says. On stage, you have a relationship with the audience that is rewarding, an exchange. You lose that in film, but you gain the ability to be smaller, subtle, nuanced.\n\nAnd a larger audience: More people will see this on (Saturday) than saw it on Broadway, says Schenkkan, who adapted his play for the screen.\n\nFilm also means close-ups, and Cranston went through long makeup sessions that included putting on a prosthetic nose and ears and thinning his hair to look more like LBJ.\n\nHowever, physical augmentations only go so far, says director Jay Roach, who directed Cranston in 2015's Trumbo.\n\nBryan Cranston inhabits two historic figures\n\nThe main transformational component is Bryan, says Roach (HBO's Recount and Game Change). I had never seen in a Johnson portrayal the sense of humor but also the pressure he could (apply) while joking with you, that Texan charm. I knew Bryan could do that.
Andrew Wolfson\n\nLouisville (Ky.) Courier Journal\n\nIt was a sad sight: Stripped of his crown, the former heavyweight champion of the world was reduced to making a paid appearance at a boat show in his hometown of Louisville, Ky.\n\nI am not allowed to work in America and I'm not allowed to leave America, Muhammad Ali said in February 1968, at the start of his first full year of exile from boxing. I'm just about broke.\n\nMarried a year with his first child on the way, Ali was so desperate his manager tried to arrange a bout in Arizona on an Indian reservation – outside the reach of state boxing commissions that wouldn't let him fight. But the Pima tribe rejected the proposal, saying it would defile the memory of Indian veterans who'd fought for their country.\n\nThe previous April, Ali had declared himself a conscientious objector and refused induction into the U.S. Army, famously saying, I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong.\n\nBy 1968, 19,560 Americans had died in the Vietnam War and another 16,502 would die that year alone. It was the year the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese army mounted the Tet Offensive, an ambitious campaign that helped persuade the American public that the war wasn't going as well as the generals and politicians had led them to believe.\n\nThe war was escalating, as was opposition to it. Just a few weeks before Ali said no to his draft board, Martin Luther King Jr., had denounced the war. He later quoted Ali in support of his position: As Muhammad Ali puts it, we are all — black and brown and poor — victims of the same system of oppression.\n\nAli was already one of America's greatest heavyweights ever. He'd won an Olympic gold medal for the United States in Rome when he was just 18 and four years later, against all odds, defeated Sonny Liston to win his first title as world champion.\n\nAnd in an era when most fighters let their managers do the talking, Ali thrived in the spotlight. He was the master of rhyming prediction and derision, as biographer David Remnick would later write. He was already the greatest, as he proclaimed himself, not just for his skills in the ring, but for talking trash – and doing it in verse.\n\nIt wasn't just what he said, but how he said it, poet Maya Angelou later put it.\n\n'Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee' – I mean, as a poet, I like that, she once said. If he hadn't put his name on it, I might have chosen to use that.\n\nNow Ali was paying the price for refusing to serve. Convicted of violating selective service laws and sentenced to five years in prison, he was free on bail. But his passport had been taken away, along with his ability to make a living.\n\nWith his characteristic bluster, he insisted he didn't ache for the money or the ring. Asked during a television appearance if he missed being heavyweight champion, he deadpanned, No, they miss me.\n\nBut sportswriter Dave Kindred, who interviewed Ali at the boat show for the Courier-Journal, wrote that the more Ali talked about not missing the ring, the more you realized he did.\n\nIt was his identity, Kindred said recently. Boxing gave him his sense of self.\n\nWithout it, recalled New York Times sportswriter Robert Lipsyte, who traveled with Ali in 1968, He could get moody and down. Without boxing, Lipsyte said, Ali was often alone – and he was not a guy who liked to be alone.\n\nIn the decades to come, his country and the world would come to embrace him as an ambassador of peace and goodwill. And after his death in 2016, his legacy grew larger still.\n\nSo it is easy to forget that 50 years ago, in the tumult of 1968, Ali didn't know how things would turn out, or if he'd ever fight again, said Bill Siegel, whose 2013 film, The Trials of Muhammad Ali, documented Ali's four years away from the ring.\n\nIt's easy, Siegel said, to forget that Ali was willing to sacrifice everything on principle.\n\nRefusing induction, Ali cited religious reasons, specifically, the Quran's ban on Muslims fighting Christian wars, but his objection was far broader.\n\nMy conscience won't let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people, or some poor hungry people in the mud for big powerful America, he said. And shoot them for what? They never called me nigger, they never lynched me, they didn't put no dogs on me, they didn't rob me of my nationality, rape and kill my mother and father. … Shoot them for what? How can I shoot them poor people?\n\nIt was a humbling year for Ali, but also one of remarkable growth. Exiled from boxing, he grew bigger than the sport.\n\nYet he was still widely reviled.\n\nPopular black athletes such as Jackie Robinson and Joe Louis denounced him. Time magazine, ripping him for his opposition to the war and his embrace of the Nation of Islam, called him Gaseous Cassius, a reference to what he called his slave name, Cassius Clay.\n\nIn Chicago, where he spent much of his banishment, Mayor Richard Daley refused to call him by his Muslim name, and Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner called him unpatriotic.\n\nOn British television, famed talk show host David Susskind excoriated Ali as a disgrace to his country, his race and what he laughingly describes as his profession. Ali, Susskind said, was a simplistic pawn and a fool.\n\nTo pay the bills and help support his wife, Khalilah, and their child, Ali embarked on a college speaking tour, earning pennies on the dollar compared to his time in the ring.\n\nHis first lecture, at Philadelphia's Temple University, paid $1,000. The next, at Cheney State College in Pennsylvania, half that.\n\nHe ended his appearance at Union College in New York with a poem: I like your school and admire your style, but your pay is so small, I won't be back for a while.\n\nAt first he was a terrible speaker, Lipsyte and others recalled. He spewed religious dogma from Nation of Islam, which he had joined four years earlier, regurgitating the words of its leader, Elijah Muhammad.\n\nAt University of Wisconsin, students booed when he denounced interracial marriage as a trick to keep us with the white man, as they did the next day in San Francisco when he complained about the marijuana smell wafting from the crowd and insisted no intelligent so-called Negro would allow his daughter to marry a white man.\n\nHe distanced himself from the Civil Rights Movement, telling 400 men and women he wouldn't join them in the Poor People's Campaign because I don't believe in turning the other cheek.\n\nI don't say we shall overcome, he said at another appearance, because I done overcame.\n\nBut Ali's speeches got better. He warmed to the crowds, and they to him. Lipsyte said Ali, though poorly educated, was a quick study.\n\nHe had a real intellectual growth spurt, Lipsyte said.\n\nAli developed his own consciousness, moving away from Nation of Islam orthodoxy. He delivered lengthy soliloquies on his objection to the war and his experience with racism in America.\n\nVerbally sparring with students forced him to become an independent thinker, said Kindred, who later wrote Sound and Fury: Two Powerful Lives, Fateful Friendship, a dual biography of Ali and sportscaster Howard Cosell,\n\nAnd as the anti-war movement grew, Ali became a hero.\n\nAnti-war activists didn't care what he said about Elijah or the Nation, they cared only that the most famous man on Earth shared their opposition to that war, Kindred said.\n\nHe became a man, Spiegel said.\n\nAli also helped move black radicalism into the mainstream, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. later wrote.\n\nHe forged an unlikely alliance with King, who on the face of it had no grounds for common cause or friendship. The Nation of Islam bitterly opposed integration. Malcolm X had derided King's seminal 1963 March on Washington as the Farce on Washington.\n\nBut King and Ali found common bond through their opposition to the war – and the hatred they both faced. Dave Zirin, sports editor of The Nation, wrote that famed 1968 Olympian and protester John Carlos once told him, If there was an Olympic sport for the number of death threats received, King and Ali would be fighting for the gold.\n\nKing, hoping Ali's story would inspire others to refuse to serve in the war, singled out the boxer for praise in a sermon.\n\nHe is giving up his fame, King said. He is giving up millions of dollars in order to stand for what his conscience tells him is right. No matter what you think of his religion, you have to admire his courage.\n\nIn May 1968, a federal appeals court affirmed Ali's conviction, saying Clay had been fairly accorded due process of law, without discrimination.\n\nBut Ali's popularity was soaring, and he knew it. While he was driving in the San Francisco Bay Area, a black man on a bicycle spotted Ali and thrust his hand through an open window, Lipsyte wrote in a column.\n\nLet me shake the hand of the only real heavyweight champion of the world, the man said.\n\nAli was overjoyed.\n\nThey made me bigger by taking my title, he told Lipsyte. Before, that chap on the street couldn't identify with me. He'd say, 'You not with me, you up on the hill with whitey.'\n\nThere are only two kinds of men, Ali continued, those who compromise and those who take a stand.\n\nAli told Pacifica Radio he was proud to say that I am the first man in the history of all America, athlete and entertainer-wise, who gave up all the white man's money, looked the white man in the eye, and told him the truth, and stayed with his people.\n\nIf he had ever lost his mojo, by October 1968 it was back.\n\nStriding down West 52nd Street in New York, he hummed a song in the cold evening air, walking with the bright swagger of a champion, Pete Hamill wrote in LIFE magazine. People stepped out of a steak house to watch him go by. Auto horns beeped in salute. A middle-aged lady asked him to autograph her newspaper.\n\nLook at me,' Ali said softly, Bigger than boxing. As big as all history.\n\nAs Ali's consciousness grew, so did the nation's.\n\nThe speeches were important, not just for Ali but for everyone who heard them, Lipsyte said.\n\nAli particularly influenced black athletes, as dramatically seen at the 1968 Summer Olympics when medalists John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists in the Black Power salute Smith later called an endorsement of all human rights.\n\nAfrican-American athletes today continue that tradition as they kneel during the National Anthem to protest mistreatment by police.\n\nBut his story inspired all athletes to stand up for equality in their sport, and beyond. Baseball players fought for free agency; track stars to end the sham of amateurism; and women for equal tennis prize money.\n\nI really believe if Ali hadn't done what he did, Smith and Carlos wouldn't have raised their fists, Arthur Ashe, the pioneering black tennis star who protested apartheid and raised awareness about AIDS, said in the 1995 oral history Muhammad Ali: The People's Champ.\n\nHe was largely responsible for it becoming an expected part of the black athlete's responsibility to get involved, Ashe said. He put it all on the line for what he believed in. And if Ali did that, who were the rest of us lesser athlete mortals not to do it?\n\nWith his Supreme Court appeal still pending, Ali's promoter arranged a fight in Georgia, which had no state boxing commission. Despite the objections of segregationist Gov. Lester Maddox, Ali took on Jerry Quarry in Atlanta on Oct. 26, 1970, and beat him in the third round.\n\nHis lawyers also won a court order forcing the New York State Athletic Commission to let him fight. The following March he lost the 15-round Fight of the Century to Joe Frazier.\n\nBut on June 28, 1971, he won his biggest victory: The Supreme Court unanimously overturned his conviction, saying his draft board failed to specify why his conscientious objector application was denied. Throughout the war, Selective Service granted more than 170,000 men C.O. status.\n\nAli twice reclaimed his heavyweight championship – and the hearts of some who supported the war. In 2005, wracked by Parkinson's, his hands shaking, he accepted the nation's highest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom, at a White House ceremony.\n\nThe American people, said President George W. Bush, are proud to call Muhammad Ali one of our own.\n\nFollow Andrew Wolfson on Twitter: @adwolfson. For more stories in the 1968 project, visit 1968.usatoday.com
While it might be common knowledge that Americans will spend billions of dollars this Valentine's Day season celebrating, it is lesser-known how Valentine's Day actually came about.\n\nLet's begin with St. Valentine – or the Valentines. As history.com points out, there are a number of Valentines – nearly all of them martyrs – that are connected to the holiday. However, St. Valentine of Terni might be the most famous, with two legends associated with him.\n\nUnder the rule of Claudius II, the Roman army relied largely on single men. In an effort to save lives, Valentine, who was the bishop of Terni at the time, would wed couples to keep husbands away from war. What a guy, right?\n\nUnfortunately for Valentine, the emperor didn't take too kindly to his noble romanticism and beheaded the bishop near the outskirts of Rome.\n\nThere is also the less violent fable that another man named Valentine was imprisoned by the Romans and sent a letter to a woman he loved with the signature, From your Valentine. And as history has it, a prison letter would ultimately spark the ideas for both valentine cards and the concept of valentine admirers.\n\nValentine's Day:These zoos will name a cockroach after your ex and feed it to an animal\n\nSo, this explains why the name is synonymous with love. But why the celebration? Cue the goat blood.\n\nLupercalia, a Roman-pagan holiday for fertility, can take credit for that. During the festival, a goat and a dog would be sacrificed. The hides were dipped in blood, and women were then whipped by the pelts of the dead animals. Strangely enough, the bloody pelts were supposed to increase the fertility of the women.\n\nAnd for the Lupercalia finale – which is named after Lupa, the she-wolf who raised Remus and Romulus – a couples lottery would ensue. Women would place their names in a jar, and a man would select a name from the jar and be paired with the woman for the rest of the festival. Often, these pairings would result in marriage.\n\nNot exactly the stereotypical teddy bear, roses and Hallmark card-gifting notions we've grown accustomed over the years. However, St. Valentine and romance – for better or worse – have historically always been linked.\n\nRelated:Coors Light will pay for Valentine's Day puppy love\n\nIn the 15th century, English poet and author Geoffery Chaucer would write about the mating season of birds on Valentine's Day in his book, Parlement of Foules. Hence, the idea of lovebirds. Later, Shakespeare would continue the romantic rhetoric referencing Ophelia as Hamlet's valentine, according to Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nThe commercial side of Valentine's Day cards and gifts would begin in the 19th century with Esther Allen Howland.\n\nAccording to a 2017 article in Time, Howland is often referred to as the Mother of the American Valentine. During the 1850s, Valentine's Day cards were often expensive and imported from Europe.\n\nHowland decided to make her own cards at a reasonable price. She hired some helping hands, began making celebratory cards, and during the height of her enterprise, she was making approximately $100,000 annually (a multimillion dollar business by today's standards).\n\nShe'd eventually sell her business to the George C. Whitney Co. in the late 1880s.

When Roseanne Barr's racist tweet last May led to the immediate cancellation of Roseanne, there didn't seem any purpose in trying to salvage ABC's top-rated revival.\n\nWithout the star who gave Roseanne its name and defined its working-class sensibility, why jury-rig a hollowed-out remake of what already was a retread, however well made and received? It was time to let it go.\n\nWell, I was wrong.\n\nThe Conners, which airs its season finale Tuesday (8 EST/PST), had a fine first season, both in quality and ratings: The spinoff, featuring the same cast minus Barr, is ABC's top comedy. Although financial considerations powered the second resurrection – even a faint facsimile of a big hit is likely to score more viewers than a new show – the Roseanne survivors (and I mean that on multiple levels) pulled off an engaging but at times uneven family sitcom that still dealt with real-world issues, if on less provocative terms.\n\nMore:'The Conners' recap: Parents face tough choices, with one that could change the whole show\n\nMore:How 'The Conners' moves on without fierce (and fired) matriarch Roseanne\n\nBarr's comedic brilliance and fearlessness (check out her Domestic Goddess standup routine) got Roseanne on TV in 1988 and made it a hit, but the show was always the sum of its many parts.\n\nEven without Barr, whose character was killed offscreen by an opioid overdose, there was more than enough for viewers to come back to Lanford, Illinois.\n\nWe had gotten to know Roseanne's husband, Dan (John Goodman), her sister, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf), and her daughter Darlene (Sara Gilbert) over 10 seasons, and that familiarity carries even more power in attracting an audience in today's cluttered TV universe.\n\nSitcoms fronted by standup comedians with little acting experience (think Seinfeld) are helped immensely by the skilled actors who surround them, and Roseanne had two of the best in Goodman and Metcalf (watch Lady Bird and try to argue she's not Oscar-worthy).\n\nMore:Could 'Roseanne' resurface, without Roseanne?\n\nMore:Review: 'The Conners' lacks Roseanne's bite but provides a satisfying meal\n\nIn a Conners home missing its matriarch, Goodman effortlessly steered Dan into a more centered, anchored persona, capable of drawing laughs but with an extra helping of fatherly gravitas. Metcalf has done her best to play Jackie as crazy and confused yet endearing, although the series could give her more opportunity to show her serious and sadder side, which it finally does in Tuesday's finale.\n\nGilbert continues to impress as Darlene, her mother's daughter in drawing blood with searing, sarcastic cuts delivered in deadpan style. Gilbert has grown into her more central role as a financially struggling mother of two, and her battles and heart-to-hearts with a willful teen daughter (Emma Kenney) recall her earlier role as the rebellious Conner adolescent.\n\nThe big surprise is the contribution of Lecy Goranson as Darlene's older sister, Becky. Goranson, who left the original show to attend college, has given single, 40-something Becky depth and vulnerability as the character tries to rein in her irresponsible, devil-may-care ways.\n\nMore:Roseanne will never change, and that's why her No. 1 show is canceled\n\nMore:'The Conners' reveals how the show kills off Roseanne – and fired Roseanne Barr responds\n\nIt's no surprise that Laurie is incredible and John is so brilliant, says Gilbert, an executive producer who helped reassemble the cast. Lecy had a lot to do and a very emotional storyline, and that was a thrill to watch.\n\nThe Conners has dealt unevenly with Becky's alcoholism: Some episodes confusingly aired out of order. and TV has a habit of resolving complicated real-life problems a little too patly.\n\nConners son D.J. (Michael Fishman) is another story, barely making an impact. His relative invisibility made it impossible for his military veteran wife, Geena (Maya Lynne Robinson), and daughter, Mary (Jayden Ray), to have much of a presence, either. That's unfortunate, because Geena had the potential to replace Roseanne's conservative viewpoint with one grounded more in military, cultural and religious beliefs than populism.\n\nThe Conners continues the welcome Roseanne tradition of showcasing working-class people in a TV comedy field full of affluent folks, as it highlighted pregnant Becky's concerns about the cost of raising a child and the family's fear of financial ruin after Dan's surprise hospital bill.\n\nI'm happy with the emotional truth of the season. I'm happy the show dealt with grief, especially the death of Roseanne, Gilbert says. We were a cast for 30 years, so we felt the loss (of Barr and the Roseanne character) and we tried to put that into the show.\n\nThe Conners preserved its predecessor's focus on lightning-rod issues, including illegal immigration, free expression and the changing rules of workplace romance, although without the in-your-face grit that Barr provided.\n\nMore:'The Conners' recap: What Johnny Galecki's visit means for Darlene-David marriage\n\nTo its credit, the show no longer serves as a cultural Rorschach test on President Donald Trump, whom Roseanne supported both on and off the show. The president played that up when Roseanne returned with gigantic ratings last spring, and Barr's support for Trump may have helped the show build an audience The Conners couldn't match. But the political disagreements between Roseanne and Jackie were never more than a minor element of the show.\n\nGilbert is hopeful for a second season (which seems highly likely, based on ratings), but she'd like it to be a shorter run like this season's 11 episodes. (She says there's also the possibility of more appearances by Johnny Galecki, who returns as Darlene's estranged husband in tonight's finale and will finish The Big Bang Theory this spring.)\n\nThe Conners will never have the sharp bite and delicious cackle of Roseanne (or the controversy, for that matter), but it proved it's still an engaging family without her. Now it just needs a couple of working-class TV neighbors.
CEDAR FALLS, Ia. — Sen. Joni Ernst says allegations by her ex-husband that she had an affair with a subordinate while serving in the military are not true.\n\nThat is not accurate and I was a company commander overseas and took that job very, very seriously, the Iowa Republican said.\n\nThe senator became emotional after answering several deeply personal questions from the media about her recent divorce, which includes allegations of affairs and a physical assault. She said it is difficult for her to talk about her own experience but vowed to continue supporting survivors of abuse.\n\nWhat I want people to understand is that I am the same person as I was last week. You just know more about what's inside of me now, she said.\n\nShe spoke with members of the media after a public town hall event on the University of Northern Iowa campus in Cedar Falls Wednesday, where the topic did not come up.\n\nIn court documents that have since been sealed from the public, Ernst and her ex-husband, Gail Ernst, accused each other of having affairs and Joni Ernst accused Gail Ernst of physically assaulting her. The documents were part of divorce filings. The divorce was finalized this month.\n\nGail Ernst accused Joni of having an affair with one of her soldiers while she was deployed as a company commander. He caught her secretly emailing him, he wrote.\n\nShe admitted to the affair, said she was sorry and begged me not to say anything, Gail Ernst wrote. But their daughter was 4 at the time, he wrote, so he swallowed (his) pride and kept quiet.\n\nJoni Ernst, speaking publicly about the allegations for the first time on Wednesday, said that a number of her former soldiers are extremely supportive of her.\n\nThey were online with me yesterday and texting me about how supportive they were, she said. And so I care about all of my soldiers. Many of them refer to me as 'Mom.' So no, the allegation is not true.\n\nThe Ernsts announced last summer that they were divorcing after a 26-year marriage.\n\nJoni Ernst said she believed the court documents would be sealed from the public, so media reporting on the allegations this week did catch me off guard.\n\nI am a survivor and I fully believe that our survivors have the right to keep their stories to themselves if they don't want to share those stories or are not ready to share those stories and unfortunately I have been forced to share my story, she said.\n\nA judge on Tuesday sealed most of the records in the divorce case at the request of the Ernsts. Under Iowa law, divorce records are automatically made public when the divorce is finalized. But parties can request to keep some records private.\n\nI would love to point the finger and say, 'Somebody screwed up. Somebody leaked.' But they're out there and so now I will deal with that, Ernst said. But what I want people to understand is that I am the same person as I was last week. You just know more about what's inside of me now.\n\nErnst, 48, a military veteran from Red Oak, Iowa, was the first woman in the state elected to either chamber of Congress. She defeated Democrat Bruce Braley in 2014 to win a six-year term in the Senate after emerging victorious from a five-way Republican primary for the nomination. She has said she will seek a second term in the Senate in 2020.\n\nAt some point while she was Montgomery County Auditor between 2005 and 2011, her husband had a special friendship with their daughter's babysitter, whom she said he spent time with even when their daughter was not there, Joni Ernst claimed in an October affidavit. The affidavit wasn't specific about when the argument happened, but she said she confronted her husband about it.\n\nWe went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage, Ernst wrote. I very nearly filed for divorce after a night that we argued, and it became physical.\n\nJoni Ernst said she fled to her mother's house with her daughter in the middle of the night. Gail Ernst followed soon after, crying and apologizing, according to her affidavit.\n\nThe next day, a victim's advocate at the courthouse performed an examination of Ernst's throat and head, she said. The advocate wanted to take Ernst to the hospital, according to the court filing. Ernst declined, writing that she was embarrassed and humiliated and did not want people to know about what she described as an assault.
Emma Robinson\n\n(Basildon, Essex) Echo\n\nESSEX, England — An English woman suspicious about her husband's past hired a private detective to look into it.\n\nAfter her own wedding ceremony last year, Wendy Lee became suspicious that her husband, David Jones, was already married.\n\nTo relieve her concerns, she hired a detective who soon found that Jones had been married — for 13 years.\n\nAfter the revelation, Lee called Essex Police who launched their own investigation into the 48-year-old.\n\nJones was arrested on suspicion of bigamy.\n\n'Sister Wives' guests ask judge to strike down bigamy laws\n\nDuring a police interview, Jones admitted the offense and accepted that he should have divorced his first wife before remarrying.\n\nJones, of Southend in Essex, England, appeared before magistrates after the court issued a warrant for his arrest because he had failed to turn up at a previous hearing.\n\nHe admitted the charge of entering a form of marriage during the life of your wife.\n\nAccording to a spokesman in the Crown Prosecution Service, which according to its website is the main prosecuting authority in England and Wales, Jones' relationship with his first wife had deteriorated but it was unclear whether he had a relationship with both women at the same time.\n\nJones received a four-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and also was ordered to carry out 100 hours of volunteer work.\n\nMontana man applies for polygamous marriage license\n\nHe was ordered to pay a victim surcharge of about $117 and pay about $124 to the Crown Prosecution Service.\n\nBigamy — the act of entering into a marriage with one person while still legally married to another — is illegal in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe penalty for committing bigamy is a prison term up to seven years, a fine or both.\n\nAccording to the latest Home Office statistics, there were 31 reports of bigamy from 2011-2012 and 44 reports in 2010-2011. The Home Office leads investigations into crime policy, immigration and passports and counter-terrorism.\n\nUnder U.K. law, a second marriage when one partner is already married is considered void.\n\nFollow Emma Robinson on Twitter: @emmarobinson14\n\nWife finds hubby — married — 9 years after he vanished
Elysa Gardner\n\n@elysagardner, USA TODAY\n\nWhen Panic At The Disco's drummer and founding member Spencer Smith left the group last year, some speculated that frontman Brendan Urie's next outing would be a solo one. The other musicians who formed Panic!'s original recording lineup had all departed before Smith, so what other option did Urie have? To become a one-man band?\n\nWell, yes, sort of. The album notes for Death Of A Bachelor (two and a half out of four stars), out Jan. 15, inform us that Panic! At The Disco now is Urie — as, say, Trent Reznor is Nine Inch Nails. Certainly, Urie's voice and vision have been central to Panic!; now free to pursue that vision independently, the singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist has turned for inspiration to a very famous pop singer of yore, one who would have celebrated his 100th birthday last year.\n\nIt turns out that Urie has been a Frank Sinatra fan since childhood, and has cited the Chairman of the Board as one reference point for Death; long-established Urie/Panic! fave Queen is another. So, presumably, is marriage: Urie took the plunge in 2013, giving up his solo status in that arena — though the romantic ambivalence and irreverence of certain lyrics here are bound to stoke the imaginations of some heartbroken fans.\n\nUrie has enlisted a horn section for the album, and he uses it exhaustively. The instruments blare over guitars and synth on the power-pop single Victorious; they surge atop a gospel-flavored chorus (and more guitars) on Hallelujah; they embellish the rock bombast of House of Memories and The Good, The Bad and The Dirty.\n\nThe horns swing, too, most conspicuously on the breathless Crazy = Genius, though that track seems more informed by '90s neo-swing than anything Sinatra recorded. And on the more contemplative title track and another ballad, Impossible Year, Urie's crooning shows little of the wit or nuance demanded by the tradition he seems to be acknowledging.\n\nHe fares much better with upbeat tracks such as Don't Threaten Me With A Good Time, which borrows the insanely catchy guitar riff from the B-52s' Rock Lobster and adds thrashing drums (and horns); and the exuberant LA Devotee, which features one of the most irresistible bridges you're likely to hear this year, with a sinuous bassline (and more horns).\n\nGive Urie -- Panic! At The Disco, that is -- credit for trying to fuse disparate influences into something fresh.\n\nPlaylist: Don't Threaten Me With A Good Time, LA Devotee.\n\nOhio University's Panic at the Disco cover is a band geek's dream
Following White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter's resignation, questions loom about his ex-wives' allegations of physical and mental abuse and his political career.\n\nThough Porter's last day with the administration was on Wednesday (a new staff secretary will be named soon), here's what we still want to know:\n\nDid domestic abuse come up in the FBI background check?\n\nIn order to work for the administration, he had to undergo an FBI background check.\n\nConsistent with the practice of past administrations, issues related to an individual's suitability are reviewed through a thorough and lengthy background check process, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said. Background checks involve a complex investigation run by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\nAccording to White House Deputy Press Secretary Raj Shah, the investigation into Shah's background was ongoing. His resignation took place before it could be completed.\n\nI'm not going to get into the specifics of the investigation itself, Shah said.\n\nDid the allegations affect his security clearance?\n\nThe ongoing investigation into his background had delayed Porter from receiving a full security clearance, the White House said.\n\nShah said Porter instead was working with an interim clearance, which allowed him access to certain classified national security information.\n\nAs staff secretary, Porter was responsible for the flow of presidential paperwork around the West Wing and to the president's desk. He would have ensured executive orders, decision memos, bills, nominations and other actions were thoroughly vetted before reaching the president.\n\nIn this role, Porter is essentially a gatekeeper for the Oval Office with direct access to Trump. He traveled with the president and was among the highest-paid aides in the White House. After John Kelly became chief of staff last summer, Kelly reportedly came to view Porter as a right-hand man.\n\nWho knew about the allegations?\n\nPorter's first wife, Colbie Holderness, reportedly told the FBI about her their marriage and shared photos of injuries she received while married to Porter.\n\nAnd last year, one of Porter's wives, Jennifer Willoughby, wrote about her abusive marriage. She never mentions Porter by name.\n\nWhen I tried to get help, I was counseled to consider carefully how what I said might affect his career, she wrote. And so I kept my mouth shut and stayed.\n\nGiven that Porter's service as the staff secretary started on Trump's first day in office, his inability to get a full clearance because of the allegations likely would have been flagged early on.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kelly initially defended Porter, saying he was a man of true integrity and honor.\n\nLater, he said he was shocked by the allegations against Porter, but stood by his previous comments.\n\nThere is no place for domestic violence in our society, he said. I stand by my previous comments of the Rob Porter that I have come to know since becoming chief of staff, and believe every individual deserves the right to defend their reputation.\n\nShah insisted on Thursday that Kelly and Trump did not become aware of the allegations against Porter until stories about the spousal abuse surfaced this week.\n\nMore:Rob Porter scandal, explained: Who is he, why he resigned, what his ex-wives say, more\n\nMore:White House staffer Rob Porter resigns amid abuse allegations
WASHINGTON – Stacey Abrams, who lost a tough Georgia gubernatorial campaign in the midterm elections, delivered the Democratic rebuttal to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night.\n\nAlthough many recent State of the Union responses have included embarrassing gaffes or quirky moments that have haunted the politician tasked with delivering it, most observers agree Abrams managed to avoid the State of the Union curse.\n\nAbrams delivered her speech with a friendly calm that made her criticisms of the president come across more as constructive criticism than scolding rebuke while still touching on key Democratic positions. And she did it without any gaffes that could spawn mocking memes.\n\n'Political games':Stacey Abrams blames Trump for shutdown\n\nHere is the full text of Abrams' remarks:\n\nGood evening my fellow Americans and happy Lunar New Year. I'm Stacey Abrams and I'm honored to join the conversation about the state of our union.\n\nGrowing up, my family went back and forth between lower middle class and working class, yet even when they came home weary and bone tired, my parents found a way to show us all who we could be.\n\nMy librarian mother taught us to love learning. My father, a shipyard worker, put in overtime and extra shifts. And they made sure we volunteered to help others. Later, they both became United Methodist ministers, an expression of the faith that guides us.\n\nThese were our family values. Faith, service, education and responsibility.\n\nNow, we only had one car, so sometimes my dad had to hitchhike and walk long stretches during the 30 mile trip home from the shipyards. One rainy night, my mom got worried. We piled in the car and went out looking for him, and we eventually found my dad making his way along the road, soaked and shivering in his shirt sleeves.\n\nWhen he got in the car, my mom asked if he had left his coat at work. He explained that he'd given it to a homeless man he'd met on the highway. When we asked why he'd given away his only jacket, my dad turned to us and said, I knew when I left that man, he'd still be alone, but I could give him my coat, because I knew you were coming for me.\n\nOur power and strength as Americans lives in our hard work and our belief in more. My family understood firsthand that while success is not guaranteed, we live in a nation where opportunity is possible.\n\nBut we do not succeed alone.\n\nIn these United States, when times are tough, we can persevere because our friends and neighbors will come for us. Our first responders will come for us. It is this mantra, this uncommon grace of community that has driven me to become an attorney, a small-business owner, a writer, and most recently the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia.\n\nMy reason for running was simple. I love our country and its promise of opportunity for all. And I stand here tonight because I hold fast to my father's credo.\n\nTogether, we are coming for America. For a better America.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, I joined volunteers to distribute meals to furloughed federal workers. They waited in line for a box of food and a sliver of hope since they hadn't received paychecks in weeks.\n\nMaking livelihoods of our federal workers a pawn for political games is a disgrace. The shutdown was a stunt, engineered by the president of the United States, one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people, but our values.\n\nFor seven years, I led the Democratic Party in the Georgia House of Representatives. I didn't always agree with the Republican speaker or governor, but I understood that our constituents didn't care about our political parties.\n\nThey cared about their lives.\n\nSo when we had to negotiate criminal justice reform or transportation or foster care improvements, the leaders of our state didn't shut down. We came together and we kept our word.\n\nIt should be no different in our nation's capital. We may come from different sides of the political aisle, but our joint commitment to the ideals of this nation cannot be negotiable. Our most urgent work is to realize Americans' dreams of today and tomorrow, to carve a path to independence and prosperity that can last a lifetime.\n\nChildren deserve an excellent education from cradle to career. We owe them safe schools and the highest standards, regardless of ZIP code.\n\nA spotlight on the people reshaping our politics. A conversation with voters across the country. And a guiding hand through the endless news cycle, telling you what you really need to know.\n\nYet this White House responds timidly, while first graders practice active shooter drills and the price of higher education grows ever steeper. From now on, our leaders must be willing to tackle gun safety measures and face the crippling effect of educational loans, to support educators and invest what is necessary to unleash the power of America's greatest minds.\n\nIn Georgia and around the country, people are striving for a middle class where a salary truly equals economic security. But instead, families' hopes are being crushed by Republican leadership that ignores real life or just doesn't understand it.\n\nUnder the current administration, far too many hard-working Americans are falling behind, living paycheck to paycheck, most without labor unions to protect them from even worse harm.\n\nThe Republican tax bill rigged the system against working people. Rather than bringing back jobs, plants are closing, layoffs are looming, and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living.\n\nWe owe more to the millions of everyday folks who keep our economy running, like truck drivers forced to buy their own rigs, farmers caught in a trade war, small business owners in search of capital and domestic workers serving without labor protections.\n\nWomen and men who could thrive if only they had the support and freedom to do so.\n\nWe know bipartisanship could craft a 21st-century immigration plan, but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart.\n\nCompassionate treatment at the border is not the same as open borders. President Reagan understood this. President Obama understood this. Americans understand this and the Democrats stand ready to effectively secure our ports and borders.\n\nBut we must all embrace that from agriculture to health care to entrepreneurship, America is made stronger by the presence of immigrants, not walls.\n\nAnd rather than suing to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, as Republican attorneys general have, our leaders must protect the progress we've made and commit to expanding health care and lowering cost for everyone.\n\nMy father has battled prostate cancer for years. To help cover the cost, I found myself sinking deeper into debt, because while you can defer some payments, you can't defer cancer treatment.\n\nIn this great nation, Americans are skipping blood pressure pills, forced to choose between buying medicine or paying rent.\n\nMaternal mortality rates show that mothers, especially black mothers, risk death to give birth and in 14 states, including my home state, where a majority want it, our leaders refuse to expand Medicaid, which could save rural hospitals, save economies, and save lives.\n\nWe can do so much more, take action on climate change, defend individual liberties with fair-minded judges. But none of these ambitions are possible without the bedrock guarantee of our right to vote.\n\nLet's be clear. Voter suppression is real. From making it harder to register and stay on the rolls, to moving and closing polling places to rejecting lawful ballots, we can no longer ignore these threats to democracy.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the results of the 2018 election here in Georgia, I did not and we cannot accept efforts to undermine our right to vote. That's why I started a nonpartisan organization called Fair Fight to advocate for voting rights. This is the next battle for our democracy, one where all eligible citizens can have their say about the vision we want for our country.\n\nWe must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a power grab. Americans understand that these are the values our brave men and women in uniform and our veterans risk their lives to defend.\n\nThe foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders, not where politicians pick their voters.\n\nIn this time of division and crisis, we must come together and stand for, and with, one another. America has stumbled time and again on its quest towards justice and equality. But with each generation, we have revisited our fundamental truths, and where we falter, we make amends.\n\nWe fought Jim Crow with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Yet, we continue to confront racism from our past and in our present, which is why we must hold everyone, from the highest offices to our own families, accountable for racist words and deeds and call racism what it is: wrong.\n\nAmerica achieved a measure of reproductive justice in Roe v. Wade, but we must never forget it is immoral to allow politicians to harm women and families to advance a political agenda. We affirmed marriage equality, and yet the LGBTQ community remains under attack.\n\nSo, even as I am very disappointed by the president's approach to our problems, I still don't want him to fail. But we need him to tell the truth, and to respect his duties and respect the extraordinary diversity that defines America. Our progress has always been found in the refuge, in the basic instinct of the American experiment, to do right by our people.\n\nAnd with a renewed commitment to social and economic justice, we will create a stronger America together.\n\nBecause America wins by fighting for our shared values against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That is who we are, and when we do so, never wavering, the state of our union will always be strong.\n\nThank you and may God bless the United States of America.
If you liked Crazy Rich Asians, get ready for Bling Empire, among the first Asian-led reality TV shows.\n\nThe Netflix series (now streaming) follows a group of wildly wealthy Asian American socialites in Los Angeles, who introduce us to their luxurious lifestyles filled with Botox parties and private jets.\n\nThe eight-episode season provides us the mindless entertainment we all need, including the petty rivalry between wealthy heiress Anna Shay and international fashionista Christine Chiu, as well as the brewing love triangle between self-made entrepreneur Kelly Mi Li, model Kevin Kreider and her ex-boyfriend, Power Rangers actor Andrew Gray.\n\nAnd, of course, what's reality TV without the trashiness? Watch a friendship end over a penis pump and see how an extravagant trip to France leads to tears and counseling. There's plenty of drink-throwing, crying and sabotaging throughout the series, and if you're not sure what a leather party is, you're about to find out.\n\n'Heavy hearts':'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' will end in 2021 after 14 years\n\nOpinion:Why 'Crazy Rich Asians' made me cry\n\nAside from the scandalous gossip and tense relationship drama, Bling Empire is, more seriously, a pivotal step toward Asian representation in entertainment, especially asHollywood turns its focus to diversity and inclusivity.\n\nWhile the reality show offers the cattiness and escapism of shows like Keeping Up with the Kardashians (they share an executive producer, Jeff Jenkins) or the Real Housewives series, Bling Empire also scratches beneath the surface of the glitz and glam to expose the reality of being Asian in America.\n\nSo you watched 'Mulan?':Here are 10 movies that make me proud of my East Asian heritage\n\nIt's refreshing to see this diverse cast – their families hail from China, Korea, Singapore, Japan and Vietnam – portrayed as three-dimensional characters who stray from the sometimes stereotypical introverts and timid types, like Erwin Kim (Hayden Szeto) in The Edge of Seventeen or Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) in Pitch Perfect.\n\nKelly Mi Li says one of the goals of the show was to showcase the cultural differences of Asian Americans.\n\nAsian culture is so diverse ... so this show covers as much as it possibly can, she says, pointing to differences in Japanese and Chinese cultures. And it's true: We get to see the Japanese perspective on having children before marriage as well as the different Chinese cuisines.\n\nEach star avoids just being Asian and has their own subtle nuances. Kevin, an adopted Korean American, struggles to embrace his ethnic roots after growing up in a predominantly white Pennsylvania suburb, and Christine, the wife of a Song Dynasty heir, comes to terms emotionally with not wanting a second child in a culture that emphasizes the importance of reproduction.\n\nDespite their differences, one thing they have in common is a commitment to balancing their Eastern and Western values – a relatable dichotomy for many Asian Americans. It's common for people like me,a Korean American, to have trouble feeling accepted in a country where we look so different yet also feel rejected by our ancestors' countries of origin for not being Asian enough.\n\nBling beautifully shows us that it is indeed possible to be both Asian and American. The real-life Crazy Rich Asians don't exactly conform to Eastern traditions of keeping a low profile as they flaunt their extravagant car collections and shoe closets and tell explicit (and hilarious) sex stories – taboo in Asian cultures valuing privacy. At the same time, they also keep in touch with their roots, with shamans. fortune tellers and a glamorous 100-day party – a tradition in countries such as Japan, Korea and China celebrating the 100th day after a child's birth.\n\nAsian culture is kind of like, 'Let's hide things, let's pretend things are great, don't air out your dirty laundry,' Li says. Opening your issues and problems to the rest of the world was such a beautiful thing, because hopefully there's a couple that's out there that went through the same issue I did.\n\nLi hopes Bling will stimulate some changes in the entertainment industry. I hope moving forward, we give a bigger platform to Asian Americans.\n\nSo if you're looking for lots of laughs and Louis Vuitton, Bling Empire is for you. But if you're looking for something to make you proud of the entertainment industry, Bling Empire is also very much for you.\n\nThis is America:Stop gaslighting me with the Asian 'model minority' myth

USA TODAY Sports\n\nFormer Olympian and current NBC analyst Bode Miller didn't take long to run off course with his analysis during coverage of the women's giant slalom Thursday.\n\nWhile talking about a run from Anna Veith, an Austrian World Cup skiier and 2014 Olympic gold medalist, Miller suggested her recent marriage was one of the reasons she wasn't getting better results.\n\nVeith, who has battled a knee injury, had a slow first run.\n\nThe knee is certainly an issue. I want to point out she also got married, Miller said. And it's historically very challenging to race on World Cup with a family or after being married. Not to blame the spouses, but I just want to toss that out there, that it could be her husband's fault.\n\nSoon, he was backtracking on air.\n\nYea, I apologize. That was an ill-advised attempt at a joke, Miller said. I was an athlete that competed after marriage and I know how beneficial it is. I know the support team you need. I relied on my friends and family. And if you have the luxury of relying on a spouse I know they are inevitably your biggest supporter. And on Valentine's Day I didn't mean to throw spouses under the bus.

It's a changing of priorities that is historically hard, male or female.\n\nI had the love and support of my wife while I was racing and I know it can be a huge asset. #happyvalentinesday\n\nIt's not the first time during these Winter Games that a reporter or analyst for NBC has gotten in hot water.\n\nDuring the Opening Ceremony, Joshua Cooper Ramo's on-air remark that every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural and technical and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation drew widespread criticism and led to Ramos' firing.\n\nJapan occupied Korea for four decades.\n\nAlso during the ceremony, Katie Couric was trying to explain why Dutch skaters have been so strong over the years in competition as the Olympic team from the Netherlands entered the stadium.\n\nAs you all know, it has lots of canals that can freeze in the winter, Couric said, so for as long as those canals have existed, the Dutch have skated on them to get from place to place, to race each other and also to have fun.\n\nThat led to another apology, this time from Couric.

LOS ANGELES – Looks like Brad Pitt is a fan of Parasite.\n\nStars of 2019's celebrated films and TV shows gathered Friday afternoon for the AFI Awards, which honored projects spanning Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Joker to Fleabag and Veep.\n\nPitt crossed a packed ballroom at the Four Seasons Hotel to pay his respects to the Parasite cast, including actor Song Kang-ho, who plays the patriarch of a scheming family in director Bong Joon-Ho's hit South Korean film.\n\nThe mood at the AFI Awards was celebratory, with famous faces embracing and wishing each other a Happy New Year. The luncheon, which lauds 10 films and 10 TV shows as 2019's best, is marked by the fact that there are no winners' speeches or honorees who go home empty-handed. At this event, everyone is a winner.\n\nOur unashamed goal for this moment is to free you, said American Film Institute president Bob Gazzale before a crowd that included Martin Scorsese, Saoirse Ronan, Clint Eastwood, Sam Rockwell, Awkwafina, Adam Driver and Laura Dern. To provide an oasis to the junkets and the red carpets and all the stress that comes with selling (your projects).\n\nGolden Globes 2020 predictions:Who will win – and who should?\n\nThat lack of expectation makes the Audi-sponsored affair more congenial and relaxed than most, especially as it lands as a Golden Globes weekend, stuffed with events, begins.\n\nAs a lunch of salmon and grilled vegetables arrived stars mingled – from When They See Us director Ava DuVernay grabbing a chat with Little Women director Greta Gerwig, to Joker star Joaquin Phoenix deep in conversation with Once Upon a Time star Leonardo DiCaprio and Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge catching up with Pose star Billy Porter.\n\nDirector Quentin Tarantino also represented his film sartorially, wearing a Once Upon a Time branded bomber jacket.\n\nWe have so many Oscar questions:Is Brad Pitt in? Will 'The Irishman' win it all?\n\nMel Brooks surprised the crowd by popping up to give a tribute to his late wife, Anne Bancroft. The Producers writer/director took the opportunity to toast Taika Waititi's WWII satire Jojo Rabbit.\n\nHe did not ask my permission to use Hitler in a motion picture, cracked Brooks, searching for Waititi from the podium. I just saw 'Jojo Rabbit' and it's really a beautiful picture. Taika, you did a great job.\n\nTo close the ceremony, Rita Moreno gave the keynote address.\n\nIt inspires, quickens the spirit, heightens the senses, steals your breath away...stimulates and arouses. I speak of my sex life, the 88-year-old West Side Story star deadpanned, cracking up the room. Then she clarified: Film, the movies! I am a lifelong devotee.\n\nMoreno toasted a diverse, bold, brilliant new generation of filmmakers and actors, saying that times definitely are changing and for whatever it's worth, I applaud it, and I applaud you.\n\nThe 10 films honored at the AFI Awards were 1917, The Farewell, The Irishman, Jojo Rabbit, Joker, Knives Out, Little Women, Marriage Story and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Richard Jewell, with a special honor given to Parasite.\n\nOn the TV side, the 10 featured AFI programs included Chernobyl, Succession, Game of Thrones Veep, Watchmen, The Crown, When They See Us, Unbelievable, Fosse/Verdonand Pose. Fleabag was also granted a special award.
WASHINGTON – Three moms from Montana will be at the Supreme Court on Wednesday where they'll get a chance to make history on religious school choice.\n\nWhat they're fighting over may seem small: a discontinued state program that offered $150 tax credits to help spur $500 tuition scholarships. But the stakes are high for both sides in the national debate over public aid for religious schools.\n\nConservative groups flooded the high court with arguments supporting the Montana parents' cause. Having long sought legislative backing for voucher and tax credit programs, they see the case as a judicial promised land.\n\nOn the other side are teachers unions and civil rights groups worried that if the floodgates open for religious school funding, public schools will suffer. A ruling for the Montana moms, they say, would violate the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, they say, would be on their side.\n\nWhat's not in dispute is the potential impact of the high court's ruling. Thirty-seven states have constitutional prohibitions against state funding of religious schools, including 17 that specifically block school choice programs. Nationwide, tax credits and vouchers help about 500,000 students attend religious schools.\n\nTwo of those are Kendra Espinoza's daughters: Naomi, 14, and Sarah, 11. Their mother is the lead plaintiff in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, and she looks forward to her latest day in court – the Supreme Court.\n\nA victory, which could be delivered this spring by the court's five conservative justices, would help the single mother afford each daughter's nearly $8,000 tuition bill at Stillwater Christian School in Kalispell, pop. 23,000 – a city where the police chief meets with residents over coffee at a diner.\n\nOur values and our grounding and our character development – it comes from our faith, it comes from our religious background, Espinoza says. The state's decision to end the program in the face of a lower court ruling, she says, is really an anti-religious bias.\n\nThe Trump administration sides with Espinoza and the other challengers. President Donald Trump has long championed prayer in schools and expanded religious freedom.\n\nThe biggest obstacle for Espinoza and the other two plaintiffs may be the state's latest position on the issue. When the Montana Supreme Court ruled the program in violation of the state's constitution in 2018, officials shut down the entire program rather than exclude only religious schools. That, state officials say, should end the challenge.\n\nIf it doesn't, the biggest losers could be the nation's public schools and its teachers' unions, which contend that state aid to religious schools will drain dollars from schools that need it most.\n\nIt will be a virtual earthquake, says Randi Weingarten, a former high school social studies teacher and president of the American Federation of Teachers. This is a ruse to siphon off money from public education.\n\n'Odious to our Constitution'\n\nThe Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts has looked kindly on religion.\n\nThe court has upheld public prayer at government meetings and exempted religious objectors from laws regarding contraception and prohibiting discrimination against same-sex marriages. It has upheld a Muslim man's right to keep his beard in prison and a Muslim teen's right to wear a hijab at work.\n\nLast year, it ruled 7-2 that a mammoth Latin cross on government land in Bladensburg, Maryland, does not have to be moved or altered in the name of church-state separation.\n\nAnd in 2017, the justices ruled 7-2 that a Lutheran church in Missouri was eligible for public funds to resurface its playground, just like other applicants. Roberts called the state's exclusion of the church odious to our Constitution.\n\nThat ruling opened the door to the current challenge, religious conservatives claim, even though Roberts added in a footnote, We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.\n\nCivil rights groups and teachers unions opposed to the use of tax dollars for religious purposes point to a different 7-2 decision from the high court in 2004. Then, the justices upheld a public scholarship program that excluded students pursuing theology degrees.\n\nA ruling in favor of religious school choice would be a game-changer, and the court may be poised to deliver it. The newest associate justice, Brett Kavanaugh, is a devout Catholic, leaving the court with five Catholics and three Jews. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch was raised Catholic but attends an Episcopal church.\n\nDouglas Laycock, a leading authority on the law of religious liberty who teaches at the University of Virginia and the University of Texas law schools, says the court appears poised to defend the rights of parents such as Espinoza.\n\nReligious conservatives perceive the public schools as deeply hostile to their faith, excluding religious observances and religious instruction and teaching evolution, which they associate with atheism, and secular values, especially on sexual matters, Laycock says. That undermines the faith and morals they are trying to instill at home.\n\n'I don't have a choice'\n\nBoth sides in the Espinoza case focus on the First Amendment but for different reasons. Conservatives cite their right to free exercise of religion. Liberals emphasize the prohibition on government establishment of religion.\n\nErica Smith, a senior attorney at the Institute for Justice who represents Espinoza, says the Free Exercise Clause mandates that any public funding for private schools must include religious ones. To exclude them is showing hostility towards religion, she says.\n\nGroups opposed to religious school funding defend states' ability to restrict the use of public tax dollars for private or religious schools.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never held that states must fund religious education, says Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. It should not do so now.\n\nEspinoza says the facts – and the justices – are on her side.\n\nPublic schools don't have an argument, she says. They have plenty of money. In fact, I still pay property taxes that go directly to the schools, and I don't have a choice in that.
Oh baby!\n\nOn Monday, Jason Aldean and wife Brittany Kerr welcomed their second child, a baby girl.\n\nThe little one's name? Navy Rome Williams.\n\nToday our family became complete as we welcomed our daughter Navy Rome to the world, Aldean, whose given name is Jason Aldine Williams, wrote on Instagram, sharing a close-up shot of their newborn. Born on 2/4/19 weighing 7lbs 12oz and looking identical to her older brother. So excited to watch what life has in store for this little princess.\n\nAldean and Kerr also have a 14-month-old son, Memphis. Aldean has two older daughters, Kendyl, 11, and Keeley, 15, from a previous marriage.\n\nMore:Country star Jason Aldean's wife, Brittany, shares baby bump pic, says she's 'about to pop!'\n\nThe couple were open about their experience undergoing IVF.\n\nAfter having our son, we knew we wanted to have two kids, Aldean told People last summer. I have my two older daughters already, so after Memphis was born we knew we wanted to have another one pretty quick – to go ahead and knock it out and have one that was a little closer in age to him.\n\nHe added: I would much rather knock it out now while we're used to having one in diapers and formula and all of that. I think it's tougher when you get out of that and wait a couple years and then have to go redo it all. … We just wanted them to be close in age, and we figured we're already in that mindset now, so why not?\n\nAldean also recently announced his eighth studio album, Rearview Town, will hit stores April 13.\n\nYou Make It Easy, his first single from the album, which debuted on Jan. 26, marked the first new music Aldean has released since the Oct. 1 mass shooting during his headlining set at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas.
When I first saw the Houston Texans might have to consider trading purportedly disenfranchised franchise quarterback Deshaun Watson, I scoffed.\n\nIf the three-time Pro Bowler isn't one of the NFL's top-five quarterbacks, he's certainly no worse than seventh. In terms of ascending players you'd want to build around, definitely top five.\n\nAnd with apologies to declining J.J. Watt, Watson and left tackle Laremy Tunsil are the only foundational players Houston has. Therefore, new general manager Nick Caserio would seemingly be out of his mind to offload Watson, who signed a four-year, $156 million extension in September – it doesn't kick in until the 2022 season – a deal that trails only reigning Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes in terms of total and average annual NFL compensation.\n\nYet the new GM may be backed into a corner dealing with a problem he didn't create after reports surfaced Thursday that Watson officially wants out of Houston.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Watson is furious about the way the franchise conducted its search to replenish the front office – specifically its belated interview of Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy for the head coaching post. The Texans plan to hire Baltimore Ravens assistant David Culley as previous coach Bill O'Brien's replacement.\n\nPer ESPN, Watson is also upset by the organization's lack of commitment to the social justice movement.\n\nOwner Cal McNair was in damage control mode at Caserio's introductory press conference earlier this month, saying, I've come to understand that it's been reported that Deshaun feels left out of the (hiring) process, but he and I had several visits and I understood his point of view before meeting with candidates. I've reached out to Deshaun about Nick's hire and I look forward to him getting back to me when he returns from his vacation.\n\nCaserio could only praise Watson, offering: He's our quarterback.\n\nWatson hasn't said much since the season ended, offering a few cryptic tweets.\n\nObviously, when there are smoke signals on social media, a figurative fire often follows.\n\nIt's natural to wonder if Caserio would have taken charge of a club largely bereft of talent, draft currency and salary cap space in the wake of O'Brien's tenure had he known how unhappy Watson apparently is.\n\nBut if the quarterback can't be placated, and the new GM goes full NFL 9-1-1? At least Caserio could draw comfort knowing he could probably engage nearly half the league in a bid to, well, up the bidding on Watson – he has plenty of leverage himself given the no-trade clause in his agreement – though any blockbuster would cost Houston another $21 million or so in dead cap space. (In for a dime, in for $21M, right, Nick?)\n\nSAINTS NEXT QB1? Replacing Drew Brees might not be so simple\n\nWHAT WE LEARNED:32 things from divisional playoffs\n\nSo when I saw one betting outlet offering Watson trade odds for all 31 NFL teams, the obvious reaction was to have fun with this whole debacle and do a league-wide reality check. If Watson does indeed force his way out of Houston, here's a viability ranking of every other team as it pertains to obtaining him – listed from ludicrous to lovely.\n\nLudicrous\n\n31. Kansas City Chiefs: They're completely committed to Mahomes, 25, the reigning Super Bowl MVP and 2018 league MVP. Next.\n\n30. Buffalo Bills: The Mafia – not to mention the organization – is blissfully wed to Josh Allen, thank you very much.\n\n29. Baltimore Ravens: Watson is a superior passer at this point than 2019 league MVP Lamar Jackson. That doesn't mean Baltimore would swap the man who's arguably the league's most dynamic threat ... especially given Jackson (currently) makes far less money.\n\n28. Los Angeles Rams: They have no first-round pick and an albatross contract belonging to QB Jared Goff – his four-year, $134 million extension kicks in this year – so little reason for Caserio to answer the phone.\n\n27. Green Bay Packers: They've got their MVP-caliber quarterback of the present (Aaron Rodgers) and, perhaps regrettably at this point, their quarterback of the future (?) in 2020 first-rounder Jordan Love.\n\n26. Seattle Seahawks: Russell Wilson and Watson are compensated similarly. But Seattle would incur an unsightly $39 million cap charge to do a trade – not to mention lost draft resources – to otherwise make a largely lateral move ... aside from the fact that Watson is nearly seven years younger than Wilson. Even if the Seahawks wanted to move Wilson to Houston, his no-trade clause would likely make it essentially impossible.\n\n25. Tennessee Titans: Division rival (and civic enemy) ... so forget it. (Unless the folks in Nashville are offering QB Ryan Tannehill, a Texas A&M guy, RB Derrick Henry, former Texans assistant Mike Vrabel, draft picks ... and permission to use Oilers uniforms as throwbacks.)\n\n24. Jacksonville Jaguars: Divisional rival ... so forget it. (Unless Urban Meyer is offering this year's Trevor Lawrence pick, which seems pretty much divorced from reality.)\n\nNFL mock draft 2021:What might happen if New York Jets don't take quarterback at No. 2\n\n23. Indianapolis Colts: Division rival ... so forget it. (And why would Caserio solve the one area vexing highly capable Colts counterpart Chris Ballard?)\n\nCOLTS' NEXT QB? Eight names to consider\n\n22. Los Angeles Chargers: Given Justin Herbert seems perched to collect offensive rookie of the year honors and likely to be on a cost effective deal for another two to three years, the focus of GM Tom Telesco and new coach Brandon Staley should rightly be elsewhere.\n\n21. Cincinnati Bengals: They don't really do the whole trade thing. Even if Caserio got them on the horn, why would a team that just drafted local guy Joe Burrow No. 1 listen?\n\n20. Arizona Cardinals: Much as GM Steve Keim might enjoy dealing with the team that gifted him WR DeAndre Hopkins, the Cards are in good shape with Kyler Murray just two years into his rookie contract.\n\n19. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Looks like they'll be bringing Tom Brady and the band back for at least 2022 ... and maybe until TB12 turns 50.\n\nPassing fancy\n\n18. New Orleans Saints: Sean Payton would probably love a seamless transition from Drew Brees. Unfortunately, the Saints generally draft at the bottom of the first round (28th this year), and their cap is in shambles. Untenable.\n\n17. Las Vegas Raiders: Though Watson would be an upgrade over underrated Derek Carr, whose brother David was ruined by the Texans years ago, offense ain't the reason the Silver and Black have been coming up snake eyes.\n\n16. Cleveland Browns: Fun to consider what this team could become with a more multi-faceted QB than Baker Mayfield. But the Texans would need a lot more in return than the native Texan – and given the course Kevin Stefanski and GM Andrew Berry have charted in Cleveland, hard to see them sacrificing their ability to build out the roster even for a player of Watson's caliber.\n\n15. Pittsburgh Steelers: The Minkah Fitzpatrick opportunity aside, they're typically tight-fisted with high draft choices. Even if Mike Tomlin and GM Kevin Colbert wanted to pursue a golden opportunity to supplant Ben Roethlisberger, who will be 39 in March, they'd have to blow up a chunk of Pittsburgh's roster to accommodate Watson's salary.\n\n14. New England Patriots: Caserio knows how to get his longtime employer on speed dial. But, much as he might like a comprehensive fix to his quarterback conundrum, Bill Belichick – even assuming he'd adopt a short-term outlook – has little to offer in terms of budding talent or immediate blue-chip picks a transaction involving Watson would require.\n\n13. New York Giants: Opening talks with the No. 11 pick, a 2022 first-rounder and Daniel Jones isn't going to get it done.\n\n12. Minnesota Vikings: Opening talks with the No. 14 pick, a 2022 first-rounder and Kirk Cousins (also) isn't going to get it done.\n\n11. Philadelphia Eagles: Opening talks with the No. 6 pick, a 2022 first-rounder and Carson Wentz (also) isn't going to get it done. (Though perhaps Jalen Hurts stirs a preliminary conversation?)\n\nIntriguing\n\n10. Denver Broncos: Doubtful the first thing newly hired GM George Paton wants to do is compromise his fairly appealing roster and player acquisition flexibility ... even if to fix the one position predecessor John Elway never could stabilize post-Peyton Manning.\n\n9. Dallas Cowboys: All signs indicate they'll eventually get a long-term deal done with pending free agent Dak Prescott, who wouldn't cost Jerry Jones anything more than the hefty paychecks that are coming to Prescott one way or another. Still, it would be unlike Jones to not at least have a backroom skull session to explore the Watson scenario which – even though he could likely fit within Dallas' salary structure as snugly as Prescott – would almost surely be cost prohibitive in terms of assets that would have to be shipped to Houston.\n\n8. Atlanta Falcons: They'd be great for Watson, who grew up in nearby Gainesville, Georgia, and could enjoy a fresh start under new coach Arthur Smith – he vexed Houston from Tennessee's sideline the past two years. But Atlanta would have to eat a cap hit north of $40 million to trade Matt Ryan – not to mention significant salary reconfigurations – and would certainly have to part with a boatload of picks (including the No. 4 selection in 2021) and maybe building blocks like WR Calvin Ridley and/or CB A.J. Terrell. All sides would have to swallow hard, but maybe?\n\n7. Washington Football Team: They've lacked stability under center pretty much since Joe Gibbs' first retirement in 1993. Watson would be a worthy solution to the newly crowned NFC East champs ... but he'd surely cost some combination of draft bounty and younger, cheaper players the caliber of DE Chase Young and WR Terry McLaurin.\n\n6. Chicago Bears: This would be a moot discussion had GM Ryan Pace traded up to draft Watson (or Mahomes) in 2017 rather than Mitchell Trubisky. Alas ... Now, the Bears clearly have a dilemma Watson would immediately resolve. Pace, who's finally paid off his Khalil Mack debt, seems to be on a short leash – so why not mortgage more first-rounders in what might be a necessary gambit?\n\n5. Detroit Lions: They're willing to part with longtime QB Matthew Stafford, who hails from Texas, and could offer this year's No. 7 pick – it would very likely afford Houston the ability to draft a blue-chip quarterback prospect – as part of the package. Be one heckuva way for new Lions GM Brad Holmes to get out of the gate.\n\nLovely\n\n4. Carolina Panthers: Charlotte is also fairly close to Gainesville, and the cap calculus is pretty easy for the Panthers to navigate. They'd have to ante up numerous picks (including No. 8 this year), probably placeholder QB Teddy Bridgewater and maybe some promising youngsters – LB/S Jeremy Chinn? DE Brian Burns? But if it means teaming Watson with RB Christian McCaffrey, WR DJ Moore and coach Matt Rhule, who has the job security to make such a bold move, why not? Especially when you can reel in all those Clemson fans ...\n\n3. San Francisco 49ers: They're constantly fielding rumors about Jimmy Garoppolo – who, incidentally, has two years remaining on his deal and wouldn't cost the Niners even $3 million in dead cap dollars to trade. The question is what else would GM John Lynch, who's hardly afraid of a calculated risk, be willing to provide? He'd have to bundle more picks than the No. 12 selection, while likely giving Caserio options among upcoming players like WRs Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel, DT Javon Kinlaw ... heck, maybe even DE Nick Bosa. Unique dynamic that would demand creativity, but Watson is worth some outside-the-box thinking.\n\n2. New York Jets: Would Caserio arm the Pats' longtime rivals (to the degree this is actually a rivalry) with No. 4? The Jets own the second pick of this year's draft plus Seattle's first- and third-rounders and also have the Seahawks' No. 1 choice next year (thanks, Jamal Adams). New York could send QB Sam Darnold to Houston – he could be a tantalizing reclamation project amid a roster rebuild – and maybe even be coerced into surrendering stud DL Quinnen Williams, 23. Compelling options for both sides and apparently also for Watson. According to the Miami Herald, the Jets are the preferred destination for Watson, who would like to play for New York's newly hired head coach, Robert Saleh.\n\n1. Miami Dolphins: The symmetry might be too much to pass up. Imagine if Caserio could reclaim – at the very least – the Round 1 (No. 3 overall) and Round 2 selections O'Brien exported as part of the deal for Tunsil right before the 2019 season – while presumably also flipping Watson for Tua Tagovailoa. For an ascending team like the Fins and a decimated one like the Texans, could be an ideal resolution for both parties. That same Miami Herald story reported the Dolphins would be Watson's second choice if he's unable to land with the Jets.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Cara Kelly\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCaitlyn Jenner included several critical passages in her new memoir about the K-troop, her nickname for the Kardashian clan, in particular, momager-in-chief Kris Jenner. So it should come as no surprise that the Ks aren't exactly here for it.\n\nIn a clip from Thursday's Ellen DeGeneres Show, the K front-woman questioned why her former stepparent would choose to air what seems to be some of the family's dirty laundry.\n\nMy heart breaks for my mom, you know, because I feel like she's been through so much and she's promoting this book and she's saying all these things, Kim said, referencing Jenner's book tour. I don't think it's necessary and I just feel like it's unfair, things aren't truthful.\n\nShe went on to confirm that she thinks Jenner isn't being honest in regard to Kris.\n\nIn the book, Jenner all but says how much her then-wife knew about her gender dysphoria, which contradicts some of Kris's past comments on the subject.\n\nI tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her, she writes.\n\nAnd implies their marriage was one of mutual convenience.\n\nKris restores my credibility. She helps to restore the image of Bruce. I also believe, and once again this is my opinion only, that Kris gets something from me, she writes, referring to rumors and some close calls of people finding out that she was on hormone therapy in the late 80s. So sometimes I wondered if Kris was making a statement to her former husband: a big (expletive) you.\n\nThough Kim doesn't specifically identify which parts she believes are inaccurate, she explains a little about why it's upsetting.\n\nI feel like it's taken a really long time for her to be honest with herself so I don't expect her to be honest about my mom now, she says. Tell your story, but just don't bash other people.\n\nIn 'Secrets,' Caitlyn Jenner reveals what Kris knew about gender transition\n\nCaitlyn Jenner on O.J. Simpson: 'I knew he did it'
The Associated Press\n\nLONDON — Lord Snowdon, the society photographer and filmmaker who married Britain's Princess Margaret and continued to mix in royal circles even after their divorce, has died. He was 86.\n\nThe death of Queen Elizabeth II's former brother-in-law is another reminder of the passing of the wartime generation that grew up with the 90-year-old queen and her friends and relatives.\n\nBuckingham Palace said that the queen, elder sister to Margaret who died in 2002, had been told of Snowdon's death.\n\nHe died peacefully at his home on Friday. His photo agency, Camera Press, confirmed his death.\n\nHis survivors include his two children with Margaret, David Armstrong-Jones, now the second Earl of Snowdon and formerly known as Viscount Linley, and Lady Sarah Chatto, and their two children each; plus three other children, a daughter from his second marriage, a son with a mistress, and a daughter he fathered with another mistress before his marriage to Margaret.\n\nOne of the country's most famous photographers, Snowdon was one of the few top-echelon royals to hold down an outside job after he married Margaret in 1960, and his professional reputation grew steadily.\n\nSnowdon was admired for his discretion, never speaking with the media about the breakup of the marriage in 1978, and rejecting offers to write a book about it. But over time, a number of details about his own complicated love life emerged, giving him a reputation as a man with a long list of lovers and mistresses.\n\nHis 18-year marriage to Margaret broke up due in part to years of infidelity and drinking on both sides; his 22-year marriage to BBC researcher Lucy Mary Lindsay-Hogg broke up in 2000 after Snowdon fathered a son with a magazine editor.\n\nBorn Antony Armstrong-Jones, he was made the first Earl of Snowdon by the queen upon his marriage to Margaret. He was a slightly bohemian member of London's smart set and an established society photographer when he and the queen's sister surprised the country with their engagement in February 1960.\n\nThey had met at a London party and managed to keep their courtship a secret in the months that followed, despite intense interest in Margaret's romantic life.\n\nUnconventional, artistic and not nearly as wealthy as Margaret's other suitors, Armstrong-Jones lived in a studio in west London and did his own cooking. He was certainly not seen by the public and press as a royal prospect.\n\nMargaret married him about five years after she was forced to give up her much older first love, Peter Townsend, a former aide to her father King George VI, because he was divorced, making her later divorce from Snowdon seem all the more bitterly ironic for her.\n\nAfter his marriage into the royal family, Snowdon became their go-to photographer for important royal events — weddings, christenings, birthdays, and portraits. He photographed the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, and the christenings of their two sons. He also organized the elaborate ceremony for the investiture of Prince Charles as Prince of Wales in 1969.\n\nLater, his photographic work featured the cream of British society, and was widely acclaimed. He was most proud of the stunning aviary he helped design for London Zoo, according to the BBC.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente
Maureen C. Gilmer\n\nIndyStar\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Shanika Heyward could have been a statistic. Drugs, crime, poverty — that was the world she lived in near 38th Street and Emerson Avenue in the 1980s and early '90s.\n\nHer parents were lost to drug addiction and mental illness during her youth. She and her two siblings bounced from home to home, moving in and out of foster care. But two things saved a young Shanika — her grandmother and the library.\n\nFrom the time she was 6 years old, Shanika would walk with her older brother and sister to the old Emerson Avenue branch of the Indianapolis Public Library at 36th and Emerson, a few blocks from her grandmother's home.\n\nEven when her siblings got older and stopped going, she didn't.\n\nI went every day, and the librarians helped me with my homework, Heyward said. My grandmother couldn't help me with my homework.\n\nNow, Heyward is in a position to help others as manager of the East 38th Street branch of The Indianapolis Public Library. During 2016 National Library Week, Heyward was honored as a Mover and Shaker by Library Journal.\n\nShe was recognized nationally for tapping into her deep familiarity with the neighborhood to organize community partnerships with more than 40 nonprofits, businesses, churches and universities.\n\nWhether it's Breakfast with a Cop, weekly GED classes, a summer food program, tutoring, STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) classes through Purdue Extension, fatherhood forums or a job center, those who know her say Heyward is always looking for ways to attack the unemployment, crime and poverty rates that threaten to rob families of the one thing everyone needs to survive — hope.\n\nConsider that the unemployment rate in the area served by the library, 5420 E. 38th St., is 22 percent, with an accompanying poverty rate of 25 percent. Forty percent earn less than $25,000 annually; 18 percent do not have a high school diploma.\n\nKris Gould, supervisor librarian at the Nora Branch, says the impressive number of Heyward's initiatives reflect her passion for connecting her community with library resources. Gould hired Heyward for a position as adult librarian at East 38th Street, in part because of her drive to break through some organizations' resistance to work with the library.\n\nShe has such a passion for raising people up, and she sees the great need in the area. She knows how to talk to groups and get them to work together, Gould said. She's our superstar.\n\nHeyward, 39, is embarrassed by the praise. All I'm doing is my job, she insists, even while surrounded by community awards in her small office. She gives credit to her staff, volunteers and former managers who have been by her side through the years.\n\nWhen you have the drive and desire, people will come right alongside to help you on the way, she said.\n\nThat passion was born early, during all those afternoons she spent at the library as a child.\n\nShe laughs as she remembers how kids in the neighborhood called her the library girl because she spent so much time there. But she also cries as those memories trigger painful reminders of a lost childhood.\n\nI remember the library was a safe place, she says simply, pausing to wipe away tears. I could go there and ask for help.\n\nHelping others\n\nSister Shanika is how some in the community refer to her. A mother, big sister, guardian angel, even Wonder Woman, they say. She cares about everyone who walks in this branch, said local businessman and mayor's office liaison Charles Ingram during a library board meeting last week. She's our wonder woman. She (doesn't) wear a shield ... but she says, 'I'm still gonna save this community.' \n\nAmong the boards Heyward sits on is Forest Manor Multipurpose Center, a United Way agency and neighbor on 38th Street. Staff bring a rolling library of sorts to the center most every day in the summer as part of an intense reading program.\n\nA lot of those kids and others in the neighborhood also get lunch from a mobile food truck that comes to the library Monday through Friday in the summer. That's a partnership Heyward pursued through the U.S. Department of Education after getting reprimanded for bringing food to feed kids at the library.\n\nI don't have all the answers, she said, but if I can't provide what you need, I have a community partner that can meet that need.\n\nRuth Lambert, longtime neighborhood resident, licensed therapist, library volunteer and founder of the Indiana Healthy Marriage and Family Coalition, is among those partners.\n\nFor a young woman to be so concerned about the growth and safety and well-being of a community is rare these days. She has been that person ever since she was 18 and discovered that you can see the world through the library, Lambert said.\n\nHer vision of the world wasn't always so clear. When she was 14, Shanika became pregnant, which might have derailed her future. But her grandmother refused to allow it. Alice Kennedy helped Shanika raise her baby and saw to it that she graduated from Arlington High School.\n\nHeyward began working at the Lawrence library branch and started college. She stopped and started again, with the support and encouragement of library managers who saw something special in her.\n\nPeople like Jeanne Gabonay, who was Heyward's supervisor in the library's collection management services department, where Heyward transferred so she could better juggle college, her job, motherhood and caring for her grandmother.\n\nI've always been so proud of her and what she's accomplished, said Gabonay, now retired. She just has so many talents; she's one of the best managers in the system.\n\nHeyward completed work on her undergraduate degree in psychology while working in the library's collection management services department. Gabonay was the person who encouraged her to pursue a master's in library science so she could become a librarian.\n\nShe had a light about her — she was so giving, Gabonay recalled of her time working with Heyward. She wants to help people, and she's chosen her role as a librarian and branch manager to be able to do that.\n\nFor Heyward, managers like Gabonay get the credit for pushing her along her journey. It's about people who believe in you when you cannot believe in yourself.\n\nThe Indianapolis Public Library took a chance when it hired Heyward as branch manager in 2013. She had the education, but not the experience. She asked for a chance to learn, promising they would not be disappointed.\n\nLibrary's 'Sister Shanika' is the heart and soul of Indy neighborhood\n\nA place of hope\n\nDespite the many programs and partnerships available through the library, Heyward bemoans the crime and lack of opportunity in the northeast-side neighborhood, as well as the absence of parental involvement.\n\nThis is a parentless branch, she said. Maybe they're working two and three jobs, but when school is out, she said, kids are in here all day. My children's librarian has to be creative with programming.\n\nThe first thing she makes sure all kids and adults have is a library card — that's their ticket to the world, Heyward believes.\n\nWe're working with so many people who just feel hopeless. If their momma don't care, nobody cares. I had my grandmother. If not, I'd be just like them. she said.\n\nHer message to patrons and partners alike is this:\n\nThis is not just a library; this is a place of hope and opportunity. Every resource you could ever think of is housed at a library, so you don't have to leave here empty. You can leave here with some hope.\n\nShe remembers the people who poured hope into her as a child and a struggling young mother.\n\nIt's a great honor to be able to serve in this capacity.\n\nFor more inspiring stories like this one, LIKE Humankind on Facebook.
PARRISH, Florida – Allan Mestel booked a flight to Washington D.C., to photograph the pro-Trump demonstrations on Jan. 6. But he canceled it after his wife warned him: This will escalate into riots.\n\nFor the past four years, the photographer from Southwest Florida has chronicled the Black Lives Matter movement through his Nikon lens. A proud liberal himself, Mestel has attended dozens of BLM street rallies. He's also crossed the lines into the counterprotests to document the names and faces of President Donald Trump's supporters.\n\nHe was at the protests when the Confederate monument was removed from the local courthouse in Florida's Manatee County. He has been in the face of screaming Proud Boys and threatened by QAnon conspiracy theorists. Each time, he's published the photos online and shared them with officials from the Democratic Party. He planned to do the same during the Stop the Steal events in Washington.\n\nInstead, like most of America, Mestel was following the attack on the Capitol online. Then he saw the photo: A man in a Trump toque smiled ear to ear as he made off with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's podium.\n\nIn the hours after the riot, the internet dubbed him Podium Guy. But Mestel knew his name. Adam Christian Johnson.\n\nThe two men from Southwest Florida, on opposite sides of the political spectrum, had crossed paths before. Now, one had become an instant icon for the far right and the other was ready to turn him in.\n\nIt's weapon-grade stupidity, Mestel said. The degree of entitlement he must have felt.\n\nCapitol riot arrests:See who's been charged across the U.S.\n\nBy the time Johnson arrived in the district, he bragged on his Facebook page that he had been drinking alcohol in four different states. His posts show him in airport selfies with other MAGA supporters who hoped to stop the certification of the electoral vote for President-elect Joe Biden, according to a USA TODAY review of his social media posts before they were removed, as well as those included in law enforcement charging documents.\n\nIn one of the images, Johnson writes Going to stay safe in D.C. as he poses with his face mask covering his eyes instead of his mouth. Alongside him, another Trump supporter is wearing his neck gaiter like a hijab.\n\nFrom the crowd at the insurrection, Johnson smiled as he raised his hand right in front of a wall of police, captioning the Facebook post with the word Riot!!!\n\nAs he breached security and entered the Capitol, Johnson posed for another shot, this time smirking next to the sign notifying the public that the building was closed to all tours. His response: No.\n\nHis trip culminated with someone else posting the photo seen around the world. A widespread search to identify him immediately spun through Twitter.\n\nThe image has become a hallmark of the attack on U.S. Capital that left five dead. It joins other viral pictures from that day: a Trump supporter with his feet kicked up on a desk in Pelosi's office; an Idaho man hanging from the balcony of the Senate floor; another Trump supporter chasing a Black police officer up the stairs of Congress; and a QAnon conspiracy theorist from Arizona wearing a horned hat with fur and face paint.\n\nBoth from Manatee County, Mestel and Johnson had mutual friends and attended some of the same social events. Mestel couldn't forget Johnson's face or the attacks he launched on liberals from his social media feeds, which have since been taken down. He immediately went to the FBI with a tip.\n\nHe spends all of his time trolling the alt-right websites, Mestel said. His social (media) was very much pro-conspiracy theory, anti-Black Lives Matter and anti-liberal. It seemed to be pretty much the focus of what made him tick and took up most of his time.\n\nFrom pot charges to stay-at-home dad\n\nBorn in the small town of Millington, Tennessee, Johnson has lived most of his life in Southwest Florida. With long, light brown hair and tattoos of crosses on his chest and left arm, he holds a fishing license, makes furniture and went to Baptist church.\n\nUSA TODAY used public records, press accounts and social media to piece together Johnson's story. Nobody answered when a reporter knocked at the door to his home this week. Immediate members of his family could not be reached for comment.\n\nWhile he was in his late teens and early 20s, police in Manatee County arrested Johnson on two separate misdemeanor marijuana charges. In 2005, he violated probation by failing to submit the required supervision reports, along with proof that he'd completed community service and substance abuse counseling. At the time, he lived at his mother's home in Bradenton and listed his occupation as a cook, police records show.\n\nFinancial problems appear to have strained his marriage to his first wife. The couple was evicted from their apartment in July 2010, with $1,098 past due rent. Their divorce was finalized the following January, according to court records.\n\nWithin five months, Johnson remarried to a physician – his current wife – and his fortunes began to turn.\n\nThey moved into a home in Parrish together, and by December 2015, the couple sold the house for a nearly $60,000 profit, according to the property deeds.\n\nOff the highway and north of the Manatee River, mobile home parks, fast-food restaurants and green fields line the roads to Parrish, a rural suburb on the outskirts of greater Tampa Bay. Inside a manicured subdivision, where herons roam and families fish the retention ponds, the Johnsons now raise their five boys from a 4,000 square-foot home with a swimming pool and six bedrooms, property records show.\n\nJohnson, who attended college at the University of South Florida, is currently unemployed and stays at home with his kids, according to interviews and local media reports. Just days before the insurrection, the family hosted a New Year's Eve party, where people were seen without masks despite the raging coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAcquaintances who spoke to USA TODAY said the 36-year-old's passion for Trump and hatred toward the left is well known and evident through his social media.\n\nBut Johnson's voting records don't always back up his outspoken beliefs. After initially registering in 2002 as a Republican, he's currently registered as a voter with no party affiliation, switching in November 2019, according to the Supervisor of Elections in Manatee County. Johnson voted in two general elections – 2004 and 2020 – but there are no records of him voting in the 2016 election that drew so many of his fellow loyal followers to Trump.\n\nHe's not active in local GOP circles, either. Until his photo and subsequent arrest went viral, many prominent local Republicans had never heard of him.\n\nGrace Reeves, president of the Manatee County Young Republicans, even went back through old photos to make sure he hadn't been at any of their events.\n\nI've never seen the guy, Reeves said. Until now, I was not aware of him at all, and that's a good thing … his acts are despicable.\n\nFrom Toronto to Florida\n\nWhen Mestel recognized Johnson in the podium image, he felt it was his patriotic duty to report everything he knew.\n\nNow 57 with tattoos on his arms, Mestel retired to Florida in 2016 from Toronto, where he grew up. He worked as a TV commercial photographer and director in Canada and even directed music videos in the 1980s and 1990s. One of his commercials won a Gold Bessie for the best TV commercial in Canada in 1992.\n\nMestel now lives in Bradenton with his wife, a personal fitness trainer and gym owner, and his two children. He spends his time photographing street activism – the images of his work can be seen in his gallery. He also hopes to publish a photo book.\n\nFor years, he's faced backlash, threats and hate mail from neo-Nazis and right-wing conspiracy theorists. Online, they flooded his business with fake reviews. The attacks only worsened when he reported Johnson for his role in the attempted coup at the Capitol.\n\nMestel said he has been called a rat, snitch, scum and every other name in the book. He says CNN's Cuomo Prime Time asked him to come on. He declined, in part because his family still fears retaliation.\n\nI think the Trump cult – the conspiracy theory component – goes deeper and beyond any sort of individual Republican Party values, Mestel said.\n\nThe day of the riot, Mestel filled out a form on the FBI website explaining what he knew about Johnson, and by the next morning, he'd heard from an FBI agent. He says he has now spoken to three different federal investigators, including special agent Michael Jeng, who signed the Statement of Facts document that outlines the charges against Johnson in federal court.\n\nHe said one of the agents even laughed about how they wished all of their cases were this easy.\n\nThis is a serious case, federal prosecutor Patrick Scruggs told the judge at Johnson's first court appearance. Everyone involved in the storming of the Capitol last week needs to be held accountable for their actions, including Mr. Johnson.\n\nConsequences for Johnson\n\nHis hands cuffed, in a white V-neck shirt, shorts, flip-flops and wearing a dark face mask, Johnson is shown in a booking video as law enforcement officers usher him into an intake area for his mugshot. They then bring him to a standing desk for a pat-down and to finish the paperwork.\n\nJohnson is facing one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, one count of theft of government property and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. He's among dozens who have been arrested so far in connection to the riot.\n\nOut on bond, Johnson is restricted from traveling outside the 35 Florida counties that make up the federal court system's Middle District, unless it's for a court appearance in Washington. The court also ordered a nightly 9 p.m. curfew and drug tests.\n\nCriminal law experts predict he could face between two to three years in prison.\n\nThe case won't be about guilt or innocence, considering there is photographic evidence of Mr. Johnson's guilt. It will be about what the appropriate penalty should be, said Derek Byrd, a Florida criminal defense attorney, who is not representing Johnson and is only providing commentary for this article. I suspect a federal judge in D.C. is going to want to send a message that breaking into the Capitol building during official proceedings, thereby stopping those proceedings, and allegedly stealing items from the Capitol will not be tolerated.\n\nDavid Bigney and Dan Eckhart, the Orlando attorneys who represent Johnson, did not respond to requests for comment from USA TODAY Network reporters. Outside the courthouse after the hearing, they told reporters that Johnson has been getting death threats and publicly acknowledged the viral photo of him with Pelosi's podium is a problem for their case.\n\nI'm not a magician, and neither is Mr. Bigney, Eckhart said. We've got a photograph of our client in what appears to be inside the federal building, inside the Capitol, with government property.\n\nJohnson is scheduled to go back to Washington for court on Jan. 19 – the day before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration.\n\nAnd the podium? It's where it's supposed to be. According to news reports, Pelosi was standing at it Wednesday when she signed the article of impeachment against Trump.

But we're here to get you ready for a new day of action – and catch you up on what you missed.\n\nWhat to watch Monday\n\nSnowboarding: California teen Chloe Kim is a favorite for gold in women's halfpipe finals. She has been so dominant in her sport that the BBC is calling her the Lewis Hamilton of ladies' snowboarding. Also, legendary Shaun White begins his quest for a medal in halfpipe qualifying. Defending Olympic champ, Switzerland's Iouri Podladtchikov, is out after having bad fall in the recent X Games.\n\nCross country skiing: No American woman has won an Olympic medal in cross country skiing.

Charles Curtis\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe time has come for a divorce in New York.\n\nThe Knicks once looked like a team that had turned around its fortunes, especially after hitting the jackpot with Kristaps Porzingis.\n\nBut as of Tuesday, they're a disappointing 18-24, three games out of eighth place in the East and filled to the brim with drama. The biggest headache? It involves Carmelo Anthony. The star forward will reportedly finally get to meet with president Phil Jackson to hash out their differences and, perhaps, talk about the future:\n\nAnthony has said he hasn't thought about waiving his no-trade clause to get out of town. But here's how this meeting should go: Jackson and Anthony should both agree - to extend the marriage metaphor once more - there are irreconcilable differences, that the clock is ticking on Melo's stellar career and that the Knicks can't be stuck in mediocrity forever. For everyone involved, a trade is the best option.\n\nJackson can even tell Anthony he can help find a preferable destination since he's the one with a no-trade clause. Anthony gets out from under the scrutiny of playing in New York, where he's questioned about his state of mind seemingly every night, and Jackson gets some return for someone who's still an elite scorer.\n\nRemember, in the NBA, staying in the middle of the pack is death. Only a full-on tank job will net the kind of assets that help build a champion. At this point, even if the Knicks somehow suddenly go on a tear, there's no way they're coming close to sniffing at a ring. Keeping things status quo is the wrong way to go.\n\nIf Jackson can pull off a deal, he'll then get to jump-start a rebuild around Porzingis, and will hopefully do it the right way through the draft. Nabbing top free agents might be a lot tougher when players see the Knicks continue to flounder and struggle with internal clashes (not to mention those posse comments hanging over his head).\n\nWill Jackson get a fair return for Anthony? Possibly not anything top-dollar. As USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt noted, he's got $54.1 million left on a deal that runs through 2018-19. There's also this factor, also from Zillgitt: [He] likes where he lives and works and isn't much interested right now in leaving.\n\nFrom a basketball perspective, however, the only way anyone will be happy is a split.
A.J. Perez\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- The racing world got a glimpse of NASCAR without Dale Earnhardt Jr. as he missed the second half of the 2016 Monster Energy Cup Series with a concussion.\n\nAttendance and television ratings — which have been in decline for the last decade — slipped further. Meanwhile, online polls, while hardly scientific, showed that a good portion of the sport's fan base said it had no interest in a NASCAR devoid of Earnhardt.\n\nYou are never going to replace a Dale Earnhardt Jr., four-time Cup champ and former teammate Jeff Gordon told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday. While I say that, I never thought we were going to replace a Dale Earnhardt Sr., and we did that in Dale Earnhardt Jr. That was rare. We have to be prepared for that. There is going to come a day where he is not going to be out there, nor will Jimmie Johnson, Kevin Harvick and Kyle Busch.\n\nJohnson, 41 and a seven-time champion, has been described as bland. Harvick, also 41, broke through with a title in 2014, but his popularity didn't really blossom further. At 31, Kyle Busch, the 2015 titlist, has rounded into a softer, gentler version of his younger self, thanks to marriage and a young son. His salty nature might have been more attractive for fans looking for controversy.\n\nJeffrey Earnhardt, the nephew of Dale Earnhardt Jr. and a fellow driver, says NASCAR minus his 42-year-old uncle would be grim for the sport.\n\nThe fan base is majority him, Jeffrey Earnhardt said. He's been the most popular driver a million years in a row. Without him, it would be scary. You saw last year, when he had to sit out, all the fans, they're like, 'I didn't want to come because Dale Jr. wasn't in the race.'\n\nI'm like, man, you hear people saying that, it actually shows you how much power he has for this sport. I mean, he's earned a lot of that, but it shows the whole legacy of the Earnhardt name.\n\nThe death of Dale Earnhardt Sr. in the 2001 Daytona 500 was not only weathered by NASCAR, but the series also grew to its greatest heights as fans connected not only with his son, but also a generation of drivers that included Gordon, Johnson, three-time champ Tony Stewart, Harvick and Carl Edwards.\n\nOver the last two seasons, NASCAR lost Stewart, Gordon and Edwards to retirement.\n\nIf you were to add Dale in there? said Gordon, a Fox NASCAR analyst who filled in for Earnhardt in eight races last season. I hope we don't see that happening for a while, because I love to see him on the track. ... Everybody wants to see (legends) stay forever. The truth of the matter is that there is going to become a day where they are no longer going to be there.\n\nMORE NASCAR COVERAGE:\n\nNASCAR makes changes to ramp up racing, boost TV ratings\n\nPlenty of tickets remain for Daytona 500\n\nNASCAR touts young talents such as Chase Elliott, Austin Dillon and Kyle Larson and rookies Daniel Suarez, Erik Jones and Ty Dillon as exciting, up-and-coming drivers. Elliott will start Sunday's Daytona 500 from the pole and has shown much promise. Austin Dillon is seeking his first win. Larson broke through with a win last year. But none of them is beloved. None has close to the fan base of Junior Nation.\n\nEarnhardt gave one scenario to reporters Wednesday that could mean this is his last run.\n\nI've always wanted to win a championship so badly, Earnhardt said. Coming back from this injury, we worked so hard. To come back this year, win a championship, it would be hard not to hang it up.\n\nGordon said he is optimistic that a current crop of young drivers could help fill the void whenever Earnhardt decides he's done with racing and, in turn, steps down as the sport's most recognizable face that adorns cardboard, life-size cutouts at convenience stores across the street from Daytona International Speedway and around the country.\n\nGordon thinks the young drivers could help fill the void whenever Earnhardt steps down as the sport's most recognizable face.\n\nIt gives the opportunity for young superstars and talents, like Chase Elliott, Gordon said. Here's a guy who hasn't even won a race yet, and he's one of the more popular drivers. In some ways, you could see him rival Dale Earnhardt Jr. for popularity. That's exciting.\n\nContributing: Heather Tucker\n\nFollow Perez on Twitter @byajperez and Tucker @HeatherR_Tucker\n\nPHOTOS: DALE EARNHARDT JR. THROUGH THE YEARS
Wondering about the afterlife and what comes after death is pretty natural. Do angels greet us? Maybe there's a warm and loving welcome from a long-gone family pooch? Or does a vast swath of nothingness await in the hereafter?\n\nThomas Pierce's touching, thought-provoking debut novel The Afterlives (Riverhead, 366 pp., ★★★ out of four) delves into the familiar desire to figure all that out, centering on a guy who actually died himself. Part love story and part speculative sci-fi, it's a meandering, albeit meaningful, look at marriage, technology and ghosts — those of the otherworldly type that may exist but also specters of our past that influence our present.\n\nAfter a scary incident of cardiac arrest — what his doctor deems a misfire — 33-year-old loan officer Jim Byrd is able to monitor the device keeping his heart in tip-top shape via an app on his phone. What nags him, though, is that in the few minutes he was technically dead, there were no shining lights or heavenly hosts.\n\nSeeking out an afterlife becomes an obsession for Jim: He hears voices at the haunted stairs of a Tex-Mex joint in his North Carolina hometown — which has become a haven for the elderly — and finds a physicist who studies the possibility of communicating with the dead, all fueling his desperate need to find the answer to What's next? At the same time, he discovers a grounding force in Annie, the childhood sweetheart he reconnects with who lost her husband in a tragic accident.\n\nLoss weighs heavily on most of Pierce's characters, even bit players who weave in and out of Jim's life. Interspersed is a love triangle from the past involving two brothers and a girl that acts as a tragic echo of the main plot: For most of The Afterlives, it's a tangential timeline that's puzzling in its connection to everything else, though by the end it becomes a satisfying addition to the overall tapestry.\n\nThat's actually true of many of Pierce's story threads, from the mysterious dog mentioned on the very first page to a fittingly named contraption called the Reunion Machine.\n\nFans of The Leftovers, A Ghost Story and others of their metaphysical ilk will find loads of heady stuff in The Afterlives that'll put them in good spirits.\n\nA new-age church where holograms give sermons, characters fretting about the fragility of existence and decisions that need to be made regarding The Great Beyond are all introduced as food for thought — like a pack of ethereally tinged Slim Jims, they can be tough to chew on but end up pretty tasty when you sit back and savor them.
It's good to be the Queen. Or King. Or vaguely affiliated with either.\n\nThe British royals are having quite the moment in pop culture, between Oscar hopefuls The Favourite, about Queen Anne, Mary, Queen of Scots, about the titular Scottish Queen's relationship with Elizabeth I, and Victoria returning on PBS for a third season Sunday. Plus the third season of The Crown is forthcoming and the actual royals are popping up every other day with new outfits and tabloid dramas.\n\nIn honor of this very posh pop culture season, we've picked the five best TV shows to watch about the British royals. If you get through them all, don't worry, there are many, many more.\n\nIf you love politicking: 'Victoria'\n\nIf you have time to catch up on Victoria before it returns, it's worth it. Starring Doctor Who alumna Jenna Coleman, the series begins with Queen Victoria's ascension to the British throne at age 18, and follows all the pitfalls and victories of her early time on the throne as she navigates the British parliament and foreign relations. Coleman is electric as the young queen, offering a picture of one of the most famous monarchs that is far removed from the aging widow we're all so familiar with.\n\nStream it on Amazon.\n\nIf you love the Windsors: 'The Crown'\n\nIf very old period pieces aren't your thing but you're still dying to know what goes on behind the walls of Buckingham Palace, Netflix's detailed dramatization of the life of Queen Elizabeth II is the one for you. The first two seasons feature Claire Foy as the young queen, and focus on her marriage with the restless Prince Phillip (Matt Smith). The forthcoming season will sub out Foy and Smith for older actors (Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies) as it documents her later life.\n\nStream it on Netflix.\n\nIf you love Henry VIII: 'Wolf Hall'\n\nSpeaking of Foy, if you want to see a very different royal character from her, watch this miniseries about the rise of Thomas Cromwell during Henry VIII's reign. Foy plays Anne Boleyn, and manages to offer a new spin on a role that's been played many, many times in film and television.\n\nStream it on Amazon.\n\nIf you'd rather focus on Elizabeth I: 'Elizabeth I'\n\nSpeaking of royals who have been portrayed a lot, Margot Robbie just became the latest actress to take on Elizabeth I in Mary, Queen of Scots. But for our money, the best take on the character comes from Helen Mirren (herself an expert on playing the royals) in this HBO mini-series about Elizabeth balancing politics and desires 20 years into her reign.\n\nStream it on HBO Go/Now.\n\nIf you want to go older: 'The Last Kingdom'\n\nIf Tudor-era England is too modern for you in the 16th century, you can travel all the way back to the ninth and the Anglo-Saxons with The Last Kingdom. The series covers the Anglo-Saxon wars with the Danes, as England is divided into seven separate kingdoms that are under attack. If you like the battles in Game of Thrones and long hair and beards, this one is for you.\n\nStream it on Netflix.
Ron Maxey\n\nThe (Memphis) Commercial Appeal\n\nMEMPHIS — A Christian publisher says it is canceling the publication of a book by a Memphis pastor who admitted to a sexual encounter with a 17-year-old high school senior in Texas 20 years ago.\n\nBethany House announced Monday afternoon that it is canceling the scheduled July publication of Andy Savage's book, The Ridiculously Good Marriage. The tweet announcing the cancellation said the book might still show up on some retail websites for a short time until those sites update.\n\nOn amazon.com, where the book still shows available for pre-order as of Tuesday afternoon, the description calls Savage a pastor and relationship coach who has been in the trenches of marital hardship.\n\nMeanwhile, the victim, Jules Woodson, says that she is disgusted by Savage's public apology and doesn't agree that the matter was dealt with at the time as Savage suggested. Woodson has come forward with her story in the vein of others in the #metoo movement.\n\nWoodson told her story in a blog post detailing the sexual assault. Savage admitted to the encounter in a post on the website of his current church, Highpoint Church in East Memphis, and addressed the congregation this past Sunday.\n\nWhile not offering as much detail as Woodson, who said she thought Savage was taking her for ice cream after church on the way home, Savage admitted in the post and to church members that he had a sexual incident with a female high school senior while he was at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church in a Houston suburb.\n\nI resigned from ministry and moved back home to Memphis, Savage said in the written statement that he read to church members, who gave him a standing ovation after his remarks. I accepted full responsibility for my actions. I was and remain very remorseful for the incident and deeply regret the pain I caused her and her family, as well as the pain I caused the church and God's Kingdom.\n\nSavage said he thought the incident, for which criminal charges were never filed, had been dealt with in Texas 20 years ago when he apologized. He said he told leaders at Highpoint about the incident before they hired him, and his wife knew about it before they married.\n\nMore:Catherine Deneuve signs letter deploring #MeToo 'witch hunt' and 'puritanism'\n\nMore:Rose McGowan on reality show: 'I'm just trying to stop international rapists and child molesters'\n\nIn hindsight, Savage says he knows more could have been done to help Woodson at the time. He said he remains committed to cooperating toward healing.\n\nHighpoint Lead Pastor Chris Conlee has expressed support for Conlee, also in a written statement on the church website. Before Savage addressed the congregation Sunday, Conlee told members there was room to disagree but still respect one another.\n\nIt's not just a right-and-wrong issue, though there was something definitely wrong, Conlee said.\n\nAfter Savage received an ovation, Conlee said he knows members are supporting healing for Woodson as well as for Savage, who Conlee said God supports 1,000 percent.\n\nWoodson could not be reached Tuesday, but she told The New York Times she saw the video of Savage's remarks to church members and the ovation and found it disgusting.\n\nShe told the newspaper the incident had not been dealt with, as Savage suggested, because it was not reported to law enforcement. She said she has made a report recently, but it's unclear whether the statute of limitations has expired under Texas law.\n\nWoodson also said she decided to come forward with the story after she saw a USA TODAY story in December about Matt Lauer being fired by NBC because of sexual misconduct. She said she first contacted Savage by email, but decided to go public when Savage never replied.
This has been an Oscar season tailor-made for a Joker movie, with chaos reigning: 1917 and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood ruled the Golden Globes, Bombshell led the Screen Actors Guild field, and Joker itself surprised with a hefty 11 nominations in the British Academy film awards.\n\nThis is about the time someone would turn on the Bat Signal, but things might even get crazier on Monday morning when the Academy Awards nominations are announced (8:18 a.m. ET/5:18 PT). While favorites loom in some of the acting races, there's no clear runaway for best picture, and Hollywood may be looking at not only another #OscarsSoWhite situation, but also one where no women break into the best director category in arguably one of the best years ever for female filmmakers. Whatever happens, movie lovers and experts alike will have snubs and surprises to drive conversation and Oscar pools right up until the big – and again hostless – ceremony on Feb. 9 (ABC, 8 p.m. ET/5 PT).\n\nThe Oscars are just a month away!Here are the films and actors leading the race\n\nAcademy Awards questions:Is Brad Pitt in? Will 'The Irishman' win it all?\n\nLet's look at the six major Oscar categories and break down the contenders from the pretenders.\n\nBest picture\n\nThe best: With three Golden Globe wins, plus important nominations from SAG, Producers Guild and Directors Guild, Quentin Tarantino's 1969-set historical fantasy Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a shoo-in. So is Sam Mendes' World War I thriller 1917, named best drama at the Globes. Things are also looking excellent for the black comedy Parasite, gangster epic The Irishman and World War II satire Jojo Rabbit, which all scored nods from the four major guilds (actors, directors, producers and writers).\n\nThe rest: Usually eight or nine films (out of a maximum of 10) snag best picture honors, so at most only four coveted slots remain. Expect most if not all to come out of PGA nominees Joker, retro racing crowd-pleaser Ford v Ferrari, divorce drama Marriage Story, period adaptation Little Women and murder mystery Knives Out. With actors being the largest voting bloc of the Academy, though, don't count out the SAG-nominated #MeToo drama Bombshell.\n\nActor\n\nThe best: Eleven years after Heath Ledger's Oscar win for playing the Joker, Golden Globe conquerer Joaquin Phoenix is in line to do the same. The Joker star's main competition will come from fellow Globe winner Taron Egerton (Rocketman), Adam Driver (Marriage Story), Christian Bale (Ford v Ferrari) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood).\n\nThe rest: Bale is probably the most vulnerable. If he, Egerton or perhaps DiCaprio don't get a nod, Globe nominees waiting in the wings include Eddie Murphy, currently on the comeback trail with Dolemite Is My Name; Jonathan Pryce, the BAFTA-nominated heart of The Two Popes; and Antonio Banderas, the Pain and Glory star who's never scored an Oscar nod in his long career. But would the Academy really let icon Robert De Niro go zero-for-everything as the heavyweight of Irishman?\n\nActress\n\nThe best: It's Renee Zellweger's show right now and everybody else is singing backup. The Globe-winning star of Judy is the clear favorite, while fellow SAG nominees Cynthia Erivo (Harriet), Charlize Theron (Bombshell) and Scarlet Johansson (Marriage Story) all have a good chance of joining her.\n\nThe rest: Awkwafina (The Farewell) has better odds now after winning a Globe, but she doesn't have a SAG nomination. Saoirse Ronan was nominated at the Globes and BAFTA but not at SAGs, plus Little Women has yet to generate much awards-season heat. Lupita Nyong'o didn't have a Globe nod but is in the SAG contingent, plus her terrifying Us role might just scare voters into including her. (Hey, it worked for Kathy Bates and Misery.)\n\nSupporting actor\n\nThe best: Leonardo DiCaprio finally won an Oscar in 2016 and now it seems the time for his Once Upon a Time buddy Brad Pitt to snag an acting honor he, too, has deserved for a while. (At least since Moneyball.) A snub for him would mean riots, so consider him safe. The Irishman looks to put two legends in the category, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, plus Tom Hanks had a nomination in the bag as soon as he signed on to play Mister Rogers in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.\n\nThe rest: That last slot – and perhaps two if Irishman gets only one contender – will come down to four deserving thespians. Jamie Foxx is SAG-nominated for Just Mercy and his inclusion could alleviate some of the #OscarsSoWhite talk that's likely to come up. Same for Parasite standout Song Kang-ho. Anthony Hopkins (Two Popes) was in the Globes supporting category, so he's in the mix, as is Willem Dafoe (The Lighthouse), who could make it three years in a row for a nomination.\n\nSupporting actress\n\nThe best: It's the one acting category without an obvious front-runner, as Globes winner Laura Dern (Marriage Story) and Jennifer Lopez (Hustlers) seem destined for an epic face-off. With SAG and Globe nods and double the BAFTA love, Margot Robbie is a no-brainer to scoot in for Bombshell or Once Upon a Time – more than likely the former.\n\nThe rest: Johansson (Jojo Rabbit) and Nicole Kidman (Bombshell) have SAG nods, although the former is more likely to earn a best actress slot for Marriage Story and the latter might not get in with co-star Robbie being a lock. A couple of Hollywood stalwarts have Globe nominations to their credit: Bates for Richard Jewell and Annette Bening, who's still never won an Oscar, for The Report. The last two nominations, however, could go to Florence Pugh, with strong reviews for Little Women, and Zhao Shuzhen, the charismatic grandma from The Farewell.\n\nDirector\n\nThe best: Directors Guild picks often overlaps with this category, a boon for Globe winner Mendes and fellow Globe/BAFTA nominees Tarantino, Bong Joon-ho (Parasite) and Martin Scorsese (The Irishman).\n\nThe rest: The scrum for the fifth slot will come down to DGA nominee Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit) or Todd Phillips (Joker), who earned Globe and BAFTA honors. On the outside looking in are Noah Baumbach (Marriage Story) and Greta Gerwig (Little Women) – a snub for her would have extra sting since 2019 was one of the strongest years ever for women's voices and women's stories in cinema.
Plus: Bay Area doctors hail Biden's plan for rapid COVID response; and Tito Ortiz attempts TKO on iconic restaurant over mask issue and loses\n\nI'm Winston Gieseke, philanthropy and special sections editor for The Desert Sun in Palm Springs bringing you the latest California news on this history-making Inauguration Day.\n\nIn California brings you top Golden State stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Get it free, straight to your inbox.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris makes history as first woman to hold the office\n\nIn a barrier-breaking ceremony Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris took the oath of office, becoming the first woman, the first Black American and the first South Asian American to hold the office.\n\nThe daughter of an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, Harris was sworn in by fellow trailblazer Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court justice.\n\nThe vice president took the oath while her husband and second gentleman (another first!) Doug Emhoff looked on. Emhoff's two children from his first marriage also were there. After taking the oath, Harris hugged Emhoff and gave a double fist-bump to President Joe Biden.\n\nThe crowd of lawmakers, family and friends fell silent as Harris made history, then erupted into applause after she was sworn in. Ready to serve, Harris wrote in her first tweet on the official Vice President Twitter account.\n\nDespite fears of violence on Inauguration Day, California protests remained peaceful. The only thing out of the ordinary Wednesday was a magnitude 3.5 earthquake that briefly rocked parts of Southern California at 8:31 a.m. No damage was reported.\n\nAlex Padilla becomes first Latino to represent California in U.S. Senate\n\nAmong her first duties as vice president, California's former senator Kamala Harris swore into office her replacement, former California Secretary of State Alex Padilla.\n\nThe child of Mexican immigrants, Padilla is the state's first Latino senator, giving a new level of representation to the demographic group that makes up nearly 40% of the state's population.\n\nIn an interview with CalMatters prior to being sworn in, Padilla expressed his views that former President Donald Trump and his supporters, including Electoral College objectors Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, must be held accountable for their actions during his time in office.\n\nEvery member of the Senate takes an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, not to uphold conspiracy theories and baseless lies about election results, Padilla said. And they had fatal consequences on Jan. 6. We can't lose sight of it. ... I think the nation would be best served if they were no longer in the Senate.\n\nOn the subject of COVID, he said: We can't rest on our laurels just because there's vaccines that have been approved. … The other side of COVID response is economic. The $2,000 direct assistance to families across the country should have been done yesterday. The sooner we get that done, the better. And I want to be clear that it's not a stimulus check in my opinion. It's a survival check.\n\nCalifornia ramps up COVID vaccinations, but are there enough doses?\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been stymied by a lack of available doses; California counties have greenlighted hundreds of hundreds of thousands of people to receive vaccines that have not yet been delivered. Will this make it difficult for patients to get the required second dose in a timely manner?\n\nData from Riverside County as of Tuesday showed that while more than 700,000 people are eligible for the vaccine — including anyone 65 years or older, teachers, law enforcement, farmworkers and others — it has only received 157,775 doses.\n\nUp north, San Francisco, which is planning to open three large coronavirus vaccination sites in the hopes of eventually administering a minimum of 10,000 doses per day, said it's likely to run out of vaccine Thursday. And while Fresno County has the means to inoculate 30,000 people weekly, it's only been receiving 8,000-10,000 doses per week.\n\nAnd let's not forget that a full vaccine requires two doses administered several weeks apart, so the number of available doses is actually half the number received.\n\nCalifornia officials said they are counting on the federal distribution network speeding up now that President Biden is in office. In fact ...\n\nBay Area doctors hail Biden's plan for rapid COVID response\n\nIn spite of vaccine distribution problems, the San Francisco Chronicle reports that after almost a year of fighting misinformation and disjointed efforts to control the virus, many Bay Area doctors felt hope on Wednesday as Biden was sworn in.\n\nDr. John Swartzberg, an infectious disease specialist from UC Berkeley who wiped away tears while watching the inauguration, said he was just relieved to see a rational speech from the president and a science-based plan from the federal administration. We're going to see a big difference, he said. Mark my words.\n\nBiden's ambitious plan to handle the pandemic, unveiled last week, includes a goal to administer 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days and invoking the Cold War-era Defense Production Act to produce more doses. He also announced a $1.9 trillion proposal to build up testing in order to reopen schools, boost the economy and help workers and their families who have been hurt by nearly a year of recession.\n\nFollowing the inauguration, the president signed executive orders requiring masks to be worn on federal property and directives to rejoin international efforts working to combat the pandemic that the previous administration had shunned, including membership in the World Health Organization.\n\nHe also put together a task force of medical experts in November, which included three specialists from the Bay Area.\n\nTito Ortiz attempts TKO on iconic restaurant over mask issue, loses\n\nAmerican mixed martial artist Tito Ortiz, who was voted in last year as a Huntington Beach city council member, took to Facebook over the weekend, urging people to avoid a local burger joint that had refused to serve the maskless public official, according to a report in The Orange County Register.\n\nIn a video posted Sunday, Ortiz complains that they won't let me order unless I have a mask to come in. ... TK Burger, you lose my business, you lose HB's business.\n\nOrtiz's video had the opposite effect. Dozens of people went to the restaurant to show support. Even Mayor Kim Carr shared a photo of her picking up lunch at the restaurant Monday. TK Burgers is a Huntington Beach institution, Carr said. I wanted to thank them for practicing health guidelines.\n\nBy Monday, possibly stung by the criticism he received, Ortiz had changed his tune, calling his denunciation of TK Burgers a bad decision.\n\nI understand this is a small business, he said via Facebook, and I would never want to ruin that business.\n\nOrtiz has previously raised eyebrows and ire over his skepticism to COVID-19 and his refusal to wear a face covering, expressing his belief that masks actually cause disease rather than prevent it.\n\nThat's all for now.

Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nYou would think that upon reaching the age of 90 on Thursday, Queen Elizabeth II would sit back and put her feet up in her castle with a cuppa and a corgi. But not this nonagenarian sovereign.\n\nThe queen, accompanied by her husband Prince Philip, who turns 95 in June, will be working on her birthday, just as she has worked on most of her birthdays and on most days since becoming queen in February 1952.\n\nExpect to see these two aged-but-still-fit royals on a walkabout outside Windsor Castle on the day, greeting well-wishers (many of whom will have camped out overnight to see her) after unveiling a plaque marking the Queen's Walkway, a four-mile walking trail in Windsor, the town surrounding the 930-year-old castle.\n\nNot only that, Wednesday the duo carried out two other public appearances in Windsor of the sort that have filled her diary for more than six decades: She visited the Royal Mail office in Windsor to mark the 500th anniversary of the postal service, and met schoolchildren when she opened a new bandstand at the riverside Alexandra Gardens.\n\nPrince George steals the show in royal family photo\n\nBecause that's the way she rolls — she's a woman devoted to duty, says CNN royal commentator Victoria Arbiter, who grew up around royals because her father is a former press secretary to the queen.\n\nArbiter says reaching 90 is a happy achievement for anyone but it's no excuse for slacking off in the view of the duty-conscious queen, who vowed service to her country at age 21 and has never retracted it.\n\nShe's doing engagements in Windsor on her birthday, Arbiter says, which shows what kind of model the queen is for her royal heirs. She has provided the single greatest blueprint of any other monarch. She is a study of how it's done, in every capacity — she is a study in how to be queen.\n\nLater in the day, will be joined by members of her family, including grandson Prince William and his wife, Duchess Kate of Cambridge, for a private celebration at Windsor Castle in the evening.\n\nAnd on Friday, she will host President Barack Obama for a private lunch at Windsor.\n\nSee more Queen Elizabeth birthday pics\n\nIt's a big deal that the queen is turning 90 — it marks another record for a record-setting royal. No other of the previous 40 British or English monarchs before her ever reached that age. And no other monarch before her reigned for a record 64 years; She passed that mark, set more than a century ago by her great-great grandmother Queen Victoria, in 2015.\n\nShe celebrated her Diamond Jubilee (60 years on the throne) in 2012, and looks to be headed for her Platinum Jubilee in 2022; after all, her mother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, lived to be just short of 102.\n\nBut the big whoopee for the queen's 90th will be celebrated by the British mostly in May and June, when the weather is better and the queen's birthday is normally marked at the Trooping the Color, the annual parade of horses and troops in scarlet uniforms and tall bearskin caps in central London.\n\nFor three days starting May 12, Windsor Castle will be the setting for a 90-minute extravaganza with 900 horses and more than 1,500 riders, actors, bands and dancers from around the world, who will tell her story from her birth through to World War II, her marriage, her coronation and her reign. The queen will attend on the final evening.\n\nOn June 10, her birthday will be marked with a televised Service of Thanksgiving at St. Paul's Cathedral in London. (June 10 is also Prince Philip's birthday but he doesn't want any public celebration.)\n\nThe following day will be the Trooping the Color ceremonies and the day after that, June 12, will be the Patron's Lunch, to celebrate the queen's patronage of more than 600 charities and organizations.\n\nThis event, organized by the queen's eldest grandson, Peter Phillips (son of her only daughter Princess Anne, the Princess Royal) will be unprecedented. The Mall in London is to be transformed into a giant street party and picnic for 10,000 paying guests, with entertainment by street performers and circus acts, while the queen and her husband watch from a specially-built platform on the Queen Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace.
Mark Curnutte\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nMOUNT GILEAD, Ohio – By her count, Sandra Mendoza had not seen her fiance for 66 days.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon in a rural Ohio jail, she got to hold his hand, wrap her arms around his shoulders, kiss his lips and become his wife.\n\nI didn't want to leave him, Mendoza said after the 33-minute ceremony.\n\nShe wore a white wedding dress that cost her $9 at a discount store and an ivory jacket. Holding a bouquet of pale pink roses, she stood near two vending machines and a metal detector in the lobby of the Morrow County Jail.\n\nShe inhaled deeply and finished her thought. I am ready for everything … whatever comes next.\n\nHer husband, Yancarlos Mendez, 27, will either be deported to his native Dominican Republic or allowed to return home to his wife and stepson in suburban Springdale.\n\nRicky Solis, 6, Mendoza's son, a U.S. citizen paralyzed from the waist down in an auto crash a year ago, was not allowed to see his stepfather. Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and a pair of new shoes, he sat in his wheelchair and ate a bag of potato chips.\n\nI just wanted to see my dad, said Ricky, who tried not to cry. At least twice, though, he wiped tears from his cheeks. The child had not spoken with Mendez since he was led away in a Butler County courtroom Nov. 29.\n\nAccording to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement rules, only those essential for the marriage ceremony may attend. A Cincinnati Enquirer reporter and two photographers were not permitted to witness the wedding ceremony or interview Mendez.\n\nThree people entered the secure area of the federal detention center in the county jail: the bride, their pastor and one of their attorneys, Charleston Wang, who collected signatures afterward on the marriage license.\n\nMore:Immigrant's jailhouse wedding gets OK from sheriff\n\nMore:Despite social media outcry, paraplegic boy's 'Daddy' to be deported\n\nYancarlos was emotional, said their pastor, Alfredo Ortiz, of Iglesia Jesucristo Rey de las Naciones in Lincoln Heights. As Christians, we have hope that God will help.\n\nMendez was dressed in his prison uniform, light green pants, matching short-sleeve shirt and a white undershirt.\n\nHe told me how much he loved me and said he didn't want me to cry, his wife said.\n\nWhile attorney Wang drove the three hours to Mount Gilead with two other immigrant advocates, another of the couple's attorneys, Nazly Mamedova, filed more paperwork with the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.\n\nWe are petitioning on behalf of the son, the mother and the stepfather, Wang said in the jail lobby. The public interest is served by allowing the family to remain together to care for the disabled child.\n\nICE disagrees and is unmoved, and its Detroit office issued a statement to that effect late Wednesday after a three-judge panel with the 6th Circuit granted the government's motion to lift the stay of his removal.\n\nICE has carefully reviewed his case and determined he was ineligible for any agency relief, and as such will move forward with his repatriation to his home country, the enforcement agency stated.\n\nMendez entered the United States legally on the Visa Waiver Program from Spain — he has dual citizenship — but he overstayed the 90-day limit by more than two years, ICE officials said.\n\nHe has been in federal detention since late November, following a second citation for driving without a license. He worked as an auto mechanic to support Mendoza and her son and was trained by staff at Cincinnati Children's Hospital to care medically for Ricky. Mendoza had to quit her job in a pizza parlor to stay with Ricky around the clock.\n\nMendez proposed a few days after Ricky and his mother were injured in the car crash.\n\nHe got down on one knee, she said. We were so busy with Ricky, we just never got around to getting married.\n\nTheir attorneys had to get an authorized copy of Mendez's divorce certificate from Spain before securing the marriage license in Butler County.\n\nRicky's constant medical needs, even with a nurse in the apartment, are never far away and leave Mendoza with little time for reflection. But Mendoza said her husband loves Ricky like he is his own son, and she believes it is the family's love that ultimately will win out.\n\nIf he stays, I am going to be happy, she said of her new husband. If he leaves, it's going to hurt. But I know he's going to be home sooner or later.
The Oscars might have overlooked Greta Gerwig in this year's directors category, but her love, Noah Baumbach, didn't.\n\nWhile doling out his thank yous at Saturday's Film Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica, California, the filmmaker gave a shout-out to the Little Women director/screenwriter.\n\nI want to say hi to Greta, who, even though she made a movie too expensive for the Spirit Awards, she's no less independent than anyone here, the Marriage Story writer/director said, wrapping up his acceptance speech for best screenplay. You're amazing and my inspiration in everything.\n\nBiggest Oscar snubs:Jennifer Lopez, Robert De Niro, Eddie Murphy shut out of nominations\n\nAdam Sandler jokes about Oscar 'snub' during expletive-laden Spirit Awards speech\n\nGerwig's Little Women received six Academy Award nods, including one for best adapted screenplay. For the second year in a row, the Oscars best director category has not included any women. Gerwig was the sole female director nominated for Lady Bird for the Oscars in 2018. That year she picked up the Spirit Award for best screenplay for the film starring Saoirse Ronan. Gerwig was previously nominated for best female lead Spirit Award for her role in the 2010 flick Greenberg, directed by Baumbach.\n\nIn March 2019, Gerwig's representative Liz Mahoney confirmed her client and Baumbach had welcomed a child, after keeping the pregnancy under wraps.\n\nWhile Baumbach is clearly fond of Gerwig, he spoke Saturday of the agony of screenwriting.\n\nThis is my t10th movie, and I would think after 10 screenplays, it would get easier, but no, he said. The truth is, for little moments amidst the agony, I love writing. And to be celebrated for it is a truly wonderful thing.\n\nContributing: Maeve McDermott\n\nCoronavirus prevents Chinese 'Farewell' star Zhao Shuzhen from accepting her Spirit Award\n\nLaura Dern talks long road to Oscar for 'Marriage Story' (and why she's definitely a Jo from 'Little Women')
Erin Lowry\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nAfter the wedding cake is eaten and the thank you notes are written, it's time to focus on the actual marriage. For many newlyweds, merging finances is the first big decision, one that involves unpacking emotional baggage about money and figuring out what works best for them as a couple.\n\nTraditional rhetoric promotes banking together in marriage. But as families blend and people marry in different stages of life, saying I do to joint accounts is not always the right answer.\n\nThere are three main strategies for approaching finances in marriage, according to Aditi Shekar, founder and CEO of Zeta, a service that helps couples manage their money together.\n\nAll in It Together\n\nIn this model, couples bring all of their assets and liabilities together, Shekar says, which means joint bank accounts held in both partners' names and accessible to both.\n\nWhen Maureen Wright married her husband, Patrick, a year and a half ago, they immediately decided to merge their finances into one checking, one savings and one joint investment account – just like their parents did. To Wright, who works as a financial adviser, the advantages of banking jointly included built-in accountability, transparency and simplicity.\n\nAndy Hill and his wife, Nicole, combined their money after getting married nine years ago.\n\nMore starter homes:Buying a new house may be easier for millennials\n\nThere's no better time than now:5 ways to get credit-healthy in 2020\n\nFrom the beginning of our relationship, we both liked the idea of merging our money so we could tackle our financial goals together, says Hill, host of the Marriage, Kids and Money podcast. I had $30,000 of student loan debt, and she had a $20,000 car loan. When we combined both of our five-figure incomes to make a six-figure one, we were able to eliminate our debt in less than a year by living on one income.\n\nAt different times, one of the Hills has earned more than the other, so their combined accounts reduce any potential headaches that come from spouses earning unequal incomes. Mentally, it's all their money.\n\nWright and Hill acknowledge the joining of finances isn't without struggle.\n\nWright points out that it can take time to feel like the spending is fair.\n\nWe set a dollar amount that we need to consult the other person on before making a purchase, Wright says. That helps manage bigger purchases and keep things level.\n\nHill advises bringing empathy to your conversations to understand the other person's point of view on smart uses of money.\n\nWright and her husband still hold credit cards from before they were married, which they typically don't use unless it's a holiday or a birthday. To surprise each other, they'll purchase gifts on those cards and not update any shared budgeting software or spreadsheets until after the event.\n\nYours, Mine and Ours\n\nIn this newer model, couples merge part of their finances in a joint bank account and put the rest in individual ones (sometimes called an allowance), Shekar explains.\n\nElle Martinez, a personal finance author and host of the Couple Money podcast, uses the Yours, Mine and Ours model with her husband of 13 years. Ninety percent of the couple's after-tax money goes into joint checking and savings accounts, then the remainder gets put into their individual checking accounts.\n\nI do want to stress that for us, separate doesn't mean secret. We know the balances on those accounts and if we do make a bigger purchase from it, says Martinez, who prefers the majority joint approach because it makes life easier between work, kids and projects.\n\nEach person having an allowance reduces the nitpicking at each other when someone spends in a way that doesn't align with the other person's values. Some couples elect to have the same stipend, while others prorate based on incomes or needs.\n\nA key to this model is to focus on paying all the bills, funding the savings accounts and working toward the shared goals first before splitting off and funding the yours and mine accounts.\n\nKeeping It Separate\n\nAs the name suggests, this strategy means married couples keep their money completely siloed.\n\nUsually, they'll take ownership over various household bills (internet) or responsibilities (child care), so they can divide expenses between each other without having to merge accounts, Shekar says. While this model might require more work and coordination, it also allows for the maximum amount of control for each partner.\n\nAmanda Kay and her husband kept money separate when they moved in together and never bothered to create joint accounts.\n\nThere are a few automatic payments that are set up through my account, so we need to be mindful of that and make sure there is enough money in the right account, at the right time, Kay says.\n\nBlending families and second marriages are another reason it may be prudent to have separate accounts.\n\nWe had both married before, and both have managed our finances as head of the household and agreed that it made sense for us to continue with that, says Leslie Tayne, founder and head attorney of the Tayne Law Group. Since we are older, our finances are more complex, and keeping it separate just made sense for us.\n\nTayne is a signer on her husband's accounts to give her access in the case of shared goals. The couple work together to cover mutual household expenses, but they individually take care of their children's needs.\n\nIt can seem unromantic or like you don't trust your partner. … It can seem very much like it's 'mine vs. yours' rather than 'ours,'  Tayne admits, though she and her husband are careful not to use mine and yours language when referring to money.\n\nTime to ramp up your retirement savings?:Here are 4 money-saving tricks that actually work\n\nHow to pick what's right for you?\n\nThe merging process doesn't need to happen right after signing your marriage license. It could make more sense to take your time.\n\nI'm a huge fan of couples merging their finances slowly, so they avoid any big changes and surprises and find the happy balance that works for them, Shekar says.\n\nIt's critical to acknowledge that what works in the first few months or years of marriage isn't always going to be the right choice, especially as life changes.\n\nIt's going to be different for every couple, Tayne says. So the most important thing is that you're willing to have those honest conversations, even though they can be difficult and sometimes uncomfortable.\n\nErin Lowry is the author of Broke Millennial Takes On Investing and Broke Millennial: Stop Scraping By and Get Your Financial Life Together.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this column are the author's and do not necessarily reflect those of USA TODAY.
Duchess Meghan, pregnant with her second child, is joining Oprah Winfrey for an intimate conversation in her first major broadcast interview since moving back to the U.S.\n\nCBS revealed glimpses of the two-hour Oprah with Meghan and Harry: A CBS Primetime Special will air on Sunday, March 7 (8 EST/PST).\n\nThe network said Winfrey spoke with the Duchess of Sussex in a wide-ranging interview covering everything from stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood (and) philanthropic work, to how she is handling life under intense public pressure.\n\nIn two promos that aired Sunday, Meghan doesn't speak, but Winfrey appears to quote her calling their frustrations almost unsurvivable.\n\nHarry harkened back to the troubles his mother, Princess Diana, had with the British media, and says he shares her frustration: My biggest fear is history repeating itself, he tells Winfrey at one point. It has been unbelievably tough for the two of us, but at least we have each other.\n\nWinfrey is seen interviewing Meghan alone and with Harry. It marks the first time she's done a major TV network interview since she and Harry gave up their senior royal roles and moved back to her home state of California. In February, Meghan, 39, announced her second pregnancy and won a major victory in a privacy lawsuit against the British tabloid Mail.\n\nThe pregnancy reveal had a special connection to Diana, who made headlines on Valentine's Day in 1984 when she announced her second pregnancy. She gave birth to Harry on Sept. 15 of that year.\n\nBaby No. 2:Duchess Meghan, Prince Harry share pregnancy announcement (with a connection to Diana)\n\nWinfrey and the Sussexes are now neighbors in Montecito, California, occupying nearby sprawling estates.\n\nWinfrey was one of multiple celebrity guests who attended the May 2018 wedding of the former actress, Meghan Markle, and Prince Harry, 36, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMeghan and Winfrey now call each other friends, exchanging gifts when Sussex baby Archie, who turns 2 in May, was born, and later when Harry and Meghan moved into their new home in Santa Barbara County.\n\nIt was unclear whether the interview has already taken place and if so, whether it was conducted remotely under pandemic protocols. It was produced by Winfrey's Harpo Productions and sold to CBS, where Winfrey has links, including CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King, Winfrey's longtime best friend.\n\nNeither Meghan nor Harry have been seen much in public since November, when they visited the Los Angeles National Cemetery to lay a wreath on Nov. 8 in honor of British Remembrance Day.\n\nThe couple have been seen in Zoom video interviews online with such publications as Fast Company, Fortune and The 19th, but these were on Zoom.\n\nThe last major TV interview the couple did was for Britain's ITV at the end of 2019 when they first spoke openly about their unhappiness with their royal lives in the United Kingdom, specifically Harry's rift with his brother, Prince William, and Meghan's distress over media coverage that they considered invasive and abusive.\n\nIn January 2020, they announced they were stepping back from their royal roles and moving to North America in search of more freedom, privacy and financial independence. They have since signed lucrative deals with Netflix and Spotify to produce entertainment, documentaries and podcasts.\n\nThe couple also have filed four lawsuits in the U.K. and in California alleging invasion of privacy, and have won three of them. In the most recent victories, The Mail on Sunday apologized, issued a correction and paid damages over a story that wrongly reported Harry had turned his back on his prized military associations.\n\nLast week, Meghan scored a major victory, winning a summary judgment in her contentious lawsuit against the Mail of Sunday for invading her privacy when it published parts of a letter she wrote to her estranged father.\n\n'Damage runs deep':Duchess Meghan wins privacy lawsuit against British tabloid
LOS ANGELES – Four weeks after Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna died in a helicopter crash, the scope of the tragedy's impact has become clear.\n\nMillions of people around the world have used social media to express shock and sadness.\n\nTens of thousands of people have flocked to Staples Center to pay their respects where Bryant starred for the Los Angeles Lakers during a 20-year career that included five NBA championships.\n\nAnd on Monday, about 20,000 people are expected to fill Staples Center for a memorial service that will start at 1 p.m. ET and be televised live in Southern California. The crowd might include a mourner whose grief is incomparable.\n\nWhile the world has lost a legendary basketball player, Vanessa Bryant has lost her husband and a teenage daughter. She has yet to make a public appearance since the Jan. 26 crash that killed Kobe Bryant, Gianna (who was affectionately known as Gigi) and seven other people, friends and family members en route to an AAU game, along with pilot Ara Zobayan.\n\nAt 37, Vanessa Bryant is now a widow after nearly two decades of marriage to Kobe Bryant. She is the sole parent of the couple's three other daughters – Natalia, 17; Bianka, 3; and Capri, 8 months.\n\nI'm very concerned,'' said Therese Rando, a clinical psychologist who specializes in traumatic loss. Vanessa has this very complicated task. Even if you don't look at her own grief, she has three children of very different ages and so very different intellectual and cognitive ability to grasp this particular loss.\n\nI know people can and do survive this. However, it takes more time, more understanding, more support, more accurate expectations than if this had been an expected death.''\n\nSince the crash, Bryant has used Instagram to communicate with the public and on Feb. 10 she shared details of her struggle.\n\nI've been reluctant to put my feelings into words,'' she wrote. My brain refuses to accept that both Kobe and Gigi are gone. I can't process both at the same time. It's like I'm trying to process Kobe being gone but my body refuses to accept my Gigi will never come back to me. It feels wrong.''\n\nThere are signs of how Bryant might cope with the deaths, if how she coped with difficulties in her marriage is evidence.\n\nIn 2003, Kobe Bryant was accused of raping a woman at a hotel in Colorado. He denied the accusations but acknowledged having sex with the 19-year-old. Vanessa Bryant forgave Kobe Bryant, and the case was dropped when Kobe Bryant's accuser refused to testify. A civil case was settled out of court.\n\nBut in 2011, Vanessa Bryant filed for divorce and cited irreconcilable differences.''\n\nWith the divorce still pending a year later, Vanessa Bryant posted on her Instagram page a quote from J.R.R. Tolkien, author of The Hobbit.\n\nFaithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.''\n\nThe following month, she and Kobe publicly announced they had called off plans for the divorce. That same day, Vanessa Bryant posted on her Instagram page: Have Faith.''\n\nKOBE'S REACH: Obama, LeBron, luminaries share favorite memories of Kobe\n\nKOBE IN CHINA: How NBA icon helped game grow in basketball-crazed nation\n\nOPINION: Kobe's last sit-down interview, with USA TODAY Sports, window into motivation\n\nOPINION: Kobe one of a kind, even in retirement\n\nA practicing Catholic, Vanessa Bryant graduated from St. Boniface Catholic School in Anaheim in 1996 before attending Marina High School in Huntington Beach. On Ash Wednesday last year, she posted on Instagram a photo of herself with ashes on her forehead in the shape of a cross. She also has posted images to commemorate Easter and Christmas.\n\nOver the years, Vanessa Bryant, Kobe Bryant and their daughters were seen several times attending mass services at Our Lady Queen of Angels Catholic Church in Newport Beach.\n\nHer faith may be one of the most important resources that she has,'' said Rando, the clinical psychologist who is the author of several books, including How to Go on Living When Someone You Love Dies, Parental Loss of a Child, and Treatment of Complicated Mourning.''\n\nI can attest to the fact that many times it is only faith that gets people through. We know for many people it is a tremendous resource. But faith doesn't take away separation pain.''\n\nVanessa Bryant revealed as much in an Instagram post Feb. 10.\n\nWhy should I be able to wake up another day when my baby girl isn't being able to have that opportunity?!'' she wrote. I'm so mad. She had so much life to live.\n\nThen I realize I need to be strong and be here for my 3 daughters. Mad I'm not with Kobe and Gigi but thankful I'm here with Natalia, Bianka and Capri.''\n\nAlthough Vanessa Bryant's three daughters can be a source of comfort for her, they also will complicate her grieving process, said Joanne Cacciatore, a professor and researcher of trauma and bereavement at Arizona State University.\n\nIf you're a parent and you're also trying to pay attention to your grieving children, this can be really hard,'' Cacciatore said. And that's why community support and family support is absolutely essential.''\n\nVanessa Bryant likely has been drawing support from her mother, Sofia, and her sister, Sophie, during a time that Cacciatore said can drain the energy needed to handle daily tasks like preparing meals.\n\nNow I realize we're talking about Kobe Bryant's family, so it's a little bit different in terms of practical hardship because obviously they have the means,'' Cacciatore said. But there are other forms of support that will be important for any family no matter what your socioeconomic status is, and that is the loving support of family and friends, of neighbors and our communities, in an unrushed, nonjudgmental way.''\n\nPILOT: Ara Zobayan had FAA violation in 2015\n\nCRASH: No engine failure, investigation ongoing\n\nBearing almost unthinkable loss, Vanessa Bryant surely will be embraced Monday if she attends the memorial service – something in which she appears to have taken a special interest.\n\nOn Feb. 7, the day Kobe Bryant and Gianna were buried in a private ceremony at Pacific View Memorial Park in Corona Del Mar, Vanessa Bryant posted on Instagram a notice for the memorial service billed as A Celebration of Life. The notice has butterflies on it, a common theme on her Instagram account.\n\nShe also referred to the service being held on a fitting date, 2-24-2020. No. 2 is the jersey number Gianna wore, No. 24 is a jersey number Kobe Bryant wore and 20 has special significance too.\n\nWrote Vanessa Bryant: #2, #24, #20 years as a Laker and the amount of years Kobe and I were together ❤️❤️💜💛\n\nAlan Wolfelt, founder and director of the Center for Loss & Life Transition in Colorado, said the public memorial service will help Bryant with the healing process.\n\nWhen words are inadequate, you have ceremony,'' Wolfelt said. Right now words are inadequate.\n\nBut if she can feel the loving arms of people wrapped around her … that'll help her and her kids survive and go on to live again.''\n\nFollow Josh Peter on Twitter @joshlpeter11
Protests over Confederate monuments. A right-wing rally turned deadly in Charlottesville. And now, two of Virginia's top officeholders have admitted to blackface impersonations of African-American singers.\n\nIn an era when all of the United States are reexamining their history of racism, no state has had to look itself in the mirror more than Virginia. Its proud history as the home of presidents and patriots also includes ignoble chapters as the epicenter of the slave trade and capital of the Confederacy.\n\nIf slavery is the original sin of American life, Virginia is its Garden of Eden.\n\nIn some ways, my personal history mirrors that of this commonwealth, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a press conference Saturday. The Democrat admitted to a blackface impersonation of Michael Jackson, but denied he was one of the subjects of a 1984 yearbook photo featuring a robed Klansman and a man in blackface.\n\nThe state's attorney general, Mark Herring, made his own admission Wednesday, saying he dressed in brown makeup in 1980 to portray rapper Kurtis Blow.\n\nHerring, also a Democrat, apologized for his ignorance and glib attitudes.\n\nThat I have contributed to the pain Virginians have felt this week is the greatest shame I have ever felt, he said in a statement.\n\nIt's a pain Virginians have felt before.\n\nIn 2006, Sen. George Allen lost his re-election bid – and his presidential aspirations – after a racist remark at campaign rally. The Republican former governor referred to an Indian-American opposition tracker who had infiltrated the rally as Macaca, a Portuguese word for monkey and a slur against dark-skinned people.\n\nHe apologized and lost.\n\nA right-wing backlash to protests of Confederate memorials turned deadly in Charlottesville in 2017. A neo-Nazi from Ohio drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, murdering 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\n\nThe incident led only to a greater push to remove memorials in places like Richmond, the state capital whose Monument Avenue remains as the most prominent symbol of the Lost Cause revisionist history of the Civil War. The state legislature still forbids the removal of the statues.\n\nAnd now, Northam's yearbook photo has prompted an examination into the culture of its educational institutions: the Virginia Military Institute, where he was an undergrad, and the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk where the 1984 photo was taken.\n\nVirginia in some ways is a state struggling with its self-identity, said Stephen Farnsworth, who studies Virginia politics at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. There are so many competing narratives about what Virginia is.\n\nFault line of American politics\n\nThe Confederacy continues to cast a long shadow over a new Virginia that is increasingly diverse, educated, suburban and liberal.\n\nVirginia was the capital of the breakaway Southern states but also its most northern member. It was also home to more Civil War battles than any other state.\n\nIt's 19th-century farming economy – fueled by free labor from enslaved African-Americans – has now transformed into a 21st-century technology hub that attracts a diverse and educated workforce. More than half of Virginians were born somewhere else.\n\nVirginia is on the fault line of the old South and the new, Farnsworth said.\n\nThe Old Dominion is much more aggressively contested political space than you would see in many other southern states. And that means a lot of arguments over its past.\n\nThat past runs deep. Virginia was the home of the first permanent English settlement in what's now the United States, at Jamestown, in 1607. Twelve years later, the first slaves from Africa arrived there.\n\nVirginia claims the first Thanksgiving, and four of the first five presidents. (It's given birth to eight overall – more than any other state.)\n\nAfter the importation of new slaves was outlawed in 1808, Richmond became the hub for the domestic slave trade, allowing for vast plantations and immense wealth for their owners. And when the South seceded from the Union in 1861, Virginia was the richest state in what would have been the fourth-richest country in the world.\n\nJulian Maxwell Hayter, a historian at the University of Richmond, says that history continues to cast a shadow throughout the commonwealth today.\n\nWhat you've seen over time is this deeply entrenched wealth reasserting itself though Jim Crow, and through most of the 20th century, said Hayter, author of The Dream Is Lost: Voting Rights and the Politics of Race in Richmond, Virginia. It's one of the few places in the South where people pride themselves on their direct lineage to the first families.\n\nSo I find it interesting that people are surprised that this stuff lasted well into the twilight of the 20th century. Those things persist throughout the system itself, and they have a longer shelf life than people tend to recognize.\n\nBut at the same time – as one of Virginia's many contradictions – it also has a racially progressive strain. The 51-year-old Supreme Court decision allowing blacks and whites to marry came out of Virginia, and the state has one of the highest rates of interracial marriage today.\n\nPhoto gallery:Lawyers marry on anniversary of Loving vs. Virginia ruling\n\nVirginians know they're Southern but they always considered themselves more refined than their brothers in the Deep South, Hayter said. It's full of these kinds of contradictions, and by the way, it's in keeping with the things that Ralph Northam has been accused of.\n\nAmericans like their racism black and white. We don't do well with granularity.\n\nThat's led to some awkward juxtapositions. Until 2000, the Martin Luther King Day holiday was celebrated on the same day honoring two Confederate generals, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.\n\nThe Lee-Jackson-King day was a compromise hashed out by then-state Sen. Douglas Wilder, later the state's first African-American governor.\n\nYou recognize Virginia for what it is. Virginia's heritage is as rich as it has ever been, he told the Washington Post in 1985.\n\nAnd just last month, Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax – only the second African-American officeholder in the state's history – stepped off the dais of the state Senate rather than preside over an annual celebration of Lee's birthday.\n\nFrom blue to red to purple\n\nLike most states, a map of election results shows deep reds in rural counties and even deeper blues in the cities.\n\nAs the cites and their suburbs have grown – in large part with non-native college students, federal workers and contractors – so have the ranks of Democratic voters.\n\nThe state voted reliably Republican in every election from Richard Nixon to George W. Bush – but has gone Democratic for three elections in a row in favor of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.\n\nState elections are even more competitive. With the strictest term limits in the nation, the governor's office changes hands every four years. Seven Democrats and six Republicans have served since 1970.\n\nMore than 248,000 active duty, reserve and civilian military personnel are stationed in Virginia – including, of course, the Pentagon – making its military population second only to California.\n\nThe large number of federal contractors, along with cheap electricity and an educated workforce, have spawned a secondary high-tech industry in Northern Virginia: Data centers. More than half of all Internet traffic in the country goes through the Dulles Technology corridor. Add to that strains of religion – from Bible Belt evangelical Christianity to more liberal churches.\n\nAt many of those churches Sunday, the Northam controversy caused some soul-searching about how to grapple honestly with issues of race.\n\nToday, I think people are asking the authentic question of how do you deal with the hypocrisy, said Mark Gordon, the former senior warden for St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Richmond after services Sunday morning.\n\nSt. Paul's, once known as the Cathedral of the Confederacy because Confederate leaders like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee worshiped there, sits directly across from the state Capitol.\n\nMore:Richmond churches seek racial reconciliation following Northam fiasco\n\nThe church has now dedicated itself to racial reconciliation, Gordon said.\n\nIf you look at the movement and the conversation, we at St. Paul's on our history and what's happening with the history of the Commonwealth, he said. The recent episode is a realization that the past is still with us and it has to be reconciled for us to move forward.\n\nGregory Korte reported from McLean, Va.

The infamous photo bomber is still serving water and looks, this time on the set of The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\nThe fallout from the Covington encounter\n\nThe Native American elder seen face-to-face with Covington Catholic High School students in a now-viral video says he's willing to meet with the teens after the footage sparked a national debate over the weekend. Nathan Phillips says the encounter could become a teachable moment on respect for diverse cultures. Longer footage of the encounter emerged Sunday, showing a group of Black Hebrew Israelites harassing the students before Phillips intervened, raising questions about who initiated the Friday dust-up at the Indigenous Peoples March in Washington, D.C. Threats followed to the students and the school itself, prompting classes to be cancelled on Tuesday amid safety concerns.\n\nSupreme Court OKs Trump's transgender military ban — for now\n\nThe Supreme Court will allow President Donald Trump's partial ban on transgender people serving in the military to take effect while court challenges continue. The high court Tuesday cleared away lower court actions that blocked the controversial policy from being implemented for nearly a year. But justices refused to hear the case before the Trump administration fights through federal appeals courts, leaving questions surrounding the action unresolved for now. The Pentagon reiterated Tuesday that the policy is not a complete ban and that transgender troops will continue to be treated with respect and dignity.\n\nWakanda at the Oscars\n\nAcademy Award nominations are out, and they will, they will, rock you.

It's been months since President Trump jabbed at Sen. Elizabeth Warren with an old nickname: Pocahontas.\n\nBut that didn't keep the Massachusetts Democrat from calling him out on it during a surprise address to the National Congress of American Indians on Wednesday.\n\nOur country's disrespect of Native people didn't start with President Trump. It started long before President Washington ever took office, she said, according to prepared remarks. But now we have a president who can't make it through a ceremony honoring Native American war heroes without reducing Native history, Native culture, Native people to the butt of a joke.\n\nShe continued: The joke, I guess, is supposed to be on me.\n\nThe senator was referring to a speech the president gave in November to honor Native American war heroes. You were here long before any of us were here, the president told the veterans at the time. Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas, he said, referring to Warren.\n\nHowever, Trump has frequently called Warren by the name Pocahontas, a reference to the daughter of a Native American chief in the 17th century.\n\nAt Wednesday's speech, Warren acknowledged that she isn't enrolled in a tribe and that her family isn't included in tribe rolls. She also said she hadn't used her family tree to get ahead or advance her career.\n\nHer claims of Native American heritage have stirred controversy in the past. During her 2012 Senate campaign, critics pointed to Warren being listed as a minority professor in the 1990s.\n\nBut she insisted that her parents were real people, and that her father's family opposed their marriage because her mother's family was part Native American. They went on to elope, and raised a family through the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.\n\nThey're gone, but the love they shared, the struggles they endured, the family they built, and the story they lived will always be a part of me, she said. And no one — not even the president of the United States — will ever take that part of me away.
Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLeave it to Duchess Kate to open up a little bit about raising little royals — but leave 'em wanting more.\n\nWe learned Monday that growing up Middleton — and middle-class — could be the best training for Kate as she raises Prince George, 3, and Princess Charlotte, 1, according to a speech the former Kate Middleton delivered in London.\n\nShe and Prince William, in the thick of their mental health-awareness campaign, appeared at a primary school and the Place2Be Wellbeing in Schools Awards to celebrate ambassadors of positive mental health in U.K. schools.\n\nDressed in one of her familiar outfits, a fire-engine red Luisa Spagnoli skirt suit, the duchess talked about her own family upbringing and how she and William hope to model it for their own children. The pair were greeted by the usual excited crowds of flag-waving kiddies at Mitchell Brook Primary School in north London.\n\nHer speech, reflecting her growing confidence as a public speaker since her marriage in 2011, addressed the adults in the room, and an even wider audience outside, about fostering mental health-wellness in children. She said she was lucky in that regard.\n\nMy family was the most important thing to me, she said, according to a transcript of the speech provided by Kensington Palace. They provided me with somewhere safe to grow and learn, and I know I was fortunate not to have been confronted by serious adversity at a young age, she said.\n\nHer parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, taught her kindness, respect and honesty, she said. I realize how central values like these have been to me throughout my life. That is why William and I want to teach our little children, George and Charlotte, just how important these things are as they grow up.\n\nShe said she also has learned lessons from children themselves, including an 11-year-old girl she met recently.\n\nShe told me that if you keep your feelings inside, you can feel as though you will blow up like a balloon, she said. But by talking to someone about them, it can make you feel so much better.\n\nI thought that was such a clever way of looking at it.\n\n.
Patrick Ryan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPARK CITY, Utah — Sundance Film Festival is just two days in, but two movies are already shaping up as audience favorites.\n\nThe Big Sick and Icarus each rode waves of pre-festival hype into their Friday premieres, earning enthusiastic reviews (and in the latter's case, repeated standing ovations). But the hotly tipped projects — both of which are seeking U.S. distribution — couldn't be more different.\n\nSick centers on a thirty-something stand-up comedian, Kumail (Silicon Valley's Kumail Nanjiani), whose newly ex-girlfriend, Emily (Zoe Kazan), falls mysteriously ill and lands in the hospital, where he must sign off on putting her in a medically induced coma. But the film is just as much a relationship comedy about parents as it is an unconventional love story, as Kumail struggles with his Pakistani parents' desire for him to have an arranged marriage, all while he learns to get along with Emily's fiercely protective mom (a scene-stealing Holly Hunter) and dad (Ray Romano).\n\nRiley Keough rocks anti-Trump hat on Sundance red carpet\n\nProduced by Judd Apatow and directed by Michael Showalter (Wet Hot American Summer), Sick was co-written by Nanjiani and his wife of nearly 10 years, Emily V. Gordon. The crowd-pleaser draws heavily from their relationship and Gordon's own grave experience in the hospital, but still manages to mine laughs from often serious, life-or-death moments throughout.\n\nWe talked a lot about (how) different people deal with these really tragic, uncomfortable situations, Showalter said in a Q&A after the screening. These people are trying to maintain some sense of humor through something that's excruciatingly painful, and that's something we kept coming back to. It's the only way to survive sometimes.\n\nSpeaking of uncomfortable comedy — no documentary since last year's Weiner has managed it better than Icarus. The stranger-than-fiction film starts as a Super Size Me-like endeavor for comedian / bicycling enthusiast Bryan Fogel, who decides to record himself using performance-enhancing drugs over a period of months, in hopes of proving how easily athletes like Lance Armstrong could avoid detection in doping tests.\n\nHis pursuit leads him to the almost-cartoonishly corrupt Grigory Rodchenkov, who served as director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Soon after agreeing to help Fogel with his steroid regimen, Rodchenkov unwittingly reveals on camera that he ran a state-sponsored doping program for Olympic athletes, many of whom went on to win gold metals for Russia after he gave them banned substances and swapped out their urine samples.\n\nSundance: Netflix's 'Home' blasts off with grisly, riotous thrills\n\nWhat unfolds is a sometimes funny, entirely shocking account of a global scandal, as Rodchenkov leaks the story to the press and flees Russia when others in the anti-doping program mysteriously die. (He is now in witness protection in the U.S.) For Fogel, it was a slow process of realizing that he'd stumbled into a story much bigger than himself.\n\nAt first, I made a choice as a filmmaker that I didn't want to become an investigative journalist; I was on my mission, and my mission was to do drugs and see if I could evade testing, Fogel said in an audience Q&A. But after a year of filming with Rodchenkov, there was a moment of, 'Oh my god, this guy's going to be killed, and I got to get him out of him (Russia).' That was when there was a moment of fear and excitement as a filmmaker, that this story was taking this incredible journey. But I was truly fearful.\n\nSundance: Al Gore's 'Inconvenient Sequel' has added timeliness with Trump
PROVIDENCE, R.I. – State Rep. Raymond Hull spoke to the state police detective in July. He says he remembers the officer's first question so clearly, because it sounded so preposterous.\n\nHe asked me, 'Do you think this Nicholas Alahverdian is still alive?'\n\nAlahverdian, a critic of the state's child welfare program who had pushed lawmakers like Hull to support reforms, died of cancer five months earlier, according to his widow and a widely disseminated email from the Alahverdian Family Office.\n\nHis announced death, at 32, came just two months after Alahverdian informed reporters at various media outlets that he had late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma and had weeks to live. His life as a crusader for children, now about to be cut short, was news that needed reporting, he insisted to a Journal reporter and editor.\n\nBut Alahverdian was also confronting another powerful force around that time, says Jeffrey Pine, a lawyer who had recently represented him: the FBI.\n\nThe agency was looking into a fraud complaint filed against him in Ohio, Pine says.\n\nHis former foster mother in Ohio, Sharon Lane, tells The Journal that Alahverdian had fraudulently obtained 22 credit cards and loans under her husband's name and ran up debts totaling almost $200,000.\n\nOhio court records also show Alahverdian's second wife was granted a divorce in 2017, after less than two years of marriage, with Alahverdian still owing her $52,000 from a loan.\n\nAlahverdian, who Pine says was living in Ireland at the end of 2019, knew of the FBI's interest in him. (Alahverdian had told the Journal he was living in an undisclosed country because his child-care advocacy from years ago had provoked threats.)\n\nAn FBI agent had called Alahverdian to discuss the fraud complaint, attorney Pine says. Alahverdian gave Pine the FBI investigator's name and I contacted him, just to confirm it.\n\nAny interest the agency had in arresting Alahverdian may have been complicated by him being overseas and the international cooperation required, says Pine, a former Rhode Island attorney general.\n\nTodd Lindgren, an FBI spokesman in Cincinnati, would not confirm or deny the existence of a potential investigation.\n\nPine, who successfully represented Alahverdian when he allegedly failed to register as a sex offender, says the timing of events – learning about the FBI's inquiry, Alahverdian's sudden pronouncement of his terminal illness and then his swift death – left questions in his mind.\n\nThe next thing I know he gets very, very sick with cancer and dies within weeks, Pine says. Do I think it's possible he's alive? Of course I do.\n\nHe is not alone.\n\nState police Lt. Col. Kevin Barry says a detective talked to Representative Hull, as well as other people, last summer as reports circulated that Alahverdian was still alive. The state police still had a warrant for him for allegedly failing to register in Rhode Island as a sex offender.\n\n(Alahverdian was convicted in 2008 on two sex-related charges after an encounter in a stairwell with a fellow student at Sinclair Community College, in Dayton, Ohio, according to court documents.)\n\nAnytime there is an allegation that someone is still alive and we have an active warrant of someone being a sex offender violator, we are going to take that seriously, Barry says. Without definitive evidence that he was deceased we had to run that down.\n\nHull says the detective, Conor O'Donnell, wanted to know how well the representative knew him and whether he thought Alahverdian was capable of faking his death. Hull said O'Donnell told him: We think him to be alive.\n\nThe question of his status has surfaced on the internet, too, where the online encyclopedia Wikipedia is questioning the accuracy of Alahverdian's biography.\n\nIt has posted a warning at the top of Alahverdian's page that reads: The truthfulness of this article has been questioned. It is believed that some or all of its content may constitute a hoax.\n\nAlahverdian's presumptive widow says all the speculation is disgraceful.\n\nIn a five-page email to The Journal she said, Unless my husband was cloned and died in my arms and faked cancer diagnosis, treatment and heart disease/heart attacks for months before that, he passed away. In my arms.\n\n(The Journal is not using her name since she requested anonymity at the time she announced Alahverdian's death, alluding to the same alleged threats he did.)\n\nShe said that if Rhode Island law enforcement truly wants to help my family maybe they should investigate how Nicholas was beaten and forced to work without pay at gunpoint as a campaign manager in 2016 and was raped by a politician in 2002 and 2003, and all of the abuse he suffered on (sic) Rhode Island and when he was sent to two other states.\n\nAlahverdian's allegations that he had been abused in out-of-state placement centers as a child in the care of the Department of Children, Youth and Families garnered much media attention over the years, as well as compassion and demands for change.\n\nHis widow said her husband had been cremated and his remains scattered at sea.\n\nShe declined two emailed requests that she release a copy of his death certificate.\n\nQuestions about the accuracy of Alahverdian's Wikipedia page began a few months ago when the blog site Wikipediocracy – which says it exists to expose the torrent of misinformation on the popular online encyclopedia – noticed changes being made to Alahverdian's page, says Wikipediocracy blog team member Michael Cockram.\n\nAnyone can make edits on Wikipedia's open site but they must use an account. Cockram, who lives in England, says what raised a red flag with his team members was that someone attempted to replace Alahvedian's photograph with a photoshopped image of someone else.\n\nCockram says the attempt was made by someone using an account created by Alahverdian.\n\nOther edits were also made from other accounts previously established by Alahverdian, Cockram says.\n\nAlahverdian's widow charges that Wikipediocracy members themselves made changes to her husband's page, seeding the allegation that they suspect he is not dead.\n\nShe says they threatened to further smear her husband's reputation with more bogus edits to the Wikipedia page unless the Alahverdian family paid extortion money in Bitcoin currency.\n\nFirst they claim my husband did all of these edits on Wikipedia himself, she wrote, then we receive extortion demands to stop the untrue edits and claims on Wikipedia.\n\nCockram says those allegations are frankly, (expletive) crazy and obviously untrue.\n\nCockram says his Wikipediocracy team received a long email from someone purporting to be Alahverdian's widow and a lawyer, but who they believe was Alahverdian himself.\n\nHe is clearly desperate to get his Wiki article and all mentions of the fake death deleted at this point, Cockram says.\n\nSays Alahverdian's widow: There are no words I can say to express my profound anger at those who are dishonestly speculating that my husband and the father of my children is actually alive when he waited to release his diagnosis hoping he would beat it but failed as many patients with non Hodgkin lymphoma do each year.\n\nIn 2008, police in Dayton, Ohio, brought charges against Alahverdian – who then used the last name Rossi – alleging he had sexually assaulted a fellow student in a stairwell at Sinclair Community College, according to court documents.\n\nThe woman said he groped her and exposed himself. Rossi was found guilty of one count of sexual imposition and one count of public indecency, court records show.\n\nRossi filed a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. The evidence took the form of a Myspace blog posting allegedly written by the victim ... in which she admitted to having lied under oath in an attempt to deflect accusations of cheating and protect her relationship with her boyfriend, say court records.\n\nBut during a Feb. 28, 2011, evidentiary hearing, the state countered Rossi's new evidence claim with the testimony of an expert in computer forensics, a Dayton detective, on loan to the FBI.\n\nThe expert testified with 90% certainty that the blog post had been altered or was completely fabricated. He said anyone familiar with the 'cut,' 'copy' and 'paste' functions of a computer with access to basic computer programs would have the capability to easily alter or fabricate a document like the Myspace blog post.\n\nFurther he noted a discrepancy between the date of the posting and the corresponding day of the week – a mistake that would not have been made by a computer, but rather only by human error.\n\nAfter the hearing, the judge denied Rossi's motion for a new trial, saying the newly discovered evidence was highly questionable (and) not credible.\n\nAlahverdian's former foster mother Sharon Lane says: Nick had the ability to pull the wool over so many people's eyes. ... When I look back, I can see a pattern but at the time we were living busy lives.\n\nEven after Alahverdian reached adulthood, he stayed with the Lanes for a time in Ohio, she says.\n\nHer husband, Charles, thought highly of Alahverdian and helped him out of his jams and getting into colleges. Court records show Sharon Lane helped purchase a house for her foster son in Dayton prior to his second marriage, at age 28, in October 2015.\n\nSeven months after the marriage, however, his wife filed for divorce, court records show. In the final judgment and decree of divorce, the court found that defendant has been guilty of gross neglect of duty and extreme cruelty toward plaintiff.\n\nThe court said Alahverdian had taken all of the marital household goods and furnishings from the marital residence, in violation of the temporary restraining orders when he left the Dayton area in July 2016.\n\nIt's unclear if he paid his ex-wife back the $52,000 loan.\n\nHis widow did not respond to a Journal email requesting comment on the loan or the fraud allegations.\n\nDivorce records show that Alahverdian persuaded his wife to lend him the money for one year, which he claimed he needed to keep (the) Community Progress Institute afloat temporarily, referring to a community service agency that Alahverdian was involved with.\n\nIn July, around the same time the Rhode Island State Police were asking questions about a man who had supposedly died five months earlier, Sharon Lane says she was contacted by Nick's birth mother.\n\nShe wanted the Lanes to look into reports that Alahverdian had died.\n\nOnce we did, we immediately knew that Nick faked his death, she says.\n\nShe read all the glowing mentions of him in his posted obituary, the memorials. The language was so familiar. He wrote everything, she says in an email. Good grief! Just like him! No mention of any of his past life.\n\nLane says one of her daughters recently received an email from someone she's convinced was Nick Alahverdian. The FBI is investigating, she says.\n\nSays the former foster mother: I doubt anyone in RI knew that Nick had this separate life.\n\nFollow Tom Mooney on Twitter: @mooneyprojo

We could hear hearts around the world shatter when Michael B. Jordan and Lori Harvey made their romance Instagram official.\n\nRumors about the couple's relationship status swirled for months as Jordan, 33, and Harvey, 24, were photographed in Atlanta together around Thanksgiving.\n\nAlmost two months after their Atlanta getaway, People's 2020 Sexiest Man Alive and the model each posted separate photos together on their respective Instagram accounts on Jan. 10.\n\nJordan posted two photos, one looking into Harvey's eyes. Harvey, who was adopted by TV host Steve Harvey after his 2007 marriage to her mother, Marjorie Bridges, posted a Polaroid photo collage with Jordan tagged. One photo featured Jordan kissing her cheek as she beams.\n\nAs fans devour details about their newly minted relationship, here's everything we know about Jordan and Harvey.\n\nJordan's over-the-top romantic Valentine's Day gesture\n\nFor their first Valentine's Day together, Jordan went all in with an extravagant plan for the evening: he rented out an aquarium and filled the place with flowers and candles, Harvey showed off on her Instagram story. The two had dinner from celeb favorite Japanese-Peruvian fusion restaurant Nobu while sitting in the aquarium tunnel, and Harvey later revealed that her Valentine had bought her Hermes stock as a gift.\n\nAppreciate you, my girl, Jordan can be heard saying in the background of one of her videos.\n\nJordan celebrated Harvey's birthday with her\n\nHarvey rang in her 24th birthday Jan. 13 with an intimate celebration with her family and, of course, Jordan.\n\nAccording to her Instagram stories, she was gifted at least 15 bouquets of white roses from her baby.\n\nHarvey's celebration included her stepdad Steve Harvey, her mother Marjorie Harvey and her brothers and nephews. Jordan was also there and can be seen playfully coming up behind Harvey as she blows out her birthday candles.\n\nPeople's Sexiest Man Alive for 2020:'Black Panther' star Michael B. Jordan\n\nJordan wished his new boo a happy birthday in an Instagram post, a photo of the pair pictured posing back to back. Another video he shared shows Jordan and Harvey engaging in a snow fight and laughing.\n\n10:10 HBD, he captioned the post along with a turtle emoji.\n\nIn impressively shirtless photographs of Jordan posted on his Instagram account Jan. 24, Harvey wrote, Mine with a cheeky emoji in the caption.\n\nPrior to making their relationship public, Jordan and Harvey were spotted in Utah together in December.\n\nIn photos captured by The Sun, the couple was seen getting off a plane in Salt Lake City, Utah to bring in the New Year.\n\nWhile Harvey and Jordan didn't share any photos or videos of each other during their trip, the two respectively posted clips from their time in Utah on Instagram stories showing off their snowboarding skills.\n\nWhere you know them from\n\nJordan kicked off his acting career in the late '90s with an appearance on the Cosby show, according to IMDb, and has paved a storied path in the entertainment industry.\n\nHis breakthrough performance came in Ryan Coogler's Fruitvale Station, where he played Oscar Grant, a Black man shot and killed by police in Oakland, California. He went on to star in leading roles in Creed, Fantastic Four, Black Panther and Just Mercy.\n\nAlong with his acting endeavors, Jordan has championed change behind the scenes in Hollywood. He started production company, Outlier Society Productions, which was among the first to embrace the inclusion rider, adopting the pledge to seek diverse casts and crews.\n\nJordan has been active in the Black Lives Matter movement and vocal about early voting registration for this year's election.\n\nHarvey has acted in a few minor roles on her stepdad's shows Steve and Steve Harvey. She also starred in Teyana Taylor's music video Issues/Hold On off the KTSE album.\n\nShe has also modeled, walking in a runway show for Dolce and Gabbana in 2017.\n\nI feel like you don't see a lot of color in the fashion industry in general. You just don't. I think I was one of five girls backstage at the show that was African-American. Of course it was an honor, but it also shows girls that look like me that you can do this too, you can break into this industry and play a huge role in it, she told BET.\n\nJordan and Harvey's past flings\n\nHarvey has been previously linked to rapper Future, Trey Songz, Justin Combs (and his father, Sean Diddy Combs) and Dutch soccer player Memphis Depay.\n\nHarvey and Future's relationship was on display as the pair celebrated her 23rd birthday in Jamaica with a group of their friends, but the couple seemingly split in August when the two deleted photos of each other off their social media.\n\nThe 24-year-old was also briefly engaged to Depay in 2017, who even got the approval of Steve Harvey.\n\nJordan's dating past has been more lowkey. The Creed actor had not made a relationship Instagram official before Harvey.\n\nHe's previously expressed his troubles with dating. In 2018 he told WSJ Magazine that Los Angeles wasn't the best place to date and later that same year he told GQ he was single adding it's hard to date someone privately.\n\nMy career is awesome. It is going great. There's other places in my life that I'm (expletive) lacking at. I'm very mature and advanced in a lot of areas of life. Dating may not be one of 'em. My personal life is not. I don't really know what dating is, Jordan said.\n\nOn the other hand, Harvey's mother tried giving her daughter dating advice in 2015 where she said: I know you just started dating this year, so, how are we gonna handle that? No athletes, no rappers — we gonna go down the list.\n\nWhen it comes to dating, my mom has nothing to worry about: I got this, Harvey said.\n\nMore:Michael B.

Anna Gorman\n\nKaiser Health News\n\nFanny Ortiz, a mother of five who lives just east of downtown Los Angeles, spent nearly a decade married to a man who controlled her and frequently threatened her. Then, she said, his abuse escalated.\n\nHe would physically hit me in the face, throw me on the wall, she recalled.\n\nOrtiz, 43, eventually left the marriage, taking her children with her. A few years later, she learned that the East Los Angeles Women's Center offered domestic violence services at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center near her home. Now she goes to the hospital campus for weekly therapy sessions, which she said have helped stop her suicidal thoughts.\n\nI was afraid to talk, Ortiz said. Now I am more open to talk about things that I was holding in.\n\nNearly 1 in 4 women have experienced serious physical violence at the hands of a partner. They often end up in the emergency room or the doctor's office. But they don't typically volunteer the reason for their injuries, and doctors don't always ask about abuse in the home. That failure of communication means the patients may miss out on the help they need.\n\nYet a growing number of health providers and anti-abuse agencies in California and around the country are collaborating to identify victims and get them help. More doctors now screen their patients for signs of abuse and more agencies place victims' advocates inside health centers. Education and counseling for people experiencing violence is also more widely available in clinics and hospitals.\n\nAbout four years ago, the East Los Angeles Women's Center opened offices on the campus of L.A. County-USC, a busy public hospital. Since then, center staff members have trained more than 2,500 doctors, nurses, social workers and others to identify victims of domestic violence. They also respond quickly to calls from the medical center's emergency room, inpatient hospital and outpatient facilities to help patients in crisis.\n\nToday, the women's center has embarked on an innovative approach: In February, it plans to open a short-term shelter for abuse victims on the medical center grounds. The 10-bed shelter fills a serious need, said Deirdre Anglin, an emergency room physician at L.A. County-USC.\n\nWe sometimes have patients in the emergency department who don't have a place to go, and in the evenings and nights all the shelters in L.A. will be filled, Anglin said.\n\nVictims of abuse can suffer long-term health problems, including chronic pain, frequent headaches, depression, diabetes and asthma. And they have higher health costs than people who have not experienced abuse. So it makes complete sense to have the health care providers acting as allies and partners in treating domestic violence, said Peter Long, CEO of the Blue Shield of California Foundation. (The foundation provides support for KHN coverage in California).\n\nThe foundation has funded 19 partnerships between health centers and domestic violence agencies around the state, including the L.A. County-USC office of the East Los Angeles Women's Center. Similar partnerships operate in Illinois, Maryland and other states.\n\nLast year, the East Los Angeles Women's Center served 600 victims of domestic violence at the L.A. County-USC hospital campus. Nearly one-third were homeless or couldn't go back home for safety reasons.\n\nAdvocates say that hospitals and clinics are ideal settings to respond to the needs of abused women.\n\nIn the San Gabriel Valley, the YWCA sponsors domestic violence support groups at a community clinic, while the clinic offers health education for survivors of abuse at the YWCA. In Sacramento, a Native American health center works closely with a domestic violence group a few blocks away.\n\nDoctors have an unprecedented opportunity to promote prevention and to respond because they are seeing patients that may not ever reach out to a domestic violence agency or police for help, said Lisa James, director of health for Futures Without Violence, which runs a national resource center dedicated to improving the response of medical professionals to domestic violence. They can provide this critical lifesaving intervention.\n\nMore:Domestic violence is a tragedy. It's not a predictor of mass murder.\n\nMore:Group urges Bengals to speak out against domestic violence\n\nMore:Watch Domestic Violence PSA from NFL game\n\nThe proximity of the East Los Angeles Women's Center to the hospital and clinic buildings on the L.A. County-USC campus makes it easier for doctors to ask their patients about violence, said Rebeca Melendez, director of programs for the center's office at the medical center. They don't need to know all the answers, she said. They just need to call us.\n\nThis growing collaboration between the medical profession and anti-abuse agencies is driven in part by the Affordable Care Act, which requires that health plans cover domestic violence screening and counseling.\n\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends doctors routinely question women about violence in the home and refer them to services if needed. The task force concluded in 2013 that intervention could reduce violence and abuse as well as mental and physical health problems.\n\nIn the past, patients would go to health centers with such problems, but providers did not feel comfortable asking questions about abuse at home, said Long, of the Blue Shield of California Foundation.\n\nThey didn't feel they had the time (or) … resources to do something about it, he said.\n\nTreating patients who are in abusive relationships is very challenging, said Anglin, the ER physician. There is no pill to give. But asking about violence needs to be part of a physician's job, she said.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a non-profit news service covering health issues.

Erin Jensen\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nJoey Feek's death last March at age 40 from cancer, a battle shared on husband Rory Feek's blog, didn't end their love story.\n\nIt's strange because she's been gone a year, but I don't feel like she's very far away, Rory Feek, 51, says during a phone interview from Tennessee. I didn't know what I would feel, but I didn't expect her to be so present — I mean present in my heart, my life and in our daily activities, in our conversations.\n\nWhile making breakfast for their daughter Indiana (Indy), who has Down syndrome and turns 3 on Feb. 17, the country musician thinks about how Joey would have done it. When pushing Indy in a stroller on a recent trip to Hawaii, Rory played Joey's songs on his phone at Indy's request.\n\nRead an excerpt from Rory Feek's new book 'This Life I Live'\n\nJoey, who married Rory in 2002, is also a great presence in Rory's new memoir, This Life I Live (Thomas Nelson), to be published on Valentine's Day, the anniversary of their first date.\n\nIn it he shares stories of how they met, their engagement, and the time Joey told Rory she thought he was her destiny but said she would likely marry the man she was then dating. He also describes a time before he met Joey when he had a relationship with his friend's wife and nearly abandoned his two eldest daughters, who he says were just kids when he bought a bus ticket one night to anywhere but here and nearly committed to starting a new life. (He got off the bus in Kentucky and came home to Nashville.)\n\nYou have to share the scary parts and the parts when you've been not such a good guy, he says, and I feel like I was excited to get to share all of those moments, as many as I could.\n\nThe chapters likely to linger in readers' minds, however, are the ones illuminated by Joey's presence. Rory writes on the first page, I am famous for loving my wife. Theirs was a powerful connection, one that overused words like love and soulmate can't fully encapsulate, he says. Instead, he describes their connection as magical.\n\n… We're not just compatible, she's the other half, he says. She's the better half of me, and I know she would say the same thing for me.\n\nNearly a year after Joey's death, Feek says things feel exactly the same, which he attributes to his amazing wife and their beautiful marriage. I still feel like I'm still in the middle of it right now, and that's a wonderful gift.\n\nWhile Feek says writing assisted in the grieving process, documenting moments with Joey also helped him remember their time together. The duo dubbed Joey + Rory is nominated for a Grammy this year, which means Rory is on the hook to attend the awards show Sunday because of a promise he made Joey that he was reminded of by his blog.\n\nI had forgotten that she had (asked me to go) and so I'm so thankful for the blog, that I have those moments to look back on… and the book will be the same way, he says. It's me telling stories that I will have forgotten about, and I will be able to go back (to). Not only will other people see something, hopefully, in those stories that will encourage them, but I will be encouraged again and again and again and again.
Paul Maslin and Joe Trippi\n\nOpinion contributors\n\nWhen the Sheraton hotel ballroom in Birmingham erupted on the night of Dec. 12 with the news that Democrat Doug Jones had upset Republican Roy Moore and won the Alabama special election for the U.S. Senate, tears of joy were falling not just there but all over America and indeed the world.\n\nComing just 13 months after the stunning presidential election of Donald Trump and weeks after a Democratic wave in Virginia, this was definitive confirmation that at this moment, in the most conservative of states, America had woken up and decided to pursue a different path.\n\nMore:Take it from voters, Dems don't want a Bernie Sanders or a blue Donald Trump\n\nMore:Republican war on Millennials looks like a suicide mission\n\nEvents and elections this year will tell that ultimate story, and whether it will hold in races without Moore and his singular problems. But for Democrats who rejoiced Wednesday as the brand new senator from Alabama was sworn in, we offer the following observations about what our candidate's victory might mean:\n\n►Run everywhere and anywhere. In order to have the chance to exploit first Moore's nomination and then his scandal, Democrats needed a credible candidate. Jones, while never having run for office before, was a successful prosecutor and respected attorney with a broad network of contacts in Alabama. We need similar people to step forward to run for office throughout the South, such as Senate candidate Phil Bredesen, the former Tennessee governor — but also in the Midwest and other supposedly Trump or Republican strongholds. The wave will reach its full power only if there are plenty of surfers who know what they are doing atop it.\n\n►Don't trim your sails. Jones is a moderate Democrat willing to work across the aisle and find common ground to get things done for Alabama and our country. However, he did not alter his support for reproductive rights, immigration or gay marriage — or downplay his role in prosecuting and convicting two of the Ku Klux Klan members who murdered four African-American girls at a Birmingham church in 1963 — to curry favor with certain constituencies. Not every Democrat will agree with every other Democrat on policy issues. We have had, and still possess, a big tent. Voters would rather you say what you mean and mean what you say than believe you are willing to sacrifice your principles in exchange for a few votes.\n\n►Common ground works as a message, even in, and perhaps especially because of, these polarized times. Jones' willingness to cross the aisle was an integral part of his message from the beginning of the campaign and became a constant in our advertising. Our polling showed that Jones won two in five voters who had favored Luther Strange (the establishment choice) in the September GOP runoff, and Jones also won independents by nearly 10 points on Election Day. The truth is that the actions of President Trump and his GOP majority in Congress have made them vulnerable to the charge that they are unwilling to compromise — thus failing to achieve any progress on health care and other key issues. In contrast with Jones' strengths, by election eve, 49% of Alabamians felt that Moore would make things worse in Washington.\n\n►We have an energized coalition that can produce electoral magic. African Americans, particularly black women, made a heroic demonstration of their political clout in Alabama: 96% favored Jones. And they punched way above their weight on turnout — exceeding their share of the overall electorate by several points while the white electorate that fueled the 2016 Trump win shrank substantially.\n\nCollege-educated white suburbanites and Millennials of all races and ethnicities helped produce the Jones victory margin as well. In each case, our campaign and various complementary groups used traditional forms of communication — television, radio and mail — as well as social media and direct voter contact in substantial volume. Campaigns must use every medium to communicate urgency to these voters.\n\nMore:Pelosi-Schumer tactics won't beat Trump. Stop cowering and hiding, Democrats\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\n►More important, groups within these communities need and deserve more support and resources to build strong and effective get-out-the-vote efforts. The groups that built those efforts in Alabama had to do so from scratch with little or no existing organization in place. What they did was nothing short of amazing.\n\nOne caution: This special election stood alone on the political calendar, with everyone focused on one campaign. That will not be the case next fall, so campaigns won't be able to count on the concentrated efforts of others. They must budget enough money to make the Democratic enthusiasm gap pay off in 2018.\n\nFinally, we would urge the next wave of Democratic candidates to set their sights as high as possible while also keeping a disciplined eye on the electoral prize. The best contenders combine a sweeping vision or campaign strategy with the resolute ability to stay on message, come hell or high water. Think Bill Clinton 1992, Barack Obama 2008 or, for that matter, Donald Trump 2016.\n\nAnd think Doug Jones 2017. He stayed incredibly grounded, even as his campaign soared to unthinkable heights. He might have pointed the way for his nation to become Sweet Home America.\n\nPaul Maslin, a Democratic pollster, and Joe Trippi, a Democratic media consultant, were chief strategists for Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama. Follow Trippi on Twitter: @JoeTrippi

But general heart-themed candy is always a good choice, too.\n\n2. A heart-shaped waffle maker\n\nDoes your lover exclusively order waffles when you go out for brunch?

Here's what we recommend.\n\n4. A Cameo video message\n\nShow your partner how much you've been paying attention to their obscure internet obsessions with a video message from their favorite celebrity.

A popular Yeti mug\n\nYou can up your lover's morning cup of joe with The Yeti Rambler Mug. Plus, you can make things a little more personal by adorning it with their name, monogram, or rugged icons.

These gifts are all under $50, but could definitely be things they've been wanting for some time.\n\n7. Some new candles\n\nCandles are a cliche yet romantic gesture that we still approve of. The Capri Blue candles not only smell amazing, but they come in chic jars that double as decor. For Valentine's Day this year, you can score one of these jars in a pretty pink color. We also approve of Homesick Candles, which offers a delightful Love Letters scent with the aroma of lemon, sandalwood, rose petals, and peonies.\n\n8. A massager for their aching muscles\n\nYour significant other claims you give the best massages—which is why they're always asking you for a rub. Instead of working your already tired hands, get them a back and neck massager that will provide hours of relief. People love this one from Zyllion and it has a 4.5-star rating on Amazon from 29,000 reviews. Your valentine can use it on their neck, back, shoulders, legs, and more, and reviewers claim that it provides incredible pressure and will last for years.\n\nGet the Zyllion Shiatsu Back and Neck Massager at Amazon for $49.95\n\n9.

Sharon Peters\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nTara Westover is living proof that some people are flat-out, boots-always-laced-up indomitable. Her new book, Educated (Random House, 334 pp., ★★★★ out of four), is a heartbreaking, heartwarming, best-in-years memoir about striding beyond the limitations of birth and environment into a better life.\n\nAt age 16, Westover, who had never attended school, who could only watch longingly as the school bus passed by on the highway every day, made a decision: She studied to pass college admission tests and got herself into Brigham Young University. She didn't have the sense or sophistication to know exactly what she was aiming for. She simply had the tiny nugget of an idea that other kids, normal kids, went to school and learned things, and that was probably a good thing.\n\nHer childhood had been hard and odd. She and her six siblings grew up in rural Idaho in a filthy, ramshackle house nestled against a mountain she loved and a chaotic junkyard she didn't. No television, radio or even telephone for many years. No doctor visits, no matter what.\n\nHer father was a domineering man who responded to conflict or challenge with long lectures about God and obsessed about armed Feds showing up at the door. The kids had head-for-the hills bags they could grab if they had to abandon their home and survive in the woods. He insisted on home births, and though some of the children attended school for a time, he eventually ruled all public schooling off-limits. He ordered that guns, provisions and water be buried on the property so that when the apocalypse came — when everyone (would be) drinking from puddles and living in darkness — his family would survive.\n\nThe author's mother, an herbalist and midwife, was worn out and worn down by marriage. She rarely challenged her husband, abiding by his decrees and tending to family injuries — including her own horrific brain injury from a car wreck (from which she never fully recovered) — at home, with needles, thread, herbs and bed rest.\n\nWestover learned to drive a forklift when she was too young to drive a car, endured various kinds of physical and emotional abuse by a brother, and was instructed in the art of shutting up, as her mother called it. That required keeping utterly silent when possible and speaking little when it wasn't to protect the family and the circumstances of their lives.\n\nFor all that she endured, hers did not approach the horrifically isolated and abusive lives of the 13 children in the Turpin family in California who made recent headlines. Westover is careful to present the good parts with the bad: She had loving relationships with her grandparents and a few friends outside the family; her father was at times tender; she was permitted to participate in local theater; and she worked in town sometimes.\n\nAnd even when presenting the rough parts, Westover, now 31, doesn't wail. She writes about it as she processed it when she was growing up insulated: in a straightforward manner. It wasn't until she reached her teen years that she began to realize not everyone lived this way.\n\nSo she went off to BYU at 17 with 12 jars of home-canned peaches and a garbage bag full of clothes (all the wrong kinds). She made few friends, had to cover enormous ground to make up for her cultural and book-learning ignorance, and yet, eventually she received a doctoral degree from Cambridge.\n\nIt's incredible, yes. But once you sift through her life, not so very surprising.
Spoiler alert! This story contains details from This Is Us Season 3, Episode 10, The Last Seven Weeks.\n\nAnd the winner is … long-suffering This Is Us fans who had to wait weeks to find out if a certain beloved marriage was OK.\n\nWhen NBC's tear-fest signed off for 2018, Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Beth (Susan Kelechi-Watson) were in the midst of what appeared to be a relationship-shaking fight about whether Randall should continue his run for city council in Philadelphia.\n\nBut by the end of this week's episode, which took place, as the title notes, over seven weeks, Randall and Beth are back in each other's arms, and Randall has miraculously (or rather, wildly improbably) won the race.\n\nAll around, things were on the up and up for the Big Three this week, in rather unlikely ways. By the end of the episode Kevin (Justin Hartley) and Zoe (Melanie Liburd) had overcome a major bump in their relationship and found a vital clue to what happened to Jack's brother, Nick (Michael Angarano). Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Toby (Chris Sullivan) had started nesting for their baby in the over-the-top way only the two of them can.\n\nIt was such a treacly episode you have to wonder what could possibly be next. Because there's no way the Pearsons get to be this happy for long.\n\nThe episode opens on election night, with Randall just four points behind Saul Brown, clearly having done something big since his campaign manager, Jae-Won, told him he was too far behind to keep going. From there the episode goes back seven weeks.\n\nKate makes the big decision, after she and Toby find out they're having a son, to start transforming their spare room into a nursery. Currently it's storage for a lot of excess stuff, including Toby's action figure collection, because apparently he's into that. She wants to sell it all, and Toby agrees, except for one box of priceless Star Wars figures. Very bad abbreviations lead to Kate selling the box, devastating Toby. Besides their monetary value, he had hoped to pass the figures down to their son.\n\nAfter a Facebook search, Kate tracks down the kid who bought the figures, but even a really massive guilt trip won't get him to give them back. Kate eventually decides to spend a hefty sum to buy replacements. In return Toby commissions someone to build a play football stadium for their baby, just like the one Jack built for Kate. It's one big gesture from Toby that I'm on board with.\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin and Zoe get back to the U.S., and he asks her to move in with him. She accepts. The new roommates then go the VA to find out what more they can learn about Nick, but are told they need a letter from someone like a congressman to get the file. Zoe sets up a meeting with her ex, conveniently a congressman, and he's less than cordial. Zoe explains to Kevin that she was supposed to move in with the congressman, but broke up with him over email.\n\nKevin is freaked out by the idea that Zoe could end a relationship so abruptly. He also starts to notice that she hasn't opened her boxes in his place, making him fear she doesn't plan on staying. When he confronts her about it, they have a huge fight. It is isn't until election night that they reconcile, when Zoe explains that her abusive father has made her wary of living with someone, but she's willing to try.\n\nAs they're unpacking at last, Zoe oh-so-conveniently opens an old box of Jack's and finds a postcard from Nick sent after the war. Jack knew Nick was alive all along, and now Zoe and Kevin have an address.\n\nFinally, we come to Randall and Beth. After that heartbreaking fight, Randall wakes up on the couch and is adamant that he will still campaign. Beth tells him she won't stand in his way, but she won't help him, either.\n\nAs the weeks drag on, Randall works long hours and stays in Philadelphia to work on the campaign. When he tries to get Beth to make campaign appearances with him again, she points out that he has been neglecting her and the kids. He accuses her of being selfish and jealous of his success while she's unemployed. Beth walks out of the room.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Randall is determined to get home with a blueberry pie for Beth, but Jae-Won stops the merriment with a single envelope. He's uncovered proof that Brown bribed the police to cover up his DUI. Randall doesn't want to use it, but he's tempted. While trying unsuccessfully to buy a pie, he runs into a local reverend who is a friend of Brown's. Randall euphemistically explains his dilemma, and the reverend is struck by the speech. The reverend gives Randall his blueberry pie and some sage advice. Randall throws out the envelope, goes home and properly apologizes to his wife and daughters.\n\nAfter New Year's, Randall is so dedicated to his family that he ignores calls from Jae-Won and considers skipping an appearance, but it's Beth who gets him to go to a local church, which just happens to be that reverend's church. During the sermon the reverend talks Randall up, and though he doesn't outright endorse him, he doesn't endorse Brown, either.\n\nAnd apparently that was enough to push Randall over the top, as he gets the call while in bed with Beth that he won. I'm sure that his time in office will be super-easy and smooth, right?
GREEN BAY, Wis. - Mike Pettine will not return as the Green Bay Packers' defensive coordinator for the 2021 season, the team said Friday.\n\nPettine, originally hired by coach Mike McCarthy, was the Packers' defensive coordinator the past three seasons. He spent the past two years under Matt LaFleur, an arranged marriage of sorts after the Packers hired LaFleur following the 2018 season. The two had never worked together, though they had common contacts in the league.\n\nPettine's contract expired at season's end, meaning he coached this past season knowing it could be his last with the Packers. Assistant coaches typically work under two-year deals, but Pettine did not have a year tacked onto his contract after the 2019 season.\n\nNFL Network was first to report Pettine would not return as defensive coordinator.\n\nThe Packers will be looking for their third defensive coordinator in the past five seasons. Pettine succeeded Dom Capers, who was fired after the 2017 season after nine years of coordinating under McCarthy.\n\nLaFleur is expected to do a full-on search for a placement. That doesn't mean defensive backs coach Jerry Gray, a former defensive coordinator in Buffalo and Tennessee whom LaFleur hired before the 2020 season, won't get the job. But LaFleur wants to interview a number of people before making a decision.\n\nUnder Pettine, the Packers' defense saw unquestioned improvement. Pettine inherited a defense that had finished 22nd (348.9 per game) in yards and 26th (24 points per game) in scoring in Capers' final season. The Packers ranked ninth in yards (334) and 13th in scoring (23.1) in 2020. It was their first year finishing top 10 in yards since 2010.\n\nThe Packers had a talent infusion on the defensive side in 2019. General manager Brian Gutekunst signed three defensive starters that spring: outside linebackers Za'Darius and Preston Smith along with safety Adrian Amos. The defense took a big jump that season, including finishing ninth in the league with 19.8 points allowed per game, but the year ended on a sour note in the NFC championship game at San Francisco. The Packers gave up 285 rushing yards against the 49ers, a breakdown made worse by Pettine's quip earlier in the season that it was faster to fly to Miami, site of the Super Bowl, than run there.\n\nThe Packers refocused on the run game in 2020. After finishing 23rd against the run (120.1 rushing yards per game) in 2019, the Packers ranked 13th against the run (112.8) in 2020. There was regression in other areas, most notably in turnovers. The Packers tied for 25th with 18 takeaways in 2020, a year after they were tied for seventh with 25 takeaways.\n\nEven still, Pettine felt he had a better defense entering the 2020 playoffs than one year earlier.\n\nI do think we have a better feel, Pettine said earlier this month, comparing his defense to a year ago. The one thing that we have right now that I don't think you can put a price on is that we're confident.\n\nLaFleur, who calls offensive plays and devises the game plan on that side of the ball, will now get a chance to hire his own coordinator to work in lockstep with him in the future. He knew of Pettine before being hired as the Packers' head coach. LaFleur's mentor, San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan, worked as Pettine's offensive coordinator with the Cleveland Browns. But the two had never worked together, and at times this season there seemed to be a disconnect between them.\n\nThe most glaring example came after Sunday's loss in the NFC championship game. At the end of the first half, the Packers gave up a back-breaking touchdown on a 39-yard pass from Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady to receiver Scotty Miller. The Packers were in man-to-man coverage with only one safety deep, allowing Miller to beat cornerback Kevin King down the left side before safety Will Remond could help.\n\nLaFleur highlighted that touchdown as one that turned the game.\n\nDefinitely not the right call for the situation, LaFleur said. You can't do stuff like that against a good football team and expect to win.\n\nAfter the Packers clinched the No. 1 seed in their finale at Chicago, LaFleur was asked about the defense's late-season turnaround. He was complimentary but also offered a blunt critique about how the secondary aligned its coverage, calling for more press at the line of scrimmage.\n\nThere's some times where I think we can be a little bit more aggressive just in terms of our mentality, LaFleur said. Some of those third downs and fourth-down conversions, a third-and-short, I want us to get up in people's faces and challenge them. Because I think we've got the people that can get that done, especially when you look at our corner situation.\n\nLaFleur showed confidence in Pettine until the end. His decision to kick a field goal on fourth-and-goal with just more than two minutes left Sunday was an analytical decision, but also showed trust in the Packers' defense. LaFleur tasked the defense with getting the ball back from Brady, a gamble that ultimately failed when the Buccaneers converted a pair of third downs. The second came on a defensive pass interference against King, who regressed this season and also allowed a pair of first-half touchdowns Sunday.\n\nWhere the Packers go from here is unclear. This will be the biggest hire in LaFleur's short tenure with the Packers. LaFleur is expected to tab assistant special teams coach Maurice Drayton as his replacement for special teams coordinator Shawn Mennenga, whose firing was made official Friday. Because of LaFleur's intent focus on the offensive side, his defensive coordinator will be especially important.\n\nContributing: Tom Silverstein of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
Brian Truitt\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe Nice Guys has a winning hand mainly due to its two jokers.\n\nRussell Crowe stars as a shlubby enforcer and Ryan Gosling is a defective detective in the action comedy (*** out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday), which sports retro 1970s style, brews up an enticing murder mystery and gives Shane Black — who directed and co-wrote the script — another hit on-screen pairing.\n\nThis time, the screen scribe behind the buddy-movie standouts Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang harks back to a Los Angeles pervaded by smog and porn. The death of an adult-movie actress brings together Holland March (Gosling), an ex-cop turned iffy P.I., and hired gun Jackson Healy (Crowe), though nice isn't exactly what they are to each other at first. While March is hired to find a young woman named Amelia (Margaret Qualley), she pays Healy to physically get him off her back.\n\nHow Russell Crowe brought 'Regular Guy' chic to Cannes\n\nArms are broken, feelings are hurt, yet the odd couple finds common ground when they learn some dangerous folks are also out to get Amelia. March and Healy end up teaming to search for her when she goes missing, and the case takes them from dealing with wacky gas-masked protesters to hitting up a porn king's palatial party to trying not to get killed when Vegas gangsters and the Department of Justice become involved in the hijinks.\n\nHilarious lines abound — Gosling gets the nugget Marriage is buying a house for someone you hate — but there's heart to The Nice Guys as well. March is a single dad devoted to his young daughter (Angourie Rice), a mini-Nancy Drew who becomes a welcome third wheel. And when a boy takes off his sweater to cover the dead porn star's naked chest, it's a touching moment that elevates the material.\n\nSummer movie preview: Unlikely BFFs bring it on\n\nThe story gets convoluted when it begins to throw in Detroit automakers, a random third-act assassin (Matt Bomer) and a hard-charging chief justice (Kim Basinger) who's the closest this movie comes to The Man. Instead, The Nice Guys is best when it just leans into its leading men.\n\nCrowe mostly plays exasperated straight man to Gosling, though the former gives the overall movie not only gravitas but also a moral quandary: Can the heavy be a hero? Gosling, on the contrary, is given carte blanche to go big with his wackiness. He does smarmy well but also has a gift for physical slapstick comedy — March usually gets himself so drunk that careening off cars and falling off houses are just minor deterrences to the task at hand, overall giving him and Healy an Abbott and Costello vibe.\n\nThe movie is a throwback in many ways but also proves a dynamic duo can still be just as effective in modern cinema as a superhero ensemble cast. For The Nice Guys, it takes two to make it outta sight.
Sharon Tate's name is back in the news, nearly 49 years after her death at the hands of the Manson family in 1969.\n\nQuentin Tarantino is slated to release his untitled picture on the 50th anniversary of Tate's death next year. Margot Robbie is set to portray Tate in the film Tarantino told IndieWire would center around the year the murders took place.\n\nHilary Duff will star in another film on the model-actress, likely introducing her to a new generation less familiar with the star's life and accomplishments before her untimely death. The Haunting of Sharon Tate is set for release later this year and has already made waves with Tate's younger sister, Debra Tate, who slammed the movie as tacky to People magazine.\n\nHere are a few key things to remember about Tate ahead of the upcoming projects.\n\nHer acting résumé\n\nIn the early and mid-60s, the Dallas-born blond appeared on the small screen in TV series Mister Ed, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and The Beverly Hillbillies. Her first credited role in a film came just three years before her death, in 1966's Eye of the Devil. In follow-up features, she would share the screen with big name co-stars Dean Martin (The Wrecking Crew) and Orson Welles (Twelve Plus One). While Valley of the Dolls (1967) was critically panned, the film earned Tate a Golden Globe nomination. In Roger Ebert's scathing review of the flick, also starring Barbara Parkins and Patty Duke, he did say Tate remains a wonder to behold.\n\nHer marriage to Roman Polanski\n\nDays before her 25th birthday, Tate wed her Fearless Vampire Killers director and co-star Roman Polanski, then 34, in a London ceremony at the Chelsea Register Office on Jan. 20, 1968. In fashions fitting with the times, Tate wore a high-neck yellow minidress of her own design, her teased hair adorned with flowers. Polanski's ensemble included a jabot.\n\nWhile the two appear happy in footage from their reception that followed at the Playboy Club, Sharon Tate: A Life author Ed Sanders hints at cracks in their wedded bliss. He writes in his 2016 biography that Valley of the Dolls writer Jacqueline Susann, a guest at one of the couple's wedding parties, remembered Tate was very happy, but she was completely under Roman's domination. He doesn't look it, but he must be a dominating man.\n\nIn 1977, Polanski was charged with statutory rape stemming from an encounter with then-13-year-old Samantha Geimer. He plead guilty to unlawful sex with a minor. Fearing the judge assigned to his case would renege on the plea agreement, Polanski left for France in 1978 on the eve of sentencing.\n\nLasting impact on pop culture\n\nTate's iconic image continues to captivate decades after her death, inspiring beauty looks on the catwalk and Drew Barrymore's Harper's Bazaar looks in 2010.\n\nMad Men costume designer Janie Bryant confirmed (in a NSFW tweet) she was influenced by a 1967 Esquire magazine photo shoot when putting Megan Draper in a white T-shirt emblazoned with a red star. There's also a Reddit thread where people postulated whether Draper's life was inspired by Tate's.\n\nTate was also profiled in David Wills' 2017 book Switched On: Women Who Revolutionized Style in the '60s. In Wills' work, designer Trina Turk refers to Tate as a designer's dream. Sharon Tate has transcended her career in the '60s to become one of the great fashion and style icons of the 20th century and beyond, Turk said.\n\nMore:Charles Manson and the Manson family: What to know about the murderous cult leader\n\nMore:Charles Manson, one of nation's most infamous mass killers, dead at 83\n\nMore:Charles Manson's pop-culture influence: From co-opting a Beatles hit to 'South Park'
Maeve McDermott\n\nUSATODAY\n\nOne day, you're grabbing Mexican food with Adam Levine, and the next, your marriage is over.\n\nIt sounds like a joke of a celebrity parable — except it's a true story that Gwen Stefani shared with the New York Times in a candid new interview about her new album, her new relationship and her new life.\n\nStefani shares how, the morning after the 2015 Grammys, she followed up her performance with Maroon 5 by eating Mexican food with her Voice coaching counterpart. Then, she woke up to news that ended her 13-year marriage to Gavin Rossdale: My life was literally blown up into my face.\n\nShe didn't go into the specifics of what, exactly, went down.\n\nIf I could, I would just tell you everything, and you would just be in shock. It's a really good, juicy story.\n\nBut she did detail how much it hurt.\n\nI'm gonna die, she said, recalling her emotional state. I am dead, actually. How do I save myself? What am I going to do? How do I not go down like this?\n\nThe good news for Stefani? She's got a new dude to get Mexican food with.\n\nRead the entire profile here.
Once upon a time (eight seasons ago, to be precise), Mayim Bialik was the new kid among the cast of The Big Bang Theory. So she's been in Rati Gupta's shoes – sort of.\n\nAlthough Big Bang was an established hit by the time the former Blossom actress first guest-starred at the end of Season 3 in May 2010, she has now been there for eight seasons of its 12-year run. (She and Melissa Rauch were both promoted to series regulars partway through Season 4.)\n\nGupta, by comparison, is coming in at the end, playing the fiancee of Kunal Nayyar's character, Raj Koothrappali, the last single member of the core group. Frustrated by his own futile attempts to find love, the biggest romantic on the show has agreed to an arranged marriage.\n\nThe 34-year-old actress, who previously appeared in Hulu's Future Man, talked about what it's been like joining the show for Bialik's Grok Nation blog. She told her co-star it was intimidating to sign on for the hit series.\n\nIt felt like transferring schools late into senior year, Gupta confessed to Bialik. However, she added, I will say the one cool and calming thing about joining a show after it's been going for so long is that it's such a well-oiled machine that I always know where I need to be, what I need to do.\n\nGupta told her co-star she had no idea what the writers had planned for her when she was cast a week before the news broke that Season 12 would be the show's last. And she remains uncertain about where the Anu character will go.\n\nOnce that she found out the show was ending, she said, my feelings about how big a deal it was going to be to be on this show rose about a hundred times more!\n\nGupta added she can relate to the plot line her character is facing. She is familiar with arranged marriages since her parents had one.\n\nI definitely have experience in the subject matter, so it's not a stretch for me to understand this character and her choices. There's a line in one of the earlier episodes where she says, 'My parents were arranged, and they are very happy.' That's a very easy line to deliver because it's true!\n\nMore: Bialik talks tough breakup, being single around the holidays\n\nBialik offers New Year's resolution advice: 'Aim for progress and not perfection'\n\nModern family: Bialik on why she had Thanksgiving with her ex and his new lady
When Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos decided to publicly accuse lawyers from the parent company of the National Enquirer of blackmail and extortion, his outlet of choice wasn't The Washington Post, which he owns, but instead the Medium blog website.\n\nThe world's richest man could have easily posted his claims as a Post op-ed or done a high-profile TV interview.\n\nInstead, he turned to Medium, which has become the go-to website for people who want to get something off their chest. Bezos isn't the first to use it: High-profile names like Tesla founder Elon Musk, former congressman Beto O'Rourke, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and actor Wil Wheaton have also posted there.\n\nIt's a logical place to publish, noted CNN media critic Brian Stelter in his media newsletter. A neutral space where the emphasis is on the words, nothing else – and kept the message away from any Amazon or Post-owned website.\n\nWhat Bezos wrote:Jeff Bezos accuses National Enquirer parent of 'extortion and blackmail' attempt\n\nPosting to Medium is easy, which is why so many CEOs, tech journalists, venture capitalists and authors like it. You register, create a handle, open a blank document and add photos and videos to your words and hit publish. This lets you blog, without the bother of having to create your own personal blog that's constantly in need of updating.\n\nThe National Enquirer previously shared details of Bezos and his relationship with Lauren Sanchez, a former Los Angeles TV anchor, including romantic text messages the two had sent each other. Bezos and wife MacKenzie announced last month that they would be divorcing after 25 years of marriage, just ahead of The Enquirer posting the intimate exchanges with Sanchez.\n\nThe leak of the texts, which Bezos confirmed in his post, prompted the Amazon founder to have Gavin de Becker from his security team investigate how the Enquirer got its hands on the messages.\n\nReport:Amazon chief Bezos hires investigators to ID leaker of romantic texts\n\nBezos claims that AMI CEO David Pecker was apoplectic over a separate investigation The Washington Post was doing into Pecker and AMI's interest in expanding to Saudi Arabia, including AMI's publication of a pro-Saudi Arabia tabloid last year ahead of the arrival of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nBezos also noted how Pecker recently entered into an immunity deal with the Department of Justice related to their role in the so-called 'Catch and Kill' process on behalf of President Trump and his election campaign, linking to a New York Times report that said Trump invited Pecker to a White House dinner in which the AMI CEO brought a guest that the Times describes as having important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAMI's response:National Enquirer owner says it 'acted lawfully' in its reporting\n\nBezos and his investigators accuse the Enquirer of a politically charged reporting job on behalf of President Donald Trump, who Bezos says believes him to be an enemy, due to his ownership of the Washington Post.\n\nIn the post on Medium, Bezos referred to potentially embarrassing photos of him the Enquirer said it had of him in various states of undress.\n\nIn the e-mails published by Bezos, representatives for the Enquirer say it won't publish the lurid photos if Bezos agreed to say publicly that the Enquirer coverage wasn't politically motivated.\n\nRonan Farrow:I received 'blackmail' threat similar to Amazon's Jeff Bezos\n\nThe post had 130,000 claps – Medium's version of the Like button – by Friday morning.\n\nCasey Newton, an editor for tech news site TheVerge, also blogs on Medium and says it's replaced the concept of a blog that needs to be constantly updated, with a place where you could just say something whenever you had a point to make. It lowered the barrier of entry and, thanks to a beautiful text editor, felt very approachable to lots of folks from the start.\n\nAlex Kruglov, who runs the Los Angeles tech startup pop.in, uses Medium to speak directly to his audience, because its really simple and they give you all the tools to make the page look good and publish properly on both desktop and mobile.\n\nWord search:'Apoplectic' and 'complexifier' are trending after Jeff Bezos fires back\n\nMedium was founded in 2012 by Evan Williams, a co-founder of Twitter and the old Blogger platform, as a way for people who had more to say than the old 140 character limit of Twitter. In the latest version of the blogging site, users can read up to five articles monthly for free, or read more by paying $5 monthly.\n\nThe most popular post of 2018 was by James Bridle, who described himself in the post as a writer and artist concerned with technology and culture. In penning his piece about his concern of seeing sexually themed videos targeting children on YouTube, he said, I usually write on my own blog, but frankly I don't want what I'm talking about here anywhere near my own site\n\nThe post got nearly 200,000 views, and many media organizations, including USA TODAY, jumped on points raised in the piece. YouTube was forced a few months later to announce changes to its policies, saying children's content on the YouTube Kids app would be curated and not left for automatic postings.\n\nJackson Cunningham, who makes cat furniture in Vancouver, Canada, wrote about getting banned for life from Airbnb for writing a bad review of his host on Google, while short story writer David Hopkins went for the less controversial take on the 1990s TV show Friends, and how it triggered the downfall of Western Civilization.\n\nLance Ulanoff, a tech blogger who posts regularly on Medium, says he was blown away, by Bezos' decision to make his announcement on Medium.\n\nIt takes guts to print what they planned to release on him, he says. I mean, there will be ramifications for a CEO of one of the world's biggest and most important companies acting so irresponsibly, but I do love how he pulled the rug out from under the (alleged) extortionists, assuming this is all true.\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Jefferson Graham (@jeffersongraham) on Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.
Arthur Levine\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nSince the inception of the roller coaster, amusement parks and their fans have been on an insatiable quest for thrill machines that climb ever higher and go faster. Through the years, designers have responded to the challenge by creating coasters that surpass previously unimaginable thresholds.\n\nIt's not scheduled to open until 2023, but when Falcon's Flight arrives at Six Flags Qiddiya in Saudi Arabia, it will not just break, but it will purportedly destroy existing height, speed and track-length records.\n\nIs the world ready for a roller coaster that climbs 655 feet, drops 525 feet straight down, accelerates to 156 mph, and navigates a track that spans more than 13,000 feet? Because that's what officials say is on the way.\n\nWe want to do things that have not been done before, says Philippe Gas, CEO of Qiddiya. The 79-acre Six Flags park will feature six themed lands filled with 28 attractions, many of which will be one-of-a-kind and break records. The Sirocco Tower, for example, will be the world's tallest drop-tower ride, topping off at 475 feet, according to Gas.\n\nMost-anticipated roller coasters of 2021:Universal Orlando, on a Carnival cruise ship and more\n\nFalcon's Flight roller coaster: What we know\n\nBut Falcon's Flight will be the headliner, encircling the park and piercing its skyline. Based on a video rendering of the planned ride, it will start by climbing an enormous lift hill and hitting a potent 94 mph for its first drop. That's only the beginning.\n\nOne of three magnetic launches will catapult the ride's train up a 655-foot-tall cliff. They will then drop over the edge and plummet at a 90-degree angle toward the valley while accelerating to about 100 mph. The train will enter a tunnel that appears will be carved into the base of the mountain, then another launch will rev the cars up to their top speed, a G-force-manic 156 mph.\n\nPassengers will then climb another gargantuan hill, drop down the other side and break 100 mph yet again. Passing under the walkway to the park's main entrance and over an adjacent racetrack, Falcon's Flight will toss in a couple of inversions and a banked helix for its finale.\n\nThe three-minute ride will traverse more than 13,000 feet, or roughly 2½ miles of track. That's about 5,000 feet, or 63% longer, than the world's longest coaster, Steel Dragon 2000 at Japan's Nagashima Spa Land. Why so long? When you are going 250 kilometers per hour, it has to be long, Gas says. Otherwise the duration of the ride is going to be very short.\n\nFor height, the current coaster champ is the 456-foot-tall Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey. And the fastest coaster, at 149 mph, is Formula Rossa at Ferrari World Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. They were both designed and built by Intamin, the European ride company that is also helming Falcon's Flight.\n\nWe have the experts; the designers; the know-how; and most importantly, the experience, says Gerard Slenders, Intamin vice president, explaining why the company gets tapped to create such extreme rides. He adds that the Saudi Arabia park offers an ideal site. The natural cliffs as well as the unique setting are perfect to design an architectural masterpiece in steel.\n\nQiddiya's Gas says that while it's great to break records, they can be fleeting. What will be striking about Falcon's Flight and what will endure, he says, will be the marriage of the unnerving ride with its environment. It's not the fact that it will be the tallest or the fastest, but the fact that this ride will take you through the Arabian Desert, along the landscape of Qiddiya, and embrace its cliff.\n\nAmong other highlights of the Six Flags park will be Sea Stallion, described as a unique interactive ride on which passengers will be able to control the speed and acceleration of horse-like vehicles. The trains on the Iron Rattler Mine Train coaster will stop midcourse, high in the air on a dead-end track section. It's decidedly not for the squeamish: A hydraulic motor will slowly tilt the track and its trainload of hapless passengers 90 degrees, then release them into an underground, effects-filled mine shaft.\n\nUnlike other Six Flag locations, the distinctive Qiddiya park is not planning to include the chain's signature DC superheroes such as Batman and Superman or Loony Tunes characters such as Bugs Bunny.\n\nThe Six Flags park will be but one component of the massive Qiddiya complex. At 128 square miles, it will be about three times the size of Walt Disney World. The project, envisioned as a showcase for entertainment, sports and the arts, features plans for a water park, a sports stadium, a golf course, a performance arena, theaters, a safari park, hotels, retail, dining and a city core with housing as well as commercial and industrial space.\n\nWill thrill seekers from around the world want to come to Six Flags Qiddiya and experience Falcon's Flight? Until 2019, Saudi Arabia did not even put out its welcome mat for international tourists. While the kingdom has recently introduced women's rights reforms and other concessions to modernity, concerns over human rights continue to compromise its image.\n\nGas acknowledges that the perception of the kingdom abroad can be challenging. But, he says, Saudi Arabia is rapidly transforming. He believes Qiddiya will help open minds.\n\nIt will take time for the outside world to understand, he says. Qiddiya and other projects will create curiosity and an appetite to visit. When people come, they will realize it's different than what they thought.

Shauna Steigerwald\n\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\n\nCINCINNATI -- Wendy and Harley hoof it through the airport, decked out in their red and pink Valentine's best. Mouths drop and heads whip around. Many travelers haven't seen a couple quite like them before, especially not in an airport.\n\nThey're horses. Miniature therapy horses, to be more specific. They're in from Seven Oaks Farm in Ross for their twice-monthly visit to the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.\n\nAnd their effect does seem to be therapeutic, or at least mood-improving. Those mouths that dropped in surprise quickly break into smiles. Suitcases and neck pillows and purses find a temporary home on the airport floor, freeing up travelers' hands for the more pressing task of petting the fuzzy, tiny equine.\n\nThe horses and their handlers can't get very far without attracting a small audience. And the people who stop vary greatly: A woman pushes a child's stroller near, at the same time that an apparent business traveler in a sportcoat bends down for a nuzzle. A pilot stops and raises his smartphone, long enough to take a few photos or maybe shoot a short video.\n\nThey're just too cute! I have to take a picture, Marshall Baugh, who works in the airport, exclaims. My granddaughter's gonna freak.\n\nCan I pet them? more than one person asks.\n\nClad in a shirt with the hashtag #ittybittyhorses, Lisa Moad, president and founder of the nonprofit Seven Oaks Farm, is quick to invite them over. Her horses, after all, have trained for this, with Moad rolling suitcases past them or impersonating a little-girl run by rushing up and squealing.\n\nThey're pretty well-received everywhere we go, she said. Everybody loves us.\n\nThe places they go range from nursing homes to hospice care to police programs, with the horses changing vests and costumes to fit the occasion. The airport visits started a little less than a year ago in a case of serendipitous timing.\n\nWendi Orlando, senior manager of customer relations, was looking for a therapy program for the airport. Many airports have dogs, so that was the initial route, she said.\n\nAs luck would have it, the very day she was researching possible programs, Moad sent her an email.\n\nHorses in Kentucky? We thought, 'hey, we can make that work,' Orlando said.\n\nShortly thereafter, Moad visited the airport with Dakota, a white miniature horse that she sometimes decks out as a unicorn.\n\nIt went over like gangbusters, Orlando said.\n\nThey really are like celebrities, she said. (Well, they have been on NBC's Today Show.) They walk through the airport, and people stop and take notice.\n\nTherapy animals are not unheard of in airports. Orlando knows of many that have therapy dogs. San Francisco, because it's San Francisco, has a therapy pig.\n\nAirports are traditionally full of anxiety, Orlando said. (Seeing animals) helps to ease those anxieties, to put smiles on faces, to just put people in a better place.\n\nThat's not just anecdotal: There's science behind it.\n\nThere's a whole body of research literature on the effects of therapy animals that does show that there are positive effects, said Melissa Robin Shyan-Norwalt. She's an assistant professor-educator in the University of Cincinnati's department of psychology and a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist through the Animal Behavior Society.\n\nSome of those studies have shown that petting an animal can lower blood pressure and stress levels, she said.\n\nNot only does the animal like it, but it does do positive things for humans in a physiological way, she said.\n\nThough Shyan-Norwalt hasn't seen studies specifically related to animals at airports, she speculates that the surprise of it could startle people out of their anxieties.\n\nSeeing a miniature horse is kind of unusual and fun, so it gets people out of their own worries, she said.\n\nMoad actually got the idea to visit CVG after witnessing some of that airport anxiety.\n\nMy husband and I were at an airport, and a guy was going off on someone at the counter, she said. My husband leaned over and said, 'that guy needs a little animal therapy.'\n\nThey've had horses for a long time. People constantly wanted to come to the farm to see them, so they started taking them out places. It just caught on like wildfire, she said.\n\nThe program, which got its nonprofit status about two and a half years ago, uses about 25 miniature horses. With the help of her daughter-in-law, Kate Moad, and an additional part-time helper, she takes them out about five days a week. They're already booked through 2017.\n\nMoad is hoping to get another team set up (another full-time staff member will be coming on soon) and to buy another vehicle so they can visit more places. Seven Oaks Farm is funded by donations, and Moad plans to start looking for grants.\n\nMy husband and I very much believe in what we do, so we fund most of it, Moad said.\n\nThe payoff is the changes and reactions Moad sees in the people she visits.\n\nIn nursing homes, it's not uncommon for a nurse to tell Moad that a resident never speaks, and then for that resident to go on and on about the horses, maybe remembering a farm from their youth.\n\nAnd then there are the reactions from youngsters. Moad remembers a little boy at a police event, on learning where her horses came from, running off. Mom! Farms are real!\n\nWhen she visits Ronald McDonald House, she sees kids who've had a difficult day get a much-needed chance to just be kids.\n\nYou can see the transformation in people, she said. It makes all of the hours in the cold and the heat training worth it.\n\nKindness goes a long way, and people respond to that.\n\n***\n\nFor more stories like this, LIKE Humankind on Facebook.
Margie Fishman\n\nThe (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON, Del. — Kathleen Biden detailed a rocky relationship with husband Hunter Biden, alleging drug use and infidelity dating to at least 2015, shortly after Hunter's brother, former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, died of brain cancer, according to court filings.\n\nCiting irreconcilable differences, Kathleen Biden filed for divorce from her husband of 23 years in December, Superior Court records in Washington, D.C., show.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hunter, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, confirmed to the New York Post that he is having a romantic relationship with Beau's widow, Hallie.\n\nReport: Joe Biden's son, widowed daughter-in-law in love\n\nThe 47-year-old lawyer, investment manager, and former lobbyist told Page Six, Hallie and I are incredibly lucky to have found the love and support we have for each other in such a difficult time, and that's been obvious to the people who love us most. We've been so lucky to have family and friends who have supported us every step of the way.\n\nBoth Joe Biden, his wife, Jill, and Hallie's father, Ron Olivere, have publicly pledged their support for the couple.\n\nJoe Biden, who served Delaware 36 years in the U.S. Senate, told Page Six, We are all lucky that Hunter and Hallie found each other as they were putting their lives together again after such sadness. They have mine and Jill's full and complete support and we are happy for them.\n\nHallie, 43, has worked as a high school guidance and admissions counselor. She has two children, a daughter, Natalie, and a son, Hunter, with the late Beau Biden. She could not be reached for comment this week.\n\nHunter has three children with Kathleen, 48, a full-time mother and homemaker. She has not worked outside their D.C. home since she got married, according to court records. Originally from Chicago, Kathleen met Hunter when they were working for the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. Later, she campaigned for her father-in-law when he was running for vice president.\n\nHer complaint alleges that Hunter hasn't sufficiently provided for the family after the couple formally separated in October of 2015. In late 2016, Hunter ordered his office to cut Kathleen's $17,000-a-month payment to $7,500, according to the complaint. Property records show that the couple owns a six-bedroom home in D.C. that was purchased for nearly $1.6 million in 2006.\n\nOver the course of the separation, Hunter has drained hundreds of thousands of dollars from the couple's marital assets by spending extravagantly on his own interests (including drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, strip clubs and gifts for women with whom he has sexual relations), while leaving the family with no funds to pay legitimate bills, according to a Feb. 23 motion filed by Kathleen. The motion asks the court to stop Hunter from further dissipation of the assets.\n\nIn 2014, the Navy Reserve discharged Hunter after he tested positive for cocaine. He had served for less than a year as a public affairs officer.\n\nCommander: Hunter Biden knew drug test was coming\n\nHunter's attorneys have not yet responded to the Feb. 23 motion. The next court hearing is scheduled for March 30.\n\nIn response to Kathleen's original complaint, Hunter denied that his conduct precipitated the couple's split and maintained that he has sufficiently supported the family during his separation from his wife. Further, Hunter's attorney has requested that Kathleen furnish all documents, including letters, cards, and emails between you and any person that you had a romantic or sexual relationship with other than your husband during the marriage.\n\nIn July of 2015, two months after Beau Biden's death, Kathleen told Hunter to leave their Washington, D.C., home due to his conduct the night before, according to court documents filed by her attorney. The filing doesn't elaborate on the conduct, only to say that the couple had discussed previously that such conduct would not be tolerated.\n\nKathleen's attorney, Rebekah Sullivan, did not respond to a request for comment Thursday.\n\nHunter's attorney, Sara Mancinelli, declined comment on the allegations against her client.\n\nHunter loves and admires Kathleen as a person, a mother, and a friend, Mancinelli wrote in an email to The News Journal. He hopes their privacy can be respected at this time.\n\nIn 2012, Hunter became board chairman of the United Nations' World Food Program USA. He also sits on the board of one of Ukraine's largest natural gas companies, Burisma.\n\nDespite multiple streams of income, the parties' outstanding debts are shocking and overwhelming, according to the filing made by Kathleen. These include maxed-out credit card debt, double mortgages on two properties, more than $313,000 in tax debt and three bounced checks to their housekeeper.\n\nKathleen's complaint accuses Hunter of depositing more than $122,000 in marital income into his sole bank account while they were separated. He spent all the money in less than two months, according to the suit.\n\nOn Feb. 17, the complaint says, Kathleen discovered that Hunter was in possession of a large diamond worth about $80,000, which he later returned.\n\nKathleen has petitioned the court for sole custody of the couple's youngest daughter, 16-year-old Maisy, with reasonable visitation by her father.\n\nBidens launch foundation to promote human rights\n\nMr. Biden's recent conduct creates situations that are unsafe or traumatic for the parties' children, and his judgment is frequently impaired with respect to their safety, their care, and their best interests, according to her Feb. 23 filing.\n\nHunter has asked the court for joint custody, noting that he has always played an active and engaged role in the care and upbringing of Maisy.\n\nIn his Jan. 6 answer to the divorce complaint, Hunter said he is willing to pay child support, but also believes that his wife, a college graduate, can become self-sufficient.\n\nMs. Biden is able to contribute to her own support and the support of the children, the document said.\n\nFollow Margie Fishman on Twitter: @MargieTrende

Well, Grace and Frankie are also aware that they're short on time, which is why they're choosing to wholeheartedly embrace life, and it's Oprah-level inspirational.\n\n2. They get that breakups are rough\n\nBreakups don't get any easier as you get older and accumulate things like homes and children. And, even though we'd like to think wisdom comes hand-in-hand with age, these women still deal with the demise of their marriages the way we would a breakup: by not washing their hair and turning to booze and Ben & Jerry's.\n\n3. Also, that 4 out of 5 online dates suck\n\nWhen Brianna (June Diane Raphael), Grace's daughter tries to turn her on to online dating, Grace is against it. I choose not to be murdered by a stranger that I met online. I choose life, she said. Hands up if you've had this reaction.\n\nGrace ended up making an online profile and narrowly endured a date with a man who named his tumor that might've had teeth Farley. Bet Fonda's character is kicking herself in her toned buns now.\n\n4. Sometimes we lie to impress a new mate\n\nWe're not proud to admit it, but we've all let our eyes glaze over as we tried to endure a TV show or movie that our new partner was really into, right? Well the carb-fearing Grace is no different. She pretends to like hoagies and golf because of this very flawed logic: When you're in a new relationship with someone you care about, and you want them to be happy, you lie. That's Dr. Drew approved advice, right?\n\n5. They go out and have a good time\n\nEpisode 12 might have featured Robert (Martin Sheen) and Sol's (Sam Waterston) bachelor party, but it was our leading ladies who ended up dancing on top of the bar during girls' night. Frankie also taught us the appropriate response when the powers that be try to make you get down off the bar.\n\n6. They know relapses happen\n\nYes, your ex is your ex for a reason, and there's probably a whole Taylor Swift verse which tells exactly why you Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, but sometimes things happen. Like when Frankie and Sol moved out of their house and did whatever the opposite of christening is in their bedroom one last time. Breakups are tough and these babes know it.\n\n7. And that relationships may come and go, but friendships are forever\n\nRomantic partners might drop out of your life quicker than you can swipe right or left, but the constants in your life, your squad, your friends, these people will be around if you get ghosted. They will always have your back.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons we can relate to Grace and Frankie is because they seem to cherish their friendship as much we do ours.\n\nSo gather your group. Season 2 of Grace and Frankie is available for streaming and binging right now.

Michael J. Stern\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nDuring my years as a federal prosecutor, my life was knee-deep in murder, international drug trafficking, and gang violence. And so, when I had some personal time for entertainment, I went the opposite way. It is with profound embarrassment that I make this admission: I am addicted to trash television. If a show contains the phrase The Real Housewives Of, I'll watch it.\n\nLast year, on the Real Housewives of New York City, Luann de Lesseps was publicly raked over the coals for an episode in which she attended a Halloween party dressed as Diana Ross. As part of her costume, de Lesseps sported face and body bronzer that people claimed was the functional equivalent of 2018 blackface.\n\nSeveral Google hours later, I learned that minstrel shows in the late 19th century continued in various forms until the 1970s. The shows had white actors in blackface portraying grotesque caricatures of black people. Blackface was used to exaggerate and degrade African Americans.\n\nI understand why people's initial reaction would be to recoil upon hearing of someone wearing blackface today. But the prosecutor in me can't help but think of the years listening to judges tell juries that there is no crime without criminal intent.\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nNAACP president: Blackface is dehumanizing and has real consequences\n\nWhy Gov. Ralph Northam should not resign: Former Virginia congressman\n\nVirginia Gov. Ralph Northam squanders his moral authority\n\nI know that blackface and committing a crime are not the same thing. But the reason the law requires proof of bad intent is because, as a society, we don't think it's right to hold people responsible for something they did not intend to do.\n\nHistorically, blackface was intended to mock and dehumanize. But it seems evident that de Lesseps admired Diana Ross and her Halloween costume was a tribute rather than a knock.\n\nWhat to make of the political firestorm over blackface in Virginia? A photo on Gov. Ralph Northam's 1984 medical school yearbook page shows a man in blackface standing next to someone in a Ku Klux Klan robe. Initially, Northam said he was in that photo. Later, he said he was not. However, Northam has acknowledged that he wore blackface more than 30 years ago when he dressed as Michael Jackson for a dance contest. Calls for Northam's resignation quickly followed, led largely by fellow Democrats.\n\nOne of them was Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring. Yet a few days later he sparked his own controversy, admitting he wore blackface almost 40 years ago at an undergraduate party where he was dressed as a black rapper.\n\nHere's the thing about what is taboo to any minority community. The minorities are the ones who have been discriminated against. They get to choose what offends them.\n\nWith that said, we must recognize that dressing in blackface as a way of dehumanizing the black community is different than trying to physically resemble an admired black person at a Halloween party. Intent is everything.\n\nBefore you start hate-tweeting me, I am not suggesting that costume stores stock up on blackface in anticipation of Halloween. Regardless of a person's benign intent, there are times in history when a consensus develops in a minority community that something is offensive. That should be respected.\n\nFrom now on blackface should be extinct\n\nAt the same time, it is not fair to judge a person's actions 30 or 40 years ago by today's sensibilities. If a politician went on national TV today and said members of the LGBT community should not be allowed to marry because marriage is between a man and a woman, he or she would be rightly condemned as a bigot. But Barack Obama said just that while running for president in 2008.\n\nThen, in 2012, President Obama changed the course of history. It is widely believed in the LGBT community that Obama's support of marriage equality was the beating heart that brought it to life. I am among the believers. It never would have happened if people like me had refused to vote for Mr. Obama based on his offensive political stance years earlier.\n\nAn apology does not wipe away all sins, even if they are decades old. But shifting mores must be considered in assessing culpability and punishment.\n\nMy hope is that recent revelations will make the use of blackface extinct. But that does not guide where we should go when we discover that a political figure wore blackface decades ago. The no tolerance moral high road Democrats have committed to walking has left them at a disadvantage to Republicans who barely wag a finger at the likes of Steve King, the Iowa congressman who defended white supremacy last month.\n\nConsider records, not just flaws\n\nDemocrats must stop choosing their politicians like they select their dinner guests. We cannot keep purging politicians who effectively support Democratic policies but are imperfect. And no, accepting imperfection is not the same as diving into the Republican cesspool of bigotry, corruption and self-dealing.\n\nBoth Northam and Herring have histories of public service demonstrating their commitment to voting rights and other issues important to minorities. It would be nice if their personal lives decades ago aligned perfectly with their current political lives. But the votes they cast, the policies they support and, in Northam's case, the bills he has vetoed as governor, should weigh heavily in assessing their value to the Democratic Partyand the individuals who comprise the party.\n\nThis is especially important considering that Virginia Lieutenant Gov. Justin Fairfax has been accused of sexual assault by two women. If all three top Democrats resign, the Republican House speaker could take over the governorship and push Virginia into alignment with Trump administration priorities.\n\nI'm not sure what should happen to Northam and Herring. What I am sure of is that every decades-old instance of blackface does not deserve the gong and the hook. Especially when the outcome may be to cede Virginia's governorship to a man who will likely roll back the very civil rights the resignations sought to vindicate.\n\nBlackface is bad. Orangeface is worse.\n\nMichael J. Stern was a federal prosecutor for 25 years in Los Angeles and Detroit. Follow him on Twitter: @MichaelJStern1
Mary Bowerman\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhy do people cheat? A new survey from infidelity site Ashley Madison sheds light on the reason cheaters stray from their marriages.\n\nSixty-one percent of survey respondents reported that sex is the primary reason they looked outside of their marriages, but other survey responses illustrate the more complex nature of cheating. The survey of 2,018 members of Ashley Madison, a dating website that targets married people who want to date or have affairs, found people are also seeking emotional reassurance like affection (44%) and friendship (42%) outside their primary relationship.\n\nEmily deAyala, a sex therapist at REVIVE Therapy & Healing in Houston, said people expect a lot out of their marriage and when a need isn't being met, they may stray instead of fixing their issues.\n\nPeople are very guilty of not nurturing their relationship, deAyala, who is not affiliated with the survey, said. We fall into patterns and start to neglect aspects of the relationship that are important, and people miss the feelings they had early in the relationship.\n\nShe notes that while it's not realistic to have the honeymoon period forever, couples have to actively find ways to rediscover each other throughout the relationship, rather than discovering others.\n\nA 2013 Pew Survey of people in 39 countries found that a median of 79% consider infidelity unacceptable. But while people may not like the idea of cheating, it's undoubtedly happening. Ashley Madison, which caters to married people who want to have an affair, has more than 54 million member accounts worldwide.\n\nThe survey found that many married Ashley Madison users are straying to stay in their marriages, and cheating only to fill a void. Fifty-one percent said an affair makes them feel more alive and 48% said they felt more desired than in their main relationship.\n\nMore:What 'good sex' really means to singles: Match Singles in America survey\n\nBut while married Ashley Madison users may feel unfulfilled in certain areas of their life, not all cheaters are interested in leaving their spouse. The survey found 54% are only seeking short-term dating, and 50% of respondents said: they cheat rather than leave their spouse because they love their partner but are just looking for more sexual fulfillment.\n\nDeAyala said people often seek extramarital relationships to feel alive again and have the intensity and energy of an affair. She notes that if someone really wants to work on their relationship, the same intensity can be found inside a marriage, but it's not easy.\n\nIt takes a lot of work from both people, and that's where a lot of couples struggle, she said.\n\nMore:Ashley Madison's new slogan: 'Find your moment,' not 'Have an affair'\n\nMore:Affair site Ashley Madison reaches $1.6M settlement
Glenn Harlan Reynolds\n\nOpinion columnist\n\nSegregation now, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever! Those words were thundered by Alabama Gov. George Wallace in his 1963 inauguration speech. But, in fact, the very next year, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, which brought an end to segregation.\n\nOr did it?\n\nWallace later repented of this phrase, but in 2020, the 1963 George Wallace seems to be getting some traction. Because all over America — and even in Alabama — universities and schools are promoting and endorsing schemes that divide and label students by race.\n\nSegregation on campus\n\nThe University of Alabama, for example, is endorsing a Goldman Sachs-backed diversity program that benefits black, Hispanic, Native American and LGBT students, but excludes other groups. White? Asian? Straight? You're not welcome.\n\nAt the University of Colorado Boulder, a special retreat is available only to students whose identity community/ies have been minoritized in science, technology, engineering and math. Nor was it about special problems faced by minoritized students.\n\nAs Campus Reform reports, Activities at the event were centered around career development and networking, and not specific to minority experiences. They included creating research and teaching portfolios, coming up with questions to ask during interviews, networking with existing CU faculty, and learning the differences between types of faculty careers.\n\nMeanwhile, at Portland State University, the Women's Resource Center holds meetings solely for people of color.\n\nAt Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, a symposium on science and technology invited only speakers who fit the categories of African Americans, Alaska Natives, Arab Americans, Asian Americans, Latinx, Native Americans, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders.\n\nFinally fed up:States are cutting university budgets. Taxpayers aren't interested in funding campus kooks\n\nAnd the University of Nevada, Las Vegas offers special race-based housing. The University of California, Berkeley, meanwhile, offers four orientations based on race in addition to the main orientation.\n\nIt was the argument of the old-time segregationists that the various races were too different to get along side by side. The best that could be hoped for was that each could stay in its lane and flourish on its own with minimal contact with the others. That's sounding more and more like the sort of thing we're hearing on college campuses, where each group is told that others can't understand its thinking because of its unique experiences, requiring its own safe space.\n\nRepeating racial mistakes of the past\n\nOld-time segregationists prefigured the modern university in another way. Though they talked about separating the races, what they really meant was separating whites from all the others. The Virginia statute barring interracial marriage, struck down by the Supreme Court in the 1967 case of Loving v. Virginia, banned marriages between blacks and whites but allowed nonwhites to marry nonwhites of other races. Though the state said it was against race mixing, it was actually only against mixing whites with other races. (The statute featured an amusing carve-out for the descendants of Pocahontas, a status claimed by many of Virginia's top families who would otherwise have been treated as nonwhite due to that Native American ancestry.)\n\nLikewise, many of these university programs seem to lump all nonwhites — except Asians, who, as sometimes happened under Jim Crow, often get thrown in as honorary whites — into one category and whites in another.\n\nFree speech is under attack:I was assaulted at Berkeley because I'm conservative\n\nI think the segregationists of 1963 would have gotten a good laugh out of the way race is often treated on campus today. The rest of us shouldn't be laughing. All of this labeling, separating and dividing by race and other characteristics is one of the things contributing to a divided and divisive America. Sure, it generates plenty of make-work for campus administrators, but that's hardly a justification that should resonate with the taxpayers.\n\nAs we were just reminded on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, progress on race in America used to mean seeing past color and race, not sorting people based on external characteristics. And, actually, it still means that. It's just that the people running the show on campus seem less interested in progress than in division.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.
Patrick Ryan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLike every character on HBO's Girls, Marnie Michaels has her haters.\n\nPeople tell me often and very freely that they don't like Marnie, says Allison Williams, 27, who plays the uptight, hypercritical twentysomething. I understand, obviously, but I always wish for a moment when Marnie could show herself to them and be a little more vulnerable, and for us to see her pain and what's really going on in there.\n\nThat moment could arrive in Sunday's episode (10 p.m. ET/PT), which centers almost entirely on the just-married friend of Hannah Horvath (Girls creator Lena Dunham). Williams describes the half-hour as a real-life 'choose your own adventure' story, as Marnie wanders around New York alone after an argument with her new husband and musical partner, Desi (Ebon Moss-Bachrach).\n\nHBO's 'Girls' goes to Japan: 'Sumimasen!'\n\nThe nature of their fight is not particularly profound or important, but you get the sense that the match is not as harmonious as she wanted, nor can she force it to be the kind of marriage she always imagined, Williams says. She could really use some help, and that's where the episode starts: from a place of exasperation.\n\nAlthough Williams stays tight-lipped about the specifics of Marnie's trek, she teases that there are definitely some surprises, which for a not particularly plot-heavy show are significant. Those may include the reappearance of someone from Marnie's past (hinted at in a teaser released by HBO), as well as an uncomfortable situation in which she tries on a different persona, wearing a revealing, red-sequined dress.\n\nIn taking some time for herself, we get to see her fully across the emotional spectrum: with nothing left (and) still trying to put on a good face, and that's, of course, a version of her our viewers are most used to seeing, Williams says. And even if people don't like Marnie more by the end of the episode, at the very least, I don't think it'll be possible to avoid understanding her better.\n\nThe actress, who starred in NBC's Peter Pan Live musical in 2014, says it was rewarding to carry the brunt of this week's Girls episode, given that Marnie has been mostly absent since her nuptials to Desi in the Feb. 21 season premiere. That episode saw her in typical bridezilla mode — making passive-aggressive demands of her bridesmaids, and clashing with her mom (Rita Wilson) over her corny flower crown — but Williams insists she was the complete opposite on her own wedding day, when she married CollegeHumor co-founder Ricky Van Veen last September.\n\nWhen Hannah is away, she will play on 'Girls'\n\nWe were different in literally every way, but I'm sure people expected much more of a Marnie-ish demeanor from me, Williams says. One of my best friend's reactions to that episode was fantastic. She was like, 'I've always known you were a good actress, but having now seen the Marnie wedding and your own wedding, I can finally appreciate the difference between the two of you. You could so convincingly be a nightmare, but when you were being yourself, you were so chill about everything.'\n\nI was like, 'Five seasons in and you're convinced of my acting abilities. I'll take it.' 
The royal wedding of Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle is five months away and already we're panting with questions about the details.\n\nAlas, we're not likely to learn the answers for many more weeks; maybe not until the day of the nuptials, May 19, in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, the largest and oldest (nearly 1,000 years old) inhabited castle in the world.\n\nBut we can speculate, and who's to object?\n\nAs everyone knows, planning a wedding is a major endeavor for ordinary mortals; imagine the hassle if you're royal. Harry, 33, will soon be only sixth in line to the throne but the wedding will still be a semi-state event and a very public affair likely to involve hundreds of official guests beyond the principals' close relatives and friends. And it's a binational wedding: the principal members of Markle's family live on the West Coast.\n\nSo here are some questions we're all curious about, and some possible answers based on the 2011 royal wedding of Prince William to the former Kate Middleton, now Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and the royal-relation wedding of Kate's sister, Pippa Middleton, to James Matthews last May.\n\nHow big will it be?\n\nNot as big as either his brother's wedding in Westminster Abbey, nor his parents' wedding in St. Paul's Cathedral, both of which had thousands of guests. It will be more in line with the 2005 wedding of his father, Prince Charles, and second wife Camilla Parker Bowles, also at Windsor Castle.\n\nSt. George's is a chapel in name only; it seats 800, about half the 1,900 guests at Will and Kate's wedding. That's also the number of guests at Charles and Camilla's 2005 prayer ceremony in the chapel, which was followed by a reception in the State Apartment of Windsor Castle hosted by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nCompared with the Will/Kate state event, the Harry/Meghan nuptials are going to be more low-key. London (28 miles away) will not be festooned with zillions of Union Jacks and miles of bunting. The wedding day won't be a national holiday. Millions will not gather on The Mall to watch the parade of gilded coaches surrounded by scarlet-clad soldiers on prancing horses. Hordes will not surround the Queen Victoria statue in front of Buckingham Palace to await the couple's appearance on the balcony amid cries of Kiss her!\n\nInstead, much smaller numbers of onlookers will pack the narrow streets of the town of Windsor outside the castle gates, and the Lower Ward within the gates and near the chapel. Most people will likely see what's happening via giant screens. There may also be tickets to the grounds distributed to the public, as was the case when Harry's uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999.\n\nOrdinarily open most days to tourists, the castle will be closed on the day of the wedding. There will be cameras in the chapel (as there were for Charles' and Camilla's wedding) but as a TV production, this will be much less overwhelming, as is Harry's and Meghan's preference.\n\nBut Kensington Palace said when the engagement was announced the couple want the public to feel part of the celebration and are working on ideas to make that possible.\n\nWho will officiate?\n\nIt will be a Church of England ceremony (the royal family is Anglican, the monarch is the symbolic head of the church), so Markle, 36, will be baptized into the church before the wedding. Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, is the senior prelate of the church and might be expected to officiate but Harry and Meghan may choose someone else.\n\nWho will design Meghan's gown?\n\nAs a style leader, Markle is still largely an unknown, though she's been spotted over the last seven years of her Suits acting career in attractive red-carpet frocks.\n\nSince her relationship with Harry became public 13 months ago, her style has ricocheted from torn-knee jeans and loafers to a gobsmacking gorgeous gown (with a price tag of about $73,000 to match) by Ralph & Russo (the Australian duo based in London) for their engagement photos. It featured a see-through black mesh bodice with embroidered gold feathers and a feathery silk organza skirt.\n\nMarkle's few appearances on Harry's arm at public engagements (they're scheduled on Jan. 9 to visit London's multi-ethnic Brixton district, where residents and police clashed in the 1980s and 1990s) have been studied by fashionistas to discern her style: She wore a cream-colored coat by Line the Label for the engagement announcement and a caramel-colored coat by Sentaler for the Christmas Day service at Sandringham.\n\nBut Markle talked with Glamour in March 2016 about wedding gowns when her character on Suits, Rachel Zane, got married. Rachel's style is more classic and timeless than her own, she said.\n\nMy personal style — wedding or not — is very pared down and relaxed, she said.\n\nClassic and simple is the name of the game, perhaps with a modern twist. I personally prefer wedding dresses that are whimsical or subtly romantic. Delphine Manivet and Christos Costarellos are faves of mine for their uniqueness and beauty. And I will always be a fan of Ellie Saab. J. Mendel is spectacular as well, especially for more structural designs.\n\nWhat looks good on Meghan Markle:Our favorite pieces from Meghan Markle's wardrobe in 2017\n\nMake of that what you will. For certain: Whoever designs her gown will reap millions in free publicity and brand awareness.\n\nWhat will her wedding ring look like?\n\nTwo words: Welsh gold. He's Prince Harry of Wales and it's a tradition dating back to his great-grandparents' nuptials in 1923 to use gold mined in Wales for royal wedding rings.\n\nWe've already seen her engagement ring, designed by Harry using two diamonds from Princess Diana's personal collection and a larger, center diamond from Botswana, a country close to Harry's heart. The couple traveled there earlier this year.\n\nWhat will their titles be?\n\nShe won't be Princess Meghan, just as Kate is not officially Princess Kate. Like Kate, Meghan will become a royal duchess, as in HRH Meghan, Duchess of … . Typically, the queen grants a royal dukedom to a royal bridegroom on his wedding day and the long-vacant title of Duke of Sussex (last used in the early 1800s by a son of the king who lost America, George III) is the clear frontrunner as a likely title for Harry, according to British royals experts. He would become HRH Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex; she would become HRH Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.\n\nThe bridesmaids: Who will be her 'Pippa'?\n\nWhen Kate Middleton married Prince William in 2011, they had been a couple for most of a decade and everyone already knew who would be her maid of honor: her sister, Pippa Middleton. Then Pippa and her shapely bottom, packed into a Sarah Burton/Alexander McQueen bridesmaid gown, nearly blew away the attention from the bride. Pippa instantly became as famous as her sis.\n\nBut adult bridesmaids are not the norm at royal weddings; usually, they are little girls, with little boys as pages. Markle has only one older half-sister, Samantha Markle Grant, 52, who has been openly critical of Markle in some interviews with the media and is writing a book she's calling The Diary of Princess Pushy's Sister. She has said they have hardly spoken since Grant was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2008 and began using a wheelchair.\n\nDuchess Kate is unlikely to be in the wedding party; she will recently have given birth to her third child.\n\nBut judging from her Instagram, Markle does have many celebrity friends to choose from, such as tennis great Serena Williams, fashion designer and pal Misha Nonoo (who may have set up her first date with Harry), TV producer Lindsay Roth (Markle was maid of honor at her wedding in August 2016), actresses Abigail Spencer (a co-star on Suits), Priyanka Chopra and Janina Gavankar, and her stylist, Jessica Mulroney.\n\nWho will be Harry's best man?\n\nRoyal weddings of the past didn't typically feature a best man, but Prince William and their father both opted to break with the past and chose their brothers as their supporters, as the British call them. It's likely Harry has chosen Will just as Will chose him.\n\nWill Harry's royal nephew and niece take part?\n\nPrince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, who will be 3 by then, were the adorable stars at Auntie Pippa's wedding in May, she as a bridesmaid and he as a page. There's no reason they wouldn't be included again. They'll be older and thus somewhat more well-behaved; at Pippa's nuptials, George had a mini-meltdown after his mum scolded him for stepping on the bride's train.\n\nHarry has a clutch of other younger relatives, first and second cousins, who may participate, including Mia Tindall, who will be 4, daughter of his cousin Zara Phillips Tindall, and Isla Phillips, 5, daughter of his cousin Peter Phillips.\n\nAnd naturally, the entire royal mob of adult relatives, headed by the queen, will be there.\n\nAnother child who might have a role: Isabel Veronica Ivy Mulroney, the 4-year-old daughter of Markle's bestie Mulroney and the granddaughter of a former Canadian prime minister.\n\nWho will attend from the bride's family?\n\nIt is still not clear who among Markle's family besides her divorced parents, father Thomas Markle Sr., a former Hollywood lighting director, and mother Doria Ragland, a yoga teacher in Los Angeles, will attend. She has older half-siblings from her father's previous marriage but her family is not as large as Harry's.\n\nDuring the BBC radio interview broadcast on Dec. 27, Harry said Markle had a fantastic time meeting her inlaws-to-be during the annual royal Christmas at Sandringham — a first-ever royal fiancée invited to the family retreat before the wedding — and the family loved having her there. ... She's done an absolutely amazing job (fitting in). She's getting in there, and it's the family I suppose that she's never had.\n\nThis remark came as a surprise to Grant, who complained on Twitter and to The Daily Mail.\n\nActually, she has a large family who were always there with her and for her. Our household was very normal and when dad and Doria divorced, we all made it so it was like she had two houses. No one was estranged, she was just too busy. Read my book complete with facts and photos, she posted before her account was made private.\n\nWho else will be on the guest list, and will it include the Trumps?\n\nEven for Will and Kate's wedding, the queen allowed the couple to tear up the official guest list and make their own friends the top priority before all the usual grand and good and foreign pooh-bahs. Harry's wedding may be expected to feature an even more casual approach given that he is not the heir to the throne.\n\nBy the end of December, the British tabloids were breathlessly reporting about whether or not Harry and Meghan will invite former president Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, instead of President Trump and the first lady.\n\nOn Dec. 27, while guest-editing a BBC morning radio program, Harry was asked about the Obama controversy; he joked the guest list was still a ways off.\n\nI don't know about that, we haven't even put the invite or the guest list together. Who knows if (Obama's) going to be invited or not, Harry said. I wouldn't want to ruin that surprise.\n\nBut Harry hardly knows the Trumps and Meghan has been an outspoken opponent: In May 2016, during an appearance on The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore, she called Trump misogynistic and divisive and said she supported Hillary Clinton. (As a member of the royal family, she won't be able to say anything like that ever again, anywhere.)\n\nThe Obamas did not attend Will and Kate's 2011 wedding (he was busy that weekend, monitoring the mission to capture and kill Osama bin Laden), but the U.S. ambassador was there as America's representative. Soon after the wedding, the Obamas met Will and Kate at Buckingham Palace, and later, in April 2016, he met Prince George at Kensington Palace, captured in a famous photo.\n\nThe Obamas have been especially friendly with Harry since he dropped by the White House for a surprise visit in May 2013 to talk about their mutual interest in wounded warriors. Mrs. Obama and her daughters had tea with Harry at Kensington Palace in June 2015. Harry and the Obamas followed up with goofy U.S. vs U.K. video challenges featuring the queen in the runup to Harry's second Invictus Games in Orlando in 2016.\n\nIn September, Obama taped the BBC radio interview with Harry in Toronto during the Invictus Games; later the two watched a wheelchair basketball competition together. And in November, Harry was a star guest at the inaugural Obama Foundation leadership summit in Chicago.\n\nWhere will the reception be?\n\nThis is not firmed up, but the official engagement photos released last month were taken at Frogmore House, the 17th-century manor on the Windsor Castle estate. It's best known as a former royal family home and the site of the royal mausoleum, where Queen Victoria and Prince Albert are buried, but it's also used for royal wedding receptions.\n\nBut maybe not this one. A former Windsor Castle staffer told People that the reception will likely be held in the Waterloo Chamber, St. George's Hall and the Grand Reception Room within the castle. All are part of the State Apartments, a royal sequence of rooms that form the centerpiece of the Upper Ward of the castle.
An unlikely friendship is at the center of an unlikely podcast: Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen in deep conversation.\n\nFormer President Obama and Michelle Obama's Higher Ground production company on Monday is debuting its second Spotify podcast, Renegades: Born in the USA. The eight-episode series features conversations between Obama and Springsteen, who formed a friendship during the 2008 campaign trail, as they discuss topics from marriage and fatherhood to race and the state of the country.\n\nThe premiere Renegades episode, titled Outsiders: An Unlikely Friendship, details how the politician and the musician forged their relationship despite not having a lot in common on the surface.\n\nHe's a white guy from a small town in Jersey. I'm a Black guy of mixed race born in Hawaii with a childhood that took me around the world. He's a rock 'n' roll icon. I'm a lawyer and politician, not as cool, Obama says in the podcast. And as I like to remind Bruce every chance I get, he's more than a decade older than me. Although, he looks damn good.\n\nObama says the podcast with Springsteen was born out of a topic that dominated conversations in America last year: How did we get here? How could we find our way back to a more unifying American story?\n\nHe adds he happened to have that conversation with Springsteen and noted the two have been on parallel journeys trying to understand this country that's given us both so much.\n\nObama recalls the time he first met Springsteen when the rocker performed on the campaign trail, adding that he thought the Born to Run artist was lowkey and maybe even shy.\n\nAnd I liked that in you. So I thought, 'I hope I get a chance to talk to him at some point.' But because it was in the middle of the campaign, we were rushing around, Obama says.\n\nObama says the two of them eventually had a nice chat. And it wasn't like we had a deep conversation. And we had a number of those sort of interactions: You know, you performed at the inauguration, came by the White House, I run for re-election, you do some more stuff.\n\nThe former president also shares a story of when Springsteen joined him for dinner at the White House and the two sang some Broadway tunes. And some Motown. And some classics.\n\nI played the piano. You sang, Springsteen says.\n\nAnd there was some… there were libations involved, Obama says. Well, he's not as shy as I thought, but he just needs to loosen up a little bit.\n\nPodcast debut:Michelle, Barack Obama discuss hopes for 'country that respects everybody'\n\nThis new venture isn't the Obamas' first podcasting rodeo. The former president was Michelle Obama's first guest on the debut episode of her The Michelle Obama Podcast last summer, and he spoke about his hopes for their daughters' futures.\n\nMore than anything, what it would be is that they're living in a country that respects everybody and looks after everybody, celebrates and sees everybody, Barack Obama said. Because we know that if we're not around, but those girls are in a society like that, they'll be fine.\n\nThe former first lady's podcast teaches listeners to open up new conversations – and hard conversations – with the people who matter most to them. Topics of discussion include sibling relationships, raising children, girlfriends, women's health, mentorship and marriage.\n\nContributing: Sara Moniuszko\n\nMore:Michelle Obama launches Netflix children's show to encourage healthier eating habits

Compiled by Jocelyn McClurg\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhat should you read this weekend? USA TODAY's picks for book lovers include the twisty best-selling thriller The Widow, and a non-fiction look at teen girls and social media.\n\nThe Widow by Fiona Barton; NAL, 324 pp.; fiction\n\nIt turns out that having serious trust issues can be a very good thing. At least when it comes to fiction.\n\nBest sellers The Girl on the Train, Gone Girl and Luckiest Girl Alive prove the point. Fiona Barton's The Widow is a psychological thriller with enough twists and turns to fit perfectly on the shelf alongside the gaggle of aforementioned girls.\n\nThe Widow opens in an English university town four years after the alleged abduction and murder of 2-year-old Bella Elliott. The prime suspect remains Glen Taylor, a mild-mannered delivery driver whose professional aspirations are never realized and whose childless marriage is put under scrutiny. The only problem is, Bella has never been found and now Glen, released after an unsuccessful prosecution, is dead in an accident.\n\nThe result is even more press coverage, more police inquiries and much more pressure for the widow, Jean Turner.\n\nUSA TODAY says *** out of four stars. Here is where the brilliance of The Widow lies. Whom do you trust? Whom can you trust?\n\nFiona Barton's 'The Widow' offers psychological thrills\n\nAmerican Girls: Social Media and the Secret Lives of Teenagers by Nancy Jo Sales; Knopf, 375 pp.; non-fiction\n\nSales talks to young women around the country to learn the extent to which their lives revolve around social media, and the sometimes traumatic effect it's having on their interactions and aspirations.\n\nUSA TODAY says ***½ stars. A clarion call — or an alarm bell …Offer(s) a harrowing glimpse into a world where self-esteem, friendships and sexuality play out, and are defined by the parameters of social media.\n\n'American Girls,' an alarming study of teens and social media\n\nOrphan X by Gregg Hurwitz; Minotaur, 368 pp.; fiction\n\nInvincible, solitary hero Evan Smoak is weaponized from early childhood by a shadowy government program — before revolting, deciding to leave field work and become an anonymous vigilante, deploying his skills on behalf of the public good.\n\nUSA TODAY says *** stars. If you fed a sophisticated computer the collected adventures of Jason Bourne and Jack Reacher and asked it to produce a thriller, the resulting book would probably look something like Orphan X.\n\nNew mysteries: Murder, mayhem and mixtapes\n\nThe Ex by Alafair Burke; Harper, 283 pp.; fiction\n\nWhen New York defense lawyer Olivia Randall's ex-boyfriend is accused of murder, she agrees to take on his case, sure at first that he must be innocent.\n\nUSA TODAY says *** stars.

Here we go again: Natalie Wood may never rest in peace.\n\nIn November, it will be 37 years since Wood, the Hollywood child star-turned-Oscar-nominated actress, died in a mysterious drowning off the coast of Santa Catalina, the popular pleasure island in the Pacific, 49 miles southwest of Los Angeles.\n\nTwo generations have been born since the peak of Wood's fame so unless these newcomers are fans of her classic movies (Rebel Without a Cause, Splendor in the Grass, West Side Story), a primer on the case might be in order.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWood was 43, a mother of two, and married to her two-time husband, handsome TV actor Robert Wagner, then 51. Like scores of other rich Angelenos with yachts, they were anchored off Catalina after a day of sailing on their 60-footer, The Splendour.\n\nThen, on Nov. 29, 1981, she disappeared from the boat under circumstances that remain murky at best. Hours later, her body was found, clad in a flannel nightgown, red down jacket and blue socks, floating in the Pacific about a mile away from the yacht and off the island's Blue Cavern Point.\n\nHer death was ruled an accidental drowning at the time. But the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reopened the case in 2011; the following year, the cause of death on her death certificate was changed to drowning and other undetermined factors.\n\nWhy is her death in the news again?\n\nOn Thursday, sheriff's detectives were back for another try, saying that new witnesses had emerged, leading investigators to label Wood's death suspicious and once again named her then-husband Wagner a person of interest.\n\nThe last time investigators said this about Wagner was in November 2011, when they reopened the case citing substantial new information. Even though the official cause of death was changed, no charges were ever filed against Wagner or anyone else.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said new witnesses interviewed since the case was reopened gave statements that portray a new sequence of events on the boat that night.\n\nOne of the witnesses described hearing yelling and crashing sounds coming from the couple's stateroom, she said. Shortly after that, separate witnesses heard a man and woman arguing at the back of the boat and believe the voices were those of Wood and Wagner, Nishida said.\n\nThe statements differ from the original version of events provided by witnesses, including those who were on the boat, she said.\n\nSo why have they decided Wagner is again a person of interest? They're not saying.\n\nDo we have enough to make an arrest at this moment? No, Nishida said.\n\nInvestigators have said Wagner has not been interviewed since the probe was reopened. They said in 2013 that they had tried at least 10 times to interview him but he refused.\n\nWagner has denied any involvement in his wife's death and no charges have been filed. His publicist, Alan Nierob, declined to comment Thursday.\n\nWho was on the yacht that night?\n\nWood: Born Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko, Wood began acting in films before the age of 5, shooting to stardom in the 1947 Christmas film Miracle on 34th Street. She earned her first Oscar nomination for best supporting actress as a teen in Rebel and added nominations for best actress in Splendor and Love With the Proper Stranger in the 1960s.\n\nShe was married to Wagner twice; the second time, she gave birth to their daughter, Courtney. In between, she was married to producer Richard Gregson, father of her elder daughter, Natasha Gregson Wagner, now 47.\n\nOne of the most famous facts about Wood: Since childhood, she had been deathly afraid of drowning in dark water.\n\nWagner: Now 87 and a recurring guest star on CBS' NCIS, he was a charming man-about-Hollywood when he married Wood in 1957, when she was in her late teens and he was in his mid-20s. Like a lot of other women in town, she had long harbored a crush on him. Their first marriage lasted only five years; they remarried in 1972 and were still married, seemingly happily, until that night on their yacht.\n\nChristopher Walken: Now 74, the Oscar-winning character actor (The Deer Hunter, 1978) was co-starring with Wood in a film and was a guest of the Wagners on the yacht that night. Known as a quirky character at best, Walken has said almost nothing in public about what happened.\n\nBut in 1997, he offered a plausible theory in an interview with Playboy: Half asleep, Wood, who Walken says couldn't swim, went to move a dinghy bouncing against the side of the boat and slipped on a ski ramp partially in the water. She hit her head, fell into the water and floated away.\n\nDennis Davern: The boat captain, now 55 and living in Florida, has said different things about what happened that night, at first telling police it was an accident and later implying that something sinister happened.\n\nIn 2011, in an interview with the Today show, Davern said he lied to police at first. I made mistakes by not telling the honest truth in the (initial) police report, Davern said then. When asked if Wagner had more of a responsibility in the case, Davern said, Yes, I would say so, yes. But he refused to elaborate.\n\nEven earlier, in a 1992 interview with Geraldo Rivera's Now It Can Be Told, he implied that he knew how Wood got into the water. And in a long Vanity Fair piece in 2000, Davern is quoted as saying that Wood and Wagner fought in their cabin before the actress disappeared.\n\nBut Davern's credibility has not been helped by the fact that over the years he has been paid to offer parts of his story to the tabloids.\n\nWhat was the reaction to her death?\n\nEveryone at the time agreed Wood's death at the height of her beauty, fame and movie-star career was shocking and tragic. But that was the only point on which there was widespread agreement.\n\nHer death set off feverish speculation in Hollywood, especially in the media: Was it an accident or was it murder? If so, who did it? Surely not her husband, R.J., as the beloved star was known in Tinsel Town. Did they have a fight before she disappeared and what was it about?\n\nAnd how come the LACSD — suspicious of Wagner from the beginning — has spent nearly four decades trying to pin something on him, and so far failed?\n\nMore: 5 other Hollywood deaths that are still shrouded in mystery\n\nContributing: Associated Press
A pair of Cubs fans will have an incredible proposal story to tell for years to come thanks in part to Anthony Rizzo.\n\nThe Cubs first baseman showed up at Saturday's Fanatics memorabilia show in Chicago and helped Cubs fan Steve Milsap propose to his girlfriend, Leslie.\n\nRizzo posed for a photo with the family before setting Steve up to ask Leslie the question. Steve didn't even make it through the whole proposal before Leslie said yes.\n\nThey even received a customized Marry Me Cubs jersey.\n\nI'd say that was a memorable trip to a card show.
WASHINGTON – Associate Justice Samuel Alito, an anchor of conservative thought on the Supreme Court, said he wasn't surprised by the backlash he received recently following a gloves-off speech in which he asserted coronavirus restrictions had created a constitutional stress test by placing unprecedented limits on individual freedom.\n\nResponding to a question about the fracas from USA TODAY, the court's fourth-most senior justice defended the parts of the Nov. 12 speech to the Federalist Society that drew the most controversy, noting they had come directly from several of his recent opinions – in some cases with nearly identical language.\n\nVirtually every substantive point in the Federalist Society speech was taken from one of my published opinions or an opinion I joined, Alito, who on Sunday marks his 15-year anniversary on the high court, said in a statement.\n\nBut Alito, who warned during the November speech that his remarks might be twisted, also indicated he wasn't fazed or particularly startled by the blowback.\n\nI was not surprised by the reaction, he said.\n\nFallout:Critics decry Justice Alito's 'nakedly partisan' speech on COVID-19 measures\n\nFreedom:Supreme Court grants California church's challenge to COVID restrictions\n\nSpeaking to a group of conservatives and libertarians days after the bitterly fought presidential election, Alito let loose on what he described as previously unimaginable state-imposed restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic – lamenting the severe, extensive and prolonged lockdown policies he said amounted to a constitutional stress test.\n\nWith his flair for slicing to the core of an argument, Alito pointed to Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak's decision in May to impose less rigid attendance limits on casinos than churches, noting the Constitution doesn't include a blackjack clause to protect gambling the same way it protects religion. Alito said he wasn't criticizing the policies – I'm a judge, not a policymaker, he said – but said the restrictions raise profound questions.\n\nTo his critics, the speech was nakedly partisan, prompting Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., to opine that justices aren't supposed to be political hacks. The criticism amplified an effort gaining momentum on the left in Washington to impose changes on the nation's highest court, such as by imposing term limits.\n\nMore:Battles between Republicans and Democrats fuel clash over Supreme Court's future\n\nBut for Alito's admirers, the remarks and his published opinions on the issue, underscored his longstanding role as one of the court's most reliable conservative voices. Put another way, some observers said, if people were surprised by Alito's remarks last fall, maybe they shouldn't have been.\n\nHe's not afraid to be alone on things, said Adam Ciongoli, a former Alito law clerk. Justice Alito is a shy person but he does not shy from controversy because, in my experience, he has a very clear sense of what his role is and what is right and wrong.\n\nMore:Amy Coney Barrett steers the Supreme Court to the right\n\nNow, with Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett ostensibly giving conservatives a 6-3 advantage on the court, Alito, 70, finds himself in a pivotal position. Part of his influence, some said, could be felt in the longstanding debate over what role justices play – and what they bring of themselves – to interpreting the law.\n\nI don't see him changing, Ciongoli added of Alito. What I do see is the landscape of the debate shifting in a way that very interestingly puts his philosophy and his personality and orientation as a figure in the middle of that debate.\n\nTextualist v. textualist\n\nFifteen years into his tenure, Samuel Anthony Alito Jr., a New Jersey native who replaced Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, has hewn closely to what conservatives had hoped for when President George W. Bush nominated him for the job in 2005: He has opposed same-sex marriage, abortion, labor protections and, more recently, restrictions on churches and synagogues imposed during the COVID-19 era.\n\nJustice Alito is not going to surprise you, said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston who follows the court closely.\n\nBut he also is a leading voice in a debate over the meaning of textualism, or the theory espoused by the late Justice Antonin Scalia that jurists should decide questions based on the textual meaning of the Constitution and statutes. Tension over the practicalities of the theory were evident in a 2020 case in which the court ruled a decades-old civil rights law barring workplace sex discrimination applied to gay, lesbian and transgender workers.\n\nAssociate Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for a 6-3 majority, found that when the law barred discrimination based on sex that it necessarily means LGBTQ people were also protected, even if the law's authors didn't envision that protection. When a company fires an employee for being gay, he wrote, it necessarily discriminates against that individual in part because of sex.\n\nBut Alito argued the majority opinion got the concept all wrong. The court, Alito said, must take into account what the words in the law meant to people at the time they were written. And sex, he wrote at the time, meant something different from sexual orientation.\n\nMore:Supreme Court grants federal job protections to gay, lesbian, transgender workers\n\nIn his statement to USA TODAY, Alito referred to his feisty dissent in the case, summarizing the point of his opinion as: The textualist argument of the majority was not true to Justice Scalia's understanding of textualism.\n\nThe court's opinion is like a pirate ship, Alito wrote in the dissent. It sails under a textualist flag, but what it actually represents is a theory of statutory interpretation that Justice Scalia excoriated – the theory that courts should 'update' old statutes so that they better reflect the current values of society.\n\nConsistent conservative\n\nAlito wrote a landmark 5-4 decision in 2014 exempting Hobby Lobby and other businesses with religious objections from the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate. Four years later, he authored the 5-4 decision that overturned a 41-year-old precedent allowing public employee unions to demand fees from non-members.\n\nUnions:Supreme Court deals financial blow to nation's public employee unions\n\nHe crafted the majority opinion in a 2010 case that found the Second Amendment's right to bear arms was a limitation on cities and states, effectively striking down a handgun ban in Chicago and nearby Oak Park, Ill. Last year, he wrote the majority opinion denying damages to the family of a Mexican teen who was killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent because the boy was on the Mexican side of the border at the time of the fatal shooting.\n\nAlito authored another decision last year that found religious schools are exempt from most employment discrimination claims, expanding the autonomy of religious employers that has been at the center of several recent cases.\n\nMore:Supreme Court upholds autonomy of religious employers in employment discrimination cases\n\nThose decisions – and others like it – have drawn criticism from the left.\n\nHe is consistently on the far right of the court, though with Trump's appointments the court has moved right to meet him, said William Yeomans, a lecturer at Columbia University and longtime Justice Department official who also served as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee under the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.\n\nWhether his consistency reflects political views or ideology, the results align closely with the political views of the Republican Party, Yeomans added.\n\nAlito's associates say he brings an open mind to cases and that his opinions are based not on partisanship but a deeply held belief that courts have a narrow role.\n\nI see him as a justice who is committed to a vision of the judicial role -- who sees that role as a limited one, said David Moore, who clerked for Alito on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and then again on the Supreme Court and who is now a law professor at Brigham Young University.\n\nCarrie Severino, president of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, described Alito as unapologetically committed to the rule of law, regardless of popular trends.\n\nEmpathetic justice?\n\nRepublicans slammed then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2005 when he pointed to empathy as part of a test for weighing Supreme Court nominees. Though the word became toxic in conservative legal circles, viewed as a departure from the idea of adhering to the text of the Constitution, Alitooften delves into the human impact of the law in his opinions.\n\nThere's a strong argument to be made that he is President Obama's definition of an empathetic justice if that justice is conservative instead of progressive, said Jonathan Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve School of Law.\n\nIf you look at Justice Alito's opinions, I think you see a lot of empathy, Adler said.\n\nAlito, a former prosecutor, was the lone dissenter from a 2011 ruling that upheld the right of members of the Westboro Baptist Church to interrupt a fallen Marine's funeral by shouting homophobic slurs.The majority found the protests were protected under the First Amendment. Alito disagreed.\n\nAlbert Snyder is not a public figure. He is simply a parent whose son, Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder, was killed in Iraq, Alito wrote. Mr. Snyder wanted what is surely the right of any parent who experiences such an incalculable loss: to bury his son in peace.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing, Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., asked Alito to comment about his heart. Alito said he can't help but think of his own ancestors when considering immigration cases or about his family when hearing cases involving children. Asked whether that approach had evolved for him after 15 years on the high court, Alito referred to an interview last year on the website We The Italians.\n\nIn that piece, Alito talks at length about how his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Italy, and about the contributions both nations have made to each other. He also described being very upset about a push to remove statues of Christopher Columbus, celebrated by some as a symbol of Italian heritage and condemned by others as a symbol of colonization of indigenous Americans.\n\nCritics say Alito's empathy extends only one way: Toward conservatives.\n\nEmpathy is among the last words that come to mind when thinking of Justice Alito and his record on the Supreme Court, said Jennifer Pizer, director of law and policy at Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ advocacy group. To those of us trying to protect civil rights, he sometimes has seemed almost disingenuous in his discounting of the human impact of his decisions.\n\nPizer pointed to the Hobby Lobby case, among others, and the Federalist Society speech, which she referred to as an impassioned call to arms for the far right.\n\nWe have seen precious little evidence of empathy, she said.\n\nNever flinched\n\nAlito's associates describe a justice who is soft-spoken, humble – boring, in his own words. Former law clerks noted Alito has taken time to offer personal tours of the court to their families,years after they parted ways. His supporters recall stories about Alito wearing a name tag at pre-pandemic functions, which they point to as a sign of his modesty.\n\nIf you didn't recognize Alito, Ciongoli said, he would never tell you what he did.\n\nDan Coats, the former Indiana senator, ambassador to Germany and director of national intelligence for President Donald Trump, recalled his experience guiding Alito through the Senate confirmation process 15 years ago. Coats said Alito was so unassuming that he joked members of his own family didn't always recognize him when they gathered at large reunions. He remembered Alito being shocked by the rows of news cameras lined up during the process.\n\nFor him it was somewhat of a traumatic experience, Coats said.\n\nBut Coats also remembered a nominee so brilliant that senators found excuses during their meet-and-greets to duck out 20 minutes into an hour-long meeting because there wasn't much room to win an argument. During marathon hearings that were often contentious, Coats remembered Alito being rational and disciplined.\n\nHe never flinched, Coats said.\n\nThat doesn't mean the diehard Philadelphia Phillies fan hasn't at times invited controversy.\n\nYears before his Federalist Society address last fall, Alito drew attention for mouthing the words not true during Obama's 2010 State of the Union address. Asked about the incident, Alito later told The Los Angeles Times he once lost points as a student debater for making a face that revealed he disagreed with an opponent.\n\nIt's something I should have learned in high school, he told The Times.\n\n'Dagger at the heart'\n\nHe may be soft-spoken, but Alito is also known as a sharp questioner.\n\nLeah Litman, a professor at University of Michigan Law School, has been tracking the amount of time each justice speaks as the court conducts its arguments by phone during the pandemic. In October, she found, Alito took more time – 4,991 seconds – than anyone else.\n\nAs the justices debated a case in November about whether a Catholic foster care organization in Philadelphia can refuse to certify same-sex couples as foster parents, Alito went bluntly to what he saw as the center of the issue.\n\nIf we are honest about what's really going on here, it's not about ensuring that same-sex couples in Philadelphia have the opportunity to be foster parents, Alito said, noting no same-sex couples had asked the Catholic group for certification – they had gone elsewhere. It's the fact that the city can't stand the message that Catholic Social Services and the Archdiocese are sending by continuing to adhere to the old-fashioned view about marriage. Isn't that the case?\n\nNeal Katyal, a former acting U.S. solicitor general arguing for Philadelphia, countered that it wasn't. But the question nevertheless put Alito's views about religious freedom at the center of the discussion.\n\nEarlier:Supreme Court to decide if foster care agencies can snub gay, lesbian couples due to religious objections\n\nAdler described Alito as the type of questioner lawyers have to pay especially close attention to or risk winding up in a trap.\n\nThere are lots of cases where Alito's questions are just a dagger at the heart, Adler said.
At noon on Jan. 20, America will usher in a new administration.\n\nDespite attempts by pro-Trump rioters (and the president himself) to overturn the electoral process, American democracy has prevailed.\n\nThe swearing-in of the president-elect and vice president-elect is one of many affirmations of our system. Every four years, the ceremony reminds all watching that it's the voices of the cooperative electorate that count, not the actions of the few who might try to override them.\n\nAnd this year, after the chaos dies down, Kamala Harris will make history as she raises her right hand to become the first woman to take the vice presidential oath of office. Her African American and Asian American roots are empowering groups whose voices (especially in political circles) are often overlooked.\n\nHarris' victory is not only a win for women — of all colors, nationalities and party affiliations — but, as political strategist Donna Brazile states below, it's also a win for American democracy.\n\nSeveral women have started a Facebook group encouraging others, no matter their politics, to wear pearls on Inauguration Day. The call was made not to uplift a particular party, but to uplift the power of women. And photos of famous women throughout history who have proudly donned pearls of all shapes, sizes and colors quickly filled the page: Harris, Barbara Bush, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Diana, even Wilma Flintstone.\n\nThe group has amassed more than 411,000 members and counting. Many plan to wear necklaces, earrings and rings passed down from their mothers and grandmothers or, in some cases, newly purchased for the day (full disclosure: I am one of them, and will be rocking my pearls and my Chucks in honor of Harris).\n\nWe invited female authors, newsmakers, activists, politicians and pundits to tell us what Harris' election means to them. Read their collection of essays below.\n\n(Want to join the discussion? Tell us: What does the election of the nation's first woman to the second highest office in the free world mean to you?

In 2010, no states outlawed conversion therapy for LGBTQ minors, banned health insurers from excluding transgender-related coverage or offered gender neutral options on licenses and birth certificates.\n\nTen years later at the dawn of a new decade, roughly 20 states have these protections in place.\n\nBreakthroughs? Or evidence of a plodding pace on the road to LGBTQ equality?\n\nIt's both, said Ineke Mushovic, executive director of the Movement Advancement Project, which released a report Tuesday on the status of LGBTQ rights from 2010 to 2020.\n\nWe have made a tremendous amount of progress understanding what LGBTQ people need to have a full opportunity to be productive workers, have equal access to health care, to go beyond the basics, she said. But at the same time, in half the country, that progress has stalled out.\n\nThe report by MAP, a think tank that maintains a database on laws affecting LGBTQ people, shows a split in the policy landscape in 2020: Nearly half – 46% – of the country lives in states earning high or medium grades for equality because of protections. But the other half – 45% – lives in states with low or negative rankings.\n\nAdvocates hope rulings in three pivotal Supreme Court cases this year on whether it's legal to fire workers because of sexual orientation or gender identity will cement a precedent for LGBTQ rights. They also will continue to press for passage of the Equality Act, which would make nondiscrimination a federal guarantee.\n\n'We are not drag queens': For transgender people in 2019, a conflicted reality\n\nBut for now, LGBTQ people are at the mercy of a patchwork of state protections. You could live in one state and move across the border and core pieces of your life could be in jeopardy, said Naomi Goldberg, MAP policy research director.\n\nThe report, which tracks nearly 40 LGBTQ-related policies and laws in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the five U.S. territories, does show significant strides:\n\n• In 2010, 48% of LGBTQ people lived in negative policy states. By 2020, that number dropped to 20%.\n\n• The number of people living in medium or high equality states increased dramatically from 6% in 2010 to nearly half, 46%, in 2020.\n\n• In 2010, only 12 states and the district explicitly prohibited discrimination against LGBTQ people in employment, housing and public accommodations. By 2020, that number jumped to 21.\n\n• In 2010, just five states and the district banned health care discrimination against LGBTQ people. In 2020, that number more than doubled to 13 states and the district.\n\nTreating trans youth a crime? National firestorm on horizon as states consider criminalizing transgender treatments for youths\n\nSame-sex marriage ruling signals progress – then backlash\n\nA landmark Supreme Court ruling sanctioning same-sex marriage in 2015 capped an evolution taking place in state legislatures and federal courts on LGTBQ relationships in the first half of the decade. In 2010, only 14 states and the district had some form of relationship recognition for same-sex couples. By 2020, marriage was the law of the land and included access to marriage-related parenting protections.\n\nBans on conversion therapy – a discredited practice of trying to change a young person's sexual orientation or gender identity – began to take root.\n\nBut midway through the decade, backlashes also started to sprout. Some targeted transgender people's rights. Many took the form of religious exemption laws that let people, churches and sometimes businesses cite religious beliefs as a reason not to enforce a law, such as declining to marry a same-sex couple or letting state-funded foster agencies refuse to place kids with LGBTQ parents.\n\nWhen we saw progress in marriage a decade ago, LGBTQ opponents realized that fight was over. All the rights and benefits that came along with marriage were solidified, Goldberg said. But it was a strategic move on (opponents') part. Yes, you can go get married, but when you show up to get that license, we can say no – you have to go somewhere else.\n\n'Shocking' numbers: Half of LGBTQ adults live in states where no laws ban job discrimination\n\nIn 2010, only one state had a religious exemption law. Now 13 states have those laws.\n\nAnd more harmful bills are percolating. In 2020, MAP's database shows at least 121 anti-LGBTQ pieces of legislation in the mix in various states. Transgender young people take a particularly hard-hit: Fourteen states are weighing bills excluding transgender students from sports, and 11 have floated legislation that bans medical care for transgender minors, some even making treatment a crime.\n\nAnd at least 14 states have three or more anti-LGBTQ bills on the docket.\n\nLocal laws help notch progress in Florida\n\nNadine Smith lives in Florida, where Anita Bryant put us on the map in the worst possible way in the 1970s with her anti-gay crusades.\n\nBut Smith, the CEO and co-founder of civil rights group Equality Florida, has seen a slow transformation in the state in recent years, mainly because cities and counties have moved the marker – much more so than the Legislature.\n\nIn 2010, Florida was ranked a negative equality state by MAP. Ten years later, it's a low equality state. The people of Florida are absolutely moving in the correct direction, Smith said. The majority of people are living in places where localities have passed nondiscrimination ordinances on sexual orientation and gender identity. Localities are showing leadership where the state has failed.\n\nAs LGBTQ people become more visible, attitudes shift and inspire change, Smith said. People meet janitors, firefighters, accountants all living a life for themselves. Being out in everyday situations matters a great deal.\n\nLife in rural America:Nearly 4 million LGBTQ people live in rural America, and 'everything is not bias and awful'\n\nBut the number of detrimental bills being weighed in the coming year in Florida – including one horrific piece of legislation that threatens doctors with up to 15 years of prison time for providing medical care to trans youths – loom large, she said. To introduce legislation that would erode local policies in existence for more than a decade ... it's clear we are collateral damage.\n\nYet, Smith remains determined and optimistic. When she was growing up in the Panhandle, she had to trick a classmate into checking out a book that had gay themes from the library. Now her former high school has a gay alliance and there are anti-bullying policies.\n\nProgress is a jagged line. There's backlash, but sometimes it's like a rubber band. And we emerge from that backlash, growing much further.\n\nIn Colorado, bipartisan boost leads to inroads on equality\n\nDaniel Ramos, executive director of One Colorado, has seen his state rocket up the road on equality in the 10 years since the LGBTQ advocacy group was founded. In 2010, MAP ranked the state fair; now it is a high equality state.\n\nOne Colorado focuses on amplifying LGBTQ voices in all parts of the state in an effort to educate and engage, he said. One of the most powerful lessons we learned is the impact of sharing our own experiences by coming out. It's harder to hate someone you know or you love.\n\nThe state is home to some high-profile groups that oppose LGBTQ rights, yet Colorado has notched many advancements, such as a conversion therapy ban and accurate ID documentation, notably through bipartisan efforts, Ramos said. In 2018, Coloradoans elected their first openly transgender legislator and the country's first openly male gay governor.\n\nThe challenge has been that issues are hyperpoliticized, Ramos said. But for youths to experience less bullying should be a nonpartisan issue, for folks to access health care should be a nonpartisan issue.\n\nRamos, who grew up in the rural town of Sterling, recalls coming out at age 13. It was one year after college student Matthew Shepard's slaying in 1998, a gruesome incident that cast an unnerving spotlight on hate crimes against LGBTQ people.\n\nWhen I think of my upbringing to where we are today in one of the most LGBTQ-friendly states in the country, it's very exciting, he said. We have been able to leverage the spirit of Colorado to come together to get things done – whether Democrat or Republican, with conservatives and with faith communities.\n\nFallout from transgender slayings:What happens after a transgender woman is murdered? For family and friends, a long and agonizing search for closure
Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West are calling it quits.\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, 40, has filed for divorce from the Jesus is King musician, 43, following almost seven years of marriage, Kardashian West's rep Christy Welder confirms to USA TODAY.\n\nThe Associated Press reports Kardashian West filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court. The filing was not immediately available.\n\nAccording to TMZ, which broke the news, Kardashian West is asking for joint legal and physical custody of the couple's four children: daughter North, 7, son Saint, 5, daughter Chicago, 3, and son Psalm, who turns 2 in May.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to West's reps for comment.\n\nKardashian West and West tied the knot in an over-the-top Italian ceremony in May 2014 after getting engaged on Kardashian's 33rd birthday in October 2013. Both events were captured on the long-running reality series Keeping Up with the Kardashians, which is set to air its final season in March.\n\nThis will mark Kardashian West's third divorce. She was previously married to music producer Damon Thomas (2000-2003) and NBA player Kris Humphries (2011- 2013), from whom she famously filed for divorce after only 72 days of marriage.\n\n'Heavy hearts': 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' will end in 2021 after 14 years\n\nKanye West jokes about Kim Kardashian's ex Kris Humphries, says he got a $68M tax refund\n\nThe split of Hollywood's power couple comes on the heels of a rocky 2020.\n\nWest was diagnosed with COVID-19 mid-March at the onset of the pandemic. Kardashian West opened up about the daunting task of caring for her ailing husband in October.\n\nKanye had it way at the beginning, when nobody really knew what was going on, Kardashian West said during her GRAZIA cover story interview. It was so scary and unknown. I had my four babies and no one else in the house to help.\n\nCOVID-19 and vaccine: Here's what Kim Kardashian West, Tom Hanks are saying\n\nIn July, West announced he was running for president, a political campaign that failed to gain much traction after a rocky start and an unhinged campaign rally in South Carolina.\n\nWest elicited concerns about his mental health during the political rally as he shouted without a microphone, cried and offered deeply personal statements about his family, including a revelation that the couple considered terminating their first pregnancy. He tearfully said Kardashian West fought to keep the unborn child, and gave birth to daughter North in 2013.\n\nSo even if my wife were to divorce me after this speech, she brought North into the world, even when I didn't want to, West said on July 19. She stood up, and she protected that child.\n\nWest went on to send a barrage of worrisome tweets days after his presidential campaign rally, including a now-deleted tweet from July 22 that read, I been trying to get divorced since Kim met with Meek at the Warldolf (sic) for 'prison reform.' \n\nDuring his tweet storm, West also suggested that he was resisting intervention efforts by Kardashian West, his mother-in-law Kris Jenner and medical professionals. He accused the Kardashian family of trying to lock me up.\n\nIn September of last year, West returned to Twitter to equate his record contract with Sony and Universal to modern day slave ships and declared that he wouldn't release any new music until he's released from his contract. He went on to release a 5-song classical project, Emmanuel, on Christmas Day.\n\nJennifer Anistonendorses Joe Biden, says it's 'not funny to vote for Kanye'\n\nKanye West campaign rally:Claims Harriet Tubman never 'freed the slaves,' tearfully discusses abortion\n\nIn late July, Kardashian West spoke on the importance of caring for those with mental illnesses amid West's public struggle with bipolar disorder.\n\nI understand Kanye is subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions, Kardashian West wrote in a lengthy Instagram statement on July 22. He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder. Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words some times do not align with his intentions.\n\nWest was hospitalized in November 2016 for a psychiatric emergency after police were called to his house by his personal doctor. The remaining dates on his Saint Pablo tour were canceled.\n\nThe rapper opened up about his mental health struggles and being placed in involuntary psychiatric hold during a 2019 interview with David Letterman. Saying he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder two years earlier, West explained what it was like to have a manic episode.\n\nYou feel everyone wants to kill you, you pretty much don't trust anyone, and they have this moment where they handcuff you, they drug you, they put you on the bed, and they separate you from everyone you know, he said.\n\nIn December, West notably wasn't pictured when Kardashian West celebrated Christmas with the couple's children and her famous family.\n\nOpinion: Take Kanye West's illness more seriously than his presidential ambitions\n\nDespite trials and tribulations, the couple appeared to have happier times.\n\nIn June, West congratulated Kardashian West after she sold a stake in her beauty brand to Coty for $200 million.\n\nI am so proud of my beautiful wife Kim Kardashian West for officially becoming a billionaire, West tweeted on June 29. You've weathered the craziest storms and now God is shining on you and our family.\n\nIs Kim Kardashian West a billionaire?Kanye congratulates his wife after beauty brand sale\n\nIn October, West gifted Kardashian West a special hologram of her father, the late Robert Kardashian, for her 40th birthday, which the reality star spent on a private island with family and friends.\n\nFor my birthday, Kanye got me the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime, she tweeted on Oct. 29. A special surprise from heaven. A hologram of my dad. It is so lifelike! We watched it over and over, filled with emotion.\n\nNot immune to her own bad press, Kardashian West faced negative feedback from fans who felt that sharing photos from her birthday jaunt during a pandemic was in bad taste.\n\nThat didn't stop Kardashian West from enjoying a girls trip to the Turks and Caicos Islands in late January with her daughters and sisters Kourtney Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner.\n\nDuring the trip, Kardashian West caused a stir after sharing a steamy photo wearing a bikini and a pair of Adidas Yeezy Foam Runners from West's clothing brand.\n\nJust Chillin, she captioned the Instagram snapshot, shared on Feb. 1.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Hollywood divorce lawyer Laura Wasser, who is reported to be Kardashian's lawyer, and also represented her during her divorce from Humphries, for comment.\n\n'It was such a nice thing': Khloe Kardashian defends Kim Kardashian's birthday trip\n\nIn legal circles, Wasser is almost as famous as some of her celebrity clients, which include Kardashian West's mother, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp.\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander, Hannah Yasharoff; The Associated Press
Robert Powell\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nPlanning on getting remarried? You're not alone.\n\nConsider: In 2013, four in 10 new marriages included at least one partner who had been married before, and two in 10 new marriages were between people who had both previously stepped down the aisle, according to a Pew Research Center study.\n\nUnfortunately, most people who get remarried have no clue about the legal and estate-planning issues that come with a new marriage, according to a new article by Jeff Scroggin, an attorney with Scroggin & Company in Roswell, Ga. They do little planning, and ultimately that just increases the conflict and chaos that often occurs down the road ... when death us do part, according to Scroggin.\n\nMost people do not understand that marriage automatically gives significant rights to the new spouse and have never heard of spousal elective shares or homestead rights or contemplated the impact of their remarriage when they pass away, says Scroggin.\n\nFor example, Scroggin says some of the rights that a spouse automatically gains upon marriage may include (depending on the state):\n\nA right to be the guardian for the other spouse\n\nThe right to be the personal representative of a deceased spouse\n\nA right to an elective share percentage of the other spouse's estate — generally ranging from 30% to 50% of the estate\n\nA right to a homestead dollar amount or the ownership or use of the house\n\nA right to personal property of the deceased spouse, including heirloom assets\n\nAn automatic right to be a beneficiary of the deceased spouse's ERISA accounts\n\nA right to be supported under state filial support laws\n\nPut this on your bucket list: Make a will\n\nThe reality is consumers just don't like dealing with personal legal planning, whether it is a prenuptial agreement, estate plan or anything else, said Martin Shenkman, an attorney in Paramus, N.J., and co-author of The Tools & Techniques of Estate Planning. I think the displeasure of the process, and secondly the cost, is what detracts most people from doing what they should.\n\nSo, if you plan on getting remarried, or already have, here's what you should do.\n\nConsult an expert. People considering a remarriage should meet with competent counsel to understand what their rights are and how to limit those rights and powers, says Scroggin.\n\nGet a prenup. Yes, it can be advisable, particularly if they have a home or business they want to pass to their descendants from a prior relationship, or the intent is that each spouse will retain the right to pass on their personal investments and property to their respective descendants, says Scroggin. Merely having an understanding or oral agreement is not a legally binding obligation — properly signed waivers are critical.\n\nA prenup is worth getting even if you're not rich. Some might feel that their assets are not worth bothering, but they may be, says Shenkman. The savings in angst, legal fees and so forth ... can be a huge benefit at almost any wealth level.\n\nIf a new spouse dies absent a prenuptial agreement, the surviving spouse will get to inherit what state law permits, called a spousal right of election. So the mere fact that the deceased spouse leaves assets to children from a prior marriage won't suffice without a waiver of the spousal right of election, which is often done in conjunction with a prenuptial agreement, says Shenkman.\n\nWidow/widower financial preparedness 101: 5 things to do right now\n\nGet your fair share. There are at least two ways that a surviving spouse can get an intestate share of a deceased spouse's estate, according to Scroggin.\n\nIf a married person dies without a will, then the surviving spouse is entitled to a share of the estate, generally limited to the intestate estate. If the decedent leaves no descendants, the surviving spouse will normally receive 100% of the intestate estate. In some states, the surviving spouse receives at least a minimum dollar amount or minimum percentage of the intestate estate even if there are surviving descendants or parents.\n\nAnd two, in most states, if the will existed before a marriage and was not made in contemplation of the marriage, the new spouse is entitled to an intestate share of the estate.\n\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

Oscar night is finally upon us.\n\nIn the shortened awards season, the most glamorous night in movies arrives this weekend: the 92nd Academy Awards.\n\nThe show is all about the big films. Director Todd Phillips' Joker surprised pundits by taking the runaway lead in nominations – 11, including best picture, best director and best actor for Joaquin Phoenix. It could be a big night for Phoenix, who appears destined to take the best actor trophy; Brad Pitt, who seems like a lock for best supporting actor in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood; Renee Zellweger, who is poised to take best actress for her role in Judy; and Laura Dern, who has swept awards season as best supporting actress in Marriage Story.\n\nSunday night's telecast will reveal their fate. We'll handle the Academy Awards questions that have definitive answers now.\n\nOscar predictions:Who will win Academy Awards – and who should\n\nWhich film deserves best picture? We passionately defend all nine Oscar contenders\n\nHow and when can I watch the show?\n\nThe Oscars will be broadcast on ABC (8 p.m. EST/5 PST) and are viewable on the ABC app. Cord cutters be warned, the app will not let you play unless you can authenticate your cable or satellite service. There are other viewing options.\n\nWhere can I check out the red carpet?\n\nRed carpet coverage begins at 6:30 p.m. EST/3:30 PST on ABC. This livestream can be viewed for free on Twitter via @TheAcademy. E! gets the party started with a red carpet pre-show at 1 p.m. EST/10 a.m. PST. At 5 p.m. EST/2 PST, hosts Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic begin the celebrity interviews for E! Live From the Red Carpet.\n\nWho is the host this year?\n\nNobody. Last year, the Oscars tried the no-host experiment: Queen opened the show with Adam Lambert on vocals, and Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph brilliantly cracked jokes, while insisting to the global audience that they were not hosting. The Academy liked the no-pressure results and decreed no need for an official host for the second year in a row.\n\nWho's performing (and why Billie Eilish)?\n\nAs if dominating Grammy night with five awards wasn't enough, the Academy confirmed Billie Eilish will perform Oscar night, even though she doesn't have a contending song. Ditto for Janelle Monáe.\n\nBest song nominees will perform their songs as well, including Harriet star Cynthia Erivo singing Stand Up, Elton John singing (I'm Gonna) Love Me Again (from Rocketman), Idina Menzel going Into the Unknown (Frozen II), Chrissy Metz singing I'm Standing With You (Breakthrough) and Randy Newman performing I Can't Let You Throw Yourself Away (Toy Story 4).\n\nQuestlove will appear, and history will be made when Eímear Noone guest-conducts the orchestra, the first woman to do so during an Oscars telecast.\n\nWho will present awards?\n\nFolks looking for their favorite stars to stand at the podium will see, among others, Mahershala Ali, Chadwick Boseman, Jennifer Garner, Greta Gerwig, Tiffany Haddish, Tom Holland, Margot Robbie, Emma Stone, Steve Martin, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Sandra Oh, Keanu Reeves, Chris Rock, Ray Romano, Kelly Marie Tran and Rebel Wilson.\n\nHas the Oscars gone meatless?\n\nAwards shows have moved toward plant-based menus in 2020, starting with this year's Golden Globes. The Oscars are a different beast since they are set in an auditorium. But the food at the pre-show will be vegan. The official after-party, the Governors Ball, hosted by Wolfgang Puck, will lean heavily toward vegetarian dishes. Signature meat dishes, such as spicy tuna tartare and chicken pot pie (Barbra Streisand's favorite), will continue to be served.
Sarah McLellan\n\nazcentral sports\n\nThe Coyotes faded to a footnote in the standings before the calendar flipped to 2017, but it's possible they morph into one of the more intriguing teams in the NHL in the coming weeks as the March 1 trade deadline inches closer.\n\nAs one of only two clubs drastically behind the playoff pace – the Avalanche are the other – the Coyotes could become sellers and have already identified what their deadline strategy will be.\n\nWe've had some good discussions on a number of different fronts to try to improve our group, General Manager John Chayka said. We're looking at a number of different things. Obviously with the position we're at, we're looking to accrue future assets. But we're also looking at a few good opportunities to just strengthen the group (and) build for the future.\n\nWhether the team is active or idle remains to be seen, but it does have plenty of possibilities to mull.\n\nCOYOTES XTRA APP: iTunes | Android\n\nMartin Hanzal\n\nAge: 29.\n\nPosition: Center.\n\nContract: In the final season of a five-year, $15.5 million deal that includes a modified no-trade clause. Poised to become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nThis season: 10 goals and 19 points through 43 games.\n\nWhy he could go: A 6-foot-6, two-way center, Hanzal is likely the Coyotes' most appealing asset. He could add some depth up the middle on a second or third line as a faceoff specialist and penalty killer. Hanzal also has a knack for deflections when he uses his frame to screen opposing goalies, no doubt a helpful skill when time and space seem to shrink in the postseason. He's got that big body that people like in the playoffs, one league source said. Although Hanzal's camp and the Coyotes have an understanding of where each stands, Chayka said, there hasn't been much talk between the two sides.\n\nWhy he could stay: Teams may be cautious to pursue Hanzal because of his injury history. He has been mostly healthy this season but has yet to log a complete season with his back giving him trouble before he had surgery on it in 2015. It's unclear if the Coyotes' asking price could be met; a package that revolves around a first-rounder may be tough to receive for a perceived rental. There could also be a case made for retaining Hanzal and trying to negotiate an extension to avoid a gaping hole at the top of their depth chart. The team has learned firsthand this season the value of experienced centers and how there's no set timeline for when a young player will be ready for the NHL. Keeping Hanzal would ensure the Coyotes have support in place while their youth matures.\n\nRELATED: Doan, Fitzgearld share mutual respect\n\nMichael Stone\n\nAge: 26.\n\nPosition: Defense.\n\nContract: In the midst of a one-year, $4 million deal. Poised to become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nThis season: One goal and nine points through 39 games.\n\nWhy he could go: Right-shot defensemen are frequently coveted, and Stone could add depth to an established blue line. He can man the point on a power play with a booming shot, and he can also be physical in his own end. Stone may also not be a rental, as one source pointed out, since a team may eye him as a potential fixture for its back end. If you're a team out there that likes what he has, his elements, he might be a guy that fits into your bottom pair right now and maybe one day has the ability to fit into a top-four role, the source said.\n\nWhy he could stay: The Coyotes do have some right-shot options in the minors such as Anthony DeAngelo and Kyle Wood, but forecasting when they'll be qualified for full-time NHL duty isn't easy. Having Stone play out this season and potentially re-upping would give the Coyotes stability on that side while their up-and-comers continue to develop.\n\nMORE: Doan not ruling out trade possibility\n\nShane Doan\n\nAge: 40.\n\nPosition: Right wing.\n\nContract: In the midst of a one-year, bonus-laden contract that essentially amounts to $5 million. Poised to become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nThis season: Five goals and 17 points through 51 games.\n\nWhy he could go: Doan is equipped with a no-movement clause but hasn't ruled out the possibility he waives it to potentially go to a contender – an option that Chayka is open-minded to listening to if Doan approaches him. The Coyotes captain tends to be a steady second-half performer and has a reputation of being productive around the net as a strong body. His most attractive quality may be his leadership. You can't underestimate the intangibles when you're looking to add a piece to your puzzle to make a run, one source said.\n\nBICKLEY: Doan, Coyotes must keep marriage intact\n\nWhy he could stay: Leaving the Coyotes after 21 seasons would require the perfect setup in Doan's eyes – joining the team that will win the Stanley Cup – and that's tough to predict. It's also unclear if a bonafide contender would have a need for Doan. Whether Doan would draw interest if he waived his trade clause elicited mixed responses from multiple league sources. While some anticipated there would be intrigue, others wondered if there would be a fit for him – especially since a team poised for a lengthy playoff run probably already has a complete roster. What also shouldn't be overlooked is how much Doan values the fact he's spent his entire career with one franchise – a distinction that could sway him to stay put before making a decision on his playing future in the offseason.\n\nRadim Vrbata\n\nAge: 35.\n\nPosition: Right wing.\n\nContract: In the midst of a one-year, bonus-laden deal that could amount to more than $3 million. Poised to become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nThis season: 11 goals and 35 points through 51 games.\n\nWhy he could go: A team looking for secondary scoring on the wings could view Vrbata as a solution. His skill has shined through this season, during 5-on-5 and the power play, and his smarts have helped him rediscover a productive rhythm after a down season a year ago with the Canucks.\n\nWhy he could stay: Some sources questioned if Vrbata would be able to contribute during a playoff run since his numbers from previous postseasons haven't sparkled. Vrbata would prefer to finish out the season with the Coyotes, and the two sides have already discussed what a new contract could look like. We have so many young guys so if they want to keep one older guy who they know what they're going to get, that would be something that I would be interested in for sure, Vrbata said.\n\nMORE: Mike Smith steady in 1st game with new gear\n\nRyan White\n\nAge: 28.\n\nPosition: Right wing/center.\n\nContract: In the midst of a one-year, $1 million deal. Poised to become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nThis season: Five goals and nine points through 37 games.\n\nWhy he could go: A fourth-line sparkplug who's tenacious on the forecheck could be on some playoff-bound teams' wish list if they're hoping for more depth. White's also had a nose for the net lately, scoring three of his five goals in the past five games. His grit and his level of compete is off the charts, one source said.\n\nWhy he could stay: Some sources wondered if White would fall too far down the depth chart; although work ethic is important, perhaps the emphasis on speed and skill filters all the way down to potential fourth-line additions. White has also filled a valuable niche for the Coyotes, providing emotion and energy on and off the ice. He'd love to stay with the team beyond this season and has enjoyed watching the team improve. It'd kind of be bittersweet to get moved because we're starting to kind of turn the corner a bit and starting to play some good hockey and it's fun to be a part of, he said. At the same time, it's business and I understand that if I do get the opportunity to play in the playoffs, I'll welcome it, too.\n\nBICKLEY: Valley sports entering tenuous time\n\nAnthony Duclair\n\nAge: 21.\n\nPosition: Right wing.\n\nContract: In the final season of a three-year, entry-level contract. Poised to become a restricted free agent.\n\nThis season: Three goals and nine points through 41 games with the Coyotes before getting assigned to the minors where Duclair has a goal and three assists in seven games.\n\nWhy he could go: Despite suffering a setback in his second year, Duclair isn't too far removed from an impressive rookie showing. His potential to be a consistent scorer in the NHL is a trait that could certainly pique the attention of teams looking to acquire more pizzazz for their lineup. Very few players score 20 goals their rookie season, and all of a sudden lose their skill, one source said. Multiple sources believed he'd merit consideration, not necessarily by a team making a playoff push this season but perhaps for one looking to beef up its forward group for the future.\n\nWhy he could stay: Parting with a player of Duclair's stature would appear to carry a hefty price tag, and his value in the marketplace only seems to wane while he's in the minors. It's possible a deal never gets consummated because it doesn't meet the Coyotes' ask. Arizona is set to control his rights beyond this season and could choose to keep Duclair in the mix amid the hope his stint in the American Hockey League helps him rediscover his scoring touch.\n\nReach the reporter at sarah.mclellan@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8276.

Defenseman Alex Goligoski returned to practice after missing Monday's session due to illness and is fine to play, Tippett said.\n\nCanadiens update: The Canadiens are atop the Atlantic Division with 30 wins and 68 points. This is the final stop in a two-game road trip that started with a 4-0 loss to the Avalanche Tuesday – the team's fourth straight defeat. Montreal hasn't won since it edged Buffalo 5-2 Jan. 31. Since then, the Canadiens have scored only three goals. Captain Max Pacioretty leads the team in goals (25) and points (44). He's a goal shy of 200 for his career. Goalie Carey Price is 23-13-5 with a .920 save percentage and 2.39 goals-against average. He's given up a combined nine goals over his last three games. Montreal is 12-11-4 on the road this season.
Kelly Rowland as Gladys Knight? Michelle Williams as Diana Ross? K. Michelle as Martha Reeves?\n\nSeeing contemporary singers portray classic Motown stars is one of the pleasures of American Soul, the BET drama that's set in 1971 and tells the origin story of Soul Train.\n\nThe series, due Tuesday (9 EST/PST) stars Sinqua Walls from the Starz hit Power as Don Cornelius, the producer behind the landmark syndicated dance show that featured African-American artists and dancers and left a deep imprint on popular culture.\n\nThe saga of Cornelius and musical numbers are interwoven with subplots driven by fictional characters, including a talented but underappreciated Soul Train staffer and three teenagers striving for their big break in show business.\n\nIt's a mash-up of story elements that somehow works. Here's why.\n\nThe blend of styles: If Empire married This Is Us and invited Nashville and the movie Sparkle to the wedding, the result would be American Soul. The action begins in 1971 as Cornelius is struggling to turn his local Chicago dance show into a nationally syndicated program. The systemic racism that Soul Train encounters in the TV industry is covered, as are the interfering tactics of record labels and the strain that's put on the Cornelius marriage — and that's just the first two episodes. Toss in stories tied to the supporting cast and you've got what might be TV's first historical drama/biopic/evening soap/musical.\n\nThe legendary star power: It will be a kick to see Destiny's Child alums Rowland and Williams and Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta vet Michelle play Motown superstars. The season also will feature Bobby Brown as Stax Records singer Rufus Thomas. In the two episodes available to critics, Rowland gives an assured performance as Gladys Knight, a rising star who yearns to have full artistic control of her career. Plus, she gets to sing Knight's signature hit Midnight Train to Georgia.\n\nThe man behind the music: In real life, Cornelius was a complicated figure whose final years were troubled. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2012. But the series presents him in his prime as an entrepreneur who juggles questionable tactics (like using paid escorts to woo a reluctant white businessman) with a strong sense of social justice. As Cornelius (played superbly by Walls) tells Knight in the premiere episode, his vision of Soul Train is of black folks the way black folks were meant to be seen: strong, powerful and beautiful.\n\nThe fictional characters: Aside from Cornelius, American Soul is populated with made-up characters whose lives touch on subplots involving the Vietnam War, single parenthood, a police shooting, drug addiction and gender equality. Among the standouts? Iantha Richardson of This Is Us as Tessa, the Soul Train dance coordinator who's frustrated at being treated more like a secretary, and nine-time Grammy nominee Kelly Price as a tough-love mom.\n\nThe trip back to the 1970s: The clothes, the music, the pop-culture references: American Soul brings the me decade back to life. In one scene, Cornelius is at a screening room where a sitcom with an African-American cast called Sanford and Son is being previewed for some bigwigs (and he's none too happy that it's set in a junkyard). Special kudos to the costume designer for not just getting the synthetic pastel suits and slinky evening gowns right, but for putting the high school-age characters of aspiring entertainers played by Katlyn Nichol, Jelani Winston and Christopher Jefferson in essential '70s separates. So where can we find those retro-groovy sweater vests?
From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Months of headaches for daily commuters, long-haul drivers and downtown businesses have come to an end with the reopening of Interstate 59/20 through the city. Workers have virtually completed finishing touches like yellow striping and installing signs on a mile-long section of the highway that was demolished and rebuilt after the old road was shut down about a year ago. The project forced east-west traffic to take alternate routes through Birmingham. Officials opened the westbound lanes Friday night after a ribbon-cutting ceremony, and both sides were open by Sunday night. The land beneath the elevated road will be used for community spaces including parks and food truck parking in what planners hope will be a way to tie together the north and south sides of the city, where a new outdoor football stadium is being built near I-59/20.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A dentist who gained notoriety after he was seen in a video riding a hoverboard and pulling teeth was convicted Friday of defrauding the Alaska Medicaid program. Seth Lookhart was convicted of 46 counts, including felony medical assistance fraud and scheming to defraud, as well as misdemeanor counts of illegally practicing dentistry and reckless endangerment, prosecutors said. The conviction followed a five-week bench trial before Anchorage Superior Court Judge Michael Wolverton, who said in a written finding that he found the state's evidence simply overwhelming. He also said Lookhart's own text conversations were persuasive. Friends had asked Lookhart how he got away with some of his practices. Dr. Lookhart responded, in effect, that unless someone was standing right next to him at the time, no one would ever know, Wolverton wrote.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state's budding hemp-growing industry is suffering growing pains as levels of THC that are too high force some farmers to destroy crops instead of harvesting them. About 41% of hemp plants tested for THC, the compound that gives marijuana its high, have failed, according to the Arizona Department of Agriculture's Plant Services Division, which oversees the program. Growers in other states around the country have had issues managing the THC content of hemp plants, but none as much as in Arizona's early months. The state began issuing hemp-growing licenses to farmers in 2019, and harvesting started later that year. At 40%, that's off the charts, Sully Sullivan, executive director of the Hemp Industry Trade Association of Arizona, said of the state's THC findings. I'm taken aback by that. That's substantial.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: Prison officials said Sunday that a state prison inmate has died after being found hanging in his cell. The state Department of Correction said in a news release that David Shabazz, 53, was found by guards about 6:30 p.m. Saturday in his one-man cell, hanging from a bed sheet that was wrapped around the cell's bars. The department said Shabazz was taken to a Pine Bluff hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly before 7:30 p.m. The department said Shabazz was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2002 following a drug-related conviction in Miller County and was later paroled but was back in custody for being a parole absconder. Shabazz's body was sent to the state medical examiner to determine the cause of death, and the death is also being investigated by Arkansas State Police.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The San Francisco Zoo is holding an online contest to name its newest koala, and it's pledging to donate the proceeds to save wildlife affected by Australia's deadly wildfires. The San Francisco Chronicle reports the 2-year-old male arrived from the Los Angeles Zoo, where he was known as Flin. He gets to assume a new identity in his new home, however, following the San Francisco Zoo's fundraising tradition of allowing donors to name new arrivals. The winner of the name-the-koala contest will be selected next month, and proceeds will be sent to an emergency wildlife fund organized by Australia's Zoos Victoria. Australia's unprecedented wildfires season has so far charred more than 40,000 square miles of brushland, rainforests and national parks – killing by one estimate more than a billion wild animals.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A proposal to rewrite the state's rules for workplace harassment claims is expected to be introduced soon at the Capitol. It would change things for employers by limiting the use of confidentiality agreements in court and would potentially make businesses liable even if a person doesn't come forward internally before filing a lawsuit. The bill would also change things for employees by allowing independent contractors, subcontractors and unpaid interns to file harassment claims, Colorado Public Radio reports. All employees would be given two years to file a complaint, up from six months now. With the gig economy that we have these days, more and more people don't have regular jobs in the traditional sense, said one of the bill's main sponsors, Rep. Susan Lontine, D-Denver. And so they don't have any way to address when they've been harmed by harassment.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: More than $56 million has been raised to build a Coast Guard museum. The Day newspaper reports the National Coast Guard Museum Association has secured $15 million in federal funds, $21 million in private donations and $20 million through state borrowing for the downtown New London waterfront project. Wes Pulver, the museum association's president and a retired Coast Guard captain, says the current fundraising tally is a significant accomplishment. The newspaper says the museum to tell the story of the Coast Guard is projected to cost at least $100 million. Construction was supposed to start early this year but has been pushed back toward the end of 2020, The Day reports. The 80,000-square-foot, five-story, partially glass building is expected to take four years to build.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Long-proposed plans to outfit police in the state's largest city with body cameras may now hinge on negotiations with the police union later this year. The union that represents Wilmington officers has told the mayor's administration any disciplinary procedures or consequences stemming from a body camera program would constitute a condition of employment that must be negotiated before officers begin wearing them. The union's labor contract with the city expires June 30. The parties have not yet begun negotiations. Proposals to outfit officers with body cameras have been discussed since 2015. Activists have renewed the call for them in the aftermath of two police shootings last year. The number of municipalities across the country using body cameras has grown significantly following high-profile police shootings of unarmed black men.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Amtrak has apologized to civil rights attorney Sherrilyn Ifill after she said she was asked to give up her seat on a train at the start of Martin Luther King Jr. weekend. Ifill described the incident – which sparked outrage from observers who drew comparisons of the indignities black civil rights icons faced – in a series of tweets over the weekend. I'm being asked to leave my seat on train 80 which I just boarded in D.C. There are no assigned seats on this train. The conductor has asked me to leave my seat because she has 'other people coming who she wants to give this seat.' Can you please explain? she tweeted late Friday afternoon to some 166,000 followers. The internationally known attorney, scholar and activist wrote in another tweet: is it 1950? Jason Abrams, an Amtrak spokesman, told The Baltimore Sun the company apologized for the incident and its slow response.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State lawmakers are transmitting a news bulletin: The telegraph era is over. Before there was instant messaging, emails or even corded telephones, there was the reliable telegraph to instantaneously transmit messages far and wide. Now, people turn to the internet, text messaging, Twitter, gifs and emojis to write their long-distance notes. While thumbing through a volume of Florida laws, state Rep. Tommy Gregory and a colleague came upon old statutes regulating the telegraph industry. I wondered if they were now obsolete, said Gregory, a former lieutenant colonel in the Air Force who has moved to rip the laws out of the state's books. A state House committee on Wednesday agreed unanimously to repeal Chapter 363 of the Florida Statute in its entirety. One lawmaker cheekily registered his vote by using his fingers to tap into the dais as if using Morse code.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A state agency says dozens of counties statewide will share $166,000 in grant money to buy child car seats. The Georgia Department of Public Health said in a news release that car seats will be distributed among 107 counties using money awarded from the Child Passenger Safety Mini Grant program. Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for children, and it's up to all of us to do everything we can to protect our children on the road, Public Health Commissioner Kathleen Toomey said. Buckling up our children is the best way to save lives and reduce injuries. Funding for the safety grants comes from the Governor's Office of Highway Safety. The grants also support community programs that teach parents and caregivers how to properly inspect, install and use child car seats.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Tax collections in the state were up by about 5% last year, a report says. The state Department of Taxation sent the annual report in December to Democratic Gov. David Ige and the Legislature, Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The report showed $8.2 billion was collected in fiscal year 2019, which ended June 30, compared to $7.9 billion collected the year prior. Revenue from the general excise tax and income tax accounted for most of the increase, department officials said. Hawaii County received $10.2 million from its general excise tax of 0.25% but is expected to increase its take after the tax went up to the maximum 0.5% at the start of the new year, the report says.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Boise Fry Co. is adding crickets to the selection of seasoning-salt mixtures it offers customers to sprinkle on their french fries. The locally owned restaurant chain debuted four new salt blends last week that include pulverized crickets at its three locations in Boise and one each in Meridian and Nampa, the Idaho Statesman reports. The response has been overwhelming, with reactions mostly positive, though some people are a little skittish, CEO Brad Walker says. Some have been 'this is icky,' and others have been 'this is awesome,'  Walker says. It's exciting to do something different. The crickets come from Orchestra Provisions, a small business in Carmen, a hamlet north of Salmon, that produces eight spice mixtures with crickets that it sells at retail. They range from curry powder to a Mexican-inspired mix, from a chai spice to a Sichuan pepper.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Museum of Science and Industry is marking the 50th anniversary of a program honoring the achievements of African Americans in science, technology, engineering, art and medicine and encouraging young people to consider those fields. The Black Creativity program began in 1970. This year's event is focused on innovation. The program, which began Monday and runs through March 1, includes hands-on activities for school groups and a museum exhibit featuring more than 200 works by black artists. The museum also has scheduled a career event Feb. 29 highlighting black artists, scientists and engineers working in Chicago.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state has just seen the biggest decrease in its infant mortality rate in six years, officials say. In 2018, 7.3 out of every 1,000 babies born in Indiana died in their first year of life – one of the highest rates in the nation. Last year, the rate dipped to 6.8 per 1,000. In all, 559 infants died in 2018, compared to 602 the previous year. Quite honestly this is a culmination of a number of years of very intensive efforts from multiple state agencies and Gov. Eric Holcomb, said Dr. Kristina Box, Indiana state health commissioner. I celebrate those babies that were saved, but we still have a long way to go. One of the initiatives the state took to combat its infant mortality rate was an OB navigator program that provides personal, at-home support for women living in the 20 counties with the highest infant mortality rate. The program follows mother and baby for six months to a year after birth.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state's industries recovered from the Great Recession at a rate less than half that of the national average, according to a new Iowa State University paper. From 2007 to 2018, the state added about 92,000 jobs. But economist Dave Swenson says Iowa would have added many more jobs if industries here grew at the same rate they did in the rest of the country. Iowa also would have added more jobs if its mix of businesses were closer to the national average. We're simply losing ground, he said. Our competitiveness is waning. Swenson's paper measures how Iowa's recovery from the Great Recession compares to other states. He said Iowa's industrial mix has been a drag on expansion, as the state relies heavily on industries where job growth is either growing slowly or shrinking, such as agriculture and manufacturing.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A task force has recommended steps for the Greek organizations at the University of Kansas to take to eliminate hazing and to connect more with the community. The 27-member task force established in November 2018 to improve safety and efficiency in the Greek community on the Lawrence campus recently released its recommendations. In a public message, Chancellor Douglas Girod said the task force strongly supported Greek life despite national concerns about hazing and substance abuse at fraternities and sororities, The Lawrence Journal-World reports. The group directed its recommendations to the Greek community at large. One of the main recommendations was to develop a partnership composed of Greek students, alumni, university representatives and representatives from the Lawrence community.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Researchers are launching a three-year study of elk in the Bluegrass State. The University of Kentucky and the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources are teaming up on the study, which begins this month and will focus on elk reproduction and survival, WFPL radio reports. The animals were native to Kentucky before being wiped out before the Civil War by unregulated hunting. They were reintroduced in eastern Kentucky about 20 years ago, and the population has grown since then to about 10,000 animals spread over 16 counties. We know a lot has changed. When we looked at this information, these were elk that were born into the west and brought into the east, said Gabe Jenkins, deer and elk coordinator with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources. Now nearly all of those animals from the west are dead. We have almost a completely new Kentucky bred, Kentucky-born population.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The National Endowment for the Humanities will provide up to $125,000 to help restore the oldest building at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. The Center for Louisiana Studies must raise another $375,000 over the next four years to get the full amount, Director Joshua Caffery said in a news release. The Roy House is over 100 years old, and we want to make sure it's here in another 100 years, Caffery said. The center began restoring the Roy House last year. Built in 1901 by landowner, businessman and Lafayette Parish School Board member J. Arthur Roy, it's the only university building on the National Register of Historic Places. Restoration plans include a reading and listening room where scholars and other patrons can access the center's audiovisual archives, plus a bookstore where UL Press titles will be sold.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state's smelts, a small fish beloved by ice fishermen, appear to be continuing a rebound in population after years of decline. Rainbow smelts come to shallow freshwater streams to spawn every spring, making them a popular target of ice fishermen in the winter. Ice fishing shacks on frozen rivers are a common sight in some Maine towns, where fishermen sit for hours in the hopes of catching the fish and eating them fried and with the head on. But the health of the fish's population is in question, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration listed it as a federal species of concern in 2004. The Maine Department of Marine Resources has described the reasons for the decline as not well understood. Loss of habitat is one possibility. Maine made it more difficult to fish for the smelts about five years ago with new restrictions, and recent years have shown positive signs.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: In 1962, Verda Freeman Welcome was a civil rights pioneer, a teacher and the first black woman in the country elected to a state senate. Last week, she became the first black person to have a portrait hung in a chamber of the Maryland State House. Her likeness replaced a 115-year-old canvas depicting a white man – and former governor – who was born when slavery was still legal and had been honored for overseeing construction of the Senate chamber. Welcome, who represented Baltimore, fought for interracial marriage, equal pay for woman, banning harassment of welfare recipients and barring racial discrimination in public places. Her daughter, Mary Sue Welcome, attended the portrait unveiling and recalled spending time with her mother around the Senate chambers more than half a century ago. This is amazing, she said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSpringfield: The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame is closing to the public for nearly two months in early February for the final phase of a $23 million renovation project. The Springfield facility's interactive Jerry Colangelo Court of Dreams will be fully redeveloped during the closure. In addition, the second floor will be deconstructed for a full transformation, the Hall of Fame said in a statement. The renovation includes the refurbishment of the hall's dome, the addition of new technology and visitor experiences, a fully redesigned High Above Center Court experience and a new Honors Ring. The renovations are privately funded and are expected to be fully completed by June 1. Many of the contractors hired for the project are from the region. The Hall of Fame will be closed to visitors from Feb. 3 until March 25.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Some state lawmakers believe the federal government should open Isle Royale National Park to moose hunters. MLive.com reports the House Natural Resources Committee heard testimony last week on a resolution supporting a limited moose hunt on the Lake Superior island. A vote could come at the next meeting. There could be more than 2,000 moose on Isle Royale. Wolves are the main predator, but the wolf population is struggling. You can continue to establish that wolf pack, but why not do a moose hunt in the meantime to help cull the herd down to help manage that population, so you don't destroy the vegetation on the island, said Rep. Steven Johnson, a Wayland Republican. Any hunt would be up to the National Park Service. A 2018 report dismissed the idea, MLive reports. The park is accessible only by boat or seaplane.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Snowplow drivers in northeastern Minnesota ended their strike with St. Louis County on Monday when union members voted to approve a new contract. Teamsters Local 320 members went on strike Wednesday afternoon over differences about health care and accrued sick leave. On Monday morning, union officials posted on Facebook that they had reached an agreement both parties can be proud of. They still needed to vote on it, however, and did so later in the afternoon, according to KBJR-TV. The ratification meeting happened in Eleveth. The snowplow drivers planned to return to work Tuesday at 7 a.m. Public Works supervisors and other licensed and qualified staff from other divisions and departments operated the plows during the strike. St. Louis County spokeswoman Dana Kazel said the replacements had 70% of the roads plowed by the time they finished Saturday.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: The mayor is moving forward with a plan to install a camera surveillance system across town as a way to reduce crime. WDAM-TV reports Mayor Toby Barker brought up the idea of a partnership with Project NOLA during a Facebook video message to his constituents during which he also discussed a recent crime spree. This partnership will deploy high-definition cameras throughout the city. These cameras can detect gunshots and read license plates. Cities that have used these cameras have seen significant decreases in violent crime over time, he said. Project NOLA is a New Orleans-based organization that works with cities and towns, organizations and individuals to put cameras and gunshot detectors in needed areas. The video is transmitted to a center in New Orleans, where an analyst then provides information to officials on the ground.\n\nMissouri\n\nArnold: A couple who had been together for nearly 65 years have died on the same day at a St. Louis-area nursing home. Jack and Harriet Morrison's beds were placed next to each other in their final hours, allowing them to hold hands, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Jack, 86, died first. Harriett, 83, died later Jan. 11. I'm sad. But I know they're at peace, and they're back together, said Sue Wagener, a niece raised by the Morrisons. It truly was a love story for the books. The couple went on their first date on Halloween of 1955. They went to a little diner and never separated from that day on, Wagener said. They married about six months later. They met as Harriett accompanied her father on a trip with the drum and bugle corp in which he played. Jack was behind the wheel of a charter bus that drove the group to some of its concerts.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Members of the state House of Representatives and legislative staffers have evaluated two chair designs to replace the seating that has been used by lawmakers for more than a century. We need to do this right because these chairs may be around another 100 years, House Speaker Greg Hertz, R-Polson, said Thursday, adding that the chairs should fit the historic atmosphere of the House. Lawmakers set aside $200,000 to purchase 106 wooden chairs for the House along with furniture for the Senate. The current chairs in the House are uncomfortable, unstable and have broken on occasion, sending a lawmaker tumbling to the floor. The designs reviewed Thursday included a rounded-back chair from Appleton Furniture of Helena and a high-backed chair manufactured by Montana Correctional Enterprises at the prison in Deer Lodge. Appleton furniture's design came out ahead in Thursday's scoring.\n\nNebraska\n\nOgallala: The Game and Parks Commission is delaying action on a set of restrictions that would drastically limit overnight campers and beachgoers at the state's largest reservoir, Lake McConaughy in western Nebraska. Commission Director Jim Douglas said Saturday that the commission is going to take additional time to consider all the suggestions offered by hundreds of people who showed up for a hearing on the proposed rules last week. Most people at Thursday's meeting said they wanted more law enforcement and greater attention to checkpoints, not a crackdown to limit access to the lake. The proposed restrictions the commission had been set to consider were developed following complaints about overcrowding and rowdy behavior last Fourth of July. The number of annual visitors to Lake McConaughy has grown significantly from 500,000 in the 1990s to more than 1 million in 2012 to nearly 2 million last year.\n\nNevada\n\nPyramid Lake: State wildlife officials and the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe teamed up last week to release 20 bighorn sheep into the hills above the desert lake on tribal land in an effort to reintroduce the species to part of its native habitat for the first time in nearly a century. One by one, the bighorns bolted out of the gates Monday, all but ignoring the dozens of supporters who quietly cheered them on, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. Past the crowds, they hoofed it through the rocky hills jutting out above the picturesque waters of Pyramid Lake, some 50 miles north of Reno, at a frenetic pace as the sun set behind the snow-capped mountains. It marked the first time since the early 1900s that the species has been spotted on the range there. As part of a reintroduction program several years in the works, the Nevada Department of Wildlife captured the animals earlier in the day in the Sheep Creek Range near Battle Mountain.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state's Democratic congressional delegation says New Hampshire will get more than $700,000 in federal funding to help youth suicide prevention efforts. Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan and Reps. Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas said the state will receive $735,844 that will go to the the National Alliance on Mental Illness New Hampshire. The funding will be used to raise awareness about youth suicide, educate the public and ensure those in crisis can get the help they need. Pointing to data that shows suicide was the second-most-common cause for death among young Americans in 2017, Shaheen said the issue demands our full attention. Pappas described youth suicide as a mental health emergency and said that we must ensure that our young people here in New Hampshire get the help and support they need.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Brunswick: Rutgers University is planning to name Jonathan Holloway, the current provost of Northwestern University, as its 21st president on Tuesday, according to NJ Advance Media. A former Stanford football player, Holloway, 52, will be the state university's first black president. A joint meeting of the university's Board of Governors and Board of Trustees has been called for 9 a.m. Tuesday. Rutgers spokesperson Dory Devlin confirmed the session's agenda is to vote on an executive-level position matter. Holloway would replace President Robert Barchi, who has served in his post since September 2012. Barchi announced in July that he will step down at the end of the 2019-20 school year. Gov. Phil Murphy tweeted about the expected hiring Sunday, saying Holloway has the vision & experience to put the needs of students first & lead Rutgers to the next level.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Plans are in the works to redevelop another dilapidated hotel along the longest urban stretch of historic Route 66, but this project on the edge of downtown Albuquerque will be bankrolled in a unique way. ARRIVE Hotels & Restaurants, the California-based hotel and entertainment company behind the effort, is partnering with investment platform NextSeed to raise $6 million through local crowdfunding to pay for part of the project. At nearly $25 million, the work will involve updating rooms at The Hotel Blue, changing the property's name, and adding new food and drink offerings. The approach to funding is common in the technology world but relatively unproven in the world of Albuquerque real estate. Still, NextSeed CEO Youngro Lee told the Albuquerque Journal the funding gives local investors an opportunity to invest in developments that are closer to home than most tech startups.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday announced a new Census Council that will oversee outreach and other efforts to make sure the upcoming census counts as many New Yorkers as possible. The Democrat said Lin-Manuel Miranda, Lucy Liu and Martin Luther King III have been tapped to co-chair the new council, which he said will hold conferences and work in hard-to-reach communities to make sure they're counted. Unfortunately, people of color are the ones most often undercounted, which leads to negative consequences for their communities, King said in a statement. Cuomo said he also plans to propose another $10 million for the state's census efforts in this year's budget, which if approved would bring state funding efforts up to $70 million.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state's online archival military collection now includes installation camp newsletters and newspapers that contain little-known information about life in the state during World War II. The collection is available as part of a two-year digitization project that the State Archives of North Carolina began in 2018 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of WWII. The project includes newsletter issues from installations such as Camp Lejeune, Camp Davis, Morris Field and Elizabeth City Naval Air Station. People have been able to use the newsletters for research since 1947, but they had to do that at the State Archives rather than online. State officials say the newsletters provide important information, including names of individuals in military units, civilian workers in various departments on base, female civilian and military personnel working at the installations, and news of casualties of people formerly stationed at those bases.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Ten communities in the state will use part of a settlement with Volkswagen to build electric vehicle charging stations. The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality will send $2.7 million to the local governments and businesses for clean vehicle projects, including 17 charging stations statewide. All but one are fast chargers that can charge vehicles in about 30 minutes, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Just 187 electric vehicles are registered in the state, and North Dakota has no Level 1 fast chargers. Several dozen Level 2 chargers exist in the state, however. They are cheaper to install, but they take hours to provide a full charge. The stations will be somewhat spread across the state, with the Interstate 29 corridor in the Red River Valley having the highest concentration.\n\nOhio\n\nNelsonville: The ongoing theft of historic bricks has frustrated officials in this small city who spent a lot of time tracking down the bricks for downtown sidewalks. At least 50 so-called Nelsonville Star Bricks have been taken since early January, city manager Chuck Barga says. The bricks are a legacy of Nelsonville's brick-making history and won first prize at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. Each has a star imprinted in its center. At least three brick producers once called Nelsonville home thanks to large clay deposits in the area. Though millions of Star Bricks were manufactured between the late 1800s and about 1920, the bricks are no longer made, which makes the thefts all the more frustrating, Barga told The Columbus Dispatch. The city tracked down the bricks for a renovation of Nelsonville's downtown a couple of years ago.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A top Republican legislator wants to eliminate the state Board of Corrections after a former board member allegedly overstepped his authority. Sen. Roger Thompson, R-Okemah, pre-filed legislation to get rid of the nine-member board first formed roughly 50 years ago. In mid-September, gang-related inmate fights broke out at six state prisons, leading the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to lock down the prisons for days. Behind the scenes, then-interim director Scott Crow and other corrections officials were discussing how to handle the situation. That's when a board member tried to step in, Thompson said. We had a board member in that control room trying to give orders and trying to be in charge, and we're dealing with public safety, he said. We can keep the people safe without board members actually trying to interfere. Thompson declined to name the individual.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Marijuana sales in Oregon along the Idaho state line are 420% the statewide average, according to a state report. Idaho residents are purchasing recreational marijuana in Oregon because it is illegal in their own state, says the report released Friday by the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. The sales in counties along the Idaho border were much stronger than I anticipated, analyzer Josh Lehner said. Obviously recreational marijuana is not legal in Idaho, but even after throwing the data into a rough border tax model that accounts for incomes, number of retailers, tax rates and the like, there remains a huge border effect. A border effect occurs when two neighboring jurisdictions have different rules prompting residents to travel to nearby regions to take advantage of the different regulations, experts said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The union representing public school teachers in the city is suing the district over its handling of asbestos contamination in schools, the union said Monday. The Philadelphia Federation of Teachers' suit comes after the city school district was forced to close a north Philadelphia elementary school for a second time Friday after tests demanded by teachers and union leaders showed elevated levels of asbestos, a known carcinogen, in the air. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports district leaders had assured teachers a day earlier that McClure Elementary School was safe to enter. Time and again, the School District has claimed that their actions are out of an abundance of caution, union president Jerry Jordan said in a statement. The school district said in a statement that it would thoroughly review the legal filings while remaining focused on improve environmental conditions in schools.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A state representative is pushing for a bill that would allow school districts to raise money for extracurricular activities, including field trips and dances. Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, said many school districts canceled field trips last year after the state's former education commissioner established a policy stating that school departments may not charge students to participate in public school field trips. Schools interpreted that to mean no fundraising could be done either, McNamara said. The bill he recently introduced would add a provision to state law to say that school districts are not prohibited from requesting money from students, their parents or legal guardians to help pay for school-sponsored field trips, dances, clubs and other activities, provided the district pay the costs to meet any deficit.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The group that awards accreditation to the University of South Carolina has determined Gov. Henry McMaster had undue influence on last year's search for a new president. The determination by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools means the university will have to submit a report and be visited by a special committee from the accreditation group, The State newspaper reports. The group has already told the university it won't receive any additional punishment from the president search. Universities that lose accreditation cannot get financial aid from the government, crippling the institution. The organization opened an investigation into the university after the tumultuous hiring as president of Bob Caslen, a retired Army general who was the superintendent of West Point for five years.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Arrests for drugs, aggravated assaults and vehicle thefts are the highest they've been since 2012, the city's police chief says. Drug arrests in particular are at an all-time high and have more than doubled since 2012, Chief Karl Jegeris says. The Rapid City Journal reports police officers made 1,567 drug arrests in 2019, compared with 734 in 2012, according to police data. Jegeris says the increase is due to the state's meth crisis and repeat offenders. He wants lawmakers to increase funding for meth treatment programs and create alternatives to prison. But he also wants repeat meth offenders to receive tougher punishments. Regarding aggravated assaults, police data shows officers handled 389 aggravated assault cases last year, the highest since 2012 and up from 379 in 2018.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Vice President Mike Pence gave a speech Sunday in remembrance of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at a service at the Holy City Church of God, the day before the federal holiday named after the civil rights leader. I'm here to pay a debt of honor and respect to a man who from walking the dirt roads of the Deep South, to speaking to hundreds of thousands on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, touched the hearts of the American people and led the civil rights movement to triumph over Jim Crow, Pence said. Before the service, Pence toured the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel, where King was fatally shot April 4, 1968, while standing on a balcony. Local church leaders noted commonalities between their faith and Pence's, with Bishop Vincent Mathews Jr., COGIC World Missions president, calling Pence one of the most persecuted Christians in America.\n\nTexas\n\nBellaire: Police have found the gun they believe a 16-year-old student used to fatally shoot his classmate last week inside a Houston-area high school, officials said. Police characterized the shooting in an ROTC room at Bellaire High School last Tuesday as an accident. Nineteen-year-old Cesar Cortes was killed, and the teenage gunman, who fled after the shooting, was captured more than three hours later and charged as a minor with manslaughter. The city of Bellaire announced Monday that authorities have recovered the weapon. Lt. Greg Bartlett declined to say when or where the gun was found. Bartlett said last week that the younger student took a semiautomatic pistol out of his waistband and pulled the trigger, killing Cortes. There were four other students in the room at the time but no adults. Police could not find the gun for days.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A rockfall in late August dumped 435,712 cubic feet of debris onto Weeping Rock trail and nearby trails at Zion National Park, and a new report from the Utah Geological Survey finds similar rockfalls could happen at any time in the area. With annual visitation exceeding 4.3 million in 2018, the likelihood of geologic hazards affecting park visitors and infrastructure continues to rise, the survey says. The rockfall Aug. 24, 2019, injured three visitors. A piece of Navajo sandstone weighing more than 31,000 tons broke off Cable Mountain, about 3,000 feet above Weeping Rock. The rockfall caused an avalanche of debris to fall on the Weeping Rock trailhead parking lot, the trail itself, Hidden Canyon trail and East Rim trail, with some rocks flowing across the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive to the Virgin River.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Senate approved a paid family leave bill by enough votes to override a potential veto by Gov. Phil Scott. The legislation was approved by a vote of 20-9 in the Senate on Friday and is now headed to the House. The bill provides up to 12 weeks of paid leave for the birth of a newborn or an adoption. People caring for an ailing loved one would be eligible for eight weeks of benefits. The average Vermont resident will receive 70% of their pay during their leave depending on how much money they make. The bill would use a 0.2% payroll tax on most workers in the state to fund the paid leave benefit. It's unclear how Scott feels about the bill, but he has said he prefers a voluntary paid leave program that workers could opt into.\n\nVirginia\n\nFort Belvoir: Plans are underway to completely dismantle the first nuclear power facility that provided electricity to the U.S. power grid. In December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed fully removing the SM-1 Reactor Facility at Fort Belvoir in Fairfax County, Virginia, WTOP reports. The project will now go out to bid and is expected to begin in 2021 with a projected end date of 2025. The reactor opened in 1957 and was decommissioned in 1973. Dismantling began over 40 years ago when the Army Corps removed a majority of the radioactive material, which was taken to a storage site in South Carolina. Remaining buildings include the reactor plant as well as many labs that were on the site. They will all be removed along with any radioactive contamination exceeding regulatory level, the station reports. The Army Corps of Engineers says there is little to no danger of radioactivity on the site once the facility is removed.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Washington State Ferries saw ridership fall 3.2% last year, held down by February's snowstorm and ongoing waterfront construction and alternative ferry service from Kitsap Transit. The Seattle Times reports the ferry agency tallied 23.9 million passengers in 2019, down about 800,000 from 2018. Despite the decrease, officials said there's no cause for concern. We've had a seven-year run of going up and up. It's not a huge red flag for us, said Ian Sterling, spokesperson for Washington State Ferries. Last February saw a 19% decline in ferry ridership during the record-setting snowstorm, and the numbers never caught up throughout the rest of the year. In fact, every month except for January and April had fewer passengers than in 2018. The Seattle-Bremerton route recorded the largest drop, with ridership down by 15%.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFort Gay: The community has passed a resolution declaring itself a Second Amendment sanctuary. The Fort Gay town council passed the resolution Friday night, news outlets report. Supporters say it is a defense against possible federal or state legislation that could limit access to firearms, ammunition or gun accessories. Mayor Joetta Hatfield says Fort Gay is the first municipality in West Virginia to adopt such a resolution. She says the move was made in response to recent events in Virginia, where the new Democratic majority leadership plans to enact a slew of gun restrictions. Fort Gay is located in Wayne County along the West Virginia-Kentucky border. Last week the Putnam County Commission passed a similar resolution.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers announced Sunday that he wants state lawmakers to pass a package of bills aimed at curbing youth vaping and educating the public about vaping's potential dangers. The bills that Evers, a Democrat, is requesting would ban vaping and vapor products on K-12 campuses and expand the definition of public health emergencies. Another bill would fund a public health campaign to address youth vaping in the state, and a fourth proposal would expand the enforcement capacity of the Departments of Revenue and Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection to prevent vaping products from being sold to minors. The governor's office said vaping products pose serious health risks to young users because the nicotine contained in e-cigarettes can harm parts of the brain that control attention and learning.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State regulators have issued a one-time permit for a company to test whether its technology to treat oil drilling and manufacturing wastewater can help vegetation grow on a farm. The Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality permit issued this month allows Encore Green Environmental to apply about 7,000 barrels of the treated water to private farmland outside Pine Bluffs near the Nebraska state line by the end of the year. The Wyoming company's co-founder, Marvin Nash, told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the permit marks the project's transformation to reality after several years of planning. Stock growers have said they see how this could work and that it's going to be an opportunity for agriculture to improve, Nash said. The company says on its website that it wants to solve the problem of too much oil and manufacturing wastewater being produced at industrial sites while nearby agricultural lands are in need of water.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports
AP\n\nHILLSBOROUGH, N.C. (AP) — A former NFL agent has pleaded guilty to violating North Carolina's sports agent law by providing thousands of dollars in improper benefits to three former Tar Heels football players to entice them into signing contracts with him.\n\nTerry Watson, 43, of Marietta, Georgia, entered his plea Monday afternoon in a deal to resolve 3½-year-old felony charges. Watson received 30 months of probation and a $5,000 fine, while Judge Graham Shirley issued a suspended jail sentence of six to eight months.\n\nWatson pleaded guilty to the 13 counts of athlete-agent inducement for providing roughly $24,000 in cash and travel accommodations to eventual NFL players Robert Quinn, Marvin Austin and Greg Little in 2010. A felony obstruction of justice charge for not providing records sought by authorities was dismissed as part of the deal.\n\nHe was one of five people facing charges in the case, four of whom were in the same courtroom Monday.\n\nThe law prohibits illegally luring collegiate athletes into contracts by providing them money, gifts or other items of value. It also seeks to regulate sports agent conduct by requiring them to register with the state. It has been enacted in at least 40 states along with the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, though its structure and penalties can vary from state to state. In North Carolina, it is a low-level felony that would typically lead to probation for anyone who doesn't have a criminal record if they plead guilty or are convicted.\n\nWatson's charges came after more than three years of investigation by the Secretary of State's office, which launched its probe in summer 2010 after the NCAA had opened an investigation into the Tar Heels football program. That case ultimately spawned the school's ongoing multi-year academic scandal, which has UNC currently facing five top-level NCAA charges that include lack of institutional control.\n\nYears ago when this all began, people in the athlete agent industry scoffed at us for looking into these cases, North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine F. Marshall said in a statement. They said 'This is how it works and you can't change it.' But today, everyone in that business knows that when you come to North Carolina, you had better follow the law. And if you don't, we can and we will enforce the law.\n\nRussell Babb, Watson's attorney, told the court that Watson was no longer working as a sports agent since first facing charges in fall 2013 and had lost his license with the NFL Players Association. Instead, he said, Watson was working in chemical sales and waiting tables as a second job while going through a divorce.\n\nBabb said Watson represented roughly a half-dozen players, including defensive back Cortland Finnegan.\n\nTerry fully understood what his options were and just wanted some closure today, Babb told The Associated Press after the hearing. He was adamant that he was tired of this hanging over his head. He's moving forward in a positive direction. Even though his marriage is falling apart, he's working hard and has the love of his kids.\n\nWatson's plea came together a few hours after his friend agreed to testify against him in a case as part of a deferred-prosecution deal that could lead to the dismissal of his charge after 12 months.\n\nPatrick Mitchell Jones, 43, was charged in 2013 with athlete-agent inducement for providing $725 to former Tar Heels football player Robert Quinn. An indictment stated he provided the money through Quinn's former girlfriend to entice Quinn to sign with Watson.\n\nJones' deal required him acknowledge his involvement and testify truthfully against Watson, according to a court document.\n\nHe has worked as a real estate agent in Cartersville, Georgia, and was described in a search warrant as Watson's friend. His deal also requires him to stay out of legal trouble, perform 48 hours of community service and not discuss the case with other defendants.\n\nAccording to a probable cause affidavit in a 2013 search warrant, Jones told an investigator in June 2012 he was Watson's longtime friend and said he sent packages containing cash to student-athletes at Watson's request.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org\n\n___\n\nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap
You will survive R. Kelly.\n\nThat was the message from accusers who brought decades of sexual abuse allegations against the music superstar to the eyes of the world, from the third and final installment of Lifetime's Surviving R. Kelly, Part II (Saturday, 9 EST/PST).\n\nWhile the message was broadcast globally on the finale episode, it was meant for two women specifically — Azriel Clary, 22, and Joycelyn Savage 24, are still under Kelly's powerful control. The episode focused on the tortorous efforts to reach the women.\n\nJoycelyn and Azriel, you are worth so much more than Rob, said Jerhonda Pace, who started a relationship with Kelly in 2009 when she was 16 and whose voice is integral to the legal cases brought against the singer. You have so much to live for. We're still fighting for you, we really are.\n\nFirst night of 'Part II':Aaliyah was a 'sacrificial lamb' in alleged abuse 'cover-up'\n\nKelly, 52, has continued to deny all allegations against him. He has pleaded not guilty to more than a dozen sex-crime charges filed in two federal courts and two state courts since February. He is scheduled to face trial in the federal case in Chicago in April, a May federal case in New York and a state case in Chicago scheduled for September.\n\nIn spite of the onslaught of grave allegations, Clary and Savage continued to live with Kelly in his Chicago Trump Tower residence, shunning their horrified families as they tried to bring their daughters home.\n\nBoth gave interviews to Gayle King in March defending Kelly and their relationship in strong terms, while portraying their embattled parents as simply seeking money from the singer.\n\nTimothy Savage, Joycelyn's father, talked about the frustration of his daughter remaining under Kelly's control, while dealing with spurious allegations that he and wife Jonjelyn were after money. He said there was perception that the couple had taken $20,000 from the singer and we handed our daughter over.\n\nWe would never sell our daughter. That is a piece of crack, said Timothy Savage. Joycelyn remains at Trump Tower today, with her parents still hoping to be reunited, Part II reports.\n\nClary met Kelly in 2015 when she was at a concert. She was 17. Her father Angelo Clary said he and her mother, Alice, had been prohibited contact with their daughter for three years. Alice Clary was so desperate that she stole onto Kelly's stage during a concert in an attempt to send a message to her onstage daughter. Security forcefully blocked it.\n\nI didn't expect security guards to be as aggressive as they were, one guy had her in a headlock, one guy had her in his arms and they more or less dragged her off the stage, said Armani Clary, Joycelyn's brother, who witnessed his mother's attempt. Kelly's team marched them both to police. The mother and son duo were cuffed and taken away in police cars.\n\nWhile Armani Clary said his parent's marriage crumbled due to the strain of their separation, the documentary ended with a positive note. An addendum stated that Clary moved out of Trump Tower in December and has been reunited with her family. But she continues to support Kelly as he prepares for trial.\n\nShe has left the side of Robert Kelly, said an emotional Angelo Clary in a video. My heart, that pain has been healed. If I was man that cried, I would be crying right now.\n\nThe episode ended with accusers talking about their efforts to overcome the pain Kelly left with them. Pace is now a teacher and works with non-profit organizations to educate young girls on sexual abuse.\n\nI was the first girl and no one believed me, I made it through, said Tiffany Hawkins, who was the first accuser, suing Kelly in 1996. She's now a mother of two working in the medical field. I wasn't going to let R. Kelly be the end of my life story.
Dayana Yochim\n\nNerdWallet\n\nYou can tell it's tax season when the dining room table disappears beneath piles of year-end statements, tax documents, crumpled receipts and tears.\n\nIt's unlikely the table will be cleared off in time to serve dinner. According to the IRS, it takes the average taxpayer 13 hours to prepare and file a tax return. Roughly half of that time is spent on record keeping, two hours on tax planning, four hours completing and submitting forms and one uncategorized hour we assume is spent griping and procrastinating.\n\nOf course, your mileage will vary depending on the size of the piles, the complexity of your financial life and your familiarity with the IRS tax code. But you're not alone if you doubt your ability to do the job correctly on your own.\n\nForm 1040 Not-So-EZ scenarios\n\nAccording to a new NerdWallet study of more than 1,600 taxpayers, nearly seven in 10 respondents fear making mistakes on their tax returns, with worries ranging from overpaying the IRS to being audited.\n\nWhile there are some great online tax-preparation tools that enable DIYers to tackle this task efficiently and cheaply, sometimes life throws you into 1040 Not-So-EZ territory.\n\nIn situations like the ones below, hiring a professional tax preparer (look for designations such as CPA and EA, for enrolled agent) buys you not just peace of mind, but also helps avert future headaches — think underpayment penalties, late-filing fees or an audit — and identify tax-savings opportunities that are often overlooked by amateur tax-prep warriors who do battle just once a year.\n\nHere are six scenarios in which to consider calling in expert reinforcements.\n\n1. You've had a major life change in the past year. Marriage, divorce, having kids, adopting them, taking elderly relatives under your wing, receiving an inheritance — when life happens, new tax rules happen along with them. A tax pro can walk you through the consequences of adding or eliminating dependents and tease out some tax-saving strategies that may now be available to you.\n\n2. You own a business, work as a contractor or are self-employed. According to IRS data, 30% of all returns filed are business returns. There are strict rules for deductions, expenses, dealing with debts and other tax laws related to being the boss. A once-a-year check-in with a CPA may not be enough, especially for taxpayers who need to pay estimated taxes throughout the year.\n\n3. You're nervous about starting to itemize your return. Every taxpayer is entitled to lower his or her taxable income by taking the standard deduction (which ranges from $6,300 to $12,600 for 2015). You also have the choice to itemize your deductions, which may lower your tax liability even more. According to TurboTax, itemizing lowers the tax bill of one out of every four taxpayers. It could put hundreds of extra dollars in your pocket.\n\nSurvey: Millennials fear tax season more than other age groups do\n\nThere's a wide range of expenses that qualify as allowable deductions — things like home mortgage/equity loan interest, property taxes, state and city income taxes, student loan interest, charitable contributions, medical expenses and even losses incurred because of theft and natural disasters. The National Society of Accountants says hiring a professional to prepare an itemized Form 1040 with Schedule A and a state tax return costs an average of $273.\n\n4. You've got investment properties. The home you live in and your weekend pied-à-terre are indeed assets and are subject to their own set of IRS rules for deductions and credits. However, investment property (rentals, real estate used for business purposes) is a different beast in the eyes of the IRS. For example, as a landlord you can trim your tax bill by depreciating real estate costs. And when it comes time to sell, there is a way for taxpayers to postpone a painful capital gains whammy (with a like-kind or 1031 exchange) — but it's an involved transaction. A skilled tax navigator can help you maneuver through it.\n\n5. You've had a lot of investing transactions. If 2015 was a particularly transaction-heavy year, a tax expert can help you navigate the details of tax-loss harvesting, correctly calculate capital gains and losses and deal with the 14 pages of instructions to fill out IRS Form 6251: Alternative Minimum Tax - Individuals. In particular, watch out if you've earned a fair amount of gains from foreign investments (think exchange-traded funds, mutual funds and even multinational companies) you held in a taxable account.\n\n6. You haven't filed your taxes in a while or think you may face some tax troubles. It's better to deal head-on with issues than let them linger and rack up additional penalties and ill will from the IRS. Ask any tax professionals you're considering hiring if they have dealt with situations like yours before and if they have the qualifications and training to represent you in any audit, collections or appeals proceedings before the IRS, should it come to that.\n\nThe ghosts of tax season past and future\n\nWhile you may not need professional help preparing your return every year, if you've got a tax pro on the payroll now you should make the most of it. Ask for tax-saving strategies for situations you may face in the future and for a review of tax returns from your DIY days. Who knows — maybe your tax whiz will find enough money from deductions you overlooked on your messy dining room table to file an amended return and recoup enough to cover the tax-prep fee.\n\nMORE: Prepare and File Your Taxes Online\n\nMORE: The 3 Biggest Mistakes People Make at Tax Time\n\nMORE: How to Get More From Your Tax Preparer Next Year\n\nDayana Yochim is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website: Email: dyochim@nerdwallet.com.

WASHINGTON – Chief Justice John Roberts began presiding over the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump last week determined to protect the stature of his branch of government, the Supreme Court.\n\nTurns out he may improve the tattered reputations of the other two branches as well.\n\nIt was well past midnight on Wednesday morning when Roberts took it upon himself to scold House Democrats and Trump's lawyers for their tone and language in the well of the Senate. Tempers had worn thin, but the chief justice of the United States was the embodiment of judicial decorum.\n\nI think it is appropriate at this point for me to admonish both the House managers and the president's counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body, Roberts said. One reason it has earned that title is because its members avoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse.\n\nMore:Chief Justice John Roberts drops 'pettifogging' bomb\n\nTo those who know or have studied him, Roberts' warning was in keeping with his regard for the institutions of government – not just the judicial branch he supervises as chief justice of the United States, but the executive and legislative branches as well.\n\nHe takes his job very, very seriously, and he's exceptionally well-prepared, always. He's a guy who is over-prepared, says Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., one of Roberts' law clerks in the court's 2007 term. He works extraordinarily hard, and so I think that shows. He's managing this trial very carefully.\n\nSince 2005, the man nominated by President George W. Bush to be the nation's 17th chief justice has done his unflappable best to keep the Supreme Court from being seen as just another political branch.\n\nAt bottom, he's an institutionalist, and he plays the long game, says Neal Katyal, a former acting solicitor general at the Justice Department who has argued 41 cases before Roberts. Both of those are what you want here – someone who is concerned about the long-term survival of our great American institutions.\n\nMore:Chief Justice John Roberts' impeachment trial role: speak softly, set a good example\n\nMore:Chief Justice John Roberts will be the 'umpire' in Senate impeachment trial of President Trump\n\nFor a government prone to so much partisan squabbling that it often resembles a food fight, a buttoned-down, by-the-book chief justice on national television provides a welcome respite.\n\nThus it was helpful in the wee hours Wednesday, when he said those addressing the Senate should remember where they are. His remarks followed a complaint Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a key moderate, sent him about House Democrats' cover-up accusations against senators.\n\nOff-camera, it was helpful as well about nine hours later, when he gently cut off a question qua filibuster from Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor so that the government's lawyer might respond, during oral argument of a closely-watched case on school choice and religious freedom.\n\nPerhaps you could comment, counsel, Roberts suggested.\n\n'Best seat in the house'\n\nAfter nearly 15 years at the center of the Supreme Court, where TV cameras are verboten, Roberts' figurative 15 minutes of fame comes at an awkward time.\n\nHis mother, Rosemary Roberts, died in late December. He turns 65 on Monday. He is in the midst of a busy, contentious high court term featuring cases on abortion, immigration, gay rights, gun rights and religious rights. His court, including two justices named by Trump, must decide if the president's tax returns and financial records are fair game for congressional investigators and New York prosecutors.\n\nMore:His Supreme Court divided like the country, Chief Justice John Roberts prepares for outsized role as umpire\n\nThose cases and more will be decided in the midst of the 2020 presidential election, making the Supreme Court – with five conservative justices named by Republican presidents and four liberals named by Democratic presidents – a political issue.\n\nWhen you live in a politically polarized environment, people tend to see everything in those terms, Roberts said during a rare public appearance in New York last September. That's not how we at the court function.\n\nWe do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. We do not caucus in separate rooms, he told a University of Minnesota Law School audience the year before. We do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation.\n\nNow, however, Roberts is presiding over the most partisan of ordeals, in which nearly every vote comes out 53-47 in Republicans' favor.\n\nHe has the best seat in the house for this trial. At least for now, he is witnessing party-line vote after party-line vote, says Brianne Gorod, chief counsel at the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center, which conducted an in-depth study of the Roberts Court in 2015. He will use whatever power and authority he has to try to make sure that there is decorum and civility, if nothing else.\n\nRoberts has tried to keep his court far away from politics, even wondering whether it's proper for justices to attend annual State of the Union addresses.\n\nTo the extent the State of the Union has degenerated into a political pep rally, he said in 2010, I'm not sure why we're there.\n\n'Who do we think we are?'\n\nThe chief justice's penchant for avoiding politics extended last year to his 5-4 ruling that federal courts may not intervene to block even the most partisan state election maps – a dramatic withdrawal from the political battles that have consumed states for decades.\n\nHow do you decide where the line is between acceptable partisanship and too much partisanship? Roberts said in announcing the decision on the last day of the term. At some point, it should occur to you that what you've been asked to do is not judging at all.\n\nThe same sense of judicial humility extended in 2015 to the court's 5-4 decision on same-sex marriage, from which he dissented. It remains the only time Roberts has summarized his dissent from the bench.\n\nThe court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the states and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia, for the Kalahari Bushmen and the Han Chinese, the Carthaginians and the Aztecs, he wrote. Just who do we think we are?\n\nThe chief justice's low profile since 2005 has assured that many Americans don't know who he is. In a Marquette University Law School poll last October, only two-thirds of those polled could identify him, and many of those did not know enough about him to register an opinion.\n\nBut to Roberts' credit, the poll found the court was not perceived as highly partisan, and he was seen as the least polarizing justice.\n\nFor the most part, the chief justice tries to keep his head down and do his work. When he is forced into the limelight, it isn't always pretty.\n\nHis eight-year relationship with President Barack Obama began on a low note on Jan. 20, 2009, when Roberts botched the oath of office before some 1.8 million people crowding the National Mall. Out of extreme caution, the two repeated the oath the next day inside the White House.\n\nBut when it comes to a continuing, contentious issue for the court – whether to allow television cameras – Roberts refuses all replays. To him, it's about protecting the institution.\n\nI think it's to a certain extent unfortunate that we're not televised, because I think most would be pleased with what they saw, he said in 2018. But I do think it would have an adverse effect on our job under the Constitution, and that has to come first.\n\nJohn Roberts' fashion choice:No stripes\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes
Laura Dern is one proud daughter.\n\nThe actress, 53, brought her mother, Diane Ladd, to tears after winning the Oscar for best supporting actress at the 92nd annual Academy Awards Sunday for Netflix's Marriage Story.\n\nSome say, 'Never meet your heroes,'  Dern said during her emotional acceptance speech. I say if you're really blessed, you get them as your parents. I share this with my acting hero, my legends, Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern. You got game. I love you.\n\nDern – who beat out Kathy Bates (Richard Jewell), Scarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit), Florence Pugh (Little Women) and Margot Robbie (Bombshell) – embraced her mother immediately after she was announced the winner.\n\nLaura Dern talks long road to Oscar for 'Marriage Story'\n\nOscars 2020:Peek behind the scenes at the Academy Awards\n\nBackstage moments later, Dern said the heartwarming moment with her mother means the world. She credited her parents with her acting career.\n\nI went backstage, and people were telling me my mother was very moved, and that just makes me so happy to stand up and sing their praises, Dern said in the press room following her speech. (My parents) literally got me here and artistically got me here as well. So it means the world. Thank you.\n\nHer win was a full-circle moment for Dern, who first attended the Academy Awards alongside Ladd in 1974 at age 7. (I remember that I, by accident, tripped on my dress and fell into Tatum O'Neal.) This year, Dern brought Ladd and her children Ellery Harper, 18, and Jaya Harper, 15, to the Oscars with her.\n\nOscars 2020: See what every A-list celebrity wore on the red carpet\n\nWorst-dressed at the Oscars:Laura Dern, Sandra Oh, Saoirse Ronan top list\n\nLadd, 84, has been nominated for a best-supporting actress Oscar three times: 1974's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore, 1990's Wild at Heart and 1991's Rambling Rose. Dern's father, Bruce, 83, has received two nominations: A best-supporting actor nod for 1979's Coming Home and a best actor nomination for 2013's Nebraska.\n\nBrutally honest rankings of Oscars 2020 musical performances, from Eminem's shocker to Elton John\n\nThis marks Dern's first Oscar win.

Jeff Platsky\n\n(Binghamton, N.Y.) Press & Sun Bulletin\n\nBINGHAMTON, N.Y. — A married same-sex Chemung County couple can rebuff an effort by a sperm donor to exert parental rights on the daughter born as a result of the arrangement.\n\nA midlevel New York appeals court ruled in favor of the couple, suspending a decision by the Chemung County Family Court that originally ordered a paternity test to determine the donor's parental rights.\n\nIn a 19-page decision released Thursday, the New York Appellate Division, Third Judicial Department, said the lesbian couple has the same parental rights as a traditional couple in a sperm donor arrangement. The mother and wife are the presumed natural parents, the court ruled, and the donor has no specific legal right to be a part of the rearing of the child no matter how the child was conceived.\n\nGranting the request of a sperm donor for a paternity test would effectively disrupt, if not destroy, this family unit and nullify the child's established relationship with the wife, her other mother. Justice Robert Mulvey wrote in the unanimous decision of the five judge panel. Testing in these circumstances exposes children born into same-gender marriages to instability for no justifiable reason other than to provide a father-figure for children who already have two parents.\n\nMore:Ind. appeals ruling on parental rights for same-sex couples\n\nMore:Mass. court gives parental rights to unmarried gay partner\n\nParties in the suit were identified as only Christopher YY, the donor; Jessica ZZ and Nichole ZZ, the mother and wife, respectively.\n\nJustices said New York's same-sex marriage law affords gay married couples the same legal rights as traditional couples, and the nature of marriage arrangement would not undermine the basic tenets of a legal union.\n\nI don't speak for my client, Pamela B. Bleiwas, the Ithaca lawyer representing the sperm donor, said when contacted by telephone on Monday. I'm not going to answer for him on the PR front.\n\nThe mother's Elmira lawyer, Ouida F. Binnie-Francis, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMarried in August 2014, the same-sex couple set up an informal agreement with the donor — known through family — to supply sperm in a process that occurred at the mother's home.\n\nThe couple's acquaintance volunteered to donate his sperm so that (couple) could have a child together, expressly waived any claims to paternity with regard to any child conceived from his donated sperm and further waived any right to custody or visitation, and respondents, in turn, waived any claim for child support, the court said.\n\nFollowing birth, however, a disagreement ensued about visitation rights. The court noted that the donor was not involved in pre-natal doctor visits, was not present at the birth and did not see the child until she was 1 or 2 months old. The child was 7 months old when the paternity action was filed.\n\nYet, the court found the donor abandoned his rights to parental authority through a previous informal agreement.\n\nHe unequivocally understood that he was doing so to permit the mother and the wife\n\nto be the sole parents of any child conceived, aware that they wanted to raise the child together and planned to marry, as they did prior to the birth of the child, the court wrote in its opinion.\n\nSubsequent to the 2015 Family Court hearing in which a paternity test was approved, the Appellate division was informed the child had been placed in foster care for a lengthy period and there are reportedly neglect petitions pending against the parents. Even with the developing circumstances of the child, the donor is not entitled to paternity, the court ruled.\n\nBecause the Appellate Division decision was unanimous, the father is not automatically entitled to a review by the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals. The court must grant permission to appeal, and that is a rarity.\n\nBleiwas would not say if she would ask for a permission to appeal.\n\nRead the decision here:\n\nFollow Jeff Platsky on Twitter: @JeffPlatsky
NASHVILLE, Tenn. – Tennessee lawmakers passed a controversial measure this week that protects religious adoption agencies if they choose to discriminate against same-sex couples.\n\nThe bill declares that no licensed adoption agency would be required to participate in a child placement if doing so would violate the agency's written religious or moral convictions or policies.\n\nIt also prohibits the state from denying an agency's license or grant application for public funds because of the group's refusal to place a child with a family based on religious objections. The adoption agency would also be protected from lawsuits for such a refusal.\n\nThe state Senate passed the bill 20-6, with five Republican members declining to vote on the measure, including Lt. Gov. Randy McNally.\n\nThe House passed the bill in April, and eight other states around the country have passed similar legislation. The bill, which never made its way to the Senate floor in 2019, will now head to Gov. Bill Lee for his signature.\n\nLee's office on Tuesday afternoon confirmed that the governor would be signing the bill as soon as it reaches his desk.\n\nSame-sex marriage:United Methodist leaders propose splitting church over gay marriage tensions\n\nIn a rare move, McNally left his speaker's chair Tuesday to debate the legislation on the floor, arguing that Tennessee has already implemented strong religious freedom protections. He suggested the bill, sponsored by GOP Sen. Paul Rose could potentially threaten those.\n\nBut along with McNally, multiple Republican members on Tuesday argued against passing the bill, despite only casting neutral present votes.\n\nSen. Steve Dickerson was among those debating the bill, challenging Rose's intentions and arguing that the state would suffer financial and economic development impacts for such a bad public policy.\n\nHe was the sole Republican to join the chamber's five Democrats in voting against the legislation.\n\nDickerson said he has spoken with representatives from the tourism industry who, over the past six months, have inquired about the status of the bill on behalf of various conventions and large events eyeing Tennessee.\n\nHe mentioned the NFL draft, NCAA basketball playoffs, NHL events and businesses eyeing the state.\n\nI think we can probably kiss that goodbye, Dickerson said.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jon Lundberg pointed to the Tennessee Religious Freedom and Protection Act passed in 2009, while Lundberg was serving in the House, and said Rose's bill language seemed to duplicate that.\n\nIs this not just a restatement of our 2009 legislation? Lundberg asked.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Jeff Yarbro, a Democrat, unsuccessfully tried to amend the bill to only offer protections on licensing and legal challenges to adoption agencies who are not receiving public funds.\n\nHe argued that there is no movement afoot in Tennessee to shut down religious adoption agencies.\n\nThere is no threat by the federal government, there is no threat by the state government, Yarbro said. I am unaware of anything that is trying to close these things down.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Raumesh Akbari told a story about her childhood friend who grew up in the foster care system and suffered sexual and physical abuse.\n\nHer friend is now an adult in a same-sex relationship and has adopted two children who had an alternative to be essentially an orphan, Akbari said.\n\nTo me, it boils down to safety, she said. It boils down to them being happy, being free from abuse, and to feel like they belong.\n\nAmong the groups supporting the bill has been the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission.\n\nThe Tennessee Equality Project, a statewide LGBTQ advocacy group, has opposed the bill, arguing it will lead to discrimination against same-sex couples who are turned away by religious agencies and result in longer wait times for children to be placed into homes.\n\nFollow Natalie Allison on Twitter: @natalie_allison.
It seems like every day is Festivus in today's Republican Party. It may be a joke holiday invented on the Seinfeld show, but the Airing of the Grievances is all too real and now happens every day instead of once a year. Who needs a special occasion to whine, complain and lash out at everyone who has been a disappointment to you?\n\nGrievance airing, closely related to entitlement and privilege, reached an all-time peak (or maybe just my personal aggravation limit) last week after a woman charged in the U.S. Capitol insurrection asked for permission to go to Mexico; so many House members (some of them armed) were hassling Capitol Police and trying to dodge metal detectors installed after the attack that the House approved steep fines for scofflaws; and a Trump political appointee at the Commerce Department, who like all political appointees knew she'd lose her job if her boss lost, complained that her paid parental leave ended when President Joe Biden was inaugurated.\n\nI got completely screwed, Vanessa Ambrosini, the new mom, told Politico.\n\nThis is not, however, a family new to how politics works. Her husband, a former Trump White House official, is executive director of the Michigan GOP, which tried to disrupt the vote count during election week and later tried to delay certification that Biden won the state.\n\nAny punishment is 'cancel culture'\n\nAll these people consider themselves victims, so why should they have to pay any price? And if that suddenly looms as a possibility, the privilege and entitlement whine moves seamlessly into the cancel culture whine. Consequences and accountability? So unfair. At least that's how you see it if you believe you are above the law, above the rules and entitled to special treatment.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for instance, believes she should pay no price for trafficking in conspiracy theories that are painful for real victims of 9/11 and school shootings, and violent threats that are frightening for those (including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and three congresswomen of color) in her crosshairs. The great majority of her Republican colleagues agreed, but House Democrats threw her off her committees.\n\nAlas, that won't cancel Greene. I feel freed, she said Friday and added (irony alert!), I'm going to be holding the Republican Party accountable and pushing them to the right.\n\nMissouri Sen. Josh Hawley is another victim of cancel culture. He lost a book contract. That is, as they say, a first-world problem. He quickly got another publisher and, last I heard, he is still in the Senate — even though he was a ringleader of efforts to block a routine and peaceful transfer of power from President Donald Trump to Biden, the fight that fueled the Capitol insurrection.\n\nNo discussion of entitlement would be complete without a nod to Trump, the king of grievance. Nobody was ever nice or grateful enough to him, from governors to the news media to Ukraine's president to Georgia's secretary of state. Nothing was ever his fault, especially America's abysmal and tragic coronavirus response.\n\nAnd it was of course not his fault that he lost the election, because, in fact, he won — by a landslide! If it seemed like voters had canceled him, well, that was fraud on a scale never seen before, because the election was stolen by radical Democrats and the fake news media. So head for the Capitol and fight for right: You don't concede when there's theft involved. Senators will decide in the trial starting this week whether they'll let Trump get away with this deadly incitement.\n\nArmed and annoyed:House members aren't an elite excused from rules on guns, security and respect for police\n\nNot that there's much suspense, given the GOP path since it embraced Trump and, in the memorable phrase from the late New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, defined deviancy down. Moynihan was talking about mental health, family structure and crime. Trump has spearheaded the downward redefinition of personal responsibility. The expectation is that bad behavior will carry no consequences, and if there are some, that's liberals trying to cancel conservatives.\n\nFrom personal responsibility to Trump\n\nThroughout the Reagan-Bush era — in 1980, 1984 and 1988 — Republican Party platforms emphasized people's personal responsibility for their own health and wellness, and the role of personal responsibility in national life. The 1984 document said schools had lost sight of their traditional task of developing good character and moral discernment. The result for many was a decline in personal responsibility.\n\nIn 1992, the phrase made the top three values — individual freedom, hard work and personal responsibility — the GOP platform said were basic to free society and effective government. The party also said the real solution to stopping the spread of AIDS was personal responsibility and moral behavior, not condoms and clean needles.\n\nA language he understands:Biden administration should sue Donald Trump to pay for Capitol riot cleanup\n\nThe 2000 Republican platform cited our long tradition of personal responsibility as the first of three foremost reasons that America is a great country. The 2016 platform focused on the responsibility of spouses to each other and their children within traditional marriage. This is the platform Trump ran on — he of the three marriages, Access Hollywood p---y-grabbing disaster and payoffs to buy silence from a porn star and a Playboy playmate about their alleged affairs with him.\n\nMost Republican senators have signaled they will vote to acquit Trump of inciting the deadly Capitol insurrection. They will not cancel him, convict him or ban him from holding future office. He will, once again, evade consequences. And the GOP (now an acronym for Grievances On Parade) will complete its journey to a planet far, far away from the principles of personal responsibility that Republicans once at least pretended to hold close.\n\nJill Lawrence is the commentary editor of USA TODAY and author of The Art of the Political Deal: How Congress Beat the Odds and Broke Through Gridlock.

Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt comes as no surprise but Bristol Palin's second baby's father went to social media to declare himself: Her ex, Marine Medal of Honor recipient Dakota Meyer.\n\nWhat's surprising is that he also went to court to declare he wants custody of the baby.\n\nBest Christmas present ever! Meyer, 27, wrote next to a picture of the baby in a post soon after Sailor Grace Palin was born in Alaska on Dec. 23. I couldn't be more proud of this little blessing.\n\nMeyer and Palin have been estranged since their plans for marriage collapsed last spring, just a month before the unmarried Palin announced that she was pregnant with her second out-of-wedlock baby.\n\nPalin, saying she can't help myself, posted more cute pictures on her Instagram of Sailor with her elder child, Tripp Johnston.\n\nAlthough Palin has never confirmed it, and defiantly dismissed all questions about paternity, it seemed obvious that Meyer was the father since she described on her blog that the pregnancy was planned, but she just got ahead of myself.\n\nHer lawyer, John Tiemessen, said Wednesday that Palin will not comment further.\n\nMeyer's claim of paternity followed the birth announcement on Palin's Instagram.\n\nThat was followed shortly by a blog post from her mom, 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who hailed the news:\n\nOh, perfect love! The best gift ever!, she wrote in the post, which included a picture of her cuddling with the baby. She said the most important people in Bristol's life were there to witness the birth in Alaska. She did not mention the father.\n\nOnly days later Sarah Palin was slamming Meyer in an interview Monday with Entertainment Tonight, after Meyer filed for joint custody of the baby and for child support from Bristol, according to documents seen by TMZ.\n\nSarah Palin says Meyer, a former Marine Corps sergeant decorated for bravery in Afghanistan, was trying to save face, although it wasn't clear what she meant. But her main point was clear: Meyer has been AWOL up to now.\n\nFor many months we have been trying to reach out to Dakota Myers (sic) and he has wanted nothing to do with either Bristol's pregnancy or the baby, she said in a statement to ET.\n\nBristol's publicist, David Martin, issued a statement commenting on Meyer: My values are such that a real American hero doesn't ask for child support.\n\nOther than that, Bristol's new pictures and video on Instagram — showing her with her family, including Sarah, target shooting — may sum up her current mood:
Lori Vallow, the mother of the two Idaho children missing since September, allegedly believed she was a god and married self-published author, Chad Daybell, who wrote dozens of books on apocalyptic events and near-death experiences.\n\nThe bizarre case spans multiple states and suspicious death investigations as Joshua JJ Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, have not been seen since Sept. 23 in Rexburg, Idaho.\n\nVallow failed to meet a court-ordered deadline to produce her children to authorities by Jan. 30, and she and Daybell were last seen in Hawaii without the children.\n\nVallow and Daybell married just weeks after his ex-wife, Tammy Daybell, died in October, and her ex-husband, Charles Vallow, was allegedly killed in July by her late brother, Alex Cox, whose December death remains under investigation, too.\n\nLori Vallow and her children moved to Idaho over the summer, but she never reported them missing and has not been cooperative in the investigation, police say. The couple has not been charged. Chad and Tammy Daybell had five children of their own.\n\nUnderpinning the investigation are the alleged religious beliefs that she held and raised concerns among relatives since the children have gone missing.\n\nLori Vallow claimed she was 'a god,' divorce records show\n\nCharles Vallow claimed Lori Vallow didn't want anything to do with him or Joshua because she had a more important mission to carry out, according to the court documents. Charles said Lori claimed she was a god assigned to carry out the work of the 144,000 at Christ's second coming in July 2020, the court documents said.\n\nShe also told Charles that she would kill him if he got in her way and that she had an angel there to help her dispose of the body, court documents said. Shortly after her alleged threats, Charles took out an order of protection against Lori Vallow, according to court documents.\n\nCharles claimed that Lori Vallow had become infatuated and, at times, obsessive about near-death experiences and spiritual visions, according to court documents. He said he attempted to get her help; however, she refused to visit a doctor because they would discover that she is a translated being, court documents said.\n\nChad Daybell's autobiography centers on near-death experiences\n\nIn his 2017 autobiography, Living on the Edge of Heaven, Chad Daybell depicts a deeply spiritual life in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. From his early years in Utah, death and near-death experiences for him and others surround his life.\n\nHe says his first near-death experience came in high school when he was cliff jumping. He had just been injured in a ski accident and almost hit in the head by a golf ball in the weeks leading up. When he jumped off the cliff into the water, he said it felt like his head hit concrete but he soon realized my spirit was partly out of my body, Daybell wrote.\n\nDuring those few moments I could see on the other side of the veil ... an endless white plain in all directions. ... I also felt tangible energy particles of knowledge rushing toward me from all directions. I just soaked it all in, he wrote.\n\nThroughout the book, Daybell writes about being in the presence of spirits, both of his relatives and of others. He says he often felt these spiritual presences directly intervene in his life.\n\nHe and his late wife, Tammy, went to the same high school and began dating after he returned from his mission, a period for young Mormon adults to proselytize or otherwise serve beyond their homes. Daybell and Tammy got engaged after dating for 10 weeks and married in March 1990, he wrote.\n\nWhile traveling in San Diego, as a young father, Daybell said he had his second near-death experience when a 15-foot wave barreled toward him as he was near a rock formation on the beach. Daybell wrote a voice told him to cling to a rock as the wave crashed down.\n\nThen my surroundings changed and I found myself in the proverbial tunnel of light. It wasn't a bright white light, but more like a yellow heat lamp. It felt like I was wrapped in a warm blanket or a cocoon, and I felt extremely happy, he wrote.\n\nHe said he saw two relatives, including his late grandfather, who explained the tasks I needed to accomplish and asked if I would be willing to fulfill the assignments he had outlined, and I agreed to do so.\n\nDaybell, who worked as a journalist and at a cemetery, eventually began writing novels, which featured time travel and relied on his and relative's life experiences.\n\nDaybell says that as he wrote one novel, Escape to Zion in 2000, he had a repeated dream that the Twin Towers in New York City were burning. He said he included the dream in the book, and it kind of threw me for a loop when it actually happened a year later. Daybell said he also had visions of one of his children being run over by a car.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Daybell was working at a Mormon book publisher and left after three years to start his own publishing company, where he published novels based on visions of the decline and downfall of the United States and an upcoming foreign invasion of America.\n\nHowever, book sales stalled during the Great Recession, and Daybell hit pause on the company. Daybell described how the decision took a toll on Tammy and his marriage. He said Tammy began playing Frontierville, a spinoff of the social media game Farmville, for hours on end and received a vision from her grandmother, who told him to have Tammy quit her d--- computer game cold turkey.\n\nAnother vision in 2015 led the Daybells to move to Rexburg, where he said his wife and children were happy. This is not an indication anyone else needs to pack up and head to Idaho. It just happens to be what our family needed to do at this time, he wrote.\n\nHowever, Daybell wrote he still believes in an ominous vision coming true: I don't know when an earthquake will come, but I have seen in vision the damage it will cause. I hope we still have a few years before it strikes, but it would be best to be prepared if it comes sooner.\n\nRelatives say Lori Vallow joined 'radical,' 'cult' group\n\nBrandon Boudreaux is the ex-husband of Lori Vallow's niece, Melani Boudreaux. He was shot at by an unknown assailant in October driving in a Jeep registered to Charles Vallow and believes the attack, Charles' death and the children's disappearance are connected to a religious group Lori Vallow joined about 18 months ago.\n\nI just don't know how people can get so wrapped up that they can end up in this space where these people are. It's just so radical, so different, Boudreaux said.\n\nHis wife began spending time with Lori and the religious group and suddenly demanded a divorce over the summer, Boudreaux said.\n\nI thought I had a happy marriage, so it was pretty overwhelming, he said.\n\nBefore the divorce was final, the attempted shooting outside his home occurred. Police later confirmed that the vehicle was registered to Charles Vallow, who had died months before.\n\nA Facebook post by Kay Woodcock, Joshua's biological grandmother and Charles Vallow's sister, says Lori was a wonderful, loving, attentive mother until things started changing in the past 18 months because of her involvement with a new religious group, which Woodcock called a cult.\n\nBoth Daybell and Vallow were involved in an organization called Preparing A People, which has said it is not a 'group' and is not a 'Cult' or something people join in a posted statement on its website.\n\nColby Ryan, Lori Vallow's oldest son, told KSAZ-TV in Phoenix that he had never known about some of his mother's extreme beliefs.\n\nRyan, 23, who grew up and still considers himself religious, said his mother would ask about his beliefs but never stated her own.\n\nI didn't know what she was reading. I didn't know the full belief system of what was going on. So I had no idea that there was a shift, he told the TV station.\n\nTylee Ryan's aunt, Annie Cushing, told KSL-TV Lori Vallow had always been religious but became obsessed with the end times in recent years.\n\nCushing is the sister of Joseph Ryan, another ex-husband of Lori Vallow who died in 2018.\n\nIt's like she wanted me to be afraid of the end times, Cushing told the TV station. There was one time where she was talking about it and she says, 'Sometimes, I think it would be better just to put my kids in a car and go off the side of a cliff.'\n\nA string of suspicious deaths\n\nSince Joshua and Tylee have gone missing, both Chad Daybell's wife and Lori Vallow's brother died under circumstances that police are still investigating.\n\nTammy Daybell, 49 and a mother of five, died Oct. 19 of what authorities initially believed were natural causes. She was buried days later.\n\nWhen announcing in December Joshua and Tylee were missing, police in Rexburg said Tammy Daybell's death may be suspicious. Her remains were exhumed Dec. 11, and an autopsy has since been conducted, with results pending.\n\nHowever, KSAZ-TV reported that the Daybell family didn't want an autopsy after Tammy died. The TV station reported police detective Ryan Pillar in Gilbert, Arizona, called a Fremont County, Idaho, sheriff's dispatcher to ask about the case.\n\nWe just have some cases down here that got our attention with Mrs. Daybell, Pillar told the dispatcher, KSAZ-TV reported. The dispatcher said the coroner and a deputy arrived on the scene after Tammy's death, but no autopsy was done initially.\n\nThey just kinda looked at her, and I was advised that the family didn't want an autopsy and they just went to the funeral home and the family refused an autopsy, the dispatcher told the detective, KSAZ-TV reported.\n\nIn Alex Cox's death, the brother of Lori Vallow, KSAZ-TV also reported that a 911 call revealed that a 25-year-old man who said he was the son of Cox's girlfriend called for an ambulance when he found Cox passed out at home on Dec. 12. Police were awaiting autopsy results to determine a cause of death.\n\nCox fatally shot Charles Vallow, 62, Lori Vallow's ex-husband, on July 11 as Charles Vallow had come from Texas to Chandler, Arizona, where Lori Vallow and her children were living at the time.\n\nAccording to police, Cox shot Charles Vallow twice in the chest during a fight. He claimed self-defense and told officers Charles had hit him with bat after an earlier argument with Lori.\n\nReports released in January show detectives were investigating the shooting as second-degree murder with the case still pending before Cox died.\n\nCharles Vallow was Lori's second ex-spouse to die within recent years. Joseph Ryan, the biological father of Tylee Ryan, died of an apparent heart attack in 2018 in Gilbert, KSAZ-TV reported. Lori Vallow has been married a total of five times, East Idaho News reported.\n\nAfter police announced Joshua and Tylee were missing, an attorney, Sean Bartholick, issued a statement on the couple's behalf, calling Chad Daybell a loving husband and Lori Vallow a devoted mother.\n\nContributing: Jessica Boehm, Rachel Leingang and Uriel Garcia, Arizona Republic\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller
Elysa Gardner\n\n@elysagardner, USA TODAY\n\nWhen Oscar Hammerstein II and Jerome Kern wrote Show Boat, the work that launched American musical theater as we know it, it surely never occurred to them to publish a book documenting their achievement and reflecting on its social and cultural significance.\n\nThat was then. Nearly 90 years and many groundbreaking musicals later, artists are expected to engage their fans through modern technology. No one has been savvier about this than Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator and star of the lavishly acclaimed Broadway smash Hamilton and now co-author of Hamilton: The Revolution (Grand Central, 288 pp., * * * ½ out of four stars).\n\nCo-author Jeremy McCarter — who knew Miranda in Hamilton's earliest stages, and served on the artistic staff of the Public Theater, where the musical was developed and premiered — explains in his introduction that this companion volume chronicles two revolutions. There's the American Revolution of the 18th century, and there's that of Hamilton itself, a musical that changes the way that Broadway sounds...that lets us glimpse the new, more diverse America rushing our way.\n\nHyperbole? No. I used the word revolutionary in my review (as did others), a fair term for a show that seamlessly and exuberantly fuses two great American forms of storytelling, hip-hop and musical theater. And indeed, both Miranda's account of Caribbean-born founding father Alexander Hamilton's unlikely rise and the production's canny multi-racial casting drive home the fact that we are an ever-evolving nation of immigrants.\n\nAll these factors are explored in the book, which includes Miranda's dazzling libretto in full — doled out between essays that provide background on historical figures featured in the musical and the actors who play them, as well as Miranda's invaluable creative team. Hamilton's journey is detailed, cleverly, in the kind of typeface you would have spotted on a broadsheet in colonial Williamsburg, with coffee-table-worthy photos taking us onstage and behind the scenes.\n\nThere is pride, reverence and humor in accounts of the mutual admiration Miranda has established with cultural A-listers, from historian Ron Chernow — whose biography Alexander Hamilton inspired the musical — to Questlove and Stephen Sondheim, or The God MC Sondheezy, as Miranda calls him. One chapter documents Hamilton's outreach to public schools, and includes a rap for marriage equality written by one student.\n\nAnother famous Hamilton fan is mentioned several times. It's noted that before Barack Obama became our first African-American president, he introduced himself, as a senator at the 2004 Democratic Convention, by telling his own story — a reference to a prominent lyric and theme in the musical.\n\nNo one could tell Hamilton's story more comprehensively than the man who conceived it, and for that reason Revolution is a must-read for admirers — whether you've scored a ticket or not.
Hoai-Tran Bui\n\nUSATODAY\n\nJ.J. Abrams may be one of the biggest names in Hollywood now thanks to a little sci-fi film called Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but that doesn't mean he's too big for the small screen.\n\nIn fact, the sci-fi director may have done some of his best work on TV, with his shows like Alias and Lost becoming cultural phenomenons. He's not known for sticking around with his shows for the entirety of their runs -- he's more of a concept and pilot episode guy -- but he's had a hand in creating, executive producing and writing (the beginnings of) some of the most beloved TV shows to date.\n\nSo, with his newest show, the Hulu series in collaboration with Stephen King 11.22.63, out, we revisit and rank all of the pilot episodes for Abrams' TV shows.\n\n11. Revolution (2012)\n\nThe bottom of a pretty good barrel, Revolution's pilot suffers from being a bad indicator of how good the show would eventually become. It's too sleek, and there are too many sexy people running around in midriff-baring tank tops to pay attention to a concept that is actually intriguing.\n\nRevolution takes place 15 years after a worldwide blackout causes everything that relies on electricity to stop working without explanation In the chaos that descended, militant regimes have taken over the remnants of civilization, and suddenly everyone's an expert at fighting with machetes.\n\nSadly, the pilot skips the intrigue (and keeps its best star, Lost alum Elizabeth Mitchell, out of the picture) to go straight to the generic dystopian post-apocalyptic tropes.\n\n10. Alcatraz (2012)\n\nAnother frustratingly dull exercise in an stellar concept, Alcatraz is a police procedural with a time travel twist.\n\nStarring Sam Neil, another Lost alum, Jorge Garcia, and an unfortunately bland lead Sarah Jones, the show revolves around the famous island prison of Alcatraz, in which 256 inmates and 46 guards mysteriously disappeared without a trace one night in 1963. In the modern day, these criminals start to resurface at the same age they were when they disappeared, and our main team -- comprised of an FBI agent, an Alcatraz history expert and a police detective -- give merry chase.\n\nThe first episode is a little too cop procedural and not enough cryptic. Plus, it hurts when your main character is just plain boring.\n\n9. Undercovers (2010)\n\nA pre-fame Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the co-lead of the spy romp Undercovers which is equal parts silly and sexy.\n\nFollowing a married couple who gave up their lives as CIA agents to run a catering company in LA, the pair (Mbatha-Raw and Boris Kodjoe) find themselves pulled back into the spy life due to the disappearance of their fellow spy friend. Globe-trotting spy adventures ensue, and you got yourself a Mr. and Mrs. Smith-style series.\n\nAbrams directed this pilot -- his first TV directorial credit since the Lost pilot in 2004 -- and you could tell that he's having fun. But maybe a little too much fun? The pilot feels a little frivolous -- heavy on the banter, but not on the plot.\n\n8. 11.22.63 (2016)\n\nA truly Stephen Kingsian plot -- the main character is a writer in Maine who encounters an inexplicable time travel portal to 1960 in a diner -- is elevated by Abrams' great grasp of intrigue. But then it's dragged back down by the nonsensical actions of the characters.\n\nJames Franco stars in the Hulu series (streaming now) as a writing teacher who decides to follow through with the crazed directions of the diner owner who showed him the portal, and go back in time to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\nIt's a great concept, and the scenes in which mysterious tragedies occur whenever Franco's Jake Epping tries to change the past are genuinely terrifying, but Jake's actions are questionable at best -- why risk all this just on the directions of a diner owner with a good conspiracy theory? His motivations are a bit muddied, but the pilot does a nice job of keeping us interested despite that.\n\n7. Person of Interest (2011)\n\nAnother pilot that nearly fails to indicate what a great show it would turn into, Person of Interest leans a bit too heavily on the procedural element and not enough on the futuristic technology around which the show revolves.\n\nA machine invented by eccentric billionaire Harold Finch (Lost alum Michael Emerson) has the ability to predict future terrorist attacks, and Finch recruits jaded former CIA agent John Reese (Jim Caviezel) to help him stop them. The nifty Minority Report-esque concept gets a little buried by the cop-partner dynamic thanks to a straight-laced NYPD detective played by Taraji P. Henson, but thanks to an always great and unsettling performance by Emerson, there's potential.\n\n6. Almost Human (2013)\n\nA futuristic cop procedural, Almost Human has shades of Blade Runner in its concept of police detectives who get partnered with humanoid robots to help combat rising crime.\n\nKarl Urban growls his way through a sleek and action-packed pilot that is both hindered and helped by an almost too-human performance by his robot partner, played by Michael Ealy. Because of the future setting in 2048, the cop procedural format feels more new and inventive, and the main leads' performances balance out some pretty flat acting from some the supporting characters.\n\n5. What About Brian (2006)\n\nA zippy rom-com pilot starring that dude from 7th Heaven (Barry Watson), What About Brian is a surprisingly fun and intelligent show about a group of friends who are all well on their way to stable adulthoods -- marriage, kids -- except for their one friend Brian. Instead, he's busy hooking up with girls he crashes his car into (oh hey Pink Ranger Amy Jo Johnson!) and mooning over his best friend's girlfriend.\n\nThere's some soap opera drama -- Brian's in love with his best friend's girlfriend, but she may no longer be his girlfriend, oh wait, she still is! -- and some sluggish sub-plots involving one of the married couples, but the genuinely likable cast and snappy dialogue keep the pilot on the grounded side.\n\n4. Fringe (2008)\n\nThe eerie gross-out horror is balanced by a stoic and endearing performance by leads Anna Torv, Joshua Jackson and John Noble. Abrams' take on the X-Files has more than enough similarities to its predecessor, but is slightly more awkward and stiff during its pilot episode. Fringe also has the problem of the pilot being lesser than the rest of the series, but its still a great introduction to the series.\n\nFringe's pilot is about an FBI agent, Olivia Dunham, who gets pulled into the world of fringe science after her partner and boyfriend gets injured during a case. She enlists the help of a mad doctor and his son to solve the case, and thus starts a beautiful and quirky team dynamic.\n\nThe callbacks to Lost (the first case is a bunch of dead passengers on a plane) and the emphasis on horror over science-fiction made the Fringe pilot a truly great watch.\n\n3. Felicity (1998)\n\nOne of Abrams' most beloved shows, it's no surprise Felicity has one of his best pilots.The pilot almost feels like a feature-length coming-of-age film, with a wonderfully vulnerable Keri Russell at its center.\n\nCollege freshman Felicity is a straight-A student with her life as a doctor planned out for her, she suddenly decides to follow a boy she had a crush on in high school across the country to New York University. Although she almost immediately regrets her decision, she decides to stay after forming bonds with classmates and her RA, and deciding that this spontaneous whim was actually the best thing she's ever done.\n\nEven nearly 20 years later, the pilot still feels fresh, and Felicity's struggle with her identity and her future still feels just as raw and endearing as it did in 1998.\n\n2. Alias (2001)\n\nAlias' pilot also benefits from feeling like a feature film, and you can tell why Abrams was scouted out to direct the Mission: Impossible movies after watching 10 minutes of this show. It's action-packed, gripping and feels completely fresh thanks to a great performance by Jennifer Garner.\n\nSydney Bristow is a grad student who works as a covert CIA agent, going on missions in between her midterm exams. But things take a turn for the tragic when she decides to tell her fiance about her double life, and her agency, SD-6, takes extreme measures against him. Thrown by her violent loss, Sydney soon learns that her agency was actually a criminal espionage organization, and she had been working for the enemy all along. She becomes a double agent for the real CIA, and the series has only just started.\n\nAlias expertly plays with the rom-com expectations for Abrams (he had up until that point only been known for Felicity), and wonderfully juggles Sydney's double life in college and as a spy.\n\n1. Lost (2004)\n\nUnquestionably Abrams' greatest pilot -- and arguably, one of the best TV pilots to date -- Lost had the perfect mixture of action, intrigue and emotion.\n\nFollowing the survivors of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815, Lost switches between present day and flashback, fleshing out the apparent strangers on the plane who are forced together due to tragic circumstances. Not only does it successfully balance out these two timelines, the pilot also manages to throw in Lord of the Flies-style conflict between the characters as well as cryptic happenings on the island that endanger and confuse the survivors even more.\n\nAbrams directed and wrote the pilot -- one of the most expensive TV pilots up until then -- and created a launching pad for Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse to turn Lost into one of the most enthralling and frustrating shows out there.\n\nIt's the show that Abrams will arguably always be known for, and will have us questioning with each new show he develops, Guys, where are we?\n\nNot included: Believe (2014) and Six Degrees (2006), because it's nearly impossible to find streaming episodes for either of these.
I'm gay.\n\nThose two words became the rallying cry against locker room-centric homophobia, starting with a surge in professional athletes and sports figures coming out with their sexual orientation in 2013.\n\nThe first significant player was NBA veteran Jason Collins, who came out in April of 2013. A few months later, college defensive line Michael Sam came out to his Missouri teammates, and became the first openly gay pro football player on a roster when the St. Louis Rams drafted him in 2014. In 2013, WNBA star Brittney Griner publicly came out as lesbian in a profile with USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe number of athletes coming out increased during the second term of President Barack Obama, and as same-sex marriage was legalized by the Supreme Court in June of 2015. Milwaukee Brewers minor leaguer David Denson came out as gay that August. In October, Bryant University men's basketball assistant Chris Burns became the first Division I men's coach in college basketball to come out publicly in a profile with USA TODAY Sports, drawing the praise of Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nI think we did see a domino effect of athletes coming out in high-profile sports, said San Diego Loyal soccer player Collin Martin, currently the only publicly out male athlete in any of the major American sports. It's clear that a lot of progress happened under Barack Obama's administration. Sadly, sports (have) been slower to show the same type of LGBTQ representation as other entertainment fields, but that political progress still extended to (sports).\n\nThough there's no known official data, a lot of that progress, LGBTQ activists believe, was slowed when President Donald Trump entered the White House in 2017.\n\nTrump's war of words with professional athletes has been well documented. LGBTQ advocates also argue that Trump's policies went beyond disputes and were discriminatory to their community, particularly to the transgender community, where Trump oversaw the rollback of rights targeting them.\n\nThe Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) created the Trump Accountability Act, a resource which catalogues the anti-LGBTQ statements and actions of the Trump administration.\n\nI wasn't going to let Trump's Presidency or a tougher time politically affect my decision to come out, said Martin, who came out in 2018 when he played for the MLS' Minnesota United. More than ever, we need athletes to come out in the public spotlight. Female athletes are way ahead of male athletes still because homophobic language isn't as pervasive (for girls) as it is for boys in youth sports.\n\nThere's been a lengthy examination of Trump and race in sports, beginning with Colin Kaepernick and the NFL protests in 2016, and the vociferous objections to Trump's racial policies and views from NBA stars such as LeBron James and Gregg Popovich.\n\nWhat's rarely been publicly examined is Trump's impact on the LGBTQ community as it relates to sports, and how the relationship will change as the presidency shifts from Trump to Biden.\n\nDid Trump's presidency play a part in slowing the overall progress in the sports realm – where there's been a shortage of openly gay high-profile athletes in men's sports – as compared to Obama's second term? And will Biden's presumed lack of resistance to LGBTQ issues act as a sail instead of a wall as Trump did?\n\nAssessing Trump's impact on the LGBTQ community is in some ways obvious, and in others it isn't. After all, the coming-out stories haven't exactly stopped over the last four years. Just in October of 2019, NFL free agent Ryan Russell came out as bisexual.\n\nBut as Joe Biden's presidency is set to begin on Inauguration Day on Wednesday, it may not take long to see the difference in how the Biden and Trump administrations treat the LGBTQ community.\n\nIt's hard to say Donald Trump hasn't played a significant role in impeding progress for LGBTQ people as a whole, said Greenburgh-North Castle (New York) High School athletic director Anthony Nicodemo, a gay high school basketball coach who teaches politics. Then in the sports world, where homophobia and toxic masculinity already exist, we're talking about a lot of fear factors that can make being your true self challenging.\n\nBiden announced that in his first 100 days in office he's pledging to enact the Equality Act – federal legislation that would add LGBTQ protections to existing federal civil rights law.\n\nThe rainbow flag was waving for the Obama administration, Nicodemo said. The natural climate was rolled back culturally with Trump simply remaining silent (on LGBTQ) issues. We saw a seismic shift after the (George W.) Bush administration because Obama was a ground-breaker as an African-American. Joe Biden is not a groundbreaker, even with Kamala Harris as a vice president. But having a president (in Biden) who I believe has great empathy for all people will go a long way.\n\nWaiting on a big name\n\nDespite all the inclusive progress in the sports world over the past decade, there has yet to be a prominent All-Star or Pro Bowl name in a top-five men's sport to come out.\n\nComing out of the closet is about your own personal timeline so coming out stories will happen in waves, said former NFL player Ryan O'Callaghan, who came out after retiring in June of 2017 near the start of Trump's presidency, and now says he counsels several closeted professional athletes. But fear plays a large factor as a societal (force) and nothing about Trump's presidency felt safe to anyone who is closeted. Coming out as gay is going to continue to be a big deal or news story for athletes until it's a regular occurrence. We're not there yet.\n\nBilly Bean, the MLB's Vice President and Special Assistant to the Commissioner, said the political climate could've played a slight factor in an athlete's personal decision to stay closeted.\n\nOver the last several years, people have been rewarded for divisive activity, especially on social media, and the (political) culture galvanized people who maybe were afraid to be homophobic or racist, Bean said. Culture is not easy to change. Homophobia and racism and most men feminizing each other growing up have been built over 100 years so it takes a while to take that wall down.\n\nLGBTQ expert Cyd Zeigler, the co-founder of Outsports – an online magazine that showcases athletes and their coming-out stories – said other measuring sticks are more important than Trump's influence. He notes that the number of athletes who have come out skyrocketed since 2013 when 77 athletes (including high school and different college divisions) came out publicly.\n\nOutsports tracked 184 coming-out stories in 2017. Zeigler said that female athletes' coming out stories, in particular, have significantly increased.\n\nWho is in the White House is like the 12th most important influence for not coming out, Zeigler said. Donald Trump is not homophobic so I don't think we're going to see an incredible wave of people coming out because of the Biden administration. If anything, (Biden's) presidency could just accelerate the momentum already in place.\n\nThe No. 1 (detriment) in athletes coming out is pro athletes and their agents who will say coming out is too risky.\n\nTo some, Sam's coming out experience is a cautionary tale. Sam, citing mental health reasons, abruptly retired in 2015. Sam said in a February 2019 speech that he regretted coming out when he did and added the NFL gave me a raw deal.\n\nSam never played a game with the Rams after being drafted in the seventh round as the reigning SEC defensive player of the year. He later became a practice-squad player with the Dallas Cowboys and had a brief stint with the CFL's Montréal Alouettes. Sam's agents at the time encouraged him to go on Dancing with the Stars shortly before his retirement.\n\nYou can't ignore what happened there, O'Callaghan said. Michael had a media circus focusing on his sexuality and I think the PR team he had in place didn't serve him well. But it's unfair to suggest he didn't make the team because of his sexual orientation.\n\nOne thing I do tell guys, if they come out, is that your play on the field has to speak louder than everyone in the media or public talking about your sexuality. I think a great political comparison is Pete Buttigieg. At first, he was known as the 'gay politician.' But then all the sudden he stood out because he was bright, elegant and a war veteran. Then the gay title was taken out and he was Mayor Pete. Being gay was a part of who he was. It has to be the same kind of thing for an athlete.\n\n'Braver ... in some ways'\n\nLGBTQ athletes and advocates say Trump's presidency amplified the need for bravery.\n\nOlympic figure skater Adam Rippon publicly sparred with Vice President Mike Pence in 2017 ahead of the Pyeongchang Games, condemning Pence's longstanding anti-gay beliefs.\n\nPublicly out women's soccer star Megan Rapinoe famously fought with Trump over social media during the 2019 Women's World Cup. Rapinoe was quoted as saying to Trump, your message is excluding people that look like me. …you're harking back to an era that was not great for everyone.\n\nThe President of the United States sets the tone for the country and I think Trump's discrimination made it less safe but it made us braver as a country in some ways, Nicodemo said. What happened in the last four years for the country was a social justice movement that actually got us somewhere now as a country we've never been before – ready for serious change. We don't have an out athlete in the NBA, the NFL, the MLB or the NHL. It's hard to imagine that will stay the same with our country being more welcoming at the top.\n\nZeigler said there's an inevitability for more publicly out male athletes based on the generational transformation. In 2019, there were eight publicly out college football players and those eight were more in one year than anyone else who came before them combined.\n\nThese closeted athletes spend their whole professional lives living in fear that they'll be outed, but if there's a safe locker room environment that says, 'this is OK,' then that changes, Zeigler said. Imagine living your life fearing a tiger ready to pounce on you and kill you. That's what it feels like to be closeted and not want your teammates or the public to find out. But when your teammates accept you, then you believe the world can, too.\n\nThat inevitability for change is highlighted in the political arena where 334 openly LGBTQ candidates won office in the 2020 elections – the highest ever mark in any election year.\n\nBean, who came out as gay at the end of his MLB playing days in 1999, said a new era has been ushered in to offset fear walls of the past thanks to more inclusiveness in younger generations and advocacy work atop sports leagues.\n\nThere's no question the data suggests we're seeing a higher number of scholastic and college-level students to come out because they're inundated with amazing friends. Peer acceptance is 90% of the decision, Bean said. We've been building the cornerstone for acceptance at the highest level, and there's been a cultural shift in locker rooms. When I was a player, I was listening to what the stars were saying and I felt like their language told me to keep my secret. Now, the stars are being inclusive. That alone makes us ready to have more athletes come out.\n\nI would rather a player in environment where a (closeted) athlete feels loved and accepted for a while before make decision to publicly come out. I think we're there.\n\nFollow national sports enterprise reporter Scott Gleeson on Twitter @ScottMGleeson.
Spoiler alert! The following contains details from True Detective, Season 3, Episode 1, The War and Modern Memory and Episode 2, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye, both of which aired Sunday, Jan. 13.\n\nTrue Detective 2014's debut was a perfect storm of elements for a zeitgeisty hit.\n\nIt starred Matthew McConaughey in the middle of his McConnaissance, in which the star rebranded himself from a stoner/rom-com love interest into a Serious Actor, with his Oscar-winning turn in Dallas Buyers Club. It was an early adopter of the limited-series formula that resets each season, and its ability to lure A-list talent like McConaughey and Woody Harrelson was also relatively novel. It was the big debut of director Cary Fukunaga, to whom many credit the brilliance of that first season. Its multiple-timelines story of death and abuse was grim, graphic and so much more adult than other detective shows.\n\nIts return in 2015 for Season 2 was wildly disappointing. Rachel McAdams, Vince Vaughn and Taylor Kitsch starred in a new chapter set among the rich and dirty SoCal set that was critically lambasted.\n\nIt's clear from the first moments of the newest season, which arrived with Sunday's two-hour HBO premiere, that creator Nic Pizzolatto is trying to atone for Season 2. Season 3, starring Mahershala Ali, so closely resembles the McConaughey and Harrelson season it might as well be a remake. That first season had three timelines, was set in Louisiana and investigated ritualistic murder and rape. Season 3 also has three timelines, concerns a ritualistic crime against children and is set in Arkansas. Like McConaughey, Ali is in the midst of an Oscar campaign – for Green Book.\n\nFor fans who wanted to see exactly what they loved about Season 1 all over again, the new season will suffice. It's certainly an improvement on Season 2. But what Pizzolatto forgets is that the second season wasn't bad because it told a different story; it was bad because it was boring and pretentious.\n\nSeason 3 fixes some of that, at least. It's not like the acting isn't good or the mystery isn't interesting. But it all just feels a bit tired and occasionally forced, a further reminder of what we learned in Season 2 – you can't re-create a phenomenon, no matter how hard you try.\n\nThe real change is that, even though Ali's lawman Wayne Hays has a partner, Roland West (Stephen Dorff), this version of Detective is really the Oscar winner's show and story. The framing device shows Hays as an old man in 2015, recounting the story of his biggest case to a documentarian while struggling with dementia. We visit the past through his muddy memories, and his younger selves sometimes react or say things that he is experiencing in the future.\n\nThe two other timelines featured are 1990 and 1980. In 1980, two kids, Will and Julie Purcell (Lena McCarthy and Phoenix Elkin), go missing after leaving home on a bike ride, and Hays and West investigate. In 1990, whoever was convicted for any crimes associated with the kids (it's unclear at this point who that might be) is trying to get their case overturned, and Hays is called in for a deposition.\n\nAs Hays remembers, the crime was committed on the day Steve McQueen died. Will and Julie ask their father Tom (Scoot McNairy) if they can go to the playground to see their friend and his new dog. He tells them to be back in an hour and a half, and off they ride, passing neighbors, a creepy man with a go kart and a group of teen boys in a purple Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nWhen they don't return, Tom calls the police, and Hays and West are assigned to the case. Contrary to what Hays says in his 1990 deposition, the partners were not actually working, but drinking beer and shooting rats at a dump at the beginning of the night. It's in these early scenes that we get to know Hays, a Vietnam veteran, expert tracker and, like all True Detective lead characters, overly philosophical. Hays is also set up as a moral superior to West, because he doesn't allow his partner to kill a cute fox.\n\nThey're called to the Purcell house, where Tom is hysterical and resists their efforts to investigate the family, which is in chaos as he and his wife Lucy's (Mamie Gummer) marriage is on the rocks. Hays finds Playboy magazines under Will's bed and a peephole in his closet that looks into his sister's room, but it might have been put there by Lucy's adult male cousin, who stayed in Will's room for a few weeks while Will slept on the couch.\n\nAt the school, the detectives interview the teens from the purple Beetle, whose stories are inconsistent. And one is wearing a Black Sabbath T-shirt, which sets off Satanic alarm bells for West. The school is also the setting where West meets his future wife, Amelia (Carmen Ejogo), who in 2015, we learn, will write a classic book about the case.\n\nIt's at a search in the woods where Hays makes the biggest discovery in the case. Using tracking skills learned in Vietnam, he wanders off from the main search party, eventually coming upon a creepy straw doll that looks like a bride. He finds another one at the entrance of a cave, and inside he finds Will's body, his hands frozen in the prayer position (sound familiar?).\n\nHays is shaken and desperate to find Julie, but the final scenes in the 1990 deposition explain why this was a fool's errand in 1980. The conviction might be overturned because Julie's fingerprints were found at the site of a recent robbery. In 1990, she's alive. And here, our mystery really lies, as the first episode wraps up.\n\nThe second episode spends a great deal of time running in place. In 1980, finding Will's body ramps up the investigation, with the FBI called in. They get one good lead, with Amelia's help: A child at the school who has seen the dolls before. The kid says that someone was giving them out a week ago on Halloween, and Julie got one, but he doesn't remember when in the night or from what house.\n\nHays and West want to search every house on the kids' trick-or-treating route, striking quickly and quietly. The prosecutor Greg Larsen (Brett Cullen) resists, fearing it will anger his constituents. Instead he tells the public that Julie may have met her kidnapper on Halloween and publishes their route. The detectives take a side mission to beat up a pedophile that Vice tipped them to, but he doesn't yield any real leads, and mostly they just take out their anger on him.\n\nEventually they're called back to the Purcell house, where a note written in cut-out letters says Julie is fine and they should stop looking.\n\nIn 1990, Hays is desperate to find out more about Julie, but there isn't much to know. No one is investigating her, because the local cops are focused on the robbery. Amelia's book is about to come out, although perhaps it will be delayed after Hays tells her that Julie is alive.\n\nIn 2015, Hays is still participating in the documentary, against his son's wishes. The director (Sarah Gadon) says she has evidence that the case might be connected to a pedophile ring, and is sure Hays's input was dismissed due to racism, but Hays shrugs off her theories. He's only participating, he tells his son, because it's helping his memory. Although he seems to have trouble remembering that his daughter is estranged.\n\nInevitably, it's all very familiar, even if there isn't a Yellow King involved. Time is a flat circle and all that.
Jim Blankenship\n\nAdviceIQ\n\nSocial Security survivor's benefits become available when a Social Security recipient dies and leaves surviving dependents: a spouse, children and other dependent family members. For many, the benefits constitute a transfusion to diminished household budgets at a tough period of life. The devil's in the details of these benefits, though, and here are some answers you and yours need ahead of time.\n\nQ: What survivor benefits are available to my spouse?\n\nIf your spouse is at least age 60 (50 if disabled), he or she may qualify for a survivor benefit based on your benefit at death. Calculating the benefit factors in the age of your surviving spouse, the benefit status of the deceased spouse and when, if applicable, the deceased's benefits began.\n\nIf your surviving spouse is at the Full Retirement Age (FRA) of 67 for anyone born after 1960, he or she receives 100% of the benefit you got at the time of your death. The minimum benefit is 71.5% of yourprimary insurance amount (PIA), the amount one receives when filing for benefits at FRA.\n\nWills Are People Too\n\nIf your surviving spouse is younger than 60 and not disabled, the survivor benefit (75% of your PIA) becomes available only if your spouse cares for at least one child or dependent of yours younger than 16.\n\nQ: What survivor benefits are available to my other dependents?\n\nSurvivor benefits are available to minor children if you, the parent or legal guardian, die while holding at least 40 quarters of coverage (a quarter being three months of the year when you made, for this year's regulations, at least $1,200). For a child under 18, or age 19 for a full-time student, the benefit equals 75% of your PIA. If the child is disabled prior to age 22, this benefit last the child's lifetime.\n\nParents, grandparents or other dependents to whom you provided 50% or more support also get your 75% benefit.\n\nQ: What survivor benefits can I receive when my ex-husband dies?\n\nIf your marriage lasted for at least 10 years and you never remarried, you qualify for the same benefits as if you were married to your ex-husband when he died. In other words, you receive all the survivor's benefits he was entitled to. As long as you are 60 or older, you file for benefits based on your late ex-spouse's record.\n\nLife Insurance From Employer Issues\n\nQ: Are there any limits to the benefits paid on an individual decedent's record?\n\nA Family Maximum benefit (FMax) ranges from 150% to 180% of the primary number holder's PIA. If the total benefits paying on an individual record exceeds the FMax, all benefits are reduced pro rata to the maximum. Survivor benefits paid to an ex-spouse of the deceased do not count toward the FMax limit.\n\nQ: Are there any restrictions for a surviving spouse to receive survivor benefits?\n\nIf you are a surviving spouse who remarries before turning 60, you're ineligible for survivor benefits from your deceased spouse. If you subsequently end your next marriage or your subsequent spouse dies (meaning you're no longer married), survivor benefits once again become available to you. The same restriction applies to your ex-spouse.\n\nQ: Does receiving a survivor benefit affect my own retirement benefit? I am 60 and will qualify for a larger benefit based on my own record when I reach FRA.\n\nAs long as you are or will be eligible for the benefits, you can take either the survivor benefit first and switch to your own benefit later or vice versa. Filing for a survivor benefit early has no impact on your later retirement benefit; filing early for a retirement benefit also has no effect on your future survivor benefits.\n\nResolutions '16: Think Long Term\n\nQ: Are there earnings limits on survivor benefits?\n\nAs with other benefits, if you earn more than the annual limit in any year before you reach FRA, Social Security withholds $1 for every $2 over the limit ($15,480 in 2014). During the year that you will reach FRA, the limit increases to $41,400 and withheld benefits drop to $1 out of every $3 over the limit. These withheld funds are credited back to you once you reach FRA.\n\nThese limits apply to any survivor benefits, whether to a spouse, dependents or ex-spouse.\n\nQ: Are any benefits available if my late spouse lacked enough quarters of coverage?\n\nFor you, the surviving spouse caring for a child who's younger than 16, reduced benefits are available if your deceased spouse earned at least six quarters of credit in the three years prior to death. Any number of quarters between the minimum of six and the maximum of 40 allows for a phased increase in the benefit amount.\n\nAdviceIQ — @adviceiq on Twitter — is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Rep. Andy Biggs is often a man apart from the crowd, afar-right brawler often in the right place at the right time.\n\nSometimes, it's because of luck. More often, it's because the three-term Arizona Republican is content to go to battle where few others will,from attacking the mainstream medical response to the COVID-19 pandemic to spreading baseless conspiracy theories about President Joe Biden's ballot box victory on Nov. 3.\n\nWhile Biggs has always been known in Arizona as a conservative, his unwavering loyalty to former President Donald Trump, his potentially dangerous counter-programming on coronavirus measures and other moments have introduced his thinking to a wider audience.\n\nBiggs, 62, is by any measure among the most conservative members of Congress. His national stature as a political outlier only has grown in the stormy aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, when Biggs repeatedly raised doubtsto undermine the process and sought to set aside millions of legitimate votes. He also is among a group of Republican lawmakers under scrutiny over their roles in the run-up to the Jan. 6 riot in which supporters of former President Donald Trump ransacked the U.S. Capitol and five people died.\n\nBiggs, the chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, is sometimes viewed as a possibility for a U.S. Senate run next year that would test the appeal of his high-octane conservative message in a once-red state that is now considered purple.\n\nBiggs' conservative bona fides are undeniable.\n\nIn a past political life at the Arizona Legislature, Biggs emerged as a major supporter of Senate Bill 1070, the state's controversial immigration-enforcement law, and as the main GOP opponent to Medicaid expansion. Biggs' Washington allies include Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., newcomers who have quickly become among the House's most polarizing members. And he is cheered by many of the same Arizona Republican Party activists who recently voted to censure Gov. Doug Ducey, Cindy McCain and former Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.\n\nLarry Sabato, the political scientist who directs the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said Biggs hasn't overshadowed other arch-conservatives on Capitol Hill, such as Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Greene, but he has gotten everyone's attention.\n\nMore:'Around here, Trump is king': How Marjorie Taylor Greene got to Congress by running as the MAGA candidate\n\nAmong Democrats, he's a pariah, that's for sure, Sabato said. The more-mainstream Republicans in the House are becoming more and more aware of the Andy Biggses and the Marjorie Taylor Greenes. Not that he's as bad as she is, but, he's certainly embraced his share of conspiracy theories.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Republicans in the House do not want to be defined by people like Biggs and Greene and Jordan, Sabato said. There's a discussion at high levels in the Republican Party about, to be blunt, whether it's worth trying to change the Republican Party because the current version is way too far to the right, and the country is changing.\n\nA few months after Biden's narrow victory in Arizona and a string of other Democratic triumphs, Biggs has said he believes his state, if not the country as a whole, is poised to snap back to a more conservative agenda.\n\nIf it seems an unlikely bet, well, Biggs has beaten the odds more than once as he has risen through the political ranks.\n\nBiggs, who is increasingly a presence nationally on Fox News and other conservative media, declined The Arizona Republic's request for an interview.\n\nMany members of Congress, and those around them, have visions of a Senate run, said Tom Freestone, a longtime Phoenix-area politician said. But mounting such a race will require heavy fundraising and a mistake from either Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly or Sen. Kyrsten Sinema that neither has made to this point, he said.\n\nI think Andy Biggs plays his cards close to his vest, he said.\n\nTyler Montague, a Republican consultant who was on the losing end of Biggs' 2016 GOP primary victory, sees Biggs as drifting to the fringe of his party, limiting his political appeal in a state that has shifted more to the political middle.\n\nHe's kind of sabotaged his ability to win a statewide general election, Montague said. He's so used to playing far-right, red-meat politics that he doesn't know how to appeal across the spectrum, and he's done nothing but pour gas on that fire in this last year.\n\nHe's always been far right, but he's always had a certain dignity about him and a decorum. He's been on the thoughtful side. There was an intellectual heft to what he was doing, but I think he's lost that. I'll be surprised if he doesn't get primaried.\n\nCapitol riots: New videos emerge tying Andy Biggs to the 'Stop the Steal' movement\n\nGrowing up in Tucson, getting political\n\nIt would mean another political battle for a man who's been fighting them since childhood.\n\nBiggs, a Tucson native, was the third of five children.\n\nIn his self-published The Con of the Con-Con, Biggs argues against a constitutional convention, comparing a desire to fix problems in government through such a process to overhauling an engine to fix a flat tire. In the book, Biggs said his family was targeted by liberals in Tucson when he was growing up.\n\nWhen my mother wrote letters to the editor expressing conservative values, our home was egged and my car was vandalized, he wrote, according to Phoenix New Times. I've been made to feel uncomfortable for being conservative.\n\nIn 1993, Biggs' life changed dramatically when he won the $10 million American Family Sweepstakes.\n\nIn a 2002 interview with The Arizona Republic, Biggs, who was running for the Arizona House of Representatives at the time, said the winnings brought him more than money.\n\nIt's taught me a lot about human nature and the dark side of people, he said at the dawn of his political career.\n\nAfter winning his fortune, Biggs worked as a policy adviser with United Families International, a Gilbert-based nonprofit that opposes pornography and same-sex marriage while promoting abstinence-only education as part of what it sees as a pro-family agenda.\n\nBiggs turned his attention to Arizona politics in 2002, when he was elected to the state House of Representatives.\n\nHe was a staunch supporter of school choice, border security and restrictions on abortion rights.\n\nHe opposed expanded government responsibilities, including the program that provided health insurance for the poor and for children in low-income families.\n\nIn his eight terms in the Arizona Legislature, Biggs scored policy victories, led principled losses and trampled toes in the process.\n\nIn 2011, Biggs pushed to have Arizona end its Medicaid program, a move that even fellow Republicans saw as too drastic.\n\nHis hard-right views put him on the edge of what was politically possible in the right-leaning Arizona Legislature. Even so, he suffered a stinging defeat his first year heading the chamber.\n\nGov. Jan Brewer angered many conservatives when she urged the state to expand Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.\n\nBiggs blocked the effort for months, but as the Legislature took up the state's final budget, five Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to approve the expansion. It allowed Arizona to tap federal funding to provide coverage to another 350,000 residents and stabilize support for rural hospitals.\n\nThis is not about expanding health care because it's some kind of altruistic program. It's about expanding health care to get federal money, Biggs argued in vain. The money will unfairly burden our children and our grandchildren.\n\nIt was a bitter loss for Biggs, who recalled the moment in a vengeful voice when arguing on the Senate floor in 2015 for an austere budget plan unpopular with a handful of GOP moderates but one that he said set the state on firmer financial footing.\n\nThat time, Biggs got his way.\n\nFirst Congress run a nail-biter\n\nIn February 2016, Biggs seemed to get the political upper hand again when Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., announced he was ending his second stint in Congress and recommended Biggs as his replacement.\n\nIt was a critical boost in a race that would become a six-month sprint to the Republican primary. In a district that leans decidedly to the right, the winner of the GOP primary was all but assured a seat in Washington.\n\nPresident Trump defeated Joe Biden by 14 points (in the 5th District). That's a pretty clear indication of the type of politics that a majority of the voters in that district want, said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of the nonpartisan Inside Politics, which analyzes congressional races.\n\nIt's too soon to know how that area, which once elected Salmon and Flake will look when the congressional lines are redrawn later this year, but the GOP has been changing in Arizona for a while, Gonzales said.\n\nYou have Arizona as a state moving more Democratic and you have the Republican Party moving more toward Trump, he said. It's hard to judge Biggs by the former members (representing that area) when the Republican Party has changed.\n\nBiggs, the state Senate president and handpicked successor to the incumbent, won a four-way primary in dramatic, come-from-behind fashion.\n\nBiggs a Trump ally during impeachment drama\n\nHe arrived in Washington with Republicans holding their firmest grip on the House and Senate under a GOP president since the 1920s. Biggs joined the House Freedom Caucus, arguably the chamber's most conservative bloc.\n\nI know where I am. I know what my belief system is. It's good to have others who share that belief system, Biggs said in an interview with C-SPAN at the time. I know how to get things done and work with anybody who's going to help me get the stuff done that I believe is important to the nation and to my district.\n\nEven so, his first term was perhaps most notable for what didn't get done.\n\nIn May 2017, Biggs was one of only 20 House Republicans who voted with Democrats against a GOP-led bill that would have overhauled the Affordable Care Act. He justified it by saying it is not a clean repeal of Obamacare.\n\nThe House bill narrowly passed, but Republican efforts to undo the ACA ended two months later amid a flurry of changes in the Senate when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., gave the rushed process a dramatic thumbs-down.\n\nIn Biggs' second term in Washington, Democrats took control of the House and began pressing the Trump administration with a series of investigations.\n\nFrom his perch on the House Judiciary Committee, Biggs was an early and forceful voice questioning the origins of the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. When that 22-month probe resulted in nearly three dozen indictments, eight guilty pleas and a jury convictionbut left Trump largely unscathed, Biggs declared it a victory for the president.\n\nIn 2019, Trump tapped Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., the Freedom Caucus chair, to be his chief of staff. In turn, Biggs' conservative colleagues named him to head their group.\n\nHe stepped into that role just as House Democrats began the first impeachment inquiry into Trump over his dealings with Ukraine. Biggs used his new platform and his seat on the Judiciary Committee to again aggressively defend the president and assail the left's agenda more broadly.\n\nBiggs was among the Freedom Caucus members who stormed a secure room in the Capitol where a witness was to be interviewed behind closed doors. He also tried, unsuccessfully, to censure Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who was leading the inquiry in the House.\n\nBiggs fights masks, lockdowns, touts hydroxychloroquine\n\nTrump's first impeachment ended with all but one Senate Republican voting to acquit him at the outset of his reelection campaign. The celebration for conservatives such as Biggs was short-lived.\n\nWithin weeks, the spread of coronavirus mushroomed into a global pandemic that brought the booming U.S. economy to a sudden halt.\n\nThroughout the year, Trump delivered overly optimistic, factually false appraisals of the deadly disease.\n\nAs he did, Biggs was a consistent voice calling to reopen the economy, questioning the authority for mask mandates and touting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment despite scientific evidence it was potentially dangerous.\n\nHis social media messages encouraged people to fight the medical establishment and unmask. He called for the White House Coronavirus Task Force to be shut down and slammed its best-known members, Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx.\n\nMedical experts publicly rebuked Biggs, who was a member of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee until January.\n\nThe politically-tinged pandemic gave way to the November election in which Biggs again sided with Trump, baselessly suggesting fraud in results affirmed by courts and security experts.\n\nIn the extended period when ballots were counted in Arizona and Pennsylvania, Biggs took to conservative media to cast doubt on the process.\n\nWell, you're talking about fraud, pure and simple. We're talking about Pennsylvania is an utter disaster, and really your immediate remedy is to basically nullify Pennsylvania's election, Biggs said in a Nov. 10 appearance on The Charlie Kirk Show.\n\nIn December, Biggs, along with more than 100 other GOP colleagues, signed onto a legal brief supporting a lawsuit brought by the attorney general of Texas asking the Supreme Court to invalidate the election results in four states.\n\nThe high court quickly dismissed the case.\n\nDays later, Biggs taped a message for Trump supporters at a Stop the Steal rally in Phoenix.\n\nAli Alexander, the man who claimed credit for organizing the event, played the message on his cellphone.\n\nLater, Alexander taped a video message in which he identified Biggs as one of three House Republicans who played key roles in organizing the rally to be held in Washington on Jan. 6. We four schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress, while they were voting so that who we couldn't lobby, we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud war from outside, Alexander said in the video.\n\nOn that day, Biggs was among the first House Republicans to argue to set aside Arizona's election results. He said judges had altered the state's voter-registration period, part of a pattern of removing control from the Legislature, which, he said, had the constitutional authority to choose the state's presidential electors.\n\nThe legalistic argument soon was overshadowed by the pro-Trump mob that broke into the Capitol in a rampage that killed five people, including a police officer, and injured at least 140 other officers.\n\nBiggs sought to distance himself from Alexander, saying he never met the man and only provided remarks to the Phoenix rally at the request of aides to Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., who was an enthusiastic supporter of the effort. Gosar was one of the other two U.S. House lawmakers named by Alexander in the video.\n\nEven before the violence, Biggs shifted his rhetoric from claiming fraud to insisting on upholding election integrity. It is a distinction lost on his critics, who view him as helping incite the riot by fueling the sense of grievance over the election.\n\nIn the end, Biggs voted to set aside the results in Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\nViolent rhetoric isn't condemned\n\nWhile Biggs sought to distinguish his own rhetoric from those around him, it was a reminder of another incident involving deadly rhetoric.\n\nIn 2015, Biggs shared his thoughts about a constitutional convention at a videotaped event in Tempe more remembered for the remarks of the co-founder of the extremist group the Oath Keepers.\n\nStewart Rhodes called McCain a traitor to the Constitution and said he should be hung by the neck until dead. Biggs didn't immediately denounce the remark and told The Republic at the time that he didn't feel it was his place to do so.\n\nThe Oath Keepers are among the groups facing federal investigation for their roles in the Jan. 6 riot. Others want the scrutiny to widen to include people like Biggs.\n\nThe left-leaning Campaign for Accountability has asked for ethics and criminal investigations of Biggs and Gosar, among others whose words helped light the match.\n\nArizona Democrats also sought a federal probe into potential acts of sedition by Arizona Republicans, including Biggs. His two brothers wrote a letter to The Arizona Republic calling for voters to oust him.\n\nSeemingly unfazed, Biggs has brushed aside his critics and doubled down on the political agenda he has long touted.\n\nHe recently led another tour of the border for House Republicans, such as freshman Boebert of Colorado. Like her, Biggs has reportedly set off metal detectors at the Capitol and ignored closer police inspection. Like Biggs, Boebert has come under fire for her behavior before and on Jan. 6; critics have blasted her for tweeting information about the location of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., while pro-Trump rioters were overrunning the Capitol.\n\nWhen Congress was evacuated during the riot, Greene, another controversial freshman, stood next to Biggs refusing to wear a mask in a closed room with their colleagues.\n\nBiggs stood with Greene when House Democrats voted to strip her of her committee assignments for an array of controversies, including comments she made online before running for office that were supportive of violence against Democrats.\n\nAnd in a recent tweet, Biggs passed judgment on Biden's entire presidency.\n\nWhen all is said and done, Joe Biden will be known as one of the worst presidents this nation has ever known.\n\nReach the reporter Ronald J.

Helene St. James\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nOf his love of hockey, there can be no doubt. But whether he'll continue that love affair in Detroit or in Russia is less clear.\n\nDetroit Red Wings star forward Pavel Datsyuk did not definitively shoot down weekend rumors saying he will leave the Red Wings this off-season and return to his native Russia when he spoke after practice at Joe Louis Arena.\n\nI have one more year contract and we have three games left this year, Datsyuk said today. This is more focus for me now.\n\nI'm not looking at next year.\n\nThe possibility of Datsyuk's premature departure was brought up Saturday night by Hockey Night in Canada's Elliotte Friedman, who cited unnamed sources in saying Datsyuk might leave this off-season because of family issues. That has the potential to be devastating for the Wings, because Datsyuk signed his last contract after he turned 35. Even if he retires, his $7.5 million hit would count against the Wings' salary cap.\n\nDatsyuk, whose daughter from his first marriage lives in Russia, said he did not want to discuss any family situations. Asked if there is any reason to think he wouldn't play in Detroit in 2016-17, Datsyuk said, Who knows. Maybe injured or something.\n\nDatsyuk, 37, has said in the past he'd like to finish his career in Russia. He spent the fall of 2012 playing in the KHL, taking advantage of the NHL's labor dispute, and came back raving about the experience.\n\nFrom the beginning of my career ... Russian fans, they help me, and I want to give back to them, he said.\n\nThis situation is similar to the last time Datsyuk had a year left on his contract. Rumors swirled he'd return to Russia - and then he ended up signing a three-year extension.\n\nDatsyuk reiterated several times his focus is on helping the Red Wings secure a playoff spot. Their next game is Wednesday, when they host the Philadelphia Flyers. Monday was an optional practice with only about a dozen players going to the ice. Datsyuk was the rare veteran.\n\nNot happy with a little bit myself, he said. I have to play better and more help my team.\n\nContact Helene St. James: hstjames@freepress.com.

WASHINGTON – Supreme Court precedents that have stood the test of time for generations are in danger of falling like dominoes in the next few months.\n\nFirst on the chopping block is a 1977 ruling that allowed public employee unions to collect fees from non-members for collective bargaining. The court's conservative justices have been itching to overrule that unanimous decision for decades.\n\nNext up is a 1992 case in which the court refused to require that mail-order retailers collect sales taxes from buyers in other states. For years, that has given online retailers a competitive advantage over brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nThe court also will consider second-guessing one of its least-popular chestnuts — a 20-year-old ruling, based on one from 1945, that gives federal agencies broad discretion to interpret their own regulations.\n\nSince Chief Justice John Roberts took the center seat on the court in 2005, the justices have been reticent to second-guess the decisions of their predecessors. They have done so at a pace just above once a year, considerably less often than in the past.\n\nThat's not an accident, says Jonathan Adler, director of the Center for Business Law & Regulation at Case Western Reserve University School of Law. The chief justice, in particular, doesn't like the court to be a disruptive force. He prefers to maintain stability and predictability where possible.\n\nIt's not always possible. Roberts could not prevent the court's conservatives from overturning two of their precedents in 2010's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, which eliminated limits on independent political spending by corporations.\n\nAnd five years later, the court's decision in favor of same-sex marriage overruled a 1972 decision that found no federal basis to block states from prohibiting the practice.\n\nThe court usually adheres to the principle of stare decisis, or adhering to its earlier decisions. But occasionally those earlier rulings cry out for change and the court waits too long to correct them. Perhaps the top example is Plessy v. Ferguson, which upheld separate public facilities on the basis of race and stood for 60 years before being overruled by Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nThe court in recent years has had scores of opportunities to overrule earlier decisions and has taken a pass, according to the Supreme Court Database, a research facility housed at Washington University School of Law. The Roberts Court has done so less than any of its predecessors dating to the 1950s.\n\nFew rulings have been up for grabs as often as Auer v. Robbins, the 1997 decision that upheld federal agencies' right to interpret their own regulations without court interference.\n\nWhen the court last refused to hear a case that would have toppled Auer, dissenting Justice Clarence Thomas warned that the doctrine is on its last gasp. Now the justices have another chance to extinguish it in a case they will consider at next week's private conference.\n\nYou wrote it.\n\nThomas is fond of recounting a conversation on the bench with the late justice Antonin Scalia, who complained that Auer is one of the worst opinions in the history of this country.\n\nNino, Thomas responded, you wrote it.\n\nThis month the court will hear a challenge to the fees paid by non-members to public employee labor unions that would overrule Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, a 1977 decision. The justices stopped short of that extreme step in 2012, 2014 and 2016.\n\nMany of the court's conservative justices believe Abood was wrongly decided to begin with because it forces workers to contribute to a group they may disagree with. Opponents argue that as a constitutional case based on First Amendment rights, it is less sacred than rulings based on statutes that Congress can amend.\n\nAlthough this court reconsiders its precedents with caution, stare decisis does not warrant preserving Abood's error, Solicitor General Noel Francisco argues in the government's court papers.\n\nBut Abood has its defenders, including Michael Kimberly, co-director of the Yale Law School Supreme Court Clinic.\n\nIf it's scuttled, Kimberly warns, contracts entered into based on unions' ability to provide specified services, funded through agency fees, would have to be renegotiated. And government employees' existing reliance on unions' abilities to negotiate effectively and to provide contractually required services would be eliminated.\n\nPrecedents don't last forever\n\nThe high court's consideration in April of a case that would level the playing field between online and brick-and-mortar retailers when it comes to collecting sales taxes presents a clear case of technological change influencing legal rulings.\n\nThe justices ruled 8-1 in Quill v. North Dakota in 1992 that companies selling wares by catalog across state lines were exempt from collecting sales taxes. Now that North Dakota case is being challenged by one from South Dakota.\n\nAs this court has long recognized, stare decisis is not an inexorable command, former Solicitor General Donald Verrilli wrote in a brief for the Retail Litigation Center. When the world changes, it is appropriate to consider whether the law should change as well.
Russ Wiles\n\nThe Arizona Republic\n\nHigh-tech Gorilla glass has replaced crystal in many crystal balls. Will it result in clearer predictions? Hard to say. But here are some financial-focused trends that look to be safe bets for 2016:\n\nMore talk, less action on taxes.\n\nCongress in December finally made permanent several tax rules for individuals, rather than extending them on a yearly basis as had become the norm. These include a deduction for teachers, optional tax-free charitable distributions from IRAs and the option of deducting state and local sales taxes instead of state/local income taxes. It also extended other rules for two years. These include a college tuition and fees deduction, an exclusion from taxable income of canceled mortgage debt and a credit worth up to $500 for homeowners who install energy-efficient windows, air-conditioning systems and the like.\n\nThese actions should clear up some uncertainty for taxpayers. That's good because the prospects for major tax legislation in a presidential election year aren't strong. But as campaigning heats up, we likely will see more serious proposals from leading candidates on tax topics. Tax reform and policies to shore up Social Security are among the issues that could come up for debate.\n\nAdded opportunities/risks with crowdfunding.\n\nSocial media has proved to be an effective way to raise donations for people facing big medical bills or supporting a non-profit quest. It also could result in more investments in fledgling companies.\n\nEquity crowdfunding could expand noticeably in the coming year following federal legislation in 2013 that opened it up and recent rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that allow small businesses to raise up to $1 million, with simplified regulations.\n\nBut the public must be careful. The pitch that small investors can get in on the ground floor of the next Google is simply too alluring for many investors to resist, even though 99 of these deals will prove to be unprofitable, said Chicago securities attorney Andrew Stoltmann,\n\nAt a minimum, he suggests that investors steer clear of companies lacking audited financial reports. Most of these outfits won't have audited financial statements, and without those you are literally trusting the firms to be honest.\n\nMore information, reduced privacy.\n\nIf you visited an electronics store lately, you couldn't help but notice all the drones for sale. Many already are in the air, and more will take flight in 2016, equipped with tiny cameras to snap photos of hot tubs, backyard parties and more.\n\nDrones aren't the only sign that privacy is eroding. All those smartphones in circulation can take photos, too. So can traffic sensors and security cameras. Retailers and government agencies fumble away personal information about customers by letting hackers into their data systems. Many people willingly reveal sensitive details about themselves through careless posts of comments and photos. It all adds up to a backdrop where Americans' shopping habits, dating preferences, driving habits and even medical issues are broadly available.\n\nTo some degree, the genie already is out of the bottle. But consumers still can take steps to defend themselves, such as by protecting financial records, checking credit reports (go to annualcreditreport.com for free copies) and just plain using common sense. If you wouldn't want to put up a statement on a billboard next to your house, don't put (the same message) on Facebook, said Eva Casey Velasquez of the Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego.\n\nMore mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe recently announced $130-billion marriage of Dow Chemical and DuPont put an exclamation mark on a busy year for mergers and acquisitions. When final numbers are in, 2015 will set records for M&A dollar volume and number of deals, reported McKinsey & Co. The trend could continue in 2016, with important implications for investors, employees, suppliers and competitors of affected companies.\n\nIn a recent report, McKinsey experts Werner Rehm and Andy West described the rationale for M&A deals as changing. In the past, big deals were often seen as tactics to address cost reduction and industry consolidation, they wrote. But today we also see deals where managers and boards are talking about diversification and, for the first time in a long time, about revenue — about cross-selling and creating new customer opportunities, and about transformation.\n\nMore M&A deals might provide a lift for the stock market, especially if the economic background continues to improve.\n\nIncreased pressure on bond prices.\n\nForecasters have been predicting for the past several years that interest rates would rise and bonds prices would decline. Now that the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates in December, it might finally happen. The Fed plans at least a few more increases over the coming year, which will tend to push up rates on credit cards, on deposit accounts and so on.\n\nBond prices won't be directly affected by Fed actions, but their yields will increase if the economy picks up traction and inflation percolates. If interest rates in general and bond yields rise, bond prices will drop, as the two move inversely.\n\nBond prices and yields likely won't change much — and almost certainly won't exhibit the sharp swings that sometimes jolt stocks. But prices of long-term bonds historically have dropped almost every other year on average, and 2016 might be a downer.\n\nReach Wiles at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8616.

It's the St. Louis Cardinals' greatest trade since the Lou Brock heist from the Chicago Cubs a half-century ago.\n\nIt's the finest acting job by a St. Louis native since Jon Hamm.\n\nAnd it is the greatest new attraction in town since the Gateway Arch.\n\nThis is what the trade for Gold Glove third baseman Nolan Arenado means to the Cardinals and their return to greatness, sponsored by Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt, who was last heard telling the baseball world that owning a baseball team was lousy business, and they couldn't possibly increase payroll in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nIncredible what a single move can do for a team's image, while changing the narrative of its owner.\n\nThe Cardinals, who were playing hard to get for past the year in their talks with the Colorado Rockies, finally heard the proposal that was simply too good to ignore.\n\nThe six-player trade cleared its final hurdle Monday night when MLB and the Players Association signed off on the deal, sending Arenado to St. Louis for left-handed pitcher Austin Gomber, infielder Elehuris Montero, right-handed pitcher Tony Locey, infielder Mateo Gil and right-handed pitcher Jake Sommers.\n\nYou get Arenado, an eight-time Gold Glove winner, five-time All-Star, five-time top 10 MVP finalist and four-time Silver Slugger for nothing more than a back-end starter without a single prized prospect. The Rockies, believe it or not, are even kicking in about $50 million.\n\nYou call this a trade?\n\nNo wonder folks in Colorado are calling this the worst trade by any sports franchise in the state's history.\n\nThere are no guarantees in baseball, or any sport, of course, but while everyone in the NL Central is stripping down or standing pat, the Cardinals' stock is soaring.\n\nThis is a team that was badly in need of a power bat and defensive prowess. Arenado leads all third basemen with 120 defensive runs saved since 2013, while Cardinals third basemen have combined for minus-2 defensive runs saved.\n\nThe Cardinals hit the fewest home runs and were among the worst five teams in slugging percentage last year, while Arenado averaged 40 homers and 124 RBI from 2015-2019.\n\nAnd all it took was money and ingenuity.\n\nThe Cardinals were able to get the Rockies to pay down the remaining $199 million in Arenado's contract to about $150 million, with Arenado even willing to defer salary in exchange for another year and $15 million.\n\nOh, sure, there are two opt-out provisions in the contract, enabling him to walk away after 2021 and 2022.\n\nThe odds of that happening is the same as Rockies GM Jeff Bridich being elected Denver mayor.\n\nArenado has long been enamored with the Cardinals, speaking glowingly about the franchise for years. This is a franchise that has had 13 consecutive winning seasons, reaching the postseason eight times. The Rockies had a winning record only twice in the last decade.\n\nHe's not going anywhere.\n\nArenado desperately wanted out of Colorado. If the Rockies weren't going to trade him to his hometown of Los Angeles, the Cardinals were next on his short list.\n\nThe Cardinals and Rockies spent the weekend sorting out the financial details, and it became official days later.\n\nJust like that, the Cardinals become the NL Central favorites.\n\nThis was a sensational coup for the Cardinals, who have a history now of plucking stars away from the Rockies, from Larry Walker to Matt Holliday and now Arenado.\n\nThe Cardinals still have blemishes, but considering their division is perhaps the weakest in baseball, they could run away with it by August.\n\nAnd, really, this is a move that made perfect sense for the Cardinals all along.\n\nMeanwhile, Rockies fans may feel betrayed by their ownership – but certainly not by Arenado, who merely echoed their criticisms.\n\nThis was a marriage that soured almost before the ink dried on his eight-year, $260 million extension just two years ago, and now that he's in a new relationship, Arenado will feel free.\n\nHe's on a team that desperately wants to win, year after year, and as the Cardinals proved with this deal, it's a tradition that isn't about to fade away.\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @BNightengale
Vice President Kamala Harris made history Wednesday by being the first woman, first Black American and first South Asian American to hold the office, but it was her family who stole the show at the inauguration.\n\nFrom her husband, Doug Emhoff, ushering in the never-before-used title of second gentleman to her niece's partner, Nikolas Ajagu, being dubbed head of the Department of Drip for wearing Dior Air Jordan 1s to the inauguration, Harris' family made waves by her side.\n\nIf the past years on the campaign trail, during the election and on Inauguration Day have proven anything, it's that Harris' family will continue to be a notable and visible part of her life for her next four years in office. Here's a break down of who's who.\n\nFrom Doug Emhoff to Meena Harris, meet Vice President Kamala Harris' family Vice President Kamala Harris' family was present at inauguration. Here's everything you need to know about the second family. USA TODAY\n\nDoug Emhoff\n\nEmhoff, 56, may be a second gentleman now, but he's had his own notable life and career.\n\nHe was an entertainment lawyer at international firm DLA Piper, but quit the law practice to take on the duties of second gentleman, flipping gender norms at a level the nation has never seen before.\n\nEmhoff was born in Brooklyn, New York, and moved with his family to Southern California from New Jersey as a teenager. He graduated from California State University at Northridge in 1987 and attended the University of Southern California's Gould School of Law, where he got his law degree in 1990.\n\nEmhoff met Harris in 2013 after a client of his and a friend of Harris' set them up on a blind date. They got married in 2014 in Santa Barbara.\n\nShow caption Hide caption U.S. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff shop in the Downton Holiday Market on November 28, 2020 in Washington, DC.

It's no surprise some called her a style icon, as she's currently studying at Parsons School of Design in New York.\n\nA week after stunning at the inauguration, IMG Models signed Ella Emhoff, spokesperson for IMG Fashion GroupAnsleigh Scholtes told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nCole and Ella Emhoff also have a cute nickname for their stepmother: Momala.\n\nTo my brother and me, you'll always be 'Momala,' the world's greatest stepmom, Ella Emhoff said in a video introducing Harris at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. You're a rock, not just for our dad, but for three generations of our big, blended family.\n\nMaya Harris\n\nMaya Harris, 53, is Kamala Harris' younger sister and a lawyer and policy advocate.\n\nThis isn't Maya Harris' first political rodeo either. Before serving as her sister's senior adviser during her 2020 presidential campaign, Maya Harris was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton when the former secretary of state was a presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nMaya Harris graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and went on to get her law degree from Stanford University.\n\nStanford University is where she met husband Tony West, who is Uber's chief legal officer.

Cathy Lynn Grossman\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nThe world's best-known evangelist, the Rev. Billy Graham, died Wednesday. He was 99.\n\nFrom the gangly 16-year-old baseball-loving teen who found Christ at a tent revival, Graham went on to become an international media darling, a preacher to a dozen presidents and the voice of solace in times of national heartbreak. He was America's pastor.\n\nGraham died at his mountain home in Montreat, N.C., where he retired in 2005 after nearly six decades on the road calling people to Christ at 417 all-out preaching and musical events from Miami to Moscow. His final New York City crusade in 2005 was sponsored by 1,400 regional churches from 82 denominations. In recent years, he was plagued by various ailments, including cancer and pneumonia.\n\nHe took his Bible to the ends of the Earth in preaching tours he called crusades. Presidents called on Graham in their dark hours, and uncounted millions say he showed them the light.\n\nThe GREAT Billy Graham is dead, President Trump tweeted Wednesday. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.\n\nFamily Research Council President Tony Perkins, noting Graham's humble beginnings, said that because he yielded himself to God, he was used to accomplish the extraordinary — forever impacting the lives of countless people.\n\nOn the National Day of Prayer and Remembrance following the 9/11 attacks, Graham spoke of the mystery of iniquity and evil, of the lesson of our need for each other and, ultimately, of hope.\n\nHe was so real, he made Christianity come true, said Susan Harding, an anthropologist at the University of California-Santa Cruz. He was homespun, historical and newsworthy all at once. He could span the times from Christ to today, from the globe to you, all in one sentence.\n\nLegacy:How Franklin Graham took the reins from a legendary preacher\n\nCrusades:How the evangelist reached millions\n\nBooks:A look at all the books Billy Graham wrote\n\nQuotations:Billy Graham's most notable quotes\n\nThe unknown:16 lesser-known facts about the legendary evangelist\n\nGratitude:Why almost everyone wants to say thank you to Billy Graham\n\nGrant Wacker, a Duke University professor of Christian history, says Graham represented what most decent churchgoing people thought and ought to think.\n\nHis reputation was untouched by sex or financial scandals. When anti-Semitic comments came to light as transcripts of conversations with Richard Nixon surfaced, Graham was promptly and deeply apologetic.\n\nHe never built a megachurch, set up a relief agency, launched a political lobby or ran for office. Yet he redefined American Protestant life by popularizing Christianity's core message — Christ died for your sins — downplaying denominational details and proclaiming the joys found in faith.\n\nGraham was, however, drawn to power. Eventually, he met, prayed with, comforted and joked with 12 U.S. presidents. He found a fine balance that allowed him to become America's pastor, Democrat or Republican. North or South.\n\nWhen President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky came to light, Graham called for forgiveness. Clinton told Peter Boyer of The New Yorker, He took sin seriously. But he took redemption seriously. And it was incredibly powerful the way he did it.\n\nFormer president George W. Bush has said it was a conversation with Graham that turned him from his drinking ways when he was young.\n\nI've never called him on a specific issue, but his influence is bigger than a specific issue, as far as I'm concerned. He warms your soul, Bush told an ABC 20/20 special on the preacher and politics.\n\nGraham emphasized the joy to be found in belief, in contrast to evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who routinely issued glowering condemnations of politicians or blamed natural disasters on modern culture. However, Graham did take an uncharacteristically political stand before the 2012 presidential election. He authorized full-page ads in major newspapers in October urging people to vote for politicians who opposed same-sex marriage on biblical principles.\n\nHe brought to the microphone a corny but effective humor, Wacker says, which made him a convivial talk-show guest. Graham logged more than 50 radio or television interviews with Larry King alone. YouTube has a tape of Woody Allen interviewing the evangelist, who draws almost as many laughs as the caustic, agnostic comedian.\n\nThe Billy Graham Evangelistic Association he founded, now led by his son, Franklin, used every communications innovation possible to carry the Gospel to any willing heart on Earth. More than 214 million people in 195 cities and territories heard God's call in Graham's voice and witnessed him deliver the Gospel in person or by satellite links. His projects included founding Christianity Today magazine in 1956 and writing more than 30 books.\n\nHigh among his numerous honors: The Congressional Gold Medal awarded to Billy and his beloved wife, Ruth, in 1996, the Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded to him in 1983 and the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion in 1982. He even has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nFundamentalists saw him as excessively liberal, and liberals saw him as too literalist in talking about sin and salvation. His wonderful balance between them is critical to his legacy, says John Wilson, editor of Books & Culture, a sister publication of Christianity Today magazine.\n\nGraham's last decades were slowed by illness and injury. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1989, felled by broken bones, bouts of hydrocephalus and rounds of pneumonia.\n\nAge, illness and bone-breaking falls left him struggling to deliver 20-minute sermons.\n\nGraham's last crusade, in June 2005 in New York City, drew 242,000 people to Flushing Meadows; 8,786 made a new commitment to Christ and thousands more renewed or rejoiced in their faith.\n\nThen he retired to his Montreat, N.C., mountaintop log cabin home where his five children grew up mostly without their traveling father to spend his days with Ruth. They shared Bible study, devotions and an endless recycling of the movie musicals she loved to watch. Those were bittersweet days, with Ruth bedridden and Billy relying on a walker. Their frequent prayer was, Help me, Lord.\n\nAt her funeral in June 2007, Graham called Ruth the finest Christian he ever knew.\n\nThough Graham's shoes could likely never be filled, his son, Franklin, has taken over in some aspects — leading The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and becoming a confidant of President Trump, including speaking at his inauguration.\n\nBut Franklin's message has swayed from his father's, leaving a mixed legacy for the Graham name.\n\nFranklin has mocked both Islam and LGBT rights. He uses his following on social media to raise funds for persecuted Christians, boycotts businesses that use gay couples in advertisements and blasts the separation of church and state as the godless successor to Cold War communism.\n\nBut his father's words for years offered peace and perspective.\n\nBilly Graham lived through the explosion of religious diversity in America, the rise of the human potential movement and the trend to personalized spirituality. He also lived to see many tire of lonely seeking or a high-minded hopscotch from church to church, religion to religion.\n\nYet he remained steadfast in his response. In 1996, when he and Ruth were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, he once more shared his faith in God with some of the most powerful men on Earth:\n\nAs Ruth and I receive this award, we know that some day we will lay it at the feet of the one we seek to serve.
Just when you thought the NFL might take a breather before the Super Bowl 55 hype machine cranks up in earnest Monday morning ... welp. A seismic deal shook the league Saturday night, and it didn't even involve Deshaun Watson switching teams.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams and Detroit Lions agreed to a blockbuster that sends veteran QB Matthew Stafford from Motown to Tinseltown, while the Rams ship QB Jared Goff and a bundle of draft picks, including two first-rounders, to Detroit.\n\nIt's a fascinating transaction that should bolster both franchises, even if it might leave some initially scratching their heads.\n\nLet's break it down by looking at the winners and losers of this first NFL megadeal of 2021:\n\nWinners\n\nStafford: It isn't hard to find former Lions who swear by Stafford's toughness, talent and personality. However those traits and 282 career TD passes earned the No. 1 pick of the 2009 draft three wild-card appearances but nary a win. (Detroit's last playoff victory occurred at the end of the 1991 season.) That isn't to suggest Stafford has been Aaron Rodgers-lite marooned in Motown. But he's orchestrated plenty of spectacular moments and solid seasons for a franchise that's been in near-constant flux – Stafford played for four coaches, including interim boss Darrell Bevell in 2020. He hasn't had elite teammates since Calvin Johnson and Ndamukong Suh left.\n\nNow? Joining the Rams effectively ensures Stafford will be supported by the best running game, best offensive line, best defense and – most important – best play caller, head coach Sean McVay, he's ever had in the NFL. The Rams won one more playoff game this year than Stafford ever has – should be fun to see what the marriage can produce.\n\nNew Detroit GM Brad Holmes: Well, hello sir. Hired by the Lions just two weeks ago – incidentally, from the Rams (he was their director of college scouting) – Holmes didn't need much time to make his presence felt in Michigan. Under his guidance, the club quickly telegraphed its intent to part with Stafford, the Lions' all-time leader in every significant passing category – and by a country mile. Holmes found a taker in his former boss, Rams GM Les Snead, who's never afraid of taking a big swing.\n\nSome are marveling at the massive compensation Holmes wrangled from L.A. (first-round picks in 2022 and 2023 and a third-rounder this year). But this seems to resemble what happened four years ago when the Texans traded Brock Osweiler to the Browns – for whom Osweiler never took a regular-season snap – only on a grander scale. (Cleveland absorbed Osweiler's pact a year after he signed a four-year, $72 million agreement, Houston sending the Browns a second-round pick as part of the package in order to offset the salary dump.)\n\nOn the heels of three consecutive last-place finishes, Detroit just added ample juice to its rebuilding plan, partially because Snead is essentially rewarding Holmes with extra draft capital because he's taking Goff's massive extension off the Rams' books. Trading Goff is going to cost L.A. about a $22 million cap blow – however cutting him would've meant an untenable $65 million hit in dead cap dollars. Moving ahead, L.A. owes Stafford $43 million over the next two years; even less what the Rams have already paid, Goff stands to make $104 million over the next four.\n\nWas Stafford worth two first-rounders in a vacuum? Almost certainly not. But Holmes found a creative way to boost the veteran's value to the Lions one last time.\n\nRams' Super Bowl hopes: Stafford, who turns 33 on Super Sunday, certainly has to prove he can win big with better players around him. But it's hard to imagine him not improving an L.A. attack often hindered by Goff's inconsistency. McVay wasn't even willing to commit to Goff playing in the Rams' divisional round playoff loss to the Packers earlier this month until it became clear that John Wolford, who was injured in the wild-card win at Seattle, wouldn't be available. And no one will forget how Goff and this offense went to pieces in Super Bowl 53, managing 260 yards and three points on a day when 14 points would have beaten the Patriots.\n\nStafford and McVay will surely have to adapt to each other, but the veteran's experience and electric arm talent should further diversify an offense with depth at all the skill positions, including two 1,000-yard receivers (Robert Woods, Cooper Kupp) in 2019. If Snead can add a deep threat, too, there's no telling how creative McVay might get. And given the state of the NFC East, Drew Brees' expected retirement and Tom Brady's advancing age (right?), the Rams are likely to be considered one of the conference's Super Bowl front-runners going into next season.\n\nMIKE JONES:It's clear L.A. was disappointed with Jared Goff\n\nMOCK DRAFT:What might happen if New York Jets don't take quarterback at No. 2\n\n55 GREATEST SUPER BOWL PLAYERS:How high do Patriots legends rank?\n\nLosers\n\nRest of the NFC West: The Rams reached the playoffs despite Goff's uneven play – lowlighted by a loss to the previously 0-13 New York Jets. Now the division champion Seahawks, break-even Cardinals and injury-riddled 49ers appear like they'll be dealing with a much tougher beast in 2021.\n\nRams' long-term future: The last time the Rams picked in Round 1? Try 2016, when Goff went No. 1 overall. As it stands now, Snead and McVay won't be tabbing their next first-rounder ... until 2024. But heck, with so much now invested in Stafford (he's under contract through 2022), DL Aaron Donald and CB Jalen Ramsey, can't blame L.A. for mortgaging the Sunset Strip in order to compete now ... though it must be noted this team has done a nice job procuring players despite sitting out the draft's first night on an annual basis.\n\n2021 QB draft prospects? The Lions are scheduled to pick seventh in the first round of this year's draft. With Stafford on the way out, they'd seemed a likely destination for a young quarterback like BYU's Zach Wilson, Ohio State's Justin Fields or North Dakota State's Trey Lance. That may still be the case, though any quarterback drafted by Detroit will likely now be stuck on the bench for at least a year. There's also a chance the Lions will now bypass QBs altogether, meaning one or two of these players could find themselves slipping down the board and earning less money.\n\nGoff: Oof. Five years ago, he was the top pick of the draft. Two years ago, he was in the Super Bowl. A little more than one year ago, he was signing his now-infamous four-year, $134 million extension. A few weeks ago, he was gamely running onto a playoff field with pins holding together his thumb less than two weeks after it had been surgically repaired.\n\nBut now? A 26-year-old who made the Pro Bowl twice after McVay came to L.A. seems like damaged goods and unlikely to be more than a placeholder for the rebooting Lions. Goff may not even get to play with WR Kenny Golladay, whose contract is expiring, and – after being backed by the league's top-ranked defense in 2020 – must now make do with a D that ranked last in the league. Not the best circumstances for a guy hoping to resurrect his career.\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

DETROIT – After 41 years in the priesthood, Father Eduard Perrone wasn't prepared for the hellfire that tore through his parish last summer: He was accused of molesting an altar boy decades earlier, and ousted from his church.\n\nThe sex abuse claim blindsided the pastor's loyal flock, though they believe he is innocent – and have launched an unorthodox crusade to clear his name.\n\nIn an unprecedented lawsuit in Michigan, and possibly the country, 20 parishioners from Assumption Grotto are suing the Detroit archdiocese for $20 million, claiming it caused them emotional distress by taking away their priest.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges church officials fabricated a rape charge against Perrone because they didn't like his conservative views and wanted him out, and because they wanted to avoid bad press. Perrone was removed from the clergy one month after reporters started asking questions about a fondling claim against him.\n\nAccording to police reports, the claim involved a 54-year-old man who alleged that Perrone started grooming him when he was 13 while he was an altar boy at St. Peter Catholic Church in Mount Clemens.\n\nThe man alleged that Perrone groped him during swim parties at the Perrone family lake house, that he served minors wine, had boys stay overnight in the rectory and took him and another boy on a private camping trip, police and church records reviewed by the Free Press say. The church learned of these allegations in 2018, after the man's wife called an archdiocese hotline and said that her husband had been abused by his priest 40 years earlier. An investigation followed.\n\nPerrone has denied the allegations.\n\nIt seems like it's all a nightmare, Perrone said in a recent interview with the Free Press. I can't believe this is happening to me. Forty-one years of priesthood ... and this has happened? It seems not possible ... I know this didn't happen.\n\nThe parishioners' lawsuit raises questions about the credibility of the accuser, who, according to police reports, suffers from mental health issues and has changed his story multiple times: He started out saying he was raped, but for reasons unknown, he took back that claim and has said there was groping and fondling only.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the accuser eventually denied to church officials that he was ever sexually abused by Perrone, though police reports tell a different story – one of a traumatized and devout Catholic who struggled with guilt and shame, feared his disclosures would lead to retaliation, so he shut down at times, then opened back up with the help of therapy.\n\nIn the eyes of the Catholic Church, the man's inconsistencies didn't matter as it concluded that there was a semblance of truth to what the accuser was saying, and it couldn't afford to look the other way. So on July 5, the archdiocese stripped Perrone of his collar pending further review from the Vatican.\n\nThen came accuser No. 2.\n\nTwo weeks after Perrone's ouster from Assumption Grotto, another former altar boy from St. Peter's came forward with an allegation that Perrone rubbed his genitalia in 1981. According to a police report, the two were riding around the city of Detroit in a Volkswagen Rabbit, looking at the architecture of various Catholic churches, when Perrone reached his hand over and rubbed the accuser's private parts. He said he pushed Perrone's hand away, and that Perrone acted like nothing happened and drove him back to the church in silence. The boy said he then took a bus home, and after that day, he quit being an altar boy.\n\n'Devastating':Woman sues Mormon church for $10M for revealing husband's child sex abuse\n\nPerrone has denied the allegation, saying he doesn't know the second accuser and doesn't recall him ever being an altar server at St. Peter's. The lawsuit also challenges the credibility of the second accuser: a recovering drug addict who did time in prison for theft, according to police records.\n\nBoth accusers, through their attorney, have declined to speak to the Free Press. Both are now 54 and said they first disclosed the sex abuse allegations in therapy sessions long before contacting the authorities, according to police and church records.\n\nThey are not seeking money or pursuing lawsuits against the archdiocese, church officials have said. They have received therapy from the church since coming forward.\n\nPerrone's supporters, meanwhile, believe the 71-year-old pastor, who has passed two polygraph tests, has been caught up in mass hysteria because of scores of clergy sex abuse reports in recent years. The first allegation against Perrone surfaced just months before the explosive Pennsylvania grand jury report, which detailed child sexual abuse and cover-ups by more than 300 clergy members.\n\nMultiple states launched clergy abuse investigations of their own, including Michigan, whose attorney general charged five Catholic priests with criminal sexual conduct last year.\n\nThe Detroit archdiocese also weighed in with letters from Archbishop Allen Vigneron, who offered prayers for the Pennsylvania victims and affirmed the need for accountability among clergy.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Perrone's supporters say, falsely accused priests don't stand a chance.\n\nNobody cares about a wrongfully accused priest. So if the parishioners don't stand up, who will? said Christopher Kolomjec, a Grotto parishioner and Perrone's lawyer who has spent months trying to exonerate his priest.\n\nAt issue for Perrone's supporters is the official church document that was used to remove Perrone. It contains the rape allegation, stating that the alleged victim reported that Father Perrone penetrated him anally, even though the accuser has said that didn't happen.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that church officials fabricated the rape claim to justify Perrone's removal and browbeat and manipulated the accuser into saying something salacious to satisfy the church review board overseeing the case.\n\n(R)ight now it's time to tell us exactly what happened, a detective told the accuser in an interview four days before Perrone's removal. Not fondling, not sodomized. … You have to describe the act. … It has to be penis. It has to be hand. It has to be body parts, and you have to tell us that Eduard Perrone did this. That's it. … And we're going to be on our way to peace.\n\nThis was according to interview transcripts obtained by the Free Press.\n\nThere's been a dark cloud over our parish since it happened. I have yet to meet a single person who wonders if it could be true, Kolomjec said. He really is like a member of everyone's family. The parish has been crushed, devastated.\n\n'We're not overzealous'\n\nThe parishioners' lawsuit names two defendants: the Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Detroit, and Monsignor G. Michael Bugarin, who oversees sex abuse allegations for the archdiocese. Bugarin declined comment and referred questions to the archdiocese.\n\nNed McGrath, spokesperson for the Detroit archdiocese, declined comment on the parishioners' lawsuit, saying only that it takes all sex abuse allegations seriously, no matter what nature, degree or how old, and that Perrone's fate will be decided in Rome.\n\nWe're not doing anything different here. We're not being overzealous. We're doing what we have to do, McGrath said. It does not matter if the alleged abuse occurred five, 15 or more than 50 years ago. ... We treat serious all complaints that are brought forward – in this case from two individuals – and have the utmost concern to protect their privacy and personal safety.\n\nMcGrath explained the rationale behind removing a priest for alleged sex abuse:\n\nIf the allegations are deemed to have 'a semblance of truth,' that is, the allegation is neither manifestly false or frivolous, and there is sufficient evidence to establish reasonable grounds, to believe that the alleged abuse could have occurred, the priest or deacon is restricted in his ministry until the issue is resolved by the Vatican.\n\nMcGrath added: Throughout the Church law process, the accused enjoys the presumption of innocence.\n\nUnder church law, clergy sex abuse investigations must begin with church officials contacting local law enforcement, which happened in Perrone's case. The Michigan State Police and Macomb County Sheriff's Office investigated the sex abuse allegations against Perrone and found them credible, though no charges were filed because too much time had passed.\n\nThe Michigan Attorney General's Office declined to comment on the merits of the case.\n\nMcGrath said the church's goal is to help all those who come forward to heal and become whole.\n\nWe're trying to help those folks, McGrath said. The majority of the people who come forward just want to get it off their chest. They've read about another case and they finally get the guts up to do something about it.\n\nBut when they do finally open up, psychology experts say, the memories that have been blocked out for years may come out haphazardly.\n\nWhen someone has severe history of trauma, it doesn't come out in a linear fashion because the brain isn't processed that way, said Dr. Bob Geffner, president of the Institute on Violence, Abuse and Trauma in San Diego. His institute has evaluated more than 100 clergy sex abuse cases, he said, noting it's common for victims to struggle with painful memories and give confusing accounts.\n\nThey're not remembering distinct events at this point. They're just getting flashes or flashbacks, he said, adding when the flashbacks are too painful, they block them out. This may be why a rape victim says they don't remember divulging a rape allegation, he said.\n\nAnd with clergy sex abuse, Geffner said, there's the added sense of guilt and shame, particularly for those who are deeply religious and fear they did something to deserve this, or that this is what God wants.\n\nFor David Clohessy, the former longtime director of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, the lawsuit carries a troubling message.\n\nThese well-intentioned but horribly misguided churchgoers are inadvertently scaring and depressing other victims into keeping quiet, and that helps other predators, Clohessy said. No matter how charming this priest is, remember: He faces two accusers. Law enforcement apparently finds the allegation 'credible,' as do his own Catholic supervisors.\n\nA wife calls for help\n\nOn May 24, 2018, church records show, a woman called an archdiocese hotline crying, angry, furious, alleging that her husband had been abused by his priest 40 years prior. The husband was experiencing significant mental distress at the time, records show, and he broke down and told his wife about the alleged abuse.\n\nAccording to police and church records reviewed by the Free Press, initially, the man was uncooperative. He refused to give his name or disclose details to the hotline intake worker. He said he was afraid.\n\nHe wasn't emotionally capable of handling what was coming, a police report states, and had only recently started to come to terms with the disclosure of abuse to his therapist.\n\nThe man said that he had disclosed his abuse to his therapist almost three years before he confided in his wife.\n\nAfter that phone call, another 14 months would go by before any action was taken against Perrone. By then, the accuser had been subjected to multiple interviews by a church investigator, a State Police detective and a Macomb County Sheriff's detective.\n\nInvestigators also interviewed four other altar boys who were the accuser's age and served Mass for Perrone. None disclosed any knowledge of Perrone abusing children, though two described the accuser as being the vulnerable type.\n\nThe accuser talked about this vulnerability in his interviews, telling investigators that his father was seriously ill and incapacitated during this time of his life, and that Father Perrone was aware of this. He also discussed why he said he hid the abuse.\n\nHe never told his parents because his own father was very ill and his mother would not have believed him. His parents were very active in the church and never questioned Father Perrone, states one police report.\n\nIn his police interviews, the accuser sometimes broke down and had to compose himself. He answered questions by nodding his head. He had panic attacks and his accounts varied. For example, one detective stated in her report that the man said he was sexually abused by Perrone during a camping trip, while another detective said the man made no such statements to him. Rather, he only stated that he, Perrone and another altar boy slept in a very small tent, causing them to touch.\n\nThat other altar boy is James Fortenberry, a nurse who now lives in Huntsville, Alabama, and believes his childhood priest has been done wrong.\n\nThe camping trip\n\nI was on the camping trip. There was no abuse there, Fortenberry said in a recent telephone interview with the Free Press, alleging a church investigator tracked him down and tried to suggest that he, too, was abused by Perrone.\n\nI'd definitely know if I was abused. There was nothing remotely abusive about our relationship, said Fortenberry, who remembers Perrone teaching him how to drive a stick shift on the camping trip.\n\nAccording to police records, Perrone took the two altar boys on a camping trip to the Upper Peninsula in the summer of their 11th-grade year. They shared a three-man pup tent and Perrone, who was then 29, slept in between the two boys. One of the boys alleged he was fondled by Perrone.\n\nFortenberry believes investigators have manipulated his friend into making such allegations, claiming they also tried to coerce him into saying negative things about Perrone.\n\nI made it really clear to them that nothing ever happened, said Fortenberry, who has not lived in Michigan for 30 years. (Perrone) was a great influence and a great priest in my life.\n\nAfter investigators called him about Perrone, Fortenberry said he called his old classmate, the accuser, to tell him about the inquiry.\n\nHe tried to get me to say that it was weird for Father Perrone to take the two of us camping, said Fortenberry, who recalled telling him,  'Nothing happened.'\n\n 'Are you sure? People are telling me that things could have happened, '  Fortenberry recalled the man answering back.\n\nFortenberry believes Perrone was set up.\n\nI'm not saying our church hasn't had problems with pedophiles, Fortenberry said. But I think the church needs to stand up for our good priests. And Father Perrone is a good priest.\n\n'I want it to stop'\n\nIt was last June when Perrone got a knock on his condo door.\n\nIt was some reporters with the Associated Press. They had stopped by, he recalled them saying, to talk about Opus Bono Sacerdotii – a nonprofit that Perrone co-founded in 2002 that supports Catholic priests facing sexual abuse allegations and other problems.\n\nPerrone invited the reporters to sit on his deck. A conversation started when out of nowhere came a bombshell question: What about the allegations that have been made against you?\n\nI said, 'What? What allegations?'  he recalled telling the reporters.\n\nHe had been accused of groping boys, the reporters told him. A former altar boy had come forward with allegations that decades ago he invited altar boys to his family lake house, wrestled with them for hours in the water, at times inappropriately grabbing and groping them.\n\nI had no idea this was coming, said Perrone, stressing the allegations are absolutely not true.\n\nThis is such a terrible insult to me. Why would I damn a soul, and my own, by committing a crime like that? It's incomprehensible to me, said Perrone, who agrees with his parishioners: That he was set up for being too conservative.\n\nFor 25 years, Perrone has made a name for himself as a straitlaced, old-school pastor who preaches and practices strict Catholic doctrine: Assumption Grotto parishioners kneel to receive Holy Communion – the wafer never touching their hand, but placed directly in their mouth. There's a dress code for brides – nothing too short or revealing. He will not give Communion to divorced parishioners who have remarried unless they have had the first marriage annulled. And no one can get Communion if they are in a state of sin, which, in Perrone's eyes, includes practicing homosexuals.\n\nThis is an attempt to get me out, said Perrone, who believes there's an ideological strife in the Catholic Church, with liberals aiming to get rid of conservatives like himself.\n\nIsn't it outrageous that neither the accusers nor law enforcement have been my problem? Perrone said. The one causing my problem is the Archdiocese of Detroit.\n\nThat is pathetic.\n\nPerrone denies harming his accusers or any child. He says he's never touched anyone inappropriately and believes there's been a terrible mistake. He remembers his accuser as a good kid and good altar server who wanted to become a priest when he was in high school. He said he was close with the boy's family, visited their home and took an interest in their son because of his interest in the priesthood, and he wanted to help him in any way I could.\n\nPerrone said his relationship with the boy was pure, and that he often imagines what he'd tell him if he could talk to him.\n\nI would forgive him, Perrone said. This was a terrible mistake. Nothing happened. Nothing criminal at all.\n\nPerrone defended the camping trip, saying it was part of pastoral life back then, when priests were encouraged to connect with young people so that they could bring them into the faith.\n\nI just wanted to be good and close and friendly with our kids, in those days the understanding of that was much different from what it is today, he said.\n\nPerrone explained why he took two boys camping: I love to be outdoors. I had never been camping. I thought this would be a great experience ... and where are you going to find adults who want to rough it. To sleep on the ground. To light their own fires, cook their owns meals, go on hikes ... but kids, kids love that kind of thing, Perrone said.\n\nBut times have changed, he conceded.\n\nBy today's standards, this would not be the thing to do, Perrone said of camping with boys with no supervision. Not because of any fear of what I would do. But because sensitivities have been so raised by all the scandal that has been caused by priests who have done criminal things. Sad to say, we have to be very careful.\n\nAs for why Perrone is speaking publicly about the accusations he is facing, he said he wants to clear his name, vindicate his supportive parish, and help other falsely accused priests.\n\nI want it to stop, not just for myself, (but) there other priests who have been accused who have been innocent … this has happened to them, and it will likely happen again, he said. I owe it to them who are coming up, who may be the next victim of this kind of process.\n\nMeanwhile, the parishioners at Assumption Grotto have been prohibited from having any contact with Perrone, who has to wear civilian clothes now. He can't call his parishioners. They can't call him. They can't even organize a rosary prayer for him.\n\nFor Perrone, the allegation has been soul-crushing. He has spent years taking care of priests in crisis. He housed them. Prayed for them. Counseled them. And now he is one of them.\n\nContact Tresa Baldas: tbaldas@freepress.com.
Suspended high above a ski hill in the frigid cold, wearing darkened goggles and a helmet, may not seem like the setting to meet the love of your life.\n\nBut it's happened, and ski chairlift speed dating is coming to Wisconsin this winter.\n\nSomewhat like speed-dating events where singles meet for a series of timed dates at a restaurant or bar, chairlift dates last only a few minutes, sitting side by side on the double-seat lift.\n\nIf the conversation goes well, and sparks fly, the newly minted couple skis down the slope together and carries on with their date.\n\nIf not, they go separate ways and get back in the chairlift line to meet someone else.\n\nHurt feelings from a chilly separation?\n\nI suppose there's that chance, but I feel that rejection is simply a way of freeing you to meet somebody who's more aligned with your interests, said Courtney Smallbeck, spokeswoman for It's Just Lunch, a dating service that's helping run the first chairlift dating event at Wilmot Mountain near Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nI don't think people get terribly emotionally involved in a relationship they've only had for five minutes, but you never know, Smallbeck said.\n\nChairlift speed dating has been done at ski resorts in Colorado and Minnesota, but Wisconsin skiers say it's still a novelty here.\n\nMore:Singles spend the most on dating each month, but the least per date, study finds\n\nMore:Looking for love: How much does the average date cost in your state?\n\nMore:How to date on the cheap without feeling cheated on date night\n\nSingles who sign up for the events are paired ahead of time, on paper, by professional matchmakers who assess their interests and compatibility.\n\nThey meet in person for the first time at the ski hill chairlift.\n\nIt's like a very short first date. Do you want to see this person again? Do you want to get to know them better? Those are the questions you're trying to answer, Smallbeck said. The great thing is, if that person doesn't like you, then you can find somebody who does by getting back in line.\n\nFinding love in the snow seems to work for some folks.\n\nThirty-five years ago at Wilmot Mountain, Christine Morris met the man who would become her husband and the father of their four children.\n\nShe and Christopher were on ski patrol together, working at the hill, assisting novices and skiers injured on the slopes.\n\nI was determined to find someone who had the same passion for skiing I had. And you learn a lot about someone when you're out together in the cold, Christine said.\n\nTheir relationship snowballed, and now married for 32 years they're still on the ski patrol at Wilmot, about 15 minutes from their home in northern Illinois.\n\nOne night, Christine said, she helped carry a woman off the hill who was injured in a fall. It was New Year's Eve and the woman was on a blind date with a guy she just met at Wilmot.\n\nShe went to the hospital. That's how they ended up spending New Year's Eve. But it was the cutest story because he stayed with her the entire time. I thought, 'Dude, you're awesome,' Christine recalled.\n\n'This amazing person sitting beside me'\n\nLast winter, Kelsey Panczyk of suburban Chicago met her true love on the chairlift at Wilmot.\n\nIt was her first time skiing, ever, and she was struggling to get on and off the lift without taking an embarrassing tumble.\n\nThis kind guy approached me and asked if I could use some help. Looking back now, I'm glad my apparent lack of knowledge got me where it did, Panczyk said in an email sent to Wilmot.\n\nHe accompanied me up the lift while walking me through basic things with gentle eyes and a sweet smile. The annoyance I was feeling towards my friends who were already up the lift had dissipated, and I was infatuated with this amazing person sitting beside me. Once we got to the top, my friends poked fun at the fact that only I would find a guy on my first ski lift. But I didn't mind, Panczyk wrote.\n\nAfter a long day of laughing and falling and learning, I felt like I just wanted to be around him more. I invited him to grab coffee, and we talked about how strange coincidences can bring people together, and we shyly looked at each other and then away. I remember this day like it was just yesterday.\n\nWe exchanged numbers and even bigger smiles when we realized we were only an hour from one another back home. … It's been almost a year, and I will always be thankful for Wilmot Mountain for being the place where I found my love.\n\nFrom age 21 to 70\n\nWilmot's chairlift dating event is scheduled for Feb. 10. It's for singles between the ages of 21 and 70, with participants paired together by age groups.\n\nPrivacy is protected by the matchmaking service, and you don't have to reveal your last name to anyone you meet on the chairlift unless you want to.\n\nStill, it could be an awkward first date if the lift gets stuck and you're suspended in the air next to someone for an hour.\n\nI guess you'd really get to know that person by the end of the experience. It would make a good headline: Strangers jump on chairlift, exit married, Smallbeck said.\n\n'A great time'\n\nAfton Alps in Hastings, Minnesota, has had chairlift speed dating, marriage proposals on the hill, engagement parties and weddings.\n\nAbout 100 people show up for the dating events that last roughly 90 minutes, giving everyone a couple of chances to meet someone they like on the lift.\n\nAfterward, everyone's invited for a party at the ski lodge bar. A local salon comes and helps the singles with their helmet hair.\n\nThe whole thing is based on fun and lightheartedness. I haven't had anyone come back and say they've found the love of their life, but what I did have was a lot of really happy people who had a great time, said Afton Alps spokeswoman Pamela Hoye.\n\nIt's just a few minutes on a chairlift, so it's low-risk. And you're wearing a helmet and goggles. All of the intimidation factors are eliminated, Hoye said.\n\nUnless you're especially brave, it's probably a good idea to have some knowledge of skiing before you sign up for chairlift dating.\n\nSometimes the hardest part is exiting the lift ... to me, that's the most nerve-wracking part of skiing, Smallbeck said.\n\nBut empathy is a beautiful quality. So if you struggle, and your partner is helpful, that's a good quality to have in someone.
Want to start off the new year by watching A-list celebrities in glamorous outfits make acceptance speeches? We've got just the thing: The Golden Globe Awards air today Sunday.\n\nThe first major show of the 2020 awards season, the Globes is also usually the booziest, funniest (thanks in part to returning host Ricky Gervais) and fashion-adventurous of the Hollywood events. The awards soirée is one that should be enjoyed as a frothy entertainment event, and not necessarily a prestigious Academy Awards predictor.\n\nHere's everything you need to know to watch the 77th annual celebration of film and TV stars.\n\nGolden Globes predictions:Who will win – and who should?\n\nSnubbed: Matt Damon, Adam Sandler, all female directors get left out of Golden Globes nominations\n\nThe Globes air Jan. 5 on NBC\n\nThe show will air live coast to coast on NBC at 8 EST/5 PST. The three-hour event will take place at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nE! will present red carpet interviews with the stars live on TV, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association will have pre-show coverage on Facebook starting at 6 EST/3 PST. After the show, the HFPA and The Hollywood Reporter will host an hourlong Twitter live stream with winner interviews.\n\nYou can stream the show\n\nIf you have a cable or satellite subscription, you can watch the Globes on host network's NBC App or NBC.com. Cord-cutters can watch on their streaming services, including Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, Sling TV and PlayStation Vue.\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association picks the winners\n\nThe HFPA is a small group of about 90 international journalists based in Southern California. Since the group is small (and has been accused of voting for glamorous stars), winners tend to be unpredictable. Winning a Golden Globe isn't quite as prestigious as, say, taking home an Emmy Award or Oscar, but you'll still hear stars emotionally thank the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for their awards.\n\nThe awards do raise awareness for nominated projects, though. Netflix's Marriage Story, which has six Globes nominations, has plenty of momentum going into Oscars voting, which began Thursday. And the streaming service's show Unbelievable is nominated, which might give the series some fresh critical eyes months before the Emmy Awards.\n\nRicky Gervais is back to host\n\nThe Brit is back for a fifth time, because the HFPA made me an offer I can't refuse, Gervais joked in a news release. But this is the very last time I'm doing this, which could make for a fun evening.\n\nThe unpredictable and often-outrageous comedian hosted the Globes for three successive years from 2010 to 2012 and returned for a fourth time in 2016. His jokes were not limited to nominated stars; he spent plenty of time making fun of the show he was hosting. In 2012, he said, The Golden Globes are just like the Oscars but without all that esteem. They are to the Oscar what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton … a bit louder, a bit trashier, a bit drunker and more easily bought – allegedly. Nothing has been proved.\n\nThe Golden Globe ambassadors are ...\n\nPierce Brosnan's sons, Dylan, 22, and Paris Bronsan, 18, who will assist with presenting awards and handing out trophies. The ambassador honor traditionally goes to the offspring of a celebrity.\n\nBig stars turn out for the show\n\nThis year's A-list nominees include Charlize Theron, Eddie Murphy, Jennifer Lopez, Al Pacino and Tom Hanks (who is set to receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement). Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, who are also nominated, are set to present Sunday, so the barometer of star power is sure to be high, as the HFPA intended. Why else would the group have an open bar and nominate Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie for 2010's critically panned The Tourist? This is an invitation that celebrities tend to RSVP yes to.\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander\n\nLast year's Golden Globes:What you didn't see on the telecast
New year, new love. Brian Austin Green and Sharna Burgess are Instagram official!\n\nBurgess, a 35-year-old ballroom dancer, took to Instagram Monday to share a photo of herself kissing the 47-year-old actor.\n\nThe Dancing with the Stars pro, simply captioned 𝘏 𝘐 𝘔 💋 on the smooching snapshot.\n\nThough Green isn't tagged in the post, his tattoos (which are on full display in the shirtless pic) confirm it's him.\n\nThe photo, taken at an undisclosed location, features a tropical backdrop of palm trees and crashing waves.\n\nPlenty of of Burgess' followers joined in on praising the pair.\n\nModel Nyle DiMarco wrote, giiiirlll drop his @.\n\nChoreographer Maksim Chmerkovskiy wrote, Here we go! ❤️ Can I follow B now?\n\nDWTS star Peta Murgatroyd wrote, There they are ❤️❤️❤️ LOVE you guys!!!!\n\nJenna Johnson Chmerkovskiy, another DWTS star, wrote, Omg omg omg. I have no words.\n\nGreen and Burgess were previously spotted together around Christmas time in photos published by the Daily Mail.\n\nThe photo comes less than two months after Megan Fox filed for divorce from Brian Austin Green, days after she made her red-carpet debut with boyfriend Machine Gun Kelly at the American Music Awards.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by E! News and TMZ, the Transformers actress, 34, cited irreconcilable differences as the reason between her split from the Beverly Hills, 90210 star after 10 years of marriage.\n\nFox and Green met in 2004 when Green guest-starred on the series Hope & Faith when Fox was 18 and he was 30. They became engaged in 2006 but broke it off before eventually marrying in June 2010.\n\nThey initially split in 2015, with Fox citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for separation in her initial divorce filing. But after Fox became pregnant with their son Journey, now 4, the couple reconciled. They also share sons Noah, 8, and Bodhi, 6.\n\nHowever, Green confirmed they split again in May after growing apart.\n\nNeither one of us did anything to each other, he clarified. She's always been honest with me. I've always been honest with her. We've had an amazing relationship.\n\nContributing: Cydney Henderson\n\nMore:Megan Fox files for divorce from Brian Austin Green after red-carpet debut with Machine Gun Kelly: reports\n\n'The Masked Dancer':New 'Masked Singer' spin-off IDs celebs based on fancy footwork and many clues
Though he publicly came out almost 10 years ago, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper says he first knew something was different around the age of 6 or 7.\n\nI'm not sure I knew the word 'gay' at the time, but I realized something was up, Cooper said in a Q&A session Monday on CNN's Full Circle, adding that he began to tell friends when he was in high school but still struggled through college with fully loving himself.\n\nI think I really, truly accepted it – and not just accepted it, but fully embraced it and came around to really loving the fact that I was gay – would probably be right after college, he said.\n\nA lot of the things I wanted to do at the time, you couldn't be gay, he said, citing an interest in joining the U.S. military, though out members of the gay community were not allowed to serve at the time. The military's don't ask, don't tell policy which prohibited openly gay, lesbian and bisexual Americans from serving, was officially repealed in 2011.\n\nHe was also interested in getting married, but same-sex marriage was not legalized until 2015.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale University in 1989, Cooper decided he didn't want to waste any more time worrying about this or wishing I was some other way.\n\nHe came out as gay to the public on July 2, 2012, allowing friend and writer Andrew Sullivan to publish an email from him, saying it'd become clear that remaining silent on the topic had given the false impression that he had something to hide.\n\nThe fact is, I'm gay, always have been, always will be, and I couldn't be any more happy, comfortable with myself, and proud, he wrote.\n\nCooper has since welcomed a son, Wyatt Morgan Cooper, born April 27, 2020 via surrogate. He co-parents with his former partner, nightclub owner Benjamin Maisani. The two split in 2018 after nine years of dating, though they remain good friends.\n\nI think being gay is one of the great blessings of my life, Cooper added on Full Circle. And it made me a better person, it made me a better reporter... It's enabled me to love the people that I've loved and have the life that I've had. So I'm very blessed.\n\nContributing: Anika Reed\n\n'I am a dad.

PASADENA, Calif. – Kim Kardashian West's latest show is shining a light on a whole different kind of reality.\n\nMost associate the star with Keeping Up the Kardashians, her marriage to Kanye West, her makeup line and various other Kardashian-branded businesses. But Kardashian West also has turned her attention to working on issues surrounding mass incarceration.\n\nPresident Trump granted clemency in 2018 to Alice Marie Johnson serving a life sentence for cocaine trafficking — after hearing a plea from Kardashian West in an Oval Office meeting. Since then Kardashian West has spoken about about the issue, which has culminated in her new Oxygen documentary (April 5, 7 ET/PT), Kim Kardashian West: The Justice Project.\n\nIt can be exhausting, frustrating, but I know that we can make a difference, and so all the criticism in the world will not deter me from what I want to do, Kardashian West told reporters at the Television Critics Association Saturday.\n\nI'm very used to criticism so nothing really fazes me. I'm one of those not-human souls that can really deal with it. However I really genuinely just stay focused on cases and people and am extremely compassionate.\n\nNo, I'm not doing it for publicity, she continued. I really do and care and spend 20 hours a week away from my family and my kids (for this).\n\nThe star is spending those hours away from her family pursuing a law degree, and has recently completed her first year of law school.\n\n(I) aced a test recently, she said. There's so much behind the scenes that has never been publicized . . . . I literally do this every single day and spend time away from my work, everything else, my family, because once you get so deep into the system . . . you just can't give up.\n\nThe two-hour documentary follows four specific cases that Kardashian West feels illuminate greater injustices within the system.\n\nEvery case that I choose is really personal to me and a lot of the time it's from a letter I receive from someone on the inside that just really touches my heart and something that know moves me, she said.\n\nBut the cases I showcase in this documentary showcase the broken aspect of our system. . . . I hope that people can be more empathetic and feel that by giving people, like those featured in the 'Justice Project' a second chance, there is no danger to our society.\n\nKardashian West said becoming a mother inspired her to start working on criminal justice reform.\n\nI'm raising four black children that could face a situation like any of the people that I help, she said. Just to know I can make a difference in my children's lives and (others) by helping fix a broken system, that's so motivating for me.
