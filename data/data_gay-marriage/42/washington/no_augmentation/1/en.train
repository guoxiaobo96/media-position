{"original": "friday, october 22, 1999; page a2 los angeles—the campaign to declare that marriage only between a man and a woman is legal in california--as opposed to a union of two men or two women--has suddenly turned very personal. the issue, which is as much about homosexual rights as it is about family values, is pitting religious conservatives against gays and their allies here, and may once again roil the political waters of this bellwether state, just as initiatives over bilingual education, affirmative action and illegal immigrants have in the past. and in this case, it already has pitted father against son. in an opinion piece last week in the los angeles times, the son of the ballot initiative's sponsor wrote that his father is anti-gay and pursuing a blind, uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a subject about which he knows nothing and wants to know nothing, but which serves his political career. the son, david knight, revealed that he is gay and living with a life partner named joe. he is also a graduate of the air force academy, a former fighter pilot who served in the persian gulf war and now, at age 39, is a cabinet maker in baltimore leading a quiet, full life. he says his father has rejected him because of his sexual orientation.", "augmented": []}

(josh blackman, a popular federalist social media force and a professor at the south texas college of law, documented the moment in his 2013 book, unprecedented: the constitutional challenge to obamacare.) barnett told me how one person in the group says, 'you want to do something about this?' i said, 'sure.' … and he said, 'whatever we do, we've got to do it fast because it's going to come out of committee very soon.'

{"original": "the encounters, as they accumulate, grow tedious. perhaps this is slimani's point, that sex won't solve problems, that indulging in base desires can make you miserable. if so, it's a point made countless times before in fiction (and in memoir) with far more emotionally resonant results. adèle glides through the narrative on a numbness-inducing wave, the kind far better executed in pauline reage's the story of o or elizabeth mcneill's nine and a half weeks or the complete works of anais nin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "adèle isn't likable, but that's also irrelevant. she's barely a character, so there is little for the reader to react to. worse, all the other characters — her husband, her children and a paramour who can't stay casual — are paper-thin constructs. reading adèle — such a far cry from the perfect nanny — was like being in the middle of a blocking exercise in a play rehearsal. move her here, move him there, see what happens, if anything happens at all.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "planning the trip and traveling together is also good for your marriage, sussman adds. she recommends that people planning a honeymoon — or really any vacation — make time to really talk about what they want from that trip, down to the way they expect to spend the days. people really need to have that conversation and get on the same page, she says. do you want to see every site there is? do you want to relax and sleep in? talk to each other and figure that out before you go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but don't let the opportunity to go somewhere slip away, because traveling together has benefits. we all have a tendency to get caught up in our daily routine, sussman says. sometimes you can get into a rut and it can feel mundane. just being together is a way to connect, and it doesn't need to be a big fancy trip. it could be an airbnb in your own city in a different neighborhood.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "another thing to keep in mind is that freelance earnings of $400 or more are subject to self-employment taxes, meaning that you must pay both the employer and employee share of social security and medicare taxes. that adds up to a total tax rate of 15.3 percent, says cari weston, a director with the american institute of cpas. however, self-employed workers can also deduct the employer portion of those payroll taxes, which account for half of the tax rate, or 7.65 percent, weston says. they may also be able to write off some other business-related costs associated with their side gigs, such as advertising, marketing and software, that can help lower their tax bill, greene-lewis says.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "for example, a couple with each spouse earning $100,000 a year would pay nearly $800 more in income taxes after getting married than if each person had filed separately as a single person, according to a calculator from the tax policy center. depending on how much each spouse is withholding from his or her paycheck, the difference could result in a tax bill.

{"original": "but some people may also face tax bills after coming across less obvious prizes, such as fans who catch a home-run ball at an important baseball game. that ball has value and is taxable, du val says. if you returned the ball in exchange for tickets or a memorabilia such as a signed jersey, that may also be considered taxable income, but tax experts say the rules are not clear.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i read in the new york times today that if i run for president, one of my problems will be that i like republicans, biden said. he made the sign of the cross. bless me, father, for i have sinned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the story in question, by alexander burns, described an october 2018 visit to michigan where biden collected $200,000 to speak to a business group and praised rep. fred upton (r-mich.) as one of the finest guys i've ever worked with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the comment angered local democrats, who came within five points of ousting upton. the grumbling underlined a paradox of the 2020 democratic primary: even as biden leads in speculative polls, even as some senior democrats insist he could roll past president trump, few in the party — including his rivals — are treating him like a front runner. no major candidate is waiting on biden to decide; none of them believes he can clear the field.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you compare biden's on-paper strength to what we saw in the past few contests, it would make sense to call him a front-runner. the only serious poll of iowa so far, december's des moines register/cnn poll, put him at 32 percent in the first caucus state, 13 points ahead of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt). every national poll of democratic votes, which don't mean much at this stage but generate plenty of news, has put biden on top. polls testing him against the president consistently put him ahead.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so why isn't he treated like hillary clinton was, with potential rivals scurrying out of his shadow? in conversations this week, operatives working with most of the candidates already running for president offered a number of reasons. some imagined that biden could carve out a lane for himself; some speculated that he could collapse once a presidential bid moved from fantasy to reality.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this newsletter usually stays away from blind quotes, but the best way to capture a conversation that's happening all the time among democrats was to let these operatives speak freely. in general, you can identify three reasons why they believe biden, unlike previous front-runners, was not scaring anyone. these people are paid to elect somebody else, but this is the chatter happening when democrats turn off the microphones.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "where's the grass-roots support? multiple operatives described biden as a genuinely beloved figure among democratic voters but not one who had turned his popularity into a real network of support. he did not waste his time after leaving the white house: he wrote a memoir about his son beau's death from cancer, he went on a multistate speaking tour, he launched a pac, and he campaigned for dozens of democrats, especially in places where other party figures were not terribly popular.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but he did not scare off democrats by building, or letting his supporters build, a pre-campaign operation. there was some scoffing about ready for hillary, the 2013-2015 effort to organize potential supporters of the 2016 nominee, but it raised millions of dollars and hosted scores of events. during the invisible primary of the same period, clinton and allies scouted for talent and communicated to those who weren't picked that it would be a mistake for their long-term plans, if they worked for someone else.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "people may have assumed she was heir apparent, but she got her campaign moving and started grabbing top staff, one operative said. that is not the case with the biden people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "biden has also lagged some lower-polling candidates in the trackable metrics of enthusiasm. to cite just one: sanders has 7.5 million followers on facebook and elizabeth warren has 3.1 million, while biden clocks in at 1.5 million. sanders and warren have used that network to launch legislative pressure campaigns and organize bustling campaign events; biden has not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "just in neutral, technical terms, i don't think biden's seen as being on the cutting edge of grass-roots organizing, another operative said. traditionally, his base has been high-dollar donors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's his age again? this came up again and again: biden would be the oldest nominee of any major party, and his nomination would set up a contest of two men in their late 70s, with implications that biden's supporters have not seriously processed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the idea that biden would crack the trump coalition with his appeal to white working-class voters was simply not flying with rival campaigns; they'd heard it about hillary clinton, who was seen as able to win back democrats who'd left out of frustration with president barack obama. when they're exposed to the heat of a campaign, brands can hold strong, or they can melt.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's been a fairly condescending notion from democrats that to win back trump voters you have to go in and look comfortable in white working-class communities, one operative said. that won't pass in the democratic party anymore. if you try that, you're going to hear 'hey, you voted to send our jobs overseas,' and that's right in trump's strike zone. he's got some experience in nailing democrats who voted for these trade deals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "several operatives also argued that biden, despite two national elections at obama's side, would struggle to excite the voters who were hardest to turn out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we lost in 2016, and the largest single factor in that loss was that we coudln't match our previous performance with the obama coalition, one of them said. we couldn't match the enthusiasm. that is a long-run problem — how does he inspire more enthusiasm than hillary? young black voters who fell off in 2016 weren't excited by hillary, so how does joe biden fix that? is it when people start talking about his votes against busing?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what about his gaffes? speaking of those votes: biden's potential rivals are extremely well aware of his long voting record, which put him on the record for everything from the antiabortion hyde amendment (now officially opposed by the democratic platform) to crack/cocaine sentencing disparities to legislation that made it harder to declare bankruptcy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "talking points distributed by biden allies say that he could run as a progressive champion who was outspoken on lgbtq rights even when every pundit around said that it was a political mistake. his rivals point out that biden would be the only democrat who cast a vote in favor of a national ban on same-sex marriage, in 1996. only one other potential candidate, sanders, was in office that year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the question is whether voters let him play by a different set of rules or not, said one operative. i hear people bring anita hill up a lot, so it'll be interesting to see how much apologizing he has to do. he does not start in a good position on women's rights. but he's in a better position to explain it than someone democrats have never heard of.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "unsurprisingly, the people working for other candidates think that biden's framing for a potential campaign has put him in a weaker position. the upton comment was one example of a biden refrain: that he can get both parties to come to the table and cut deals on issues of obvious national importance.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's no reason that by 2025, we can't have most of our energy coming from renewables, biden said thursday. it's all within our grasp, but for special interests. he recapped the implementation of the 2009 stimulus package by saying that it required us to work together, because our backs were against the wall. the reaction from rival campaigns: which republicans does he think the next president will have to deal with?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "who did the operatives worry about? really, no one, and none were exactly glib about biden's potential challenge. he had the ability, they said, to enter the race with massive national attention, with polls showing him well ahead of trump, and with some democrats quickly endorsing him. but after 2016, they simply were not afraid of front-runners.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the partnership for america's health care future, launched with some ballyhoo in december, is an all-hands effort by insurance and drug companies to suppress support for medicare-for-all before it's too late. efforts like this have been brutally effective in state elections, with hundreds of millions of dollars raining down to block health-care ballot measures.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "we know that more is coming, as the intercept scooped some of these internal plans in november. but roping the public option into the single-payer discussion, which worked for republicans in 2010, is a tougher task now — it makes no changes to private plans whatsoever and has become the universal compromise position of the democratic party.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "stunned, she yanks him off the ground and kisses him roughly, after which the fantasy dissolves and janet reno, attorney general, is shown to be making out with simba the tiger. she is – has this been mentioned already? – a man. also, she is tall. that's one thing. it may be the main thing, the thing that explains so much else. this is what janet reno would tell you. they do this sort of thing because she is so tall. she's tall, says former labor secretary robert reich, who is not, when asked what single thing strikes him about janet reno. the few times we did events together, i was reminded of just how tall she is. well, yes, that's one point you can safely make about the attorney general. she is, without question, tall – 6 foot 1 – hence perhaps one popular image that has emerged of her, big and fearless, clomping through the corridors of justice. what reno's sister, maggy hurchalla, sniffingly calls the image of a large person with boots on. but that's just one of many images the culture has yielded during reno's five-year tenure. one of the longest-serving attorneys general in modern history and arguably the most powerful appointed woman in american politics (given the inherent stature of her cabinet post and her long-running investigative authority over the president), reno has been in the public eye more often, or at least more dramatically, than anyone else in clinton's cabinet.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "she is doubtless the best-known attorney general since robert f. kennedy; citizens who couldn't pick william barr out of a police line-up approach her in airports to confide some personal outrage. but even now – or maybe especially now, with the spin and finger-pointing that followed her decision not to appoint the independent counsel to investigate clinton and vice president gore – the images of janet reno are dizzyingly multifarious. in today's political climate, with the parties battling for any incremental advantage, it's probably not surprising that the democrats are spinning her one way and the republicans another – that she's been portrayed, alternately and with equal conviction, as a flinty individualist and a pandering white house loyalist: a paragon of public virtue is how rep. tom lantos (d-calif.) put it, not long after jim nicholson, chairman of the republican national committee, had gone on record saying how sad it was to see janet reno shredding her last remaining bit of credibility. and given her earlier career as state attorney in dade county, fla., and her current position as head, and figurehead, of the justice department – which is to say, the main justice facility, the u.s. attorney operations, the bureau of prisons, the immigration and naturalization service, the fbi, the drug enforcement administration and the u.s. marshals service – it's probably also not surprising that she has attracted the ravings of a subterranean lunatic fringe.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the saturday night live skits may be good-natured, laughable, but they go out to an estimated 9 million viewers. and they are consistent with a pattern in which reno, more even than other women in the clinton administration, has been incessantly sexualized: in the snl skits, on late-night tv, in jokes, in rumors, at washington dinner parties, on at least one recent videotape in which small-time right-wing politicians declaim pompously against her, a videotape anonymously shipped to the washington post and labeled janet reno – evil lesbian. the culture gropes for an archetype, a way to understand her, some means of comparison. after the waco disaster and her truman-like assumption of responsibility, spy magazine superimposed reno's head over the pumped-up pectorals of arnold schwarzenegger in the terminator. more recently, the weekly world news tabloid superimposed her head over the body of a fleshy model wearing a swimsuit and platform shoes (janet reno . . . as you've never seen her before! promised the headline to the story, which purported to show how men in japan salivate over reno), while jay leno took the opposite approach, superimposing her head on the body of xena: warrior princess, a tv heroine who is also a lesbian icon. the culture, in short, is confused. is she ma kettle, hillbilly dominatrix? is she nurse ratched, humorless and repressed? is she jimmy stewart, gregory peck, joan of arc? she's hit from all sides.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "throughout her career the first female attorney general has downplayed gender, unlike, say, supreme court justices ruth bader ginsburg or sandra day o'connor, both of whom are from roughly the same generation as reno, both of whom have made sex discrimination a crucial part of their public story lines. even though (as she quietly said in her confirmation hearing) reno, too, was denied a law job because of her gender, she has chosen not to go there, not to wave that particular flag. i don't think [gender] remotely occurs to her, says anne bingaman, former head of the antitrust division. though reno has advanced the cause of women at the justice department, in keeping with her stated intent to hire based on excellence and diversity, she has tended to surround herself with women who think of themselves more as individualists than as feminists, who prefer not to make an issue of gender, to keep their heads down and work. in her approach, she's also strikingly different from the other controversial woman in the clinton administration, the other woman who has jokes and web sites devoted to her hair and her sexuality, the other woman who has appeared on a tabloid cover in a bathing suit (and another time, holding a space alien baby): hillary clinton. in a sense, hillary clinton and janet reno both have been thrust into excruciatingly difficult roles for modern women to accommodate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clinton in the highly symbolic, conventionally feminine role of first lady has one redoubtable host of expectations to cope with, and reno, in the traditionally masculine role of top cop, has another. and both have coped in very different ways. unlike reno, hillary clinton came to washington as a feminist networker, surrounded herself with women who made gender an issue first and foremost. unlike reno, she has at times attempted to parry the fulminators publicly. the response to her infamous 1992 campaign remark, i suppose i could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas, shows how risky it can be to answer the critics on their own terms. in a sense, reno's head-down stance is consistent with her whole attitude toward publicity, which is to say: go forward, do your work, don't make a lot of noise, don't spin. whenever political appointees come to washington, it's necessary to make a decision about how and whether to participate in the image-management industry. madeleine albright, for example, is one cabinet member who pays close attention to how she looks and who she knows and how she's portrayed. in contrast, when reno came to justice she didn't even want a press office (in miami, she fielded reporters' calls herself). when it became clear she had to have one, she chose stern, a former law correspondent for nbc, to head it, with the idea that his natural inclination would be to distribute information rather than spin. according to stern, she remains remarkably unconcerned about how people see her.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "reno threw an arm around him, told him that she liked big, strong, handsome, kind, sensitive, intelligent men, and added, i understand why you might be confused. it was an adroit, sensitive parry of a label – dyke! – that many women are confronted with at some point or other, one that's so difficult to handle because, in responding, one runs the risk of protesting too much, or implying that there's something wrong with homosexuality. moreover, it's a label that's impossible to disprove. women, often, are polarizing, says political consultant carter eskew, something that will come as no surprise to working mothers, or to stay-at-home mothers, or to single mothers, or to unmarried women, or to women without children. everybody has an opinion about the most personal choices a woman can make, and naturally these opinions get translated to the public arena. reno thus remains an easy target despite her olympian disregard of the rumormongers. in washington, moreover, she also unnerves people because she is so introverted, such an inveterate non-schmoozer. during the week, she works. on weekends, she works, and, when she has a chance, hikes the c&o canal or kayaks the potomac – behavior that baffles the a-list crowd. washington, particularly in the corridors of power, is a very normative environment, jamie gorelick says. so wonderful qualities that are endearing in another community are deemed unacceptable here.", "augmented": []}

(d-mich.) and, in a gidget-like moment, asks conyers what he's going to wear to congress the next day. a suit, he sighs. what are you going to wear to the justice department? my one blue dress, says reno. it's a predictable joke, a jab at the much- remarked fact that reno does seem to wear a blue dress every day, except for days when she wears a blue suit. for a male, such behavior would be less remarkable, expected. for reno, the dress and the brush 'n' go short haircut receive more attention than probably any law enforcement initiative she's ever proposed. like her unmarried status, they raise a red flag: people say, `oh, bad glasses, bad hair, bad this, bad that,'  says consultant neel lattimore, former press secretary to hillary clinton.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "no presentation of masculinity — not buttigieg's, and not trump's — is a salubrious thing. it's all toxic. but there's a key difference. trump's idea of manliness involves degrading women, threatening violence against racial and religious and sexual minorities, and using false and superficial displays of strength (who's the loudest? who's the meanest? who's sleeping with the hottest women? who's making other people look small?) to overcome self-doubt and feel big. by contrast, men who take the stoic approach, stifling their emotions and anything that smacks of stereotypical femininity, mostly harm themselves; acting like gary cooper can eat you up from the inside. but on a general-election stage, against trump's primordial displays of dominance, the style that buttigieg fashioned in the closet might serve him well, especially combined with the relative freedom he's found in the few years since. that's partly because his only real insecurity in life, it appears, has been about his queerness; intellectually, politically and morally, buttigieg betrays almost too much self-confidence. he speaks in such perfect paragraphs that his critics think he is scripted, even when he improvises. it can sometimes come off as lofty or smarter-than-thou — but the message discipline is impressive. and buttigieg has shown a sneaky flair for effective zingers.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "this situation, difficult under the best circumstances, is rendered excruciating by the tense nature of antara's relationship with her parents. in the narrative that unfolds through gentle shifts between present to past, we learn of the early collapse of their respectable family. ma always ran from anything that felt like oppression, antara says. marriage, diets, medical diagnoses. antara was born in an ashram, where her mother served, for a time, as the leader's consort. that disorienting period of neglect and even more perilous ordeals later have left antara craving her mother's attention while hating her. such is the unbearable situation created in a culture quick to judge, to expel and especially to circumscribe the lives of women.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's no doubt that antara's mother can be unspeakably cruel. i always knew having you would ruin my life, she says one day, but antara's willingness to accept those blows and remain devoted to her mother is motivated by an amalgam of adoration and rancor. i love her to death, she says ominously. i understood how deeply connected we were, and how her destruction would irrevocably lead to my own. that connection — beyond all reason and affection — leads antara to imagine, together, we will find redemption.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "doshi, who was born in new jersey and now lives in dubai, pursues this psychological dependency to depths few writers would be brave enough to fathom. the artistic narrator she has imagined suffers — or benefits — from sensory sensitivity as acute as her emotional sensitivity. antara's obsessive attention leads her to maintain a vast flowchart of her mother's bodily functions, which both repulse and fascinate her, which was my reaction, too. this is a novel stained with all manner of fluids, excretions and smells, and the narrator fights an almost constant sense of nausea. but if burnt sugar is often as unpleasant as a sinus infection, it's just as hard to shake off.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "between intimate confessions about her mother and their past, the story explores antara's perfunctory marriage to a polite man who's basically starving her with pleasantness. he says, antara notes, it must be tiring to be me. it is, but that weariness is exacerbated by her husband's sterile equilibrium. his interest in her troubles with her mother extends no further than offering irritatingly bland observations. being around her is very stressful for you, he says. to be honest, i wonder if you'll make her worse or better. he's horrid, except that he's nice and willing to stay yoked to this woman bristling with anxieties, loathings and yearnings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "antara's effort to recover lost memories and squandered affections develops into a multilayered, wholly consuming act of reclamation. it's a struggle that runs parallel with her work as an artist. antara's most significant production is an endless series of portraits of the same face sketched hastily, day after day, month after month, a record of emotional dedication and visual drift. it's yet another demonstration of doshi's skill that this work of art functions so evocatively both as a symbol in the novel and a linchpin to its disturbing plot.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the new title is so much more effective than girl in white cotton. burnt sugar perfectly captures this story's complex flavor, the taste of something sweet transformed into something deep and melancholy. i don't mean to scare you away; only to make sure you know what you're getting into. this is, among other things, a challenging interrogation of the presumption that a book's protagonist should be likable. where can our sympathies find purchase with this woman who is devoted to her mother and yet filled with rage toward her? our simultaneous revulsion and attraction stems, i suspect, from the nagging suspicion that antara is dragging us toward a species of candor that's terrifying.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "while there's a nordic version of the sport that involves being pulled by dogs, the western version involves horses and organizers say it's growing in popularity. this year, ski joring america, a governing body for the sport, helped stage events in montana, colorado, idaho, utah and wisconsin — and every year they're adding more participants and more events.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's not just skiing, and it's not just horses, said ebbie hansen, one of the sport's top riders. it's being pulled by a horse at 35 mph and having to navigate the gates and jumps. it's a little different than just going down a hill.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a horse towing a skier might seem like a far cry from the slate of snow and icy sports at this month's winter games, but skijoring does actually have some olympic roots. it was a demonstration sport at the 1928 olympics in st. moritz, switzerland — the second winter games ever staged — meaning the event was held, but no medals were formally awarded. it was a race with no obstacles back then and also was included in the nordic games, a forerunner of the winter olympics, in 1901, '05 and '09, according to bill mallon, an olympic historian.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mallon says he has heard no recent chatter about revisiting the possible olympic inclusion of skijoring, though nearly a century ago, pierre de coubertin, the frenchman who's considered the founder of the modern olympic games, was in favor of the sport and liked it, mallon said, but it was never again mentioned as a possible winter sport.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the international olympic committee wouldn't have to look hard to find skijoring disciples along the rockies, where weekend competitions are staged in communities such as ridgway, colo., saratoga, wyo., and wisdom, mont. the sport also has seen events in the dakotas, idaho, wisconsin and canada.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "crossett works in television production and discovered the sport while working in durango, colo. with a mix of great action and colorful characters, he thought he had the makings of a fun documentary, but he also saw a sport with a lot of potential. skijoring, though, felt disorganized, so he pulled together ski joring america three years ago to help oversee the sport, establish consistent rules and safety regulations, while providing guidelines for event organizers in various cities. crossett estimates there are about 300 competitors — not including horses — and many of them travel the circuit from january to march, bouncing between weekend competitions, where prize money ranges from a few thousand dollars to as much as $25,000.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "despite some encouraging results, when he was 19, the olympics started to look improbable and griffen enrolled at montana state, where he dabbled in rodeo. others in the horse community soon learned about his ski racing background and urged him to explore skijoring,. griffen didn't know what to expect.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "reviewed by gertrude himmelfarb, professor emeritus of history at the city university of new york and author, most recently, of the de-moralization of society: from victorian virtues to modern values. sunday, november 29, 1998", "augmented": []}
{"original": "h istorians are notably wary of the word revolution. they are even grudging in applying it to political events (was the english revolution of 1688 a revolution or merely a restoration? ), still more so to social or cultural events. and still more to social or cultural events in their own time. surely a longer perspective (the famous long view that historians are supposed to cultivate) will dissipate the effect of ephemeral experiences and reveal the continuity behind ostensibly dramatic changes. yet occasionally, very occasionally, historians are privileged (or doomed) to live through real revolutions, even social and cultural ones. arthur marwick, a professor of history at the open university in england, maintains that the 1960s witnessed one such revolution. and a revolution, moreover, that transcended political and national boundaries. marwick confines himself to four countries, britain, france, italy and the united states (with passing references to germany, eastern europe and japan). as a good historian, he apologizes for focusing on so artificial a period as a decade, and then, with further apologies, for prolonging the sixties to encompass the long decade of 1958 to 1974. the apologies are unnecessary. there was a revolution in these (and other) countries, and decades are sometimes significant units of time, even though they spill over into the adjacent years. the 800-odd page book (with another hundred pages of bibliography, footnotes and index) is one to be read in rather than read through.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "divided into three periods, 1958-63, 1964-69 and 1969-74, it ranges over a variety of subjects: sex, censorship and morality; art, literature and movies; race, class and youth; poverty, affluence and commerce; education, welfare and crime; feminism, consumerism and environmentalism; beatles, hippies and yippies. in addition there are accounts of the dramatic events in each period and each country: the civil rights movement, student strikes, urban riots, political crises. in a work of this scope there are inevitable omissions and peculiar emphases. why so much emphasis on the popular culture (on movies especially) and so little on the high culture, which was complicitous in creating, sustaining and, more important, legitimizing the cultural revolution? (it would have been useful to be introduced to lionel trilling's concept of the adversary culture, which originated with the literati earlier in the century and was democratized and popularized in the course of the '60s.) why half-a-dozen pages on gore vidal and toni morrison and no mention of saul bellow? why, in a long discussion of race, is there no account of the moynihan report on the black family in 1965, which was so prescient in pointing out a crucial aspect of the racial problem in the united states: the breakdown of the black family (signified by the then-startling illegitimacy rate of 25 percent)?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and why, in a multi-national study such as this, is so much attention paid to memphis, tenn., which is hardly typical of the united states let alone of western europe (but which happens to be the location of rhodes college, where the author was a visiting professor and availed himself of the city's research facilities)? but these are incidental details compared with the main issue: the nature of the revolution itself. and here marwick has made a genuine contribution, first in affirming the reality of the cultural revolution as it manifested itself in so many spheres of life; then in showing how that revolution permeated and transformed mainstream society; and finally in putting it all in an international perspective, exposing the differences and yet basic similarities provided by the perspective. for americans especially, it is useful to be reminded that the american experience was not unique -- certainly not the product, as is sometimes suggested, of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war. and the insistence upon the interaction between the dominant culture and the counter-culture (the term itself was coined in 1968) is also fruitful, obliging us to recall another aspect of the revolution that is too often forgotten, the fact that so many of the revolutionaries proved to be imaginative, ambitious and eminently successful commercial entrepreneurs, creating whole industries out of the counter-culture itself -- boutiques, experimental theatres, art galleries, discotheques, nightclubs, 'light shows', 'head shops', photographic and model agencies, underground films, pornographic magazines.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in his methodological observations, marwick is very much the cautious professional historian. he firmly rejects the great marxisant fallacy, according to which any revolution worthy of the name can be conducted only by a class intent upon overthrowing the whole of bourgeois society and culture; it was this fallacy that inspired herbert marcuse to create a new revolutionary class, composed of students, blacks and other marginalized and disaffected groups. marwick's own methodological explanation is more complex and sophisticated (so complex and sophisticated, perhaps, as to offer little practical guidance): cultural and social change, while influenced by human agency, by contingency and convergence, takes place within the opportunities offered, and the constraints imposed, by structural, ideological, and institutional circumstances. like a good disinterested historian, he also professes to reject the familiar ideological interpretations of the '60s: the radical view that sees it as a movement of social and sexual liberation, a boon to blacks, women, gays and other oppressed minorities; and the conservative view that harps on such disagreeable matters as the increase of crime and violence and an assault upon the universities and rational inquiry. marwick does not, to be sure, refrain from judgment. instead he couches his judgments in the familiar if . . . but, on the one hand . . . on the other hand mode. thus, if a relaxed censorship brought an explosion of porn and exploitation, it was also accompanied by a remarkable continuity in the revival in serious american film-making.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if drug abuse got out of control, it can, however, be seriously questioned whether the recreational use of drugs, and certainly cannabis, is any more reprehensible than the recreational use of alcohol. if brutal things did happen in the sixties, yet there was a remarkable balance between this humanism [tolerance and rationality] and the extremes of innovation. if ever there was justification for violence, the appalling, utterly inhumane story of 'soledad brother' george jackson [of black panthers fame] provided it. some rioters were vandals, but practically every violent episode could be traced back to some stupid or brutal (often both) action by the police. many of those caught up in violent situations were intensely peace-loving . . . the student uprisings demonstrated on the one hand, the dedication, the idealism, the bravery of those who participated in them; on the other, the folly of their obedience to the great marxisant fallacy, the absurd faith that there was a promised land ready -- given sufficient protest, sufficient violence, sufficient unconventionality, sufficient vulgarity -- for the taking. lest marwick's own view of these students be in doubt, he adds: i do not mock the protesters; i salute them, recognizing that they never had a hope of success in their revolutionary aspirations. i do mock commentators since, who, looking for the revolution decreed in the marxist scriptures, have gone on and on picking over their failure, missing the real cultural revolution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the real cultural revolution -- by the end of the book that revolution has taken on dimensions and attributes that even its most ardent supporters rarely claim for it. the essence of the cultural revolution, marwick writes, was its involvement of vast numbers of ordinary people, from peasant families in rural italy getting the basics of civilized living to black children in the ghettos of the american south being admitted for the first time to properly equipped schools; from paraplegics whose needs as integrated members of the community were for the first time being recognized, to women everywhere freed from the confinements of the feminine mystique; from italian, french, british and american workers with freshly negotiated wages and conditions of employment to young people in once-dreary provincial cities, now provided with boutiques and discos. and so on, with a medley of other tributes, large and small: the end of segregated housing, the increase of social welfare, the liberalization of marriage and divorce, the abandonment of fictions about the nature of beauty and the arrival of body-hugging clothing (or no clothing for sun-bathers), the inauguration of the new universal language of rock [that] was genuinely liberating, and not just for the young . . . there even emerged a new measured judgment on the part of authorities, so that tom hayden, the leader of the radical sds, and the many others who suffered grievously at the hands of the most reactionary elements in the 'justice' system were all finally acquitted.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "by the last page of this very long book, in his opinion, the ifs and buts, on the one hand and on the other, are resolved, as marwick happily looks back to a period that, in his opinion, was so much better than those that preceded or followed it: gone was the stuffy conservatism of previous decades, while the radical, divisive, philistine conservatism of reagan and thatcher was yet to come. one has come a long way from the opening page, where marwick deplored the political polemic, nostalgic mythologizing, and downright misrepresentation of both sides in this debate. although there is much valuable material in his own voluminous work, it too is a notable contribution to that polemical genre.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it's easy to feel guilty about this situation, as if i brought a burden into my partner's life. i can't help but think that his financial situation might be easier if he'd ended up with someone who did not have a crushing amount of debt. if that were the case, he may not be living paycheck to paycheck. he may not be having to contribute more than his fair share to household expenses. he may have been able to apply for a home loan with that person, rather than being forced to apply on his own because of my debt-to-income ratio.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "as student loans affect more couples, the strategy taken to attack debt is shifting. rather than paying off student loans together, many couples, such as krieg and her fiance, are each handling their own. krieg attended the college of saint benedict, a private school in st. joseph, minn., and got degrees in english and education. she teaches seventh grade, and recognizes that a private school education holds a high price tag in relation to a teaching salary. because she knowingly made this decision, she feels the debt is her responsibility to pay off.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "once married, krieg and osell plan to jointly file their taxes. according to capalad, this is an important conversation to have, as how couples file can affect loan payment amounts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one conversation to make sure you have with your accountant before you file your taxes as a married couple is to see how it will affect your student loan payment if you file jointly versus separately, capalad said. certain income-driven repayment programs will adjust your payment amount if you file jointly but not if you file separately.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for other couples, the decision to treat loans separately stems less from guilt and more from necessity. allison youngers is part of one such couple. the 28-year-old from sheldon, iowa, had $85,000 worth of student loans after graduating from college, while her boyfriend had no student debt. the couple, now with two children, has put marriage aside so that younger's debt does not hinder their ability to make other big life choices.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if we were married and had combined debt, we would have never been able to get a house loan because of our debt-to-income ratio, youngers said. matt's finances and credit score look better without mine added to it, and he is able to qualify for loans. because of my debt burden, i can't even get a relatively small car loan without a co-signer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brian hanks, a financial planner in boise, idaho, says he often sees this type of mind-set in couples with a large amount of student loan debt. the main impact i see is couples with lots of student loans are scared away from doing what they want in life, he said. the career option that's a little riskier, but with huge upside? they pass. the opportunity to work in a country or city helping others? they can't afford to do it. the real tragedy of student loans is the value of the opportunities not taken.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's certainly something i've seen in my relationship. it's tough to decide if one of us should accept a job that we are passionate about but might not have the highest paycheck. we debate over attending certain events for friends and family that include travel expenses. we would have liked to be engaged by now, but that has been delayed because of our financial situation. i'm sure the same will be true of having children.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in recent years, though, g league teams have increasingly hosted high-profile nba players returning from injury such as cousins, whose $18.1 million contract in 2017-18 was more than 500 times greater than the standard g league salary of $35,000. these rehab assignments are a marriage of convenience, pairing nba players coming off injuries with pro-level competition that can mimic the speed and physicality of the big league without taxing actual nba players during the middle of their season.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this rise in rehab assignments is a helpful barometer for the g league's growth. since its founding in 2001, the g league has expanded from eight teams to 27 teams, and formalized the relationships between nba teams and their minor-league affiliates. rather than sharing far-flung affiliates with other teams as they did in the past, most nba teams now operate their own g league teams in one-to-one relationships. this trend has allowed nba teams greater control over style of play on the court, sales and marketing off the court, and even the location of the franchises. meanwhile, the nba has expanded roster sizes and added new player designations, such as two-way contract players who can shuttle back and forth between the nba and g league, to encourage greater investment in the minor-league product. the g league will expand to 28 teams in 2019-20 and expects to have 30 affiliates to match the 30 nba franchises within the next 18 months.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as the g league has added and relocated franchises, the convenience factor has sharply increased. the santa cruz warriors, who relocated from north dakota in 2012, are a prime example. pitching a rehab stint in bismarck in mid-december? good luck. coordinating a 75-minute drive down from oakland? no problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "proximity has mattered for other franchises, too. the los angeles lakers assigned guard rajon rondo to their south bay affiliate, which plays its home games at the team's el segundo practice facility. the chicago bulls have placed zach lavine and kris dunn with their windy city affiliate, which plays just 25 minutes from downtown. when the los angeles clippers sent blake griffin to practice with their agua caliente affiliate last season, they hand-delivered the competition to their star by bringing in the g league players from ontario, calif., to practice at their playa vista training facility.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "according to data provided by the g league, the average distance between an nba team and its g league affiliate this season is 142 miles — down sharply from 452 miles in 2013-14. that geographical shift has led to a corresponding spike in rehab assignments, which have long been common practice for major league baseball teams and their farm clubs. from 2013-14 to 2016-17, an average of five nba players per year were sent to their g league affiliates to aid in their recoveries. over the past 18 months, 19 players have undertaken rehab assignments, including six all-stars.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rehab assignments are another value-add for the g league, said shareef abdur-rahim, who began his tenure as g league president on monday. you can use the g league to develop your young players and coaches, but you can also give players like cousins the opportunity to get practice and game time. we've seen tony parker and brandon knight do it, too.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "without question, cousins's return represents one of the key mileposts of the 2018-19 season. kerr plans to start him at center, giving golden state a starting five composed entirely of all-stars from a season ago (the last team with such a luxury was the 1975-76 boston celtics). if cousins fits in and looks healthy, the warriors are overwhelming favorites to claim their third straight title. if there are bumps or setbacks, the mercurial cousins — known for his arguments with officials and occasional emotional outbursts — will become a lightning rod.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "santa cruz's players noted that cousins won't need to carry as heavy of a burden with the warriors as he shouldered with the sacramento kings and pelicans earlier in his career. lee said that cousins's repeated trips to santa cruz showed how humble of a person he is, and miles spoke positively of cousins's demeanor and leadership during his visits.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "jaleel cousins said his brother is in a good place mentally because the warriors have given him a lot of downtime during his rehabilitation and because his comeback represents a chance to rewrite his reputation. he's mingled with the team and meshed with them perfectly, jaleel said. he's not the monster everybody tries to make him out to be.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "as she would often do, agatha has used the familiarity of the stereotype to subvert our expectations. it was one of the cleverest tricks she would play. it was, in fact, more than a trick: by such means she revealed her insight, her lightly worn understanding of human nature.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "christie, as thompson details, came by such understanding through the traditional means of early hardship. born agatha mary clarissa miller in 1890, her middle-class upbringing in torquay was idyllic, with a fierce, close relationship with her mother, a woman determined to shield agatha from a repeat of her own childhood hurts. young agatha was imaginative but practical, a skillful nurse during world war i who wished for a domestic life as a wife and mother — and got it, after marrying archie christie and giving birth to their only child, rosalind.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "he seemed to have emerged from the ether, as christie liked to tell it, though her careful reading of earlier detective fiction greats — especially émile gaboriau's monsieur lecoq novels — was no doubt a contributing factor. the singular alchemy of careful plotting, ruthless character study and her absolute belief that each person had an immutable essence, usually unknown even to themselves was already in evidence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "christie's life and work collided in 1926. she had already published the murder of roger ackroyd, the poirot novel that still provokes vociferous reader debate, to modest success and critical acclaim. by december she was infamous, the subject of constant media scrutiny, after an 11-day disappearance that ended when she was discovered at a harrogate spa.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "she never discussed the underlying reasons for the vanishing. thompson lays out a plausible theory of a fugue state, brought on by the crushing discovery that archie was in love with someone else, exacerbated by terror and shame that essentially paralyzed christie. the spell broke, she and christie divorced, she married the archaeologist max mallowan and lived a merry life of travel and riches and hard work. but the key enigma, this mystery story, is, as thompson notes, her finest, because it cannot be solved.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "afterward, there was the public agatha, whose poirots, miss marples and other detective fictions reached readers at a near-annual clip. but the more private one had a creative outlet, too, under the pseudonym of mary westmacott. thompson artfully demonstrates how christie revealed in the westmacott novels her pain about her collapsed first marriage, her difficult relationship with rosalind and her overwhelming love for her mother.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "christie, in essence, was the elena ferrante of her day. she did not take public ownership of the pseudonym until the 1960s. while agatha christie could present herself as the clever, controlled, sensible woman who knew all about human emotion but who dealt with it, every time, and kept chaos at bay, mary westmacott was, by contrast, the sensitive, secret creature who had been born of the drifting ghost of harrogate . . . who could never have existed without the strange freedom that came from using another woman's name.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while thompson makes a good case for reading the westmacott romances, any christie biography must ultimately be about the mystery novels that brought her such extraordinary commercial success. thompson does not cheerlead when it isn't warranted — at least one of christie's novels (the burden) is deemed diffuse and barely structured — and she argues that christie's zenith, in plot and in prose, was during and after world war ii.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in my experience, people use shame and guilt interchangeably, and i don't think that's correct, said tanisha ranger, a licensed psychologist at insight to action. guilt is what we feel when we've done something wrong. … shame, on the other hand, is a deep and pervasive feeling that something is wrong with us.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "teaching a child to own their mistakes isn't the same as making them believe they are a bad person for making those mistakes. in a difficult moment, we can teach our children that their mistakes don't taint them as an unloveable or bad person, thayne said. what happened may be a mistake that they regret, but their worth and belonging are constants. he recommends that parents talk about what shame feels like and said that, in the right dosage, it's a motivator for making changes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "because mistakes are part of being human, kids need to learn how to not let shame take root in their hearts. the guilt after a mistake helps with the development of a sense of right and wrong, but shame often makes people dig their heels into the bad behavior in an attempt to convince themselves that what they're doing is okay, or to give up on the idea that they could ever be 'good,' said shephard.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "however, it's critical that parents don't use shame to make their kids feel stupid, dumb, or bad about themselves. i never believe instilling an identity of shame is healthy for a child, said tim elmore, president of growing leaders. i do, however, believe in speaking with a child about a past behavior and letting them know they are guilty of behavior that may hurt someone else. then i would separate that behavior from their identity. in other words, say to the child: 'you are better than this.'", "augmented": []}
{"original": "words, more than actions, can instill a sense of shame, so we should be careful with how we address misbehavior. when parents say 'you are …' instead of 'you did …' they may be using shame. … when we focus on actions, we're looking at guilt. when we act in ways that push our kids to identify as bad or broken, we're using shame to punish, said shephard.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "the election season was full of jaw-dropping moments that eclipsed this confrontation. but morain returns to it and offers a telling snapshot of harris. he portrays her as a confident, seasoned public figure, whose success rests upon the intimate loyalties of others and whose candidacy could not avoid being symbolic. witnessing those harrowing seconds, some flashed back to the 1968 assassination of martin luther king jr., while others saw the ubiquitous threat of 21st-century gun violence. americans had no precedent for a scene in which harm might come to a woman of color — the daughter of jamaican and indian immigrants — while she campaigned for the highest office in the land.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for readers eager to understand how harris became someone who could hold her own on a national stage, morain charts her route. his premise is that there was nothing predictable about the journey of a daughter of immigrants, a howard university alum and a hastings college of law graduate from local prosecutor to vice president-elect. he stresses that it does no justice to harris's story to label her a female obama. morain gives readers the public harris on her own terms: a leader who rose to power in the crowded terrain of california politics. though berkeley was her girlhood home, harris was not a politician who came up from the grass roots. instead, beginning with her career as a prosecutor in alameda county, home to oakland, harris committed herself to public service, working in the trenches of the justice system for those she termed the voiceless and vulnerable. it is a perspective that continues to frame her work to this day.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but principles alone did not take harris beyond the seedy courthouses of the east bay. her rise from local prosecutor to district attorney of san francisco, attorney general of california, u.s. senator and finally vice president took three decades. building relationships, morain explains, was key. early on, harris was an intimate of her state's unrivaled black power broker, lawmaker willie brown, who showed her california's political underbelly and its ropes. along the way he boosted harris's statewide visibility. harris's sister, maya, who headed the aclu of northern california, and her husband, tony west, associate attorney general under president barack obama, have served as her steadfast confidants and strategists.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "while some observers, including those on san francisco's society pages, have focused on harris's style, morain, a former longtime reporter and editor for the los angeles times and the sacramento bee, keeps the spotlight on her achievements. after becoming california's attorney general in 2011, harris earned a voice on issues that had national resonance: the death penalty, marriage equality, gun control, the mortgage crisis, for-profit colleges, reproductive rights and human trafficking.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here, morain is admiring of harris and forgives her for the policy compromises that still attract criticism. in 2008, as san francisco's district attorney, harris aimed to curb truancy with a stick: prosecuting parents whose children failed to attend school. though she had built her public career as a death penalty opponent, in 2014 attorney general harris fended off a constitutional challenge to california's death penalty. morain explains that kamala's way meant she balanced her principles against her political ambitions. she assessed matters through the lens of the larger public issue. in the case of prosecuting parents for their children's truancy, she sought to enforce a child's right to an education. on the death penalty, she sided with the need for a balance of powers that ensures that courts settle constitutional questions. but her approach still riles detractors who brand harris a public official too steeped in a law-and-order model of justice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "morain relies on insights he gathered in his time covering california politics, bolstered by interviews with harris's colleagues through the years, giving the book the feel of an insider's tale. but without access to the vice president-elect or her family, morain cannot get to the inner kamala harris. curiously, kamala's way provides little on how racism and sexism shaped harris's path. in his effort to explain her character, morain comes very close to trading in old, pernicious stereotypes about black women, though perhaps unwittingly so. in his telling, harris sometimes comes across as a jezebel who callously exploited intimacies, even one with a married public figure; a mammy who, though she had no children, readily mothered others; an angry black woman wielding a sharp tongue and sharper wit; or an ambitiously talented professional who knew that to get ahead she had to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have, as olivia pope's father told her in the television show scandal.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "equally powerful, though in a setting far removed from the priest's exotic travels, is the story of a neurosurgeon dreaming of his upcoming marriage. inspired by watching a brain operation in a welsh hospital, thubron uses this doctor's work to concentrate on the theme that pulses through night of fire: he thought of the brain as he might of an unbreakable cipher, thubron writes. in its memories it held the web of human identity. it was the incarnate self. but of course, that description — with its allusion to christ — opens only to greater mystery. how can just a few pounds of matter, a labyrinth of electro-chemical activity, contain what seems transcendent and immaterial: our very selves, past and present?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the neurosurgeon's story revolves around the treatment of two patients suffering the effects of brain tumors: one is a woman desperate to retain her memories of a cherished affair; the other is a religious fanatic whose spirituality could be carved away by surgery. for the doctor, their cases present an unresolvable tension between pathology and identity. the hippocampus was totally sclerotic, the neurosurgeon thinks with faux self-confidence, and my business is to heal people, not preserve their fantasies. this is that rare tale that lures us into a metaphysical black hole: the nature of identity that eludes conclusion. when the surgeon's devout patient whispers, my brain is not me. i'm me, we feel his desperation and confusion. he's staring into the paradox that emily dickinson articulated:", "augmented": []}

{"original": "thus, the mere title of james wyllie's new book, nazi wives: the women at the top of hitler's germany, promises a delicious opportunity to answer a few of those more intimate questions about a group of towering figures in the canon of male monstrosity. they are so well-known that their surnames are all we need to summon the epochal evils of hitler's regime: goebbels, the minister of propaganda; goering, the luftwaffe commander and second-most-powerful nazi; heydrich, gestapo chief and final solution architect; himmler, the ss chief and holocaust implementer; hess, deputy führer; and bormann, hitler's private secretary. all of them had their specific remit of horrors, and all of them were committed to adolf hitler and the anti-semitic, racist, xenophobic and totalitarian values of his regime. in seeing the dynamics of their married lives, do we learn something more about these men — their motivations, their petty jealousies, their messy and repugnant humanity — that could shed light on what they did?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for years, the role of women in nazi germany was eclipsed by the preoccupation with the actions of prominent men. then, as wyllie notes, in the 1980s feminist scholarship began to examine this world. in her book hitler's furies: german women in the nazi killing fields (a 2013 finalist for national book award), wendy lower observed, the consensus in holocaust and genocide studies is that the systems that make mass murder possible would not function without the broad participation of society, and yet nearly all histories of the holocaust leave out half of those who populated that society, as if women's history happens somewhere else. lower looked at the women in the trenches, the wives of some of the camp leaders, and women who worked as willing agents for the regime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if these women were the worker bees, wyllie, a british author, screenwriter and broadcaster, focuses on the queens. the women who in various ways competed for hitler's attention to embody the beau ideal of womanhood in the reich: fecund, contentedly subservient, vying for the fürher's admiration. extra points for a sense of humor. ilse hess, who unfortunately had a husband who made the mistake of getting captured in scotland in 1941 because of a botched diplomatic mission and spent his life imprisoned, would describe how much hitler enjoyed a good laugh; not one for telling jokes, hitler did impressions and liked nothing better than listening to a well-told funny story as long as it wasn't about him. you don't get this from learned histories of world war ii.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "despite hitler's well-known bachelorhood (until his hasty, pre-suicide marriage to eva braun), his leadership was required to be married, never divorce and have many children. magda goebbels for many years claimed the title of first lady of the reich for her blond beauty and for the six blond and beautiful children she had with her wily and serially unfaithful husband, the nazi propaganda minister. wyllie describes her rather dignified desire to have a quiet divorce while her husband was enmeshed in another passionate romance, and her genuine suffering when that was denied. in a gesture of ultimate loyalty, or despair, the parents poisoned all six children on may 1, 1945, before poisoning themselves.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "goering and carin never had children, and his sexuality never matched the robust promiscuity of joseph goebbels and reinhard heydrich. as wyllie writes, emmy and goering's sex life had already given rise to a number of wedding night jokes that focused on his performance in the bedroom (for example, that emmy had stopped going to church after their honeymoon because she'd lost faith in the resurrection of the flesh). eventually, they had a daughter, edda, and goering celebrated by having 500 planes fly over berlin in their honor. (edda died in 2018, still loyal to her dad.)", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wyllie acknowledges that much of the source material has to be treated with caution. but he recounts their stories with a bracing combination of scholarship and an almost cinematic — not surprising, given his other work — approach to spinning a compelling narrative. while the bombing of britain, the russian campaign, the holocaust, the unspeakable suffering inflicted on humanity by these people unfolded as an international catastrophe, wyllie shows us the petty competitions, the moments of domestic sadism, the appalling grift and the daily lives of those responsible for it. like in the most banal real housewives episode, we see the in-groups and out-groups establish themselves. margaret himmler, corpulent and determined, and lina heydrich, lacking any public stature or particular charisma, were never included in what wyllie describes as the berghof clique. and so they involved their husbands. there is something disorienting about imagining heinrich himmler, the man who created the unsparing efficiency of the nazi extermination machine, chiding his ss colleague heydrich about the behavior of his wife.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "both a will and a living trust are estate-planning documents. a will is a document that allows you to designate who will inherit your real estate and personal property along with stocks, bank accounts and other items you own.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a will, however, will require that your estate go through probate. that means that upon your death, someone must go to the probate court and deliver a copy of your will to the court. an executor of the will then is approved by the court, and the executor can then handle the distribution and sale of assets and take care of any other estate affairs under the supervision of the probate court.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obtaining a will isn't difficult, and an estate attorney or other attorney experienced in drafting wills can take care of it for you. the cost can be rather basic for a simple will, or quite expensive if your financial matters are complicated. when we say that the fee can be small, you might find attorneys willing to do simple wills for less than $1,000, but keep in mind that simple means very formulaic: you don't have much in terms of real estate (other than your condo), some items of personal property (jewelry, furnishings, a car, etc.) and some bank accounts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when you have many different real estate holdings, stock and bank accounts, minor-age children and distribution issues, you'll find that attorneys will have to charge you more because of the additional work in handling the questions and the drafting of the document. we can't tell you how much more, as it will vary by location and the type of attorney you hire to handle the transaction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a trust is a document that allows you to transfer the ownership of your real estate, bank account and financial holdings to a different entity. that different entity is your trust. the trust would own these items, but you would be the beneficiary of the trust and thus control the trust and be the effective owner of those items.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, upon your death, the trust would still be the owner of your real estate, bank account and other financial holdings that were in the trust's name. you wouldn't need to go to court to have the court supervise the administration of those items. the successor trustee — you would be the initial trustee of your own trust —would handle your affairs and could sell off your real estate and stocks and close your bank accounts. your trust could designate what you want done with your real estate holdings, your bank accounts and other holdings.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the cost of setting up a trust can be a bit higher. that's partly because you have similar document-drafting issues as with a will, but you would also have the cost of having all of your assets retitled from your name to the name of the trust. when it comes to your home, you'd have to transfer title in your home to the trust. if it's your car, you'll have to retitle the car in the name of the trust. the same would go for bank accounts and accounts with financial institutions. if you don't re-title your assets, they are not part of the trust.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here's where it starts to get complicated. since everything you own won't go into the trust, you will likely also need a will to make sure all of your assets and property are accounted for. so if you have a bank account that never got retitled or jewelry and other personal effects that are not owned by the trust, your will would dispose of those items as you intend.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "while paying for a will and a trust means a double payment, having both will cause the least pain for family members taking care of your estate after your death.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in your question, you talk about your condominium. if that is the only thing you own, a will may be sufficient for you. but a trust might be equally as good. or both could allow you to own that now and cover other items in the future. what we are getting at is that your question is really specific to your situation, the value of your property and what you are looking to do, how to do it and how much you might be willing to spend now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finally, one advantage a trust may have, depending on the state you live in, is protecting your premarital assets from spousal claims after marriage. however, in some states, if you live with someone long enough, your long-term partner may have similar claims. since you are living with someone, you might want to have some agreement spelled out to address possible future ownership claims. you might even want to draw up a partnership-type document if both of you are contributing toward the condominium expenses and costs. please talk to a local attorney for more information.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "linking previously scattered social movements, ni una menos forged a diverse coalition of women to challenge the status quo. after beginning as a protest against machista violence, ni una menos eventually broadened its claims to encompass reproductive rights. feminist activists argued that without legal abortion, ni una menos would always be a misnomer, because unsafe, clandestine abortions represent one of the leading causes of maternal death in argentina.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "ni una menos framed abortion as an issue of social justice and public health — rather than the united states' framing, in which it is an individual right. further, it emphasized that poor women in particular are likely to encounter dangerous conditions when seeking abortions; one popular chant at demonstrations has been: the rich abort, the poor die. that has changed the reproductive rights conversation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "through persistent mobilization, female activists persuaded public officials and fellow citizens that the prohibition on abortion had failed — and that only legal access could address the serious public health crisis afflicting argentine women, primarily those who are poor.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "according to our analysis of public opinion data from the americasbarometer, citizen attitudes became more favorable toward legalization only after ni una menos arrived on the scene in 2015, amid record rates of protest by women.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to be sure, the abortion debate in the americas has hardly been put to bed. just as roe v. wade inaugurated the modern era of partisan sparring over abortion in the united states, this issue, and others related to gender and sexuality, may increasingly become a political battleground throughout the region.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in a working paper analyzing americasbarometer and latinobarómetro public opinion data from across the region, smith and boas found that when abortion or same-sex marriage dominate the headlines, abortion rights or antiabortion attitudes start to matter more on election day. traditionally, voters mostly worry about bread-and-butter issues when they go to the polls. but as candidates stake out opposing positions on new culture war issues, elections are being transformed. championing abortion or same-sex marriage rights can pave the way to victory, but so can conservative opposition — as happened in brazil's 2018 election of jair bolsonaro.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "argentina's abortion legalization could have ripple effects throughout the americas. on other social issues, significant legislative changes have tended to sweep through the region in relatively quick succession. after argentina recognized same-sex marriages in 2010, brazil, colombia and uruguay followed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "of course, argentina's move may galvanize abortion opponents, as well. the christian right has been jolted by the recent wave of change. and just as ni una menos inspired activists in other countries, so, too, have conservative social movements. #conmishijosnotemetas (don't mess with my children), founded in peru in 2016 to oppose feminist gender ideology in schools, has been spreading around the region, including to argentina. in 2021, chileans rewrite their constitution — and both leftist and rightist social movements at the convention are likely to lobby on sexuality politics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if our research on argentina is any indication, abortion rights advocates in other latin american countries may have more success if they focus on the public health consequences of prohibition and its disproportionate impact on women living in poverty. ultimately, abortion legalization in argentina won because of the persuasive power of street activism. we expect that leftist and rightist social movements will be similarly critical in determining the future of abortion laws elsewhere in latin america.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "everything is moving so quickly. we're not compatible and maybe never were, so this will be a good thing for us. however, i do still care about him and believe his mental health issues were at least partly to blame for his behavior.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he has rewritten our past enough that now i'm questioning what is true and what isn't. i'm also blaming myself for not being more emotionally available (he wasn't either), not being more compassionate about his mental health issues, and just not being a good partner in general. at the same time, he told me he never opened up to me emotionally either and wasn't really what i was looking for in a partner.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "my only advice is to stop trying to figure all of it out. in fact, don't try to figure any of it out. just get through the mechanics of it. attorney, yes, and a home of your own, and your own finances and home goods and all of that. these take time and attention. make sure that attention is available by keeping your to-do list short. when the questions bubble up, let them go unanswered. say it aloud if you have to: i'll get to that later. or: that can wait.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "when you hear it, that's when it's time to think about all those questions. you might find, and i suspect you will, that some of them will have answered themselves in the process. the churn of an emotional transition can make issues seem more complicated than they really are. and if your husband's emotional mo is to deflect/diffuse/muddy, then the post-marital silence will be more powerful still.", "augmented": []}
