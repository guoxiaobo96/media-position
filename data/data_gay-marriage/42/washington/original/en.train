Oh my goodness.\n\nThe good way to start with these boundaries is as a girl/boyfriend, not as a spouse. I'm sorry. I know it's a giant woulda coulda, but it's worth exploring, I think, to help you understand your options now.\n\nThat's because you gave away much of your leverage at the altar. As a mere GF/BF or even fiance/e, you were surrounded by possible exits. Including the big fat open door marked, This isn't working. With that behind you, you could have said, I am really uncomfortable with the amount of say your mother has in your daily life. What's up with that? And if you didn't like his answer, you could have broken up, talked about it some more, waited and seen. Painful, potentially, but with a lot of room for good outcomes.\n\nNow when you say the married version of that: I am really uncomfortable with the amount of say your mother has in our daily life--which you do need to say, by the way, ASAP--you've basically got the one door out if you don't like his answer: divorce.\n\nIt's drastic, it's upsetting, it's scary. And the draconian feel of that option often works to suppress our will to get in there and say what we need and do the hard work to get it.\n\nSo, now my advice is to recognize that pressure solely so you don't let it intimidate you into backing down on what you need. If you don't want your MIL to have a key to your home and if you want her to come only when invited, then insist on these things, because you have a right to them. And if your husband responds in a way you don't like, then be ready for that, with your now-more-limited options already thought through and chosen.\n\nI'm saying this all in forceful terms, but that doesn't mean your conversations with your husband can't be gentle, even when you've resolved not to budge. This is the other reason it's so important to have this stuff out pre-vows: He married you thinking you were okay with his relationship with his mother. Now you're changing the terms on him.\n\nYou still have standing to do that--you know what you know when you know it, and you're apparently just knowing now where your limits are--but you do need to be mindful that he's getting this out of the blue. Tell him you support his being close to his mom, you just want privacy in your home.\n\nOne of those limited options, btw, is marriage counseling; if he really thinks his mom gets to tell you what to do, then I imagine you two will need an objective referee, soon.
But those ingredients vary by region, town and family. Because of mass-market versions such as those made by Rao's, Olive Garden and Progresso, when many Americans hear Italian wedding soup, they think of a bowl of broth with meatballs, greens and pasta. But that's only one version.\n\nAD\n\nI combed through hundreds of recipes, from Apicius's De re Coquinaria and Pellegrino Artusi's Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well to more modern books such as Joyce Goldstein's and La Cucina Napoletana by Jeanne Caròla Francesconi, and found that the dish can include: fava beans, a prosciutto bone, sausage, broccoli rabe, a whole chicken, wild fennel, escarole, rice, spinach, eggs, bread, milk, cheese, pasta and/or beef. It can take days or an hour to prepare. It may be based on a fatty broth or clear stock. It can start with making meatballs or by blanching greens, by roasting a whole pig or simmering sausages or boiling a chicken until the meat falls off the bone. If there was one true minestra maritata, I thought, certainly the Italian Academy of Cuisine would know.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1953, a group of Italians founded the Accademia Italiana della Cucina, dedicated to the preservation of regional Italian cuisine. After decades of research, they published a book of more than 2,000 recipes; La Cucina del Bel Paese was translated into English in 2009. It contains no fewer than five recipes for minestra maritata, each from a different region in Italy, from Piedmont to Puglia. In a fascinating twist, the only commonality four of the five share is that they marry a meaty broth with hearty greens, either chicory or endive or fennel or spinach. (The recipe from Veneto doesn't contain any greens but thickens an enriched chicken stock with rice and tagliolini.)\n\nAccording to the late historian and journalist Vittorio Gleijeses's 1977 book, A Napoli Si Mangia Così, minestra maritata can be traced to Naples, and he supposed, originally came from the Spanish olla podrida, a long-simmered stew of vegetables, meat and beans. Italians made it their own, marrying local ingredients to great effect.\n\nAD\n\nBy the time it made its way to the United States, its popularity began to wane in Italy. Italian immigrants added meatballs, ranging in size from marbles to baseballs, and whatever greens they could grow or find at the markets in their new cities. (Escarole was a popular option; many, like my Italian American babysitter, also called it scarole soup.) The story of Italian wedding soup, then, is a lot like the story of a long, good marriage: It's gone through a lot but it's stuck together, because when something works, it just works.\n\nAD\n\nScale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here.\n\nFor this recipe, based on a memory of the one my babysitter used to make me when I was a kid, I've taken some liberties, using store-bought stock (use homemade if you have it!) and precooked chicken sausages (they add an easy hit of flavor). Then, quickly mixed and shaped meatballs, pork or turkey, are roasted before they're added to the fortified broth along with lots of chopped kale, escarole, spinach or chard. Lemon juice and zest offset the rich, meaty flavors and perk up the bitter greens. It comes together in under an hour, but makes an especially filling and flavorful meal. Serve the soup with grated Parmesan or pecorino Romano, fresh herbs and crusty bread to soak up the lightly spicy broth.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 teaspoon olive oil\n\n1 (12-ounce) package fully cooked Italian-style chicken sausage, preferably spicy, sliced into coins\n\n2 large (about 3 ounces) carrots, scrubbed and chopped\n\n2 stalks (about 3 ounces) celery, halved lengthwise and sliced (save a few leaves for garnish, if desired)\n\n10 cups (2 1/2 quarts) low-sodium chicken stock\n\n1/4 cup (2 ounces) milk or water\n\n1 large egg\n\n1 slice white bread, hard crusts removed\n\n1 pound ground pork or turkey\n\n1/2 cup (about 1 ounce) grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano, plus more for serving\n\n1/4 (2 ounces) yellow onion, grated\n\n1/4 cup (about 1/2 ounce) chopped Italian parsley, plus more for serving\n\n3 or 4 cloves garlic, minced\n\n1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste\n\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste\n\n3/4 cup (2 1/2 ounces) tiny pasta, such as ditalini, orzo, stelline or acini di pepe\n\n4 to 6 ounces (4 to 6 tightly packed cups) shredded or chopped escarole, kale (thick ribs removed), chard (ribs removed) or spinach, or a combination\n\nPinch red pepper flakes, optional\n\n1 large lemon, zested and juiced\n\nSprigs of dill, for garnish (optional)\n\nStep 1\n\nIn a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high, add the olive oil and sausage and saute, stirring every so often, until browned on both sides, 2 to 4 minutes. Increase the heat to high and add the carrots, celery and stock. Cover, bring to a boil and cook until the carrots and celery are tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStep 2\n\nMeanwhile, make the meatballs: Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, add the milk and egg and whisk lightly. Add the slice of bread and soak for 5 minutes. Add the ground pork or turkey, cheese, onion, parsley, garlic, salt and pepper to the soaked bread and mix with your hands until combined. Rinse and moisten your hands with cool water and then shape the mixture into 1- to 2-inch meatballs; you will have 30 to 35 meatballs. Place them, spaced evenly, on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes; meatballs will finish cooking in the soup.\n\nStep 3\n\nReturn the heat to high under the soup. As soon as the broth comes to a boil, stir in the pasta and simmer until al dente, 4 to 6 minutes. Lower the heat to medium, and stir in the chopped greens, red pepper flakes, if using, and half of the lemon zest; reserve the remaining zest for garnish.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStep 4\n\nUsing a spatula, scrape the meatballs and any fat and crispy bits stuck to the pan into the soup. Increase the heat to high and cook until the greens soften and the meatballs are cooked through — cut into one to be sure it's no longer pink in the center — about 3 minutes.\n\nStep 5\n\nAdd half of the lemon juice; taste the broth, and season with additional salt and pepper, if desired.\n\nServe the soup hot, garnished with celery leaves, Parmesan, parsley, dill, and the remaining lemon zest and juice, if desired.\n\nNutrition Information\n\nCalories: 491; Total Fat: 23g; Saturated Fat: 8g; Cholesterol: 111mg; Sodium: 1134mg; Carbohydrates: 37g; Dietary Fiber: 3g; Sugar: 4g; Protein: 35g.\n\nAD\n\nRecipe from staff writer G.

According to a new poll from the Pew Research Center, the teens may offer a window into the politics of Generation Z more broadly.\n\nGeneration Z, defined as those born after 1996, is on the cusp of adulthood. The oldest are graduating college. By 2020, almost half will be eligible to vote in the presidential election, which means their values and opinions could soon help shape national politics.\n\nAccording to the survey, released Thursday, Gen Z teens and young adults have overwhelmingly adopted left-leaning beliefs similar to those of the millennials before them. They overwhelmingly disapprove of President Trump, believe the government should do more and reject American exceptionalism.\n\nIt's not uncommon for young people to hold liberal views that moderate as they age. But Gen Zers grew up in a very different world than previous generations. The oldest among them was 11 when the first black president was elected. They became teenagers as same-sex marriage was legalized around the country. They also, according to Pew, will be the most racially diverse and well-educated generation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis younger generation is much more likely to see climate change as a result of human behavior and to believe black Americans are treated unfairly.\n\nThese differences are particularly pronounced among Gen Zers who self-identify as Republican. While older Republicans overwhelmingly support Trump, his job approval drops off significantly with the younger generations. Eighty-five percent of baby-boomer Republicans believe Trump is doing a good job. Fifty-nine percent of Gen Zers share that view.\n\nHistorically, younger people are less civically engaged and vote in fewer numbers than older generations. In 2018, 31 percent of eligible millennials voted in the midterms. If millennials and Gen Zers increased their participation in elections, they could have the power to decide the outcome.\n\nAD\n\nBut events such as the partial government shutdown are not going to inspire them to get more involved. While the Parkland teens' tremendous efforts influenced changes at the state level and got pro-gun-control candidates elected to Congress, they've been met mostly with dysfunction at the federal level.
When Martha goes into labor in their cozy townhouse, they fly into action, calling the midwife and preparing for the blessed event. When a replacement named Eva (Molly Parker) arrives, they're taken aback but go with the flow: For the next\n\n30 minutes, Pieces of a Woman chronicles the birth of Martha and Sean's daughter with startling intimacy, following the action in a fluid, unbroken shot that takes in every scintilla of pain, anticipation and relief of childbirth — which, in this case, involves deeply upsetting trauma.\n\nIt's a stunning piece of filmmaking, directed by Kornel Mundruczo with finesse and impressive logistical adroitness. This isn't a surprise considering his astonishing 2014 drama White God, which brought him to the attention of audiences outside his native Hungary. As in that film, Mundruczo evinces superb control with the camera, as well as an instinctive affinity for actors who can be seen committing entirely to even the most difficult material.\n\nIn this case, that subject matter is the aftermath of profound loss, which sends Martha and Sean into tailspins whose centrifugal force sends them further apart. After that opening sequence that veers so precariously on the edge of histrionics, Kirby turns on a dime, becoming preternaturally still, watchful and opaque. For his part, LaBeouf portrays Sean with a combination of self-pity and sympathetic pain, revealing once again what a gifted actor he is, up to and including his willingness to tap into his real-life battles with addiction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith such impressive performances at its core, though, Pieces of a Woman begins to lose momentum and clarity. As Martha seeks to heal, her journey feels less and less convincing, especially her encounters with her brittle and combative mother (Ellen Burstyn). It's clear that Mundruczo has looked to the work of John Cassavetes and Ingmar Bergman for inspiration in his examination of how relationships break down amid grief, betrayal and isolation. But, even at their most raw and naturalistic, the scenes from Martha and Sean's marriage ultimately feel like a banal domestic melodrama, with more thespian pyrotechnics and icy, dead-eyed stares.\n\nEven viewers who are captivated by the performances and technical prowess of Pieces of a Woman will be forgiven for finding its third-act twist both sentimental and wholly unearned. It also offers a tantalizing suggestion of a crucial relationship in the film that goes almost entirely ignored, or at least unplumbed — one that could have given Pieces of a Woman a genuinely novel and illuminating point of view. What we're left with is a showcase for Acting-with-a-capital-A, and little else.
A close friend and partner-in-activism of the late Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, Abdulaziz has been continuing Khashoggi's reformist mission, issuing critical social media posts even as the Saudi authorities have threatened him and thrown his brothers in jail. Now the activist's story, little known in the United States, could become more widely publicized with the release of The Dissident, a documentary that tells his and Khashoggi's story.\n\nAD\n\nThe film was released on video-on-demand over the weekend by Briarcliff Entertainment, an independent distributor, after big Silicon Valley streamers Netflix, Amazon and Apple, as The Post reported, passed on the film, possibly not to offend the Saudi government.\n\nAD\n\nBriarcliff has released the movie in 175 theaters and on many digital rental platforms, including iTunes on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video, which collectively reach more than 150 million U.S. homes. The movie won't, however, get the same marketing push had a streamer acquired it outright and also will require customers to pay separately, potentially reducing its audience. (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos, who is featured in the film as an alleged hacking victim of the Saudi government, owns The Post.)\n\nBriarcliff, run by film veteran Tom Ortenberg, conducts little business in the Middle East. Ortenberg says the company has received no threats to date. The firm's financial exposure is also limited: It spent less than $500,000 for rights, according to a person familiar with the negotiations who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about them, far lower than the $5 million to 10 million a streamer can pay for a documentary.\n\nShadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that any targeting of a distributor would probably come in the form of business restrictions in the kingdom. Abdulaziz should be more concerned, he said: The activist's family could be subject to further retribution.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDirected by Bryan Fogel, who made the Oscar-winning Russian doping documentary Icarus, The Dissident turned Khashoggi's killing at Istanbul's Saudi Consulate — an act the CIA thinks was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — into a cinematic event at last year's Sundance Film Festival. The movie, which is funded by the Human Rights Foundation, earned such fans as Hillary Clinton, while critics raved about its style and import.\n\nBut the late journalist is only a piece of the narrative. The Dissident also tells of a less-expected figure — Abdulaziz, who not only is seeking to continue the columnist's work but provides a kind of alternate history, reminding what Khashoggi might have kept doing had he not been killed.\n\nIn an interview over a secure video link, Abdulaziz described his current life.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI have six phones on my desk because my phone was hacked [by the Saudi government] in 2018, he said. I can go to a restaurant or movie theater, but I can never tell anyone where I'll be. In his mind, he says, play constant images of Khashoggi, who evidence indicates was slowly asphyxiated by a team of agents and dismembered with a bone saw.\n\nAbdulaziz was speaking from an unidentified location in Montreal. Even on Canadian soil, he has watched as dangers lurk around every corner. He has been forced to resist numerous attempts to lure him back to his homeland, where he thinks he will be arrested and tortured, even fending off prominent Saudi figures who have come to retrieve him.\n\nHis friends and two of his brothers have been jailed in his home country to apply pressure on him to return.\n\nAD\n\nYet he is continuing Khashoggi's work under the constant threat of death, tweeting to more than half a million followers (Twitter is the rare source of independent information in the kingdom) and posting videos on YouTube that garnered more than 30 million views last year. Abdulaziz is part of a small but influential group of Saudi dissidents that also includes such figures as Loujain al-Hathloul, the activist who last month was sentenced to nearly six more years in prison for her work on behalf of women's rights.\n\nAD\n\nI made this film for Omar and Loujain, Fogel said. I made it for all the people who are suffering because they speak of freedom. He says he hopes Abdulaziz's unblinking stance will prompt other young people to take up activism. He also wants to show that Khashoggi's tale offers not just tragedy but a legacy.\n\nAbdulaziz began his activism in his early 20s, attracting attention with his cogent video posts, in Arabic, criticizing Mohammed and the Saudi government; he fled to Canada when he learned Saudi authorities were seeking him out. Abdulaziz would link up with Khashoggi in a kind of marriage of complements: The elder journalist guided him with his insider knowledge of the kingdom; the youthful activist contributed his knowledge of social media and reaching young people in a country where more than 40 percent of the population is younger than 25.\n\nAD\n\nThe two created the bees, a savvy, low-budget social media initiative meant to combat Mohammed's flies (essentially troll farms aimed at keeping dissent out of trending sight).\n\nAD\n\nIn March 2018, with Abdulaziz's profile growing, the Saudi government dispatched a prominent lawyer and talk-show host to Montreal, coercing Abdulaziz's brother to come along for added leverage. The men tried to entice Abdulaziz to return to Saudi Arabia with promises of a talk show, Abdulaziz said, and then urged him to visit the Saudi Embassy in Ottawa to renew his passport.\n\nThe activist consulted Khashoggi, who told him it was dangerous to do either of those things. He counseled him to refuse. Abdulaziz stayed put, and the lawyer and host returned to the kingdom. Abdulaziz's brother Ahmed was subsequently arrested and jailed along with 23 of the dissident's friends. Another brother was later arrested. Abdulaziz has continued to tweet.\n\nAD\n\nI know they've been severely tortured, and that causes me pain, he said. But I can't stop. Because if they use it as a card to stop me from posting today then tomorrow they'll use it as a card to kill me.\n\nAD\n\nHe paused. All these threats are just motivating me.\n\nBill Browder, the financier-turned-human-rights campaigner, says that he thinks Abdulaziz has taken his life in his hands by seeking to continue Khashoggi's work.\n\nIt's a very precarious position he's in — he's very exposed, Browder said in an interview. The Saudis have all the resources in the world. And we know how they go after their enemies.\n\nBrowder, who has worked pro bono to spread word of the film in Washington, is thought to be under significant threat himself from Russian authorities for campaigning for sanction-based anti-corruption laws known as Magnitsky laws, named for his lawyer allegedly killed by Russian authorities. Browder says that he thinks Abdulaziz is in a predicament he knows well.\n\nAD\n\nThe human body doesn't have the capacity to live in fear full time; you become accustomed to risk and adrenaline levels go down, he said. You almost have to train yourself to be vigilant.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Mohammed has said he is a reformer, the nonprofit Freedom House ranked Saudi Arabia seventh-worst in political rights and civil liberties among the world's 49 countries considered not free, noting extensive surveillance and the criminalization of dissent.\n\nAbdulaziz says the censorship situation has gotten worse, particularly with the flies that pervade the domestic Internet.\n\nYou can see their work everywhere. You'll be on Twitter at 6 a.m. and see messages about Selena Gomez, and then at 8 a.m. about the Weeknd, he said. And then at 10 a.m., suddenly it's 'MBS is the most beautiful person in the world' from so many places, just to make sure everything looks great and nobody hears any criticism.\n\nAD\n\nAbdulaziz says he thinks a new administration in the White House might press the regime harder on these issues. Already there are signs that there will be a greater holding of Mohammed to account on Khashoggi, a campaign promise of President-elect Joe Biden. And Saudi Arabia last week ended the long-running Qatar blockade in an apparent gesture of conciliation.\n\nAD\n\nExperts are only slightly optimistic.\n\nA lot of this depends on how much internal will the new administration has to confront Saudi Arabia, and I don't know that they do. They will have their hands full with a new Iran deal, and they don't want the Saudis to make their lives miserable on that, said Hamid, the Brookings expert. For anyone expecting a significant shift, unless there is serious pressure on the U.S., I don't think it happens, he said.\n\nOne way to raise the heat globally, he noted, would be The Dissident. That could be tricky internationally, since without a major streaming deal the movie must be released through a cross-section of distributors and release dates in various countries, from Turkey to the United Kingdom (there are no current plans for Saudi Arabia). There is a strong possibility, Fogel says, the film will get a release window on Amazon in the United Kingdom after its theatrical release there this spring. An Amazon U.K. spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the meantime, Briarcliff is using outdoor and online advertising to drive people to rent the film on digital platforms.\n\nThere's a lot of competition on-demand. But you can also keep your movie out there for a long period of time, Ortenberg said.\n\nHe said Abdulaziz's saga was a main reason he bought the film.\n\nOmar's story is virtually unknown in most of the world. That needs to change, he said.\n\nThe activist said he is not seeking attention, just a chance to do his work without worrying about his family. He received another warning from the RCMP only a few days ago — he asked not to reveal its specifics — and his brothers remain in jail because of his tweets. He says he last communicated with his father in August, when messages to him began going unreturned.\n\nAbdulaziz thinks that his father has been threatened with punishment if he speaks to his son.\n\nIt's better for all of them not to talk to me, the activist said with a shrug, but a tear could be seen welling up on the screen.\n\nHe said thinking about Khashoggi is one of the few things that makes the pain bearable.
Its writer-director, Bong Joon-ho, was also named best director.\n\nIn all, the film, which combined drama, dark comedy, horror and social commentary, won four Oscars, the most of the evening, in what amounted to a historic upset of the Hollywood elite. The movie brushed aside works by such acclaimed directors as Martin Scorsese (The Irishman) and Quentin Tarantino (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) as well as the much-lauded World War I epic 1917.\n\nAD\n\nThe 2020 Academy Awards belonged to Parasite. The South Korean film won four Oscars, including the biggest prize: Best picture. (The Washington Post)\n\nAD\n\nThe night's biggest flop may have been Joker, the dark and violent film about a social reject who descends into madness and murder. It came into the ceremony at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood with 11 nominations, more than any film. It won two awards.\n\nOne of those, however, went to its star, Joaquin Phoenix, in the best actor category, for his bombastic portrayal of the title character.\n\nPhoenix gave a typically rambling acceptance speech, saying, I think we've become very disconnected from the natural world. . . . We go into the natural world and plunder it for its resources. We artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby [and] take her milk and put it in our coffee. He then said, I think that when we use love and compassion as our guiding principles we can develop and implement systems of change beneficial to humanity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe best actress award went to Renée Zellweger for portraying the drug-addicted and dying Judy Garland in Judy, as she rallies for a series of triumphant concert performances in London. Zellweger mounted a Hollywood-style comeback of her own, winning the best actress Oscar after leaving filmmaking for six years.\n\nBoth Phoenix and Zellweger were the heavy, even prohibitive favorites, having swept the Golden Globe, British BAFTA, Screen Actors Guild and Critics' Choice awards in recent months.\n\nBong, a widely respected director among cinephiles but previously little known to general audiences, shared the best original screenplay award with Parasite co-writer Han Jin Won. His film also won — again, predictably, given its worldwide acclaim — in the best international feature film category (formerly known as best foreign film).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI'm ready to drink tonight, quipped the shaggy-haired Bong, speaking in English for the first time as he accepted the international trophy. Later, as he accepted his award for best director he acknowledged Scorsese and Tarantino in what was perhaps a symbolic passing of the torch.\n\nBrad Pitt and Laura Dern, two Hollywood veterans, took home the best supporting acting Oscars, the first acting Oscars for each of them in their storied careers.\n\nSeveral presenters referred, if only indirectly, to the lack of diversity among the acting nominees; only one actor of color — Cynthia Erivo, star of the biopic Harriet — was nominated in the major acting categories. And none of the South Korean actors from Parasite were nominated.\n\nAD\n\nThe dominance of men among the directing and technical nominees was also repeatedly referenced, most explicitly by Hildur Guonadottir, who won for original score for Joker. Accepting the award, she said, To the girls, to the women, to the mothers and the daughters, please speak up. We need to hear your voices. She received a standing ovation.\n\nAD\n\nPitt was recognized for his portrayal of the laid-back stuntman in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Tarantino's story about the last days of Hollywood's Golden Age, set in 1969. It was also a kind of career achievement award for Pitt, who had won an Oscar for producing but never for acting.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Pitt made one of the few explicitly political comments of the night, taking a shot at Senate Republicans, who voted last week to acquit President Trump at his impeachment trial. Pitt said he had only 45 seconds to speak onstage, noting that this was 45 more seconds than the Senate gave John Bolton this week to testify at the trial. Republicans voted not to hear testimony from Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, who has alleged that Trump abused his power in his dealings with officials in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nDern's award — for playing a tough-talking divorce lawyer in Marriage Story — was also in part a recognition of her many years as a film and TV actress. She thanked her parents, actors Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern, whom she called her acting heroes, my legends.\n\nAD\n\nAcademy voters twice passed over Scarlett Johansson, who was nominated in two categories — actress in a leading role in Marriage Story and best supporting actress in Jojo Rabbit. Nevertheless, Johansson's achievement was a rare feat: Since the Oscars began in 1929, only 12 actors and actresses have been nominated for the best acting and best supporting actor awards in the same year. She was only the fifth — after Sigourney Weaver in 1988, Emma Thompson in 1993, Julianne Moore in 2002 and Cate Blanchett in 2007 — to leave the ceremony empty-handed.\n\nThe academy also stiffed director Greta Gerwig, whose Little Women was nominated for best picture although Gerwig herself was left off the list of director nominees, leaving an all-male slate. Gerwig is only one of five women who have ever been nominated in the directing category (for her 2018 feature Lady Bird) in the 92-year-history of the event. Gerwig was also nominated for best adapted screenplay for Little Women.\n\nAD\n\nChris Rock noted the lack of diversity among the nominees in an opening monologue, joking that Erivo did such a good job playing Harriet Tubman, who aided fugitive slaves in pre-Civil War America, that the academy hired Erivo to hide all the black nominees.\n\nAD\n\nIn the documentary-feature category, the winner was American Factory, about a factory outside Dayton, Ohio, that was acquired by a Chinese billionaire and the cross-cultural conflicts that result. The documentary was released by Netflix under its deal with Michelle and Barack Obama's Higher Ground Productions.\n\nAmong the other predictable winners were the legendary British cinematographer Roger Deakins for his work on 1917 and the storied songwriters Elton John and Bernie Taupin for best original song, (I'm Gonna) Love Me Again, from the Elton John biopic Rocketman.\n\nAD\n\nFor the second year in a row the awards had no host, just presenters. The film industry dispensed with its traditional host format after comedian-actor Kevin Hart dropped out amid criticism for homophobic tweets.\n\nThe blockbuster Pixar film Toy Story 4 won the animated feature film category.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Hair Love, a seven-minute film about an African-American father's struggle to style his young daughter's hair, won the animated short film category. It was written and directed by Matthew Cherry, a former NFL player.\n\nOne winner, Andrew Buckland, who won for sound editing on Ford v Ferrari, noted a symbolic fact: His movie will be among the last released by Twentieth Century Fox, one of the film industry's most storied studios. The studio was sold last year by a company controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch to Disney, which rebranded it last month as 20th Century Studios.
Dear Amy: My mother and I have a difficult relationship. She has some serious mental issues. She has seen a few psychologists throughout her life, but once the therapy starts to bring up things my mother does not like or agree with, she calls them crazy and quits.\n\nShe has done a lot of things to hurt me and my siblings, and as hard as we work to build some sort of relationship, she works just as hard to tear it down.\n\nI will be getting married next year. I do not want to invite her.\n\nMy sister got married last year, and our mother's behavior was unreasonable. A week before the wedding she cussed her out and told her that marriage is horrible and that all men cheat.\n\nThe morning of the wedding she kept calling my sister and the wedding planner. She tried to make it all about her. When the bride and groom visited tables during the reception, our mother turned her head away and ignored my sister. She left a couple of hours later without telling anyone.\n\nShe pushes people away with her erratic behavior.\n\nI feel guilty that I don't have a relationship with her, but I have been hurt in the past, so I no longer trust her.\n\nMy fiance suggested that we explain to her why we don't feel comfortable inviting her, and then create a time where we can visit her a couple of weeks after the wedding.\n\nI don't know what to do. Should I invite her and suck it up, even though she will probably make me angry/sad on my wedding day?\n\nAt a Loss\n\nAt a Loss: If you want to sever whatever remaining shred of a relationship you might have with your mother, then don't invite her to your wedding.\n\nHowever, I think you should consider inviting her, but then not let her make you angry/sad.\n\nExpect her to say or do hurtful, thoughtless or unkind things. Understand that her punishing tendency is to try to create drama. Don't engage. This form of loving detachment might get her angry enough in advance of your wedding that she will refuse to attend. That's on her.\n\nYour mantra should be, I wish things could be magical and perfect, but that's not the family I landed in. My family is flawed, my mother has problems, and yet — it is what it is. Try to serenely anchor to your own joy, hold hands with your beloved and start your life together with your eyes open and facing your challenges together.\n\nAsk your sister to help you run interference on the day.\n\nDear Amy: I broke up with my boyfriend about six months ago. We were in a relationship for four months, and the entire time it was like we were just friends. He was scared to advance the relationship, so I ended it.\n\nNow I am starting to develop feelings for him again, and I realize that I made a horrible mistake.\n\nAll of my friends hate him, so they kept pressuring me to break up with him. They have very bad judgment and never took the time to get to know him. At the time, I was angry at him for ditching me in the middle of a date because it was too awkward. But, nevertheless, I have feelings again. What should I do?\n\nConfused\n\nConfused: Ask yourself, what has changed?\n\nThis man doesn't seem to want to have an intimate relationship with you. He had four months to get onboard, and he either didn't want to — or was unable to.\n\nIt can be very tempting to try to win over someone who is remote, or emotionally (or physically) unattainable, but unless he has radically changed, all of the elements that didn't work last time won't work in the future. If he is interested in you, let him show you. If you decide to act on your feelings, be aware that the previous pattern will probably prevail.\n\nDear Amy: Upset was worried because her husband's brother and his wife were going through a nasty divorce, and the brother didn't want his ex-wife (the child's godmother) to attend Upset's child's First Communion. I was surprised that you suggested they speak with clergy about this. What does that have to do with their issue?\n\nConcerned\n\nConcerned: A child's First Communion is a religious event. The child's godmother has an important role in this event. Clergy should influence all of the adults to behave.
These past few days have prompted a basic question: Why can't these clerics just say they're sorry?\n\nIt's a particular conundrum for those of us who are Catholic. The sacrament of reconciliation provides us with the opportunity to confess our sins to a priest, apologize for them, make amends and resolve to do better. When many of us prepared to practice the sacrament for the first time as children just reaching the age of reason, we were taught that lying was a sin. As we moved into adolescence, we learned that any sexual activity outside of marriage was likewise a sin. So why are our confessors finding it so hard to apologize for these very same basic sins?\n\nHaving worked for the Roman Catholic Church for the past 25 years, I think it may have something to do with the dramatic change in the status of religious leaders in my lifetime.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGrowing up in the Boston of the 1970s and early 1980s, where neighborhoods were still divided along the parish boundary lines despite a growing presence of non-Catholic immigrants from around the world, great respect and even reverence were directed toward the parish priest and his assistant clergymen. These men could do no wrong. They were arbiters of grace, and their Sunday evening visits for family dinners demanded the use of the best china. The church itself taught that the members of the clergy are in their very being different because of their ordination (in the church we use the term ontological). While they look like any layperson, there is a fundamental difference in their being. The church still teaches this today.\n\nI remember the shock I felt when, as a teenager, I first encountered a priest who swore, or told an off-color joke, or smoked cigarettes or drank alcohol. In the end, it really was not that hard to find all of these peccadilloes in the priests I encountered in my parish or my Jesuit high school, but the result was a certain diminishment of the clergy in my eyes. The image of a superman was tarnished. As we now know, there were many much more serious sins and crimes being committed by Catholic clergy in that same place and time, but I had no personal experience of that.\n\nFast-forward to 2019, and one would be hard-pressed to find a lay Catholic who puts his or her priest on such a pedestal. We have been jaded by the scandals of the church in Boston, and now we are experiencing a crisis of leadership locally. Keep in mind that McCarrick was ordained to the priesthood in 1958 and Wuerl in 1966, and so their respective climbs to become princes of the church took place in the Father Knows Best milieu of an earlier time in this country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSure, institutional fear of costly litigation enters in, and perhaps that is really what is preventing Wuerl from being as candid as he might like. But it is also true that we might be asking both Wuerl and McCarrick to do something that priests and bishops of their time were never expected to do. If Father was always right, an apology was never needed — especially not if you wielded the additional power and authority of a bishop.\n\nBishops will tell you that their power and authority come to them through the Scriptures and the tradition of the church. None of us will ever be in a position to know or judge the private prayer lives of these men, the sins they themselves confess as they do penance nor the things they discuss with their spiritual directors and companions. We are left to hope that Wuerl, in receiving the sacrament of reconciliation himself from a brother priest, did not leave his knowledge of McCarrick's actions completely unvoiced. Should his confessor have suggested public disclosure of the same? Well, Scripture does tell us that the truth will set you free.\n\nTime and again, we have seen examples of Americans being willing to forgive people who have let them down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis week, a spokesman for the Catholic community Opus Dei made an unusually frank — for a faith group — admission of guilt and shame after it was forced to publicly confirm it paid nearly $1 million in a sex misconduct suit for celeb-priest C. John McCloskey and covered it up — leaving him in the same D.C. assignment for a year after the victim came forward before removing him quietly.\n\nThe reality is he was around for a year after we were informed, spokesman Brian Finnerty said. That's the reality. It's not good. But we may as well own it. . . . It's an argument that is no longer tenable — this 'let's quiet things over so priests can continue to do good.' \n\nWithin the past few years, some local Catholic institutions, most affiliated with the Jesuit religious order but not exclusively so, have looked at their own sad involvement in the slave trade of the 18th and 19th centuries and have apologized publicly for their complicity. My alma mater, Georgetown University, in 2017 stripped the names of two Jesuit leaders who traded in slaves in 1838 off some of the newest buildings on campus and renamed them for the first slave named on the university's bill of sale (Isaac Hawkins) and a black educator who founded a girls' school in the Georgetown neighborhood in that era (Anne Marie Becraft). The university also invited more than 100 of the slaves' descendants to the renaming ceremony and offered them scholarship opportunities to study at the school.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the ceremony, the Rev. Timothy Kesicki spoke directly to these men and women as resident of the Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States: Today the Society of Jesus, who helped to establish Georgetown University and whose leaders enslaved and mercilessly sold your ancestors, stands before you to say that we have greatly sinned. We pray with you today because we are profoundly sorry.\n\nSimple words spoken with great conviction — not a burdensome expectation, really.
Dear Amy: I'd like to know how to get over a lifetime of embarrassment. I was raised by self-absorbed and often cruel parents. Both of them took delight in humiliating me as a child. My father would stand up at my birthday parties and tell jokes about me in front of my friends. He would make fun of me until I cried, and then laugh at me.\n\nWhile working one of my first jobs, I had a strong crush on my boss (that I never acted on). My mother knew about it. One day, she showed up at my job, found my boss and went on and on to him, laughing, about how much I loved him. There were many other incidents.\n\nNow I am a married, working woman and I live far away from my parents. However, I am still haunted by these memories, and I am so hypersensitive to possible embarrassment that I live in a constant state of anxiety. I have been to therapy, and while my therapist was lovely, nothing much has changed for me. I'm not sure if I need more therapy, or something else. Confronting my parents does nothing, because they remain just as unapologetic of their behavior. They do not care what I think or feel. How do I navigate through this?\n\nEmbarrassed daughter\n\nEmbarrassed daughter: What you are describing is emotional abuse, and I am so sorry that you had to experience that.\n\nYou don't mention if you've discussed your anxieties with your spouse, but they are there to love and support you, and they can be a source of guidance if you're feeling overwhelmed. I would also recommend visiting your therapist again. Treatment is a process, and being open and honest is an important first step to seeing results. Tell them what you're going through, and describe the anxiety you're experiencing.\n\nIf you're still unable to connect with your therapist, ask for help finding different treatment. Your therapist's job is to help you so that you can get better at helping yourself. The elements required to cope with the legacy of abuse are: time, patience, talk therapy and meditation — or possibly medication — to deal with your more serious anxiety symptoms.\n\nDear Amy: I had been married for just nine months when my in-laws visited us. My husband and I had been living in one of their homes in London.\n\nMy husband and I had been arguing a lot and he told his parents about our problems. He said he was overwhelmed. My in-laws then insisted that I leave and visit my parents so that we could have some space and reevaluate our marriage. During the next two months we did just that. We spoke every day. We discussed our problems in depth and were both more open to hearing criticism. We apologized for the past.\n\nWe agreed that I should return to London, but then his parents showed up in London again. He stopped speaking to me after their arrival and then asked me not to come back after all. Clearly, this was all because of his parents' influence.\n\nMy question is, should I go to London anyway, or should I accept it is over between us because of their meddling? He refuses to speak to me now and I don't know if I should keep fighting for our relationship or just accept and move on.\n\nMeddled with by in-laws\n\nMeddled with by in-laws: I love London and would never advocate not going there, but don't you want a husband who is going to fight for you and work on your relationship when you're both in the same city?\n\nYour in-laws seem hellbent on babying their son and breaking up your marriage. However, we can't blame it all on them: your husband is the one who let his parents send you away, and now he won't talk to you. He is making a choice, and he is choosing them. You should keep calm and carry on.\n\nIf, despite all of this you do decide to go through with your trip, you will have to take responsibility for what happens next.\n\nDear Amy: Thank you so much for advocating for childhood literacy through your Book on Every Bed holiday campaign.\n\nThis year, not only did we do this with our own children, but we adopted a local family and made sure their children also had books on their beds on Christmas morning.\n\nLoving literacy\n\nLoving literacy: I am so proud to have spread this simple idea. Thank you for spreading it further.
Since many engagements are sealed with a pricey ring, does being betrothed count as an appropriate relationship for the exchange of other such gifts?\n\nThe engagement ring is a pledge, whose acceptance is dependent on a forthcoming marriage. That means it is to be returned if either person breaks the engagement. Miss Manners is sorry, but the jilted should have only the satisfaction of throwing it in the faithless one's face, not of selling it.\n\nAD\n\nA variation of this will tell you what a lady should not accept from a gentleman to whom she is not related or planning to become related: anything she would still want to keep even if she discarded him.\n\nAD\n\nDear Miss Manners: I have numerous friends and colleagues who email me to meet with them over a meal or to join them for some general event, such as attending the movies. Then they message, asking: What restaurant or movie do I want to attend? What is the location, date and time?\n\nIn other words, I essentially am invited to review restaurants, look up movie options and viewing times, and peruse my calendar to share dates and times I have available, then send this information back to them to pick and choose. When I demur and suggest they manage the options, I hear how they don't care and just want to do whatever I want to do.\n\nAD\n\nWhat I want is a clear-cut invitation without the long email back to them with all the information from me.\n\nWhat is a polite but firm and determined response I can use to get the people inviting me to make their own arrangements? I have said in the past that I was in a work crunch with deadlines and just preferred that they manage the details, but I generally get, again, But I don't care and want to do what you prefer. Or okay — what is a restaurant you like, or a movie you want to see? When are you available?\n\nAD\n\nThis exchange is known as After You, Alphonse. Everyone is trying to be considerate, but it drags on too long. Miss Manners suggests that you go only so far as to name a date, and then say, Please surprise me. I have great faith in your taste.\n\nAD\n\nDear Miss Manners: I showed an acquaintance a photo of me that was taken nine years ago. The photo is of me, in a beautiful ball gown. His response? That doesn't look like you at all.\n\nIt was irritating at least, humiliating at worst. What do I say if I get this rude comment again?\n\nI know. I changed my clothes.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice. You can send questions to Miss Manners at her website, missmanners.com.

In my mind, my father saved me from a world that I could've died in, but the truth is, he was just as responsible for my neglect.\n\nMy father remarried, and my grandmother allowed me to live with my dad in his new home with his new wife. I called her Mom until she passed away.\n\nAD\n\nMom was not affectionate toward me. She was very strict.\n\nAD\n\nFast-forward to now. I am 50 years old. My biological mother and stepmother are both dead. My father remarried again and moved hundreds of miles away.\n\nMy issue is a new resentment toward my father. Having learned that he wasn't the saint I always thought him to be, I find I don't want to speak to him much.\n\nI love him very much, but I'm hurt that every woman in his life has had such an influence on him to the neglect of, not just me, but also my two half-sisters.\n\nI don't really want to go down this path. My bitterness toward my biological mother, and lack of love from the woman who raised me has made me a cold person toward family. I feel more empathy toward strangers than my own relations (sometimes, even my own children, which I am acutely ashamed of).\n\nAD\n\nTherapy is not easily accessible in my rural area, so I'm left to my own devices.\n\nAD\n\nWhat advice can you provide that may warm my heart toward the very few that have loved me?\n\n— Heart Two Sizes Too Small\n\nHeart Two Sizes Too Small: You seem to have a lot of insight about your challenging past. You have made the connection between the neglect you suffered as a child and your own hesitance (or inability) to express affection toward family members. Insight is a positive start, and you can definitely continue to grow and change.\n\nAs a child, your emotional needs weren't met. Your mother abandoned you, and then the other adults in your life didn't provide an emotionally safe and nurturing environment.\n\nAD\n\nTo love others fully, you have to learn to fully love yourself. Loving yourself doesn't mean you are arrogantly declaring how great you are, but that you are learning to accept and embrace your own vulnerability, owning your own mistakes, and leaning into your determination to do better. Your very efforts toward healing and self-love should be considered your first triumph.\n\nAD\n\nOne way to love others is to physically be there for them. Be present, especially for your children. Show up for them. Express an interest in their lives and be bravely expressive toward them. You should tell them your own story, share your insight, express the desire to be better, and tell them you are in their corner — through good times and bad. You are trying to break a generational chain of neglect, so understand that your kids may be bewildered, hurting and affection-starved, too.\n\nYou would benefit from reading Healing Your Emotional Self, by Beverly Engel (2007, Wiley & Sons).\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: I am an average-attractive single woman who lives in a big city.\n\nI am frequently approached by men of other races that flirt with me and try to get my phone number.\n\nHow do I tell them I am not interested without offending them? I stick to my own kind.\n\nAD\n\n— No Thanks\n\nNo Thanks: It is fairly easy to say, No thank you. But if you truly want to repel these interested men, you could tell them the truth: No offense, but I'm a racist.\n\nThey should leave you alone after that.\n\nDear Amy: Thank you for your response to Shy in Boston, the shy guy who was wondering how to possibly meet a nice woman in the supermarket.\n\nIt may sound like a cliche, but this is how I met my husband! He somewhat shyly asked me for advice about produce.\n\nThe rest is history. We're celebrating 15 years of marriage this year.\n\n— Happily Together\n\nHappily Together: I need a price check for happily-ever-after on Aisle One!
The one thing that bothers me involves texting and social media. She routinely gets text messages from a male co-worker during the evening and weekend hours. I firmly believe that it's inappropriate and unnecessary for the communication between the two of them outside of work.\n\nShe is a devoted life partner, but why does this continue, even after I have expressed my concerns?\n\nAD\n\nEarly in our relationship, before we were fully committed, she went on a trip that was previously planned to visit a man she was in a prior relationship with. She wasn't fully forthcoming about this until she returned home. She said she didn't think we were in a fully committed relationship. I have forgiven her.\n\nAD\n\nI'm thinking about getting engaged, but I wonder why these behaviors continue. She's a very friendly and caring person, which may at times come across as flirtatious.\n\nAm I being unreasonable and insecure, or should I be concerned?\n\n— Just Wondering\n\nJust Wondering: Your girlfriend is a devoted life partner. Devoted life partners get to have friends outside of the partnership. These friendships should not be conducted in secret and should be acknowledged openly — and occasionally shared — with the family.\n\nAD\n\nThe friendship with this co-worker predates your relationship. As you two continue the process of braiding your lives together, you should meet each other's friends and learn the backstory of these various friendships. Platonic friendships outside of the primary relationship are not inappropriate or unnecessary. In fact, these friendships can demonstrate (as well as expand) a person's capacity for other relationships.\n\nAD\n\nYes, texting and posting on social media during together time is distracting and rude to one's partner. Perhaps as a couple (and family group), you can all agree on parameters regarding phone use.\n\nYou need to differentiate between human instincts (when you just know in your bones that something is amiss), and the toxic trust issues perpetuated in your marriage and triggered by this work friendship. Discuss this tactfully with your partner, encourage her to be open and transparent about her friendships, and show an interest in meeting all of her friends.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: Over the past year, my husband has come to believe that conversation consists of asking lots of questions, even if they relate to details regarding a range of topics that I cannot possibly know.\n\nTopics run the gamut from information in the news to details about my relatives. This has gotten worse over time. Sometimes our conversations seem like an interrogation. He does not converse with others in this way.\n\nAD\n\nRecently, I returned home after driving seven hours to arrange an assisted-living facility for my mom — an emotionally draining experience.\n\nUpon entering the house, I was confronted with intense questioning about issues surrounding my mother's trust and estate. I felt like getting back in the car and driving away.\n\nAD\n\nThe next morning, I told him that his way of welcoming me home was highly undiplomatic and that intensely questioning someone is not carrying on a conversation.\n\nWe are both 65, I am retired, he is partially retired, and we do not have financial stress. I do not have secrets from him, and we trust each other completely.\n\nWhat gives?\n\n— Interrogated\n\nInterrogated: This might be a sign of a cognitive problem, except your husband doesn't seem to do this with other people.\n\nArriving home from a stressful trip — not to a greeting but an interrogation — is not the best way for him to love you. Point this out during a calm moment.\n\nAD\n\nEncourage him to dive into his outside friendships — because it seems that he is storing up a lot of what he sees as conversation starters for you. If this gets worse, he should get a medical checkup.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: I was shocked by your response to Annoyed, the young mother whose foreign-born mother-in-law constantly makes nonsense baby noises to her baby.\n\nThe reason your response shocked me was because you got it right.\n\nAnnoyed should perhaps take the opportunity to listen to a podcast while her mother-in-law is goo-goo-gooshing.\n\nThank you for encouraging this kind of adult-baby communication.\n\n— Shocked\n\nShocked: I accept your backhanded compliment — and thank you.
Now, they are on the cover of Parents Magazine. A recent report from ReWire.News suggests that becoming fathers is easier than it once was for gay men. But the evidence is largely anecdotal. There is no clearinghouse, for example, that reports on the clientele of private adoption and surrogacy agencies, heterosexual or otherwise, or how long couples wait to become parents. And there is still plenty of resistance to gay parents, as the petition by One Million Moms against the cover of Shaun T and husband Scott Blokker in Parents Magazine attests.\n\nOn Parenting spoke with four gay men who had all entered fatherhood in the past 10 years through different means. One adopted through foster care, and another had an open adoption through a private agency. Another worked with a surrogate in the United States, and one worked with a surrogate overseas. Their experiences and geographies were varied, but several themes emerged. The road toward fatherhood may be more smoothly paved than it was 10 years ago, but there are still significant challenges.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMoney in the bank\n\nJared Gertner of Los Angeles said he often hears a particular encouragement to would-be parents: Everyone tells you, 'No one is ever ready to have a child, so just go for it!' But as a gay man, the opposite is true.\n\nFor men who want to become fathers in the United States without a female sexual partner, there are options. They invariably require a lot of paperwork, and often a lot of money and a long time waiting.\n\nThis due process isn't a bad thing, said Julian Chang of San Diego, who adopted his son four years ago with his husband, Wade Estey. If everyone had to be fingerprinted and produce their tax records in order to become parents, there would be a lot more wanted children in this world, Chang said.\n\nAD\n\nWith the exception of adoption through foster care, though, the financial costs are often tantamount to buying a car or even a house outright.\n\nAD\n\nGertner and his husband, Jeffrey Marshek, knew early in their relationship that they wanted children and that they wanted a biological connection to their child. There wasn't a lot of information about surrogacy when we were researching, said Gertner, who married Marshek in 2010. The couple knew they would need to save significant money upfront. They worked with a surrogacy agency that was recommended to them.\n\nBecause they had financially prepared, when their surrogate unexpectedly delivered their son, Auggie, six weeks early, Gertner and Marshek were both able to take the time off work and accommodate the time their newborn son spent in the NICU.\n\nRob Depew of San Francisco experienced the NICU as a new father as well, but in India. Depew said when he and his co-parent David Augustine began researching surrogacy options in 2007, they learned the average budget for working with a surrogate in the United States was $150,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut then they heard about agencies in Mumbai and Delhi that were actively advertising to gay couples in the U.S. and Europe. They were able to offer the matching processes and medical lab and fertility process — and to do it at about a quarter of the cost of the U.S., Depew said. That would make it possible to both have a child and buy a house for their family in San Francisco.\n\nThe process was smooth, Depew said, until the surrogate delivered their daughter, Kimaya, at 32 weeks gestation in 2012. Communicating with doctors in India with very different expectations of what you need to understand as a parent from 10,000 miles away — it was pretty stressful, Depew said. Kimaya was diagnosed with cerebral palsy due to complications from birth and has significant mobility impairment, Depew said. But it was a successful experience because we have a lovely, happy daughter, he said.\n\nPaternity leave issues\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMaternity and paternity leave in the United States are far from ideal. For families with two dads, the decision to take paternity leave is often made more difficult by their unusual situation.\n\nDepew brought his daughter home from India in 2012. He opted to use a mix of sick time and paid time off that his employer offered for new parents. I took a full five months off and I remember my boss was shocked and unhappy. I definitely remember the expectation being that dads don't actually take leave, whether they're gay or straight, he said.\n\nFor Angel Maldonado Lopez and Leonard Norton of Boston, who welcomed their then 7-year-old son Jesse home through foster care, paternity leave was not ideal, they said. Norton, who is self-employed, took the summer off to be with their new son. Lopez, who is the primary breadwinner, could only afford to take two weeks of paternity leave. It was too short, he said. Jesse struggled to see me as the paternal figure — I was just the guy who went to work and came home from work later. That's a struggle for most dads whether gay or straight — but I wish I had gotten more time just to bond with him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEmotional heavy lifting\n\nAll of the fathers interviewed mentioned the significant emotional work they had done to prepare to become fathers.\n\nLopez and Norton went to therapy for a year before adopting to make sure we were on the same page, Lopez said. He felt the therapy was helpful in shaping him and Norton as parents. Since they planned to adopt through the foster care system, they attended training and anticipated the child they would adopt would likely have experienced trauma. We all need to be aware of our pasts. Everyone has their own trauma. We have to be very intentional to take the steps not to trigger things for all of us, said Lopez.\n\nAD\n\nIntentional is a word that emerged as a sort of motto for each couple interviewed.\n\nWe don't come to parenting by accident, Chang said. We come to it by way of a lot of money, and with great intentionality. That is the commonality among gay dads with children.\n\nAD\n\nLike others, Chang and Estey went to therapy in preparation for becoming fathers. Therapy helped us clarify our thoughts, and any holdovers from our childhoods. It helped us to think about how we might navigate two busy careers, and the division of labor, Chang said.\n\nAbout the division of labor, Gertner sees a lot of positives for gay people. You don't really get caught up in gender roles when you're working with two dads. Society doesn't expect one of you to stay home or one to do the grocery shopping or anything like that.\n\nAD\n\nDealing with strangers\n\nThe downside, said Gertner, are the assumptions made. If I'm out shopping with my son without my husband, strangers will sometimes say, 'Oh, are you giving Mommy a break?' I know there are plenty of straight dads out there who find that patronizing, too.\n\nAD\n\nAll four of the men interviewed have children in school, and all four said their schools, a mix of private and public, had been extremely supportive of their families. The thing that has been the most difficult are strangers who don't understand, Gertner said. They see us out with our son and we don't fit into their little box of what a family looks like. I've been asked whether Jeffrey and I mixed our sperm together in a cup. And that's rude, but as our son gets older, he is being shaped by a certain narrative about who he is.\n\nAD\n\nHe said he doesn't want to avoid the questions, but he wants to make it clear that some information is none of other people's business. We're always asking ourselves, 'What's the company line?' and we haven't found it yet.\n\nKendra Stanton Lee is a freelance writer based in Milton, Mass.

The sound of Pamela Smart arrives before she does.\n\nDown the prison hallway it comes. Boot heels clattering on floor tiles. Moving fast.\n\n(Jesse Dittmar for The Washington Post)\n\nThey call her Tinker Bell here, she says, because she flits from one place to another like the cartoon fairy, always in a hurry, always in motion, trying to forget that she has all the time in the world.\n\nYears before O.J. Simpson's case became a made-for-television extravaganza, Smart starred in the first gavel-to-gavel broadcast of a murder trial in U.S. history. It was a seamy tale of blood and lust. The trial became an international sensation, so compelling that CourtTV aired it in 1991 and a local television station in New Hampshire, where the trial was held, preempted daytime soap operas in favor of testimony about sexual obsession and betrayal.\n\nSmart lives with the echoes of the truths and the myths of those long-ago days at a maximum-security women's prison in New York. She was 23 when she was given a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole after a jury convicted her of using her sexuality to manipulate her former teenage lover to murder her husband.\n\nThe Pamela Smart who has spent more years behind prison walls than outside them can blur in the mind's eye with the Pamela Smarts of factually challenged tabloid headlines (no, she wasn't a schoolteacher) and fictional renderings, such as the chilling character she inspired for the cult favorite Nicole Kidman film To Die For.\n\nIt was easy to cast me into that role of the femme fatale and leave it at that, Smart, now 51, says one afternoon on the phone from prison. Smart agreed to a series of phone conversations and a videotaped prison interview with The Washington Post in which she offered previously undisclosed details and an intimate glimpse of her inner life as she mounts a new push to be released from a life sentence.\n\nHer case still fascinates, resurfacing at a moment in American history when life-without-parole sentences are being reassessed and, in dozens of cases, erased by governors in states as politically diverse as Maryland, California and Louisiana. There are websites\n\ndedicated to winning Smart's release and periodic tweetstorms for a woman who has been in prison so long that she's never used the Internet or an iPhone. Amateur sleuths pore over details of the case in support of her fervent claims of innocence. Tipsters whisper clues to her legal advisers and her mother. They believe in other Pamela Smarts — the Pamela Smart who says she was wrongly convicted or the Pamela Smart who wants the world to consider her argument that, even if a jury thought she was guilty, she's been imprisoned long enough.\n\nPamela Smart was convicted for conspiring to have her husband killed and sentenced to life in prison without the parole. Now, she wants her freedom. (Erin Patrick O'Connor)\n\nHer detractors see another seduction in motion, a ploy to woo the public this time, rather than a teenage boy. Paul Maggiotto, who prosecuted Smart's case and is now in private practice, calls Smart a sociopath in an interview. But some of America's most prominent feminists have come to her aid, drawn in part by the fact that the teenage triggerman and his three male accomplices have all been released from prison, while the woman who became the face of the case remains behind bars. Among those who have written to the state on her behalf are Gloria Steinem, Vagina Monologues playwright Eve Ensler and Kate Millett, the groundbreaking author of Sexual Politics, who visited Smart in prison before her death last year and strongly proclaimed her innocent.\n\nTheir urgings are included in a 695-page legal filing that asks New Hampshire's Republican governor, Chris Sununu, to commute her sentence and make her eligible for parole. The state attorney general's office is fighting the request, which has been slowed by procedural requirements, saying in a blistering response that she is undeserving of the mercy and compassion she wants. Smart places the blame for her crimes and her current predicament everywhere but where it belongs, squarely on herself, the response says.\n\nSmart's legal team hopes to convince the state that her sentence is an example of a justice system out of step with modern legal and ethical thinking. But her attorneys and supporters also want to cast doubt on the outcome of Smart's trial, revisiting a strange spectacle that began with a terrible thing that happened late one night in Derry, N.H., on a street called Misty Morning Drive.\n\nPamela Smart and her attorney Mark Sisti listen to closing arguments in her 1991 murder conspiracy trial in Exeter, N.H., following 11 days of testimony. (Jon Pierre Lasseigne/AP)\n\nLife at Bedford Hills\n\nPamela Smart has been thinking about death a lot. She's thought about it while attending memorial services for fellow inmates whose remains are bound for the prison potter's field, where they bury the bodies of women no one wants to claim.\n\nSometimes the thought is triggered by a stray comment that she hears as someone passes what she calls her room — the place that is actually her cell. But just as often the notion of dying in prison pops into her head uninvited.\n\nIt's always in my brain, Smart says one afternoon on the phone in voice flat and devoid of emotion. I would rather be put to death than die in here of old age.\n\nShe arrived at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women one morning in 1993, transferred from the New Hampshire prison she'd occupied since her conviction two years earlier. The official line was security reasons, but Smart suspects New Hampshire wanted to sweep me under the rug and make it more difficult for family and attorneys to visit.\n\nSmart has also suggested that her former home state is being unfair to her because inmates with similar sentences are imprisoned in New Hampshire. A prison spokeswoman declined to comment about the reasons for her transfer. Smart is one of only four female New Hampshire prisoners incarcerated outside the state.\n\nThe prison where Smart was sent is set in rolling hills north of New York City, amid some of America's priciest real estate. It has housed a parade of the country's more notorious and well-known criminals, including Joyce Mitchell, the civilian prison tailor-shop worker whose romantic entanglement with two prisoners she helped execute a bold breakout was depicted in the recent Showtime series Escape at Dannemora. Among others are Amy Fisher, the teenage Long Island Lolita, who was convicted of shooting the wife of her lover, Joey Buttafuoco; and Jean Harris, who murdered an ex-lover, the author of The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet.\n\nWithin a few years of Smart's transfer to Bedford Hills, her eye socket was fractured in an attack by two fellow inmates. She had to have a plastic plate surgically implanted and has lost feeling on the left side of her face.\n\nIn the New Hampshire prison, Smart says, she'd been able to wear her wedding ring. But when she came to Bedford Hills, she says it wasn't allowed because it had a diamond setting. She gave it to her mother to hold for her. At that moment, three years after her husband's murder, the ring meant something to her, something she wanted to keep — it still does.\n\nWhy wouldn't I? she says during a recent interview in the prison library. I mean, I'm still married.\n\nPamela and Gregory Smart on their wedding day. (Jon Lasseigne/AP)\n\nThe affair\n\nPamela Wojas became Mrs. Gregory Smart in 1989. They'd met at a party in New Hampshire while she was visiting her family during a college break.\n\nHer new beau moved to Florida to live with her while she finished her degree in communications at Florida State University. When she wasn't in class, she interned at a local television news station and hosted a program on the college radio station titled Metal Madness. She was also the station's promotions director, she says, a gig that meant she handed out backstage passes for acts such as the Scorpions and Whitesnake.\n\nI went backstage with everybody, Smart recalls. I was the woman with all the goods.\n\nShe aspired to be a television features reporter, a la Barbara Walters, but couldn't find a decent-paying job in the profession after she graduated. The couple moved back home after her mother alerted her to a position as a media services director, responsible for writing feel-good news stories and managing a video library, for 11 schools in southeastern New Hampshire.\n\nFor a time, Smart says, she had a happy marriage. Her husband took a job as a life insurance agent. He'd gotten her a dog that she named Haylen — a twist on the name of her favorite band, Van Halen. They moved into a rented condominium near his parents, and her new mother-in-law helped her decorate it just so. There were weekend outings at the Trump casino in Atlantic City.\n\nBut they hadn't yet been married a year, Smart says, when her husband confessed to her that he'd had a one-night stand.\n\nI thought there was something wrong with me and I wasn't good enough, Smart says.\n\nAt the time, she was serving as a facilitator for a school self-esteem program. Through the program she met a 15-year-old student volunteer named Billy Flynn. She remembers Flynn, six years her junior, flattering her and says she eventually started to develop feelings for him. I thought he had feelings for me, too.\n\nThere have been conflicting accounts about who seduced whom, but both Flynn and Smart have testified that they became lovers. Smart says that they began having sex sometime around his 16th birthday and that she slept with him more than five times over the course of about two months. All the while, she says, her husband's admission was coloring her mind-set.\n\nI feel like if that had not happened I wouldn't have gotten involved with somebody else, she says.\n\nIn prison, she has asked herself over and over how she ended up having an affair.\n\nSometimes I find answers, she says on the phone one day.\n\nOther times she comes up blank, she says: Sometimes I think I don't even understand my own self.\n\nPamela Smart, left, follows jurors out of her former home in Derry, N.H., where her husband was shot. She was charged with planning his murder with three of her students from Winnacunnet High School, where she was a media instructor. (Jon Pierre Lasseigne/AP)\n\nThe murder\n\nOn May 1, 1990 — six days before her first wedding anniversary — Pamela Smart came home from a school meeting to find her 24-year-old husband dead and lying in puddling blood on the floor of their condominium.\n\nAs the investigation proceeded, Smart was in a frenzied state, alternating between depression and mania, her mother, Linda Wojas, says in a recent interview. Wojas says she took Smart to a residential mental health facility. The facility was about to admit her when both mother and daughter hesitated, Wojas says.\n\nI didn't want to leave her there, Wojas says. I thought I could take better care of her. I think I made a terrible mistake.\n\nThe next month, the case of Gregory Smart's murder blew wide open. Two of Billy Flynn's friends — Pete Randall and Vance Lattime Jr. — told a classmate that they'd been involved in the killing.\n\nThey eventually turned themselves in and pleaded guilty after agreeing to cooperate in return for reduced sentences. They said Lattime bought bullets with money given to him by Smart. Flynn said he shot Gregory Smart in the head while Randall held a knife in front of the victim's face.\n\nPatrick Randall, 17, testifies in Rockingham County Superior Court in Exeter, N.H.

(Jim Cole/AP)\n\nThe class divide was glaring. The boys were from Seabrook, a working-class neighborhood that the cartoonist Al Capp has said provided the inspiration for his rube-ish Appalachian characters in the comic strip Li'l Abner.' Smart was the daughter of a Delta Air Lines pilot, who'd risen from humble origins to build a comfortable life.\n\nAfter being told they would be charged as adults, the boys eventually told investigators that Smart orchestrated the killing down to the smallest detail — leaving an entrance unlocked so they could surprise her husband when he came home, instructing them to make it look like a burglar and offering to pay them $500 apiece.\n\nLooking back, Smart says, none of those things took place. But she allows that it's at least possible that Flynn could have interpreted her words as a request to kill her husband.\n\nShe says she told him, I can't, you know, do this because I have a husband. If he translated that into, you know, that he couldn't have me as long as Gregg was around, then that's in his brain . . . that as long as Gregg was here, Bill could never have me for himself.\n\nWhile Flynn was incarcerated, Smart almost made it easy for investigators to finger her as the culprit. She had a series of conversations with Cecilia Pierce that were monitored by police using a phone wiretap and body wire. On the tapes, which would be played at Smart's trial the next spring, she seems to be urging Pierce to lie to investigators.\n\nIf you tell the truth, you're gonna be an accessory to murder, Smart says in one exchange, according to a prosecution transcript.\n\nWhat good is it gonna do if you send me to the f—ing slammer? she asks.\n\nSmart has said that the conversations were a charade — that she was conducting her own private investigation and pretending to know more about the crime than she did. A friend of her husband's corroborated that part of her story at the trial.\n\nOn Aug. 1, 1990, Smart was arrested.\n\nThe circus was about to begin.\n\nPamela Smart walks past cameras at Rockingham County Superior Court in Exeter, N.H. awaiting a verdict in her murder conspiracy trial. (Jon Pierre Lasseigne/AP)\n\nThe trial\n\nLet me tell you what the, quote, fake media did to us 28 years ago, Linda Wojas says on the phone one recent afternoon.\n\nSmart made a compelling central figure when her trial launched in 1991, tailor-made for a media frenzy. Blond, petite and well-dressed, she was sometimes described as a schoolteacher, a mistake that Smart believes fed into a stereotype. Some of the coverage noted that one of the hit songs by her favorite band, Van Halen, was called Hot for Teacher.\n\nSmart and her supporters frequently complain that there was too much focus in the media about her appearance. The bows she wore in her hair during the trial became an object of fascination.\n\nThe jury wasn't sequestered until the second day of deliberations. It later came out that one juror was making tape recordings at night about her thoughts on the trial. The witnesses weren't sequestered either; Flynn and the other two boys were housed together, and at times were able to watch one another's testimony.\n\nSmart's demeanor on the witness stand played into the narrative that she was an ice princess. She shed no tears in court, but her former lover, Flynn — a big-eyed kid with a quintessentially 1980s mullet haircut — cried openly on the witness stand. Looking back, Smart says she'd been raised to contain her emotions; stoicism was a virtue. But at night during the trial, when no one was looking, she says she sobbed.\n\nPamela Smart, then 23, takes the oath before sitting in the witness stand in Rockingham County Superior Court in Exeter, N.H. (Jon Pierre Lasseigne/AP)\n\nOne of the fundamental underpinnings of the case was the idea that Smart was an older woman who used her sexual wiles to entrance a teenager who became obsessed with her to such a degree that he was willing to kill for her. The prosecution referred to Flynn as a virgin, and in its closing argument said he was having his first sexual experience. He's in way over his head. And I submit she liked it that way.\n\nSmart believes those assertions created the impression that Flynn was an innocent whom she deflowered. Her attorneys are trying to cast doubt on Flynn's testimony, arguing in her commutation request — without presenting any proof — that they have found new evidence that Flynn wasn't virgin before he met Smart.\n\nFlynn, who was encouraged by an official at his parole hearing not to talk to the media after his release, declined through his attorney to comment.\n\nSmart says she was the one who was inexperienced in the ways of love. Asked about her sexual history, she says in a phone interview that she was sexually active with a boyfriend in high school but says she was too busy to date during college before meeting her future husband.\n\nEven as the trial was unfolding, it was clear the saga was destined for Hollywood. Pierce, who was a key witness against Smart, had made a movie deal.\n\nThe lines between what was happening in the real world and what was happening on television screens were blurring — even on the witness stand. Flynn testified that he and Smart watched the film 9 ½ Weeks, then reenacted a steamy sexy scene.\n\nI think he's having a problem remembering where reality began and the movie stopped, Smart testified.\n\nFrom his perch at the prosecution table, Maggiotto wasn't buying any of it. The evidence, he says in a recent interview, was overwhelming: I just don't think she was that believable.\n\nOn Mar. 22, 1991, the jury convicted her of witness tampering and conspiracy to commit murder and of being an accomplice to first-degree murder. Under New Hampshire law, the accomplice conviction meant she would spend the rest of her life in prison.\n\nSoon after the verdict was delivered, a juror wrote in a first-person piece for the Boston Globe that he considered any suggestion that the decision was influenced by the media insulting. More recently, the 2014 HBO documentary, Captivated: The Trials of Pamela Smart, featured a juror who would have hung the jury if she'd known Smart would be sentenced to life in prison.\n\nNicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix star in To Die For, a mockumentary based on the details of Pamela Smarts trial. (Everett Collection)\n\n'I am so not that way at all'\n\nOne night in the mid-1990s, Pamela Smart settled into a chair for movie night inside the prison in Bedford Hills. As always, she says, she didn't know what film would be played. She felt a chill as the opening scenes appeared on screen.\n\nThe film was titled To Die For, and it starred Nicole Kidman in the role of an ambition-crazed woman who has an affair with a teenager, then manipulates him into killing her husband.\n\nSmart froze.\n\nIt's almost like when you see a car accident and you think to yourself, 'Why am I looking at this?'  she recalls in an interview. Later, the reality sinks in that people actually believe that because they've seen it on TV.\n\nThe movie, a critical success filmed in mockumentary style, was based on a novel of the same name by Joyce Maynard. Kidman's portrayal of Suzanne Maretto, the character Smart had so clearly inspired, chafed Smart.\n\nShe portrayed me as flaky, like an airhead, Smart says. Ambitious to the point where she was willing to step on anybody who got in the way of her ambitions. In the movie she came across as very narcissistic. I'm so not that way at all.\n\nThe film was the killer for her, says Eleanor Pam, her academic adviser. Guards tell her, 'I saw it. I know what you did.' \n\nOne of the prison's guards, according to Smart, sexually assaulted her in 2003, and took photos of her in lingerie, in the same poses she'd struck in photos shown to the jury at her trial. She says he then threatened to kill her family if she told anyone. The photographs were later published by the National Enquirer. (The guard has since died.)\n\nThat same year, she earned a master's in English literature from Mercy College; it was her second, after having earned a master's of science in law degree from the Southern California University for Professional Studies two years earlier. She's now working on a doctorate in ministry, she says.\n\nI don't have time to be depressed, says Smart, who serves as a grievance representative and HIV-prevention counselor for fellow inmates, and dreams of working for the United Nations in HIV prevention if she's ever released.\n\nBut at times, she says, she's been angry. Especially in June 2015 when Flynn, who got married while he was still in prison, and Randall were released early after being granted parole. (Lattime, who provided the gun and drove the getaway car, was paroled in 2005; Raymond Fowler, who waited in the car the night of the murder, was paroled in 2003.)\n\nWilliam Billy Flynn cries as he addresses the Smart family at a parole hearing. Flynn was convicted and sent to prison for killing Gregory Smart, the husband of his lover, Pamela Smart, in Derry, N.H., in 1990. Flynn was released from prison in Maine on parole in 2015. (Cheryl Senter/AP)\n\nOn beautiful sunny days, she feels the ire building up inside.\n\nThey're probably at the beach right now living the high life, she thinks to herself.\n\nThe release of the four men involved in the killing gave Smart's supporters an added boost for their argument that gender has played a role in the case.\n\nThe feminists got it right away, says Pam, a professor emerita of City University of New York who is the president of Veteran Feminists of America, a nonprofit feminist history organization. It was clear that she was the 20th-century version of all the feminine villains in history.\n\nSteinem, the legendary feminist leader, cited the releases and called Smart's sentence an enormous injustice.\n\nMaynard wrote a letter to the governor's office, saying, To whatever extent Pamela Smart's chances for a fair parole hearing might have been affected by my novel, I trust that you will do what you can to rectify that situation by giving her the same second chance granted the others involved in the case.\n\nMaynard, who did not respond to multiple requests to be interviewed for this article, has long said that her novel, which was published after Smart's trial concluded, was a work of fiction with a story line influenced by what she'd read in the media about Smart.\n\nSmart has asked for mercy before. In 2004, the state of New Hampshire denied her request to have her sentence commuted.\n\nA key in commutation cases is whether the inmate has accepted responsibility and expresses remorse. Smart finds this to be a kind of impossible riddle — she doesn't want to admit to a crime she says she didn't commit. What she's left with is a confusing path — pleading her innocence, while at the same time making arguments that could be used by a person who has admitted guilt. For example, citing scientific studies that support the argument that people younger than 25 should not be sentenced to life in prison because their brains are not fully developed and that they shouldn't be held responsible for their actions in the same manner as older offenders.\n\nThe attorney general's vigorous opposition to her current request emphasizes that she still has not accepted full responsibility.\n\nSmart has blamed the news media, the witnesses, the trial judge and the prosecutors. . . . Her attempts to blame others for her incarceration are a reflection of not only her guilt, but her inability to be rehabilitated, Associate Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin writes.\n\nSmart says she'd be lying if she admitted to orchestrating her husband's murder, but parts of Strelzin's argument ring true to her.\n\nFor many years, it was the whole world's fault — not mine, she says. I think on some level, in my brain, I didn't want it to be my fault.\n\nNow, she says, I do feel responsible for my husband's death. . . . When I think about it, I say that all of this is my fault. Had I not made that initial, horrible decision [to have an affair] nothing would have happened.\n\nPamela Smart sits for a portrait at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Bedford Hills, N.Y. (Jesse Dittmar for The Washington Post)\n\nLove letters and hate mail\n\nAt home on an island in New Hampshire, Smart's mother, Linda Wojas, says she walks three miles a day in hopes that she'll live long enough to see her daughter freed.\n\nMy time's running out, says Wojas, who just turned 77. I was 49 when this happened.\n\nShe's been consumed by the hunt for clues.\n\nMy husband gets tired of it, she says.\n\nOn the phone one recent afternoon, she says: Today I received a phone call from an informant. Please, God, make this be the thing that turns this.\n\nShe wrote a book, but couldn't find a publisher. She's now working with a different agent.\n\nIn New York, Pam — Smart's academic adviser and spokeswoman — fends off people who try to inject themselves into the saga.\n\nI have people who try to make themselves players. They want to solve it; they get in the way, she says. For the life of me I don't know why it has the staying power it has.\n\nHer mailbox fills with letters. Some people, she says, have written that they hope Smart rots in prison and gets gang-raped every night.\n\nOthers have said, I'm in love with her. Can you introduce me?\n\nSmart gets letters, too. Dozens of them each week. She answers every one, she says, and shows the callus on her finger to prove it.\n\nMost people who write her offer words of encouragement, she says. Occasionally she gets a marriage proposal.\n\nOne writer called her hot.\n\nI'm like, 'Come on!,'  she says. I'm not so hot — anymore.
Adapted from an online discussion.\n\nDear Carolyn: Can you ever really trust a husband who cheated on you? He confessed — I didn't catch him — and he'd already ended the affair. He says all the right things, blocked the other woman's numbers, called her in front of me to tell her he made a horrible mistake and wouldn't respond to any contact from her. He offers full access to anything electronic (passwords included), offered to put a GPS tracker on his phone and car, made an appointment for therapy and for STD testing. My heart is telling me to go to therapy; my head is screaming that a cheater is always a cheater. Can someone really change?\n\nOnce a Cheater?\n\nOnce a Cheater?: I don't believe anyone is always anything. We are mercurial pieces of work, all of us, and answer to impulses in different ways depending not just on who we are (at a given time? discuss), but also our surroundings, emotional states, peers, opportunities, prevailing theories of life, prevailing winds.\n\nSo a husband who cheated on you could do it again, sure, but he could also choose not to cheat ever again based on this experience, or he could end up never cheating again because the circumstances never align this way again. I am not a fan at all of harboring, much less building on, any illusion of certainty.\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/For The Washington Post)\n\nYou have you. That's what you know (ignoring for a moment that we manage to surprise ourselves as a matter of course). And you know — or will find out over the next few weeks and months — how you respond to your husband's infidelity and to his apparently firm commitment to fixing whatever he broke.\n\nYou don't have to figure anything out now. Sure, go to therapy — by yourself, too, not just with him — but then see for yourself what you have.\n\nThis experience will change both of you and it'll change your marriage — that's a reasonable bet — so your job at this point is just to open your mind to whatever presents itself. You can choose to live with it awhile, too, while you figure out whether you want to take or leave these changed versions of your husband and marriage.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm not thrilled with the fact that his remedies are highly technical, with passwords and GPS tracking et al. That's all on the verification side. Where you and he need attention now is on the origin side, on the feelings (or absences thereof) that led to this. Why did someone turn his head, why was he susceptible to this attention, why did he act on the temptation?\n\nThis isn't just a more reliable way to reestablish trust, since phone and password workarounds are so elementary that a 10-year-old can explain them to you. It's also the only real way to get your relationship to emerge better, stronger and more intimate for having been through this crisis. The couples who can really talk about what went wrong are the ones who get there. Is he willing to say those right things? Are you?\n\nI also recommend you listen to the podcast Invisibilia, Season 2, Episode 2 (The Personality Myth) at npr.org/podcasts/510307/invisibilia. It's a fascinating walk through the potential for humans to change.
Dear Amy: My husband's brother and his wife just got divorced after 17 years of marriage and 25 years of being together.\n\nThey have three children, who are close cousins to my three children. All the children are under the age of 15. My children love their aunt and uncle, and consider her still their aunt, even though she is no longer married to their uncle. I too consider this woman my family, even though technically she is no longer my sister-in-law.\n\nMy daughter's Communion is this spring, and this woman is godmother to my little girl. Naturally I want to invite her to the church and dinner afterward, but my brother-in-law forbids it! My husband is inclined to side with his brother and say she is not welcome, and that I need to honor this since it is his family.\n\nMy daughter will feel terrible if her godmother is not welcome, and I am also fearful that the cousins will not come if their mother is not welcomed.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking it is okay to invite her, even though they aren't married anymore? Is my husband acting appropriately in telling me it is his call to decide?\n\nWe are now fighting over this and it isn't pleasant for anyone.\n\nWhat's appropriate here?\n\nUpset\n\nYour husband and his brother have what could be called the primary relationship in this tough triangle. They grew up in the same household and have long-standing familial loyalties that your husband is anchoring to now. You can imagine that your husband is under some pressure from his brother regarding this event. Sibling loyalty (unfortunately) trumps your close relationship with your sister-in-law.\n\nYou can also imagine that, given the breakup of this marriage, she might not be ready to amicably attend a family event alongside her ex.\n\nBecause she is the child's godmother, this is an issue you should take to clergy. You and your husband should ask for a meeting and attend together.\n\nIn my view, you should invite her, and the couple should work out between themselves who will attend.\n\nYou and your former sister-in-law should work hard to maintain your friendship and relationship, regardless of what happens with this event.\n\nDear Amy: My niece recently got engaged.\n\nI sent a card congratulating her and offered to host a bridal tea for her. She accepted my offer of hosting a shower. Soon after, I was informed, by her mother, that they are getting married ASAP with only his parents, her parents and siblings in attendance.\n\nThey want to spend funds that would be spent on a wedding on other things. Now, she and her mother seem to think they get to make all the decisions about the shower, and I am to show up with checkbook in hand to pay for the event.\n\nI have been cussed, screamed at and hung up on.\n\nIs it too late to call this off without causing a big (or should I say bigger) row in the family?\n\nI was under the impression that the hostess organized the shower and the bride-to-be furnished the guest list. Am I that much of an old fogey? Have things changed that much?\n\nCurious Aunt\n\nThings have not changed all that much. People who offer to host events should be thanked, and the recipients of this generosity should gracefully accept, offer to help and not interfere.\n\nCussing, screaming and hanging up on people has never been an acceptable way to communicate, and it's not acceptable now. You have learned some unfortunate truths about these family members, and because you can't please them, you should gracefully bow out and let them do what they want to do, on their own.\n\nDear Amy: I have a simple solution for Worried Future Mother-in-law, who was worried that the mother of the groom would be drunk and disorderly at the wedding.\n\nThey should simply not serve alcohol at the reception, although they shouldn't tell the groom's mother ahead of time — otherwise she might bring her own, or arrive drunk.\n\nProblem Solved\n\nI have read that dry receptions are on the upswing, but many marrying couples, their families and friends, are not willing to sacrifice their own celebratory imbibing for others' sake.\n\nI absolutely believe in limiting alcohol served at these celebrations. Alcohol use at weddings leads to problems that last far beyond the typical hangover. Drunken revelers damage property and relationships, and the consequences of drinking at these open-bar events are sometimes tragic.
In California, Gay Marriage Battle Is a Family Feud California Assemblyman Pete Knight, R-Palmdale, appears weary during more than three hours of hearings regarding his bill banning same-sex marriages. (AP)\n\nBy William Booth\n\nWashington Post Staff Writer\n\nFriday, October 22, 1999; Page A2 LOS ANGELES—The campaign to declare that marriage only between a man and a woman is legal in California--as opposed to a union of two men or two women--has suddenly turned very personal. The issue, which is as much about homosexual rights as it is about family values, is pitting religious conservatives against gays and their allies here, and may once again roil the political waters of this bellwether state, just as initiatives over bilingual education, affirmative action and illegal immigrants have in the past. And in this case, it already has pitted father against son. In an opinion piece last week in the Los Angeles Times, the son of the ballot initiative's sponsor wrote that his father is anti-gay and pursuing a blind, uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a subject about which he knows nothing and wants to know nothing, but which serves his political career. The son, David Knight, revealed that he is gay and living with a life partner named Joe. He is also a graduate of the Air Force Academy, a former fighter pilot who served in the Persian Gulf War and now, at age 39, is a cabinet maker in Baltimore leading a quiet, full life. He says his father has rejected him because of his sexual orientation. David's father, the sponsor of the Protection of Marriage initiative, which will be put before voters here in March, is state Sen. William Pete Knight, a conservative Republican from Palmdale who has attempted--and failed--five times in the state house to pass similar legislation declaring that marriage is only for a man and a woman. Neither David nor Pete Knight is discussing the matter with the news media, but Pete Knight did issue a statement saying, I care deeply about my son, and adding he regrets that David felt he needed to force a private, family matter into the public forum. He suggested that he and his son were closer than what David Knight told readers of the newspaper. Three years ago, the senator, who also is a former test pilot who holds the Guinness Book of World Records mark for flying speed at 4,520 mph, publicly acknowledged that his son is gay, as was his younger brother, who died of AIDS. The question of who makes a marriage is surfacing now because of recent attempts in states such as Hawaii and Vermont to legalize and sanction gay marriages. If a same-gender couple were to get a legal marriage certificate in, say, Montpelier--as Hollywood's famous lesbian couple Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche suggested they might--and then come home to California, the state might have to recognize the union. But in 1996, President Clinton signed the Federal Defense of Marriage Act, which essentially gave each state the right to determine its own laws on same-sex marriage. And many states have done so. Ballot initiatives banning same-sex marriages also recently passed in Alaska and Hawaii. Some day, both sides agree, the issue is headed for a big court test case. Early polling shows that about six in 10 Californians support Knight's ballot initiative. But this will be a hard-fought and potentially divisive campaign--with each side promising to spend dollar for dollar, possibly as much as $10 million. Opposing the initiative is a San Francisco-based group calling itself No on Knight. They argue that the initiative is unnecessary, unfair, divisive and intrusive. Mike Marshall, the campaign manager for No on Knight, says that he believes the initiative is the beginning of an assault on gay rights in California and around the nation. In the last legislative session in Sacramento, where Democrats control the state government, gays and lesbians won a windfall of protective measures, from extension of domestic partner benefits to including sexual orientation in anti-harassment laws. Clearly, the radical right is using this issue to mobilize their conservative base, Marshall said. Supporters of the marriage measure have contributed almost $4 million so far--and much of the money has come from religious groups. Catholic bishops support the measure and so does the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This is a new type of coalition, said Rob Stutzman, spokesman for the Protection of Marriage initiative. The Catholic bishops are literally writing us checks, and so are the Mormons. We've got over 10,000 individual donations, and a lot of that is from the Church of Latter Day Saints. We've also got Muslims coming on board and conservative Jewish support--the kinds of people that normally don't sit together in a room and talk. One strategy of the initiative's opponents is to hang the measure around the neck of its sponsor, by suggesting that Sen. Knight is fixated on homosexuality for personal reasons having to do with his estranged son and dead brother. The No on Knight group also is reminding visitors to its Web site that in 1993, when he had been recently elected to the California Assembly, Knight distributed a poem to fellow GOP members that many considered racist and inflammatory. The poem was, in essence, about how illegal immigrants from Mexico were lazy abusers of this country's welfare state. Stutzman, spokesman for the marriage measure, describes all this as a red herring and says that his opponents' strategy is that they don't want to talk about the initiative, so they go after the conservative white guy who introduced it. © 1999 The Washington Post Company Back to the top
Those jocks just couldn't compare, he later told the Chicago Tribune. I was the power. They would just stand around and look goofy at the parties I was at. That was my arena.\n\nFeeling inspired one day, he jumped through an open window at a downtown storefront and started doing the robot. People thought I was completely nuts, he recalled. So they came and arrested me because I didn't have an entertainer's license.\n\nAD\n\nAnd that was that. My first break into show business.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Quiñones danced on the television show Soul Train and became a founding member of the Lockers, whose intricate footwork, handslaps, kicks and cartwheels helped introduce a national television audience to street dance. He later worked as a dancer and choreographer for artists including Lionel Richie, Madonna and Michael Jackson, and became a star in his own right while playing the dancer Ozone in a pair of 1984 movies, Breakin' and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo.\n\nHe was the first matinee-idol street-dancing movie star, said singer, dancer and choreographer Toni Basil, another founding member of the Lockers. He had spectacular technique; he could do multiple styles; he danced with intense passion; and he was a great storyteller, a Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly of street, she added in a phone interview.\n\nAD\n\nHe was also drop-dead gorgeous.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Quiñones, who was widely known by his dance name Shabba-Doo, was 65 when he died Dec. 29 at his home in the Eagle Rock section of Los Angeles. His manager, Robert Bryant, said the cause was not yet known. The day he died, Mr. Quiñones announced on social media that he was recovering from a cold and had tested negative for the coronavirus.\n\nMr. Quiñones modeled himself after innovative Black dancers like the acrobatic, tap-dancing Nicholas Brothers. But his own work defied easy categorization. He moved fluidly between styles — from the funk and hip-hop style known as locking to disco and mambo — and performed a street-dance version of Swan Lake before making his major-movie debut in Breakin'.\n\nAD\n\nReleased on the heels of Flashdance (1983), it starred Mr. Quiñones and Michael Boogaloo Shrimp Chambers as Los Angeles performers who mentor a classically trained dancer, played by Lucinda Dickey. Mr. Quiñones said he did most of his dancing in the movie with a broken left hand, which he fractured while doing a windmill move and then concealed with a bandanna, fearing the filmmakers would replace him.\n\nAD\n\nMade for about $1 million, the movie became a surprise hit, grossing more than $38 million. When director Sam Firstenberg made a sequel later that year, he said he often turned to Mr. Quiñones — who had grown up in Chicago's violent and neglected Cabrini-Green housing projects — for help with the story. If there's a gang fight, he's correcting us and saying, 'Let's do it this way, because it's more like what really happens out in the streets,'  Firstenberg told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nMr. Quiñones was hailed as the Bob Fosse of the streets by Us Weekly. The Times called him the uncrowned king of popping, locking and hip-hopping; the liege lord of the street-dance explosion. He later choreographed Madonna's Who's That Girl tour and, at the Academy Awards in 2007, choreographed and appeared in Three 6 Mafia's performance of It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp, which won the Oscar for best original song.\n\nAD\n\nHe also became a mentor to actors, dancers and choreographers such as Darrin Henson, who recalled watching Breakin' in awe as a teenager, shocked that street dancers could make it to the big screen. The man was so giving, Henson said by phone. Everything was about teaching, growth, expansion, strength and execution. The man was energy personified.\n\nAD\n\nChambers, who played Turbo in the Breakin' movies, said Mr. Quiñones was one of the first to encourage street dancers to view their craft as a career, and advised his peers and students to put a price to your talent, long before street steps and hip-hop dance forms were ubiquitous in music videos.\n\nMake it Broadway. Shine it up, he said in an interview, recalling Mr. Quiñones's advice. His whole thing was presentation: bringing glam and etiquette to a dance that was loose and very green.\n\nAD\n\nAdolfo Gutierrez Quiñones was born in Chicago on May 11, 1955. His father, also named Adolfo, was a Puerto Rican salesman and laborer who left when Mr. Quiñones was a child; his mother, the former Ruth McDaniel, was a Black accountant whose family moved from Mississippi during the Great Migration.\n\nMr. Quiñones grew up dancing to both Tito Puente and James Brown, showing off his moves in the park. He later told NPR that he was a bit of a hoodlum, which led his mother to move the family to California in 1971, just as the TV show Soul Train became nationally syndicated. I'll get on 'Soul Train' and my life will change, he recalled thinking. And sure enough, that's exactly what happened.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1973 he joined a few friends from Soul Train in forming the Lockers, who were initially led by Don Campbell, who died in March and was credited with inventing locking. The group opened for Frank Sinatra at Carnegie Hall, performed on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show and — with mixed success — taught their moves on-air to Dick Van Dyke.\n\nBy then, Mr. Quiñones was calling himself Shabba-Doo, after experimenting with the dance name Sir Lance-a-Lock. He left the Lockers in 1976 and soon partnered with Bette Midler, appearing in her Broadway concert special Bette! Divine Madness. (New York Times music critic Robert Palmer wrote that he brought more style and elegance to the stage than Midler and her backup singers put together.)\n\nMr. Quiñones also danced in Xanadu (1980), a movie musical with his hero, Gene Kelly; the action comedy Tango & Cash (1989), starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell; and the dance drama Lambada (1990).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe studied at the American Film Institute Conservatory in the 1990s and directed a movie musical, Rave, Dancing to a Different Beat (1993), as well as a street-dance documentary, The Kings of Crenshaw (2017). In recent years, he taught private lessons, led master classes and created a dance-fitness program known as Funk-Shway.\n\nHis marriages to Soul Train dancer Gwendolyn Powell and actress Lela Rochon ended in divorce. Survivors include his mother; a son from his first marriage, Vashawn Quiñones; a daughter from a relationship, Cassini Quiñones; a sister; two half brothers; a half sister; and three grandchildren.\n\nMr. Quiñones died the same month that breaking — one of the street-dance styles he helped popularize — gained Olympics status, with dancers slated to compete at the 2024 games in Paris. He was really adamant that because street dance and breaking really started in the streets, that inner-city kids have opportunities for funding and sponsorship, Bryant, his manager, said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut while Mr. Quiñones called on Olympic organizers to remember the origins of the craft and to focus on the flavor, personality and the spontaneity of breaking rather than the mere gymnastics, he was also gratified at the recognition for street dance more broadly.
To the little people, it never felt right. The readers of the old Organic Gardening and Farming magazine saw no logic in spraying poisons on their vegetables.\n\nThe magazine was founded 75 years ago, with no glamour or gloss, and its circulation reached more than a million at its height. It featured tales and photos from real home gardeners, bursting with pride in the healthy, vigorous, chemical-free plants they had grown.\n\nThe sad history of pesticide use in horticulture bears their hunches out. One product after another has been found unsafe to use. In the 19th century, a concoction named Paris green was the insecticide of choice before being replaced by lead arsenate — an unholy marriage of arsenic and lead first used in 1892. When that proved deadly to humans as well as insects, it was followed right after World War II by DDT, which reigned until Rachel Carson disgraced it with her book Silent Spring in 1962. So all these were sold commercially for a long time before their dangers were recognized, and to this day many pesticides are considered harmful to humans, wildlife, and the quality of soil, water and air, even as they are kept in widespread use.\n\n[ More vegetables, less work: Lessons from the mother of mulch]\n\nThat reality is reinforced in a new report from the United Nations, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food. Pesticide regulation has largely failed. Pesticides are responsible for biodiversity loss and water and soil contamination and for negatively affecting the productivity of croplands, thereby threatening future food production.\n\nThis prediction runs counter to the claim made by powerful food industry giants that pesticides are needed to feed the world's future population. Rather, the report says, the industry's inequitable production and distribution systems keep food from those who need it. It's cheering to read that a rise in organic agricultural practices in many places illustrates that farming with less or without any pesticides is feasible. Green agriculture, it states, is capable of delivering sufficient yields to feed the entire world population.\n\nMeanwhile, there are other hopeful signs. Increasing numbers of us buy fresh organic fruits, vegetables and meat from local farmers who not only try to keep the food pure but also use practices that protect their workers and the environment.\n\nBecause the least sustainably grown crops tend to be commodity foods such as the corn and soybeans that find their way into packaged, highly processed goods, taking the time to cook from scratch with wholesome basic materials is a positive step, too.\n\nWhen we grow food at home, we can guarantee its quality and make sure that it does no harm to the ecosystem. We are not convinced that sustainable practices will work only in home gardens and on small farms.\n\nCultivating, mulching, solarizing and flame-weeding can all be used to reduce or eliminate weeds without herbicides.\n\nHandpicking can keep pest-\n\ninsect pressure down. You can speed up the process by using a wet-dry vacuum to suck them up. Larger such machines are used on big farms.\n\nVegetable oil squirted into the young silks of corn ears will banish corn earworms. A strong hose spray will reduce the number of aphids and spider mites.\n\nSpun-bonded polyester covers, set over crops at sowing or transplanting time, can exclude many kinds of garden pests.\n\nRotating crops will help avoid overwintering insects in the soil, such as potato beetles and carrot maggots. This requires a diversity of crops, but diversity in itself leads to fewer pest problems than one finds with monocultures.\n\nMaintaining soil fertility will help plants repel pests. The more vigorous plants are, the more they are able to produce natural chemicals for pest resistance.\n\nKeeping poisons off the property will help sustain populations of beneficial predators in the form of birds, amphibians and predatory insects.\n\nThese are just a few tactics one can pursue. In the end, it may still be up to all of us, the little people, with our hunches, our anecdotal evidence, our creativity, and our power to vote with our dollars and our hoes, to set things right.
But Trump is not the only world leader who has opted to stay home in 2019 because of a domestic political crisis that can be viewed through the prism of a backlash to globalization.\n\nAD\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is skipping Davos so she can manage Brexit. May on Monday spelled out a 'Plan B' for Brexit that appeared very much like a warmed-over version of her Plan A, which suffered a crushing defeat in Parliament last week, Karla Adam and William Booth report from London. May was forced to return to Westminster by a newly assertive Parliament that has been trying to exert more control over what withdrawal from the European Union looks like. … May refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit — the possibility that Britain could 'crash out' of the EU without a deal March 29, which the government warns could create economic hardship. … May said that the people already voted for Brexit and that the job of her government and Parliament is to deliver it. A second referendum, she warned, 'could damage social cohesion by undermining faith in our democracy.'\n\nAD\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron opted to stick around Paris to deal with the Yellow Jacket protests. Citizens wearing the yellow vests French motorists are required to carry in their vehicles started weekly protests of a fuel tax increase in mid-November. Anger over the president's policies that were seen as favoring the wealthy swelled the demonstrations into a broader anti-government movement, the AP reports. Macron launched a 'national debate' last week to solicit ideas from citizens and to help assuage the anger. Thousands of people nevertheless turned out in Paris and several other cities Saturday, the 10th consecutive weekend of demonstrations. Still, Macron coaxed more than 150 corporate types to meet with him yesterday at the Palace of Versailles on their way to Davos. Big tech companies like Cisco, Microsoft and IBM – plus the candymaker Mars – announced a combined $682 million in planned investments.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May spoke to Parliament on Jan. 21 about her next steps for a Brexit deal. (Reuters)\n\nMore than 60 heads of state will still fly to the Swiss Alps for the five-day confab, along with more than 3,000 of the haves, the have-mores and the hangers-on. But the meeting in many ways underscores the extent to which globalization continues to be in retreat and global elites have failed to turn the tide of populism. The combination of climate change, income inequality, technology and geopolitics pose an existential threat to humanity, Klaus Schwab, the founder and chairman of the World Economic Forum, said in a statement released ahead of the conference.\n\nAD\n\n-- The growing parallels to the 1930s are eerie, as powerful people repeat many of the same mistakes: falling prey to the rising tides of isolationism, nativism and protectionism.\n\nAD\n\n-- The theme of this year's conference is Globalization 4.0: Shaping a Global Architecture in the Age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Sebastian Buckup, the director of programming at Davos, lamented in a lengthy essay last week that we live in an era of fortresses and walls, and he said the goal of the meeting is to draft a blueprint to construct a geopolitical framework that can support this era's needs.\n\nIf we only respond to an accelerating world by reinforcing walls, we risk ending up trapped in our fortresses, Buckup said. However, if we respond to an accelerating world by trying not to order it, we then surrender to chaos. … New powers, problems, and technological possibilities are pushing hard against structures that were built for other purposes and other times. We need a new architecture—but where to start?\n\nAD\n\n-- One central focus of this week's gathering is climate change, but the world has backed away from collective action in the Trump era. Don't forget that it was a fuel tax hike, intended to combat climate change, that precipitated the protests in Paris. And Trump has announced that the United States will no longer follow through with its commitments in the Paris climate accord.\n\nAD\n\n-- Income inequality is another focus of the titans who fly to Davos on their private jets every year, but it keeps getting worse. Oxfam published a report on Sunday, to coincide with the start of Davos, that shows billionaires got 12 percent richer last year while the 3.8 billion people who make up the world's poorest half saw their wealth decline by 11 percent. This is not inevitable, this is unacceptable, said Oxfam International Executive Director Winnie Byanyima. Oxfam said the number of billionaires has almost doubled since the financial crisis a decade ago yet tax rates on the wealthy and corporations have fallen to their lowest levels in decades, per the AP. Byanyima said 'the people in Davos' have the power to be 'the solution to end extreme inequality.' But they haven't.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund cut its economic growth forecast and warned that the risk of a sharper decline in global growth has certainly increased. (Reuters)\n\n-- Rising fears about the state of the world's biggest economies are likely to preoccupy the Davos crowd as much as anything else. China reported Monday that its economy expanded by 6.6 percent last year — a figure that would be good for many countries but represents the slowest growth for China in 28 years. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its expectations for the global economy, highlighting sharp declines in Europe and warning that the risks of a major slowdown have increased, Heather Long and Anna Fifield report on the front page of today's newspaper. Even U.S. consumers, who have remained resilient for months, have been shaken. Early this month, consumer confidence slumped to the lowest level of Trump's presidency, according to the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey. … While few see a recession as imminent, the high-level officials and executives at Davos catalogue a growing number of risks, including … rising interest rates, high global debt levels, and more polarized politics around the world. …\n\nAD\n\nSurveys released in recent days by global consultancies show more alarm bells in boardrooms around the world. Chief executives ranked a global recession as their No. 1 concern for 2019, according to a survey of nearly 800 top business leaders around the world released Thursday by the Conference Board. Global trade threats came in second. A survey of 1,300 chief executives released Monday by PwC found that 30 percent of business leaders believe that global growth will decline in the next 12 months, a record jump in pessimism to about six times the number who said that last year. The most pronounced decline in optimism was in North America, where it dropped from 63 percent a year ago to 37 percent now.\n\nAD\n\n-- Asian markets retreated overnight in the face of all this bad economic news.\n\n-- And there was equally concerning news for the global elite in the annual Edelman Trust Barometer, which showed the 'trust gap' between college-educated and wealthy people and a more frustrated mass population widened to a record extent, the Financial Times reports. Only one in five of the 33,000 people polled across 27 countries for the Edelman Trust Barometer said the current system was working for them, with more than 70 percent voicing a sense of injustice and a desire for change. After what the world's largest public relations company had dubbed a 'crash' in trust in the US in the first year of the Trump presidency, college-educated Americans reported a 15-point rebound in confidence in a year in which Democrats took the House. … Yet while 60 percent of such 'informed publics' now say they trust the country's institutions, just 47 percent of the general population voice such confidence. …\n\nAD\n\nThe survey shows widespread pessimism in more economically developed markets about the future, with majorities of the mass population in Japan, the US and every western Europe country saying they do not believe they and their families will be better off five years from now. A majority voiced fears of losing their job because of automation or insufficient skills.\n\nAD\n\n-- Bigger picture: The mood is noticeably more somber, Heather Long writes from Davos. A year ago, optimism was high as nearly every country was growing, and Trump received a warm welcome from business leaders after a big U.S. tax cut for corporations. … 'If you want to be a superpower in the world — and the U.S. still is — you have to engage with people,' said Hans-Paul Bürkner, chair of the Boston Consulting Group. He warned that 'everybody will be a bit more careful' until the shutdown and trade disputes are resolved.\n\nAn array of crises are keeping several world leaders away from the annual World Economic Forum in Davos. (Reuters)\n\n-- The number one question in the mind of leaders in Davos now is what on earth is Donald Trump up to? said Tina Fordham, chief global political analyst at Citigroup. We've very clearly moved in terms of investor sentiment from the Trump bump euphoria surrounding tax cuts and deregulation to fears of a Trump slump.\n\nAD\n\nThat quote is from a fresh piece this morning by Bloomberg News's David Wainer: Faced with that reality, world leaders are increasingly falling into one of three camps in their approach to the president, according to Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard University: following Trump's lead, resistance -- however futile -- and trying to make the most of his policy vagaries. Yet lacking any consensus against Trump, Walt sees many leaders as engaged in a waiting game to try and sit him out. 'There is no longer this idea that he'd be reined in by the establishment and that you'd have a fairly normal administration,' said Walt. 'People are now fully aware that he's extremely impulsive and erratic and will continue to challenge the status quo. That means something different depending where you are.'\n\nAD\n\nLeaders from all three camps will be present in Davos: those from traditional U.S. allies such as Canada and Germany who are resisting as far as possible in the hope they can wait Trump out; rivals from China and Russia who thought they could exploit the opportunities but have found him too erratic; and those in countries like Israel, Hungary and Brazil who have benefited from the environment around Trump's rise, Wainer writes for Bloomberg. Among the forum's headline attractions is German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who can be expected to build on her New Year's address denouncing nationalism and populism that reinforced her status as a Trump adversary. Yet she and Macron were unable to prevent Trump from quitting the Iran nuclear deal or the Paris climate accord. Germany is in the firing line if he follows through on his threat to impose punitive tariffs on imported cars.\n\n-- An American delegation still planned to attend after Trump pulled out on Jan. 10, including the secretaries of state, treasury and commerce, but the White House announced they'd stay home last Thursday afternoon. The administration did so reluctantly in the hours after the president denied Speaker Nancy Pelosi access to a military aircraft for a long-planned CODEL to visit combat troops in Afghanistan. Because of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation, I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos, Trump tweeted two weeks ago.\n\nAD\n\n-- Of the Group of Seven countries, only Germany, Italy and Japan will send their top leaders. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping also won't be in attendance, Ishaan Tharoor reports from Davos in his WorldViews newsletter. But that doesn't mean there's no chance of fireworks. A new crop of statesmen will get to make a splash, from right-wing Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and his Italian populist counterpart, Giuseppe Conte, to Ethiopia's reformist prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, and New Zealand's pathbreaking female leader, Jacinda Ardern. The most anticipated appearance may be that of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is not even a full month into his presidency. Bolsonaro may well fly a Trumpist flag in Davos: He is a known climate change skeptic and rode to power on an ultranationalist campaign suffused with contempt for the liberal order.\n\n-- Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa also canceled his planned speech in Davos at the last minute to deal with an economic crisis and the political fallout of violence by security forces, who have reportedly killed at least a dozen protesters. More than 600 have been arrested by security forces in a crackdown on the opposition, per the AP.\n\n-- Back in the United States, calling someone a Davos Democrat has become one of the harsher put-downs you hear from lefty types. It's the equivalent of calling a conservative a RINO (Republican In Name Only). Democratic activists, based on polling and interviews, appear uninterested in nominating a billionaire or businessman to take on Trump, which is why Tom Steyer chose not to run and why Mike Bloomberg still could take a pass if he concludes there's no real path to victory. It's also why former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz is considering an independent bid for president. Meanwhile, freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is driving the debate on the left with her call for a 70 percent top marginal tax rate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- A onetime McKinsey consultant who has turned against the Davos set, Anand Giridharadas, recently wrote a book called Winners Take All that's gotten a lot of attention on the left. In a new piece for Time magazine, he argues that the people who attend this conference are hypocrites who bear some responsibility for problems ailing the world today. You enabled the nationalism that threatens our societies. You stiffed so many of us, Giridharadas writes. You fought for rules that let you steal the future from our children. You pushed for monopolies … and austerity and deregulation. People got angry, and some of them voted for hell. And who benefited? You again. Because instead of following their anger up to the summit where you gather, the enraged were goaded, sometimes by your fellow plutocrats, into punching downward and turning on the most vulnerable.\n\n-- The billionaire Boston investor Seth Klarman, in his highly anticipated annual letter to clients, sounds the alarm about rising debt, growing social tensions and the absence of American leadership. Klarman is not at Davos, but Andrew Ross Sorkin reports in today's New York Times that his 22-page letter is being passed around at the gathering.\n\nIt can't be business as usual amid constant protests, riots, shutdowns and escalating social tensions, Klarman writes. As the post-World War II international order continued to erode, the markets ignored the longer-term implications of a more isolated America, a world increasingly adrift and global leadership up for grabs. … There is no way to know how much debt is too much, but America will inevitably reach an inflection point whereupon a suddenly more skeptical debt market will refuse to continue to lend to us at rates we can afford. By the time such a crisis hits, it will likely be too late to get our house in order.\n\nAD\n\nKlarman used to be the single largest GOP donor in New England, but he's redirected his giving to Democrats because of his distaste for Trump. This post-truth moment is quite dangerous, he writes in the letter to his investors, which include the Harvard and Yale endowments. Imagine an incident that threatens national security. Will Americans see eye to eye on the seriousness of the threat? If our leaders are truth-challenged, will Americans believe the official explanation of the threat and the wisdom of the proposed response? Should they?\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nGET SMART FAST:​​\n\nMany police departments are dropping their body-camera programs, citing their high cost amid budgetary concerns.

But the 49-year-old retired Navy reservist has had some second thoughts. 'What the [expletive] were we thinking?' he asked the other night inside a Walmart here, in an area of blue-collar suburban Detroit that helped deliver the presidency to Trump. … 'It's silly. It's destructive,' Daudert said, adding that all he knows about 2020 is that he won't be supporting Trump. 'I was certainly for the anti-status quo. … I'll be more status quo next time.' …\n\nErica McQueen, a 38-year-old from St. Clair Shores, voted for Trump and also has liked a lot of what he's done. 'But it gets overshadowed by the stunts he pulls,' she said. … 'The wall is getting out of hand,' she said. 'It's too much. It's ridiculous. I'm sick of seeing it, I'm sick of hearing about it.' Like other onetime Trump supporters, she's now openly wondering if she can back him again. 'Something miraculous has to happen,' she said, 'for me to vote for him again.'\n\nJeremiah Wilburn, a 45-year-old engineer who voted for Trump after backing Barack Obama twice, was pleased for most of the past two years thanks to the strong economy. I was doing fine with him up until this government shutdown, he said. It's ridiculous. You're not getting the wall built for $5 billion. And Mexico is not paying for it, we all know that, too. Meanwhile, it's starting to turn people like me away. He worries about the shutdown's effect on the economy. He's concerned about the impact on his brother, who works for the TSA in Florida. You can't expect people to come to work without getting paid, Wilburn said. If I were them, I certainly wouldn't come to work.\n\n-- The government shutdown drew no closer to an end over the holiday weekend, with the House and Senate planning to pursue separate bills that are both expected to die before reaching Trump's desk. Jeff Stein and Erica Werner report: The Senate, led by [Mitch McConnell], will take up a proposal announced by Trump on Saturday to trade temporary protections for young undocumented immigrants and others for $5.7 billion the president is seeking for his border wall. The legislation, released late Monday, would reopen the government through Sept. 30 while funding a variety of other immigration security measures and spending $12.7 billion on hurricane and wildfire disaster relief. But Democrats have rejected the plan, so it appears unlikely to garner the 60 votes necessary to advance.\n\nThe House, led by [Nancy Pelosi], will pass a series of spending bills that would reopen portions of the government that have nothing to do with the wall. The legislation will include some security priorities supported by both parties, including a total of about $1 billion for immigration judges and ports of entry along the border. But the House legislation is dead on arrival in the Senate, where McConnell has made clear he will not advance any spending bills Trump won't sign.\n\nThe bill being voted on in the Senate also contains significant changes to asylum procedures for Central American minors, a fact that came to light only when the legislation was released late Monday night and sparked an angry reaction from immigrant rights activists. The legislation would require these minors to apply for asylum in their home countries, not at the U.S. border, as now occurs, and they would be returned home if they sought to apply for asylum at the U.S. border. It would also put new caps on asylum claims from Central American minors.\n\n-- Republican senators continue to largely support Trump's strategy, partly because of intense pressure from the base. Seung Min Kim and Sean Sullivan report: Under pressure from conservatives to help Trump deliver on a signature campaign promise and unable to persuade him to avert the partial government shutdown, these lawmakers have all but surrendered to the president's will. Their comments show how the cracks in the 53-member Republican majority that emerged at the outset of the shutdown have not spread beyond a handful of lawmakers. Asked about the pressure from constituents and some of the 800,000 affected federal workers to end the impasse, GOP senators insisted they are facing equal — if not more — insistence to stand behind Trump and his call for $5.7 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, especially from conservative voters.\n\n-- Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) said he would consider Trump's proposal, but even if Manchin supports the bill, McConnell would have to pick up another six Democratic votes. From Politico's Marianne Levine: 'He needs to see the final proposal before he decides,' said Jonathan Kott, a spokesperson for Manchin, in an e-mail. Following Trump's announcement Saturday, Manchin tweeted that he was 'hopeful' Trump's proposal would allow Congress to 'immediately reopen gov.' 'I look forward to working w/ my GOP & Dem colleagues to make this happen so that we can end this shameful shutdown,' Manchin said on Twitter.\n\nAs the partial government shutdown continues, more sectors of the economy are beginning to feel the effects. (Joyce Koh/The Washington Post)\n\nFRESH FALLOUT:\n\n-- A record 10 percent of TSA employees did not show up for work yesterday, causing delays at airports across the country. Ashley Halsey III and Michael Laris report: In addition to a 35-minute wait at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and a 45-minute wait at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport (the city hosted a National Football League playoff game Sunday), the 40 busiest airports showed the strain of processing passengers with as many as 1 in 10 workers out. Fourteen airports had checkpoint waiting times of more than 20 minutes, with three of them pushing the maximum TSA acceptable wait time of 30 minutes. In Los Angeles (29 minutes), Tampa (28 minutes) and Chicago (27 minutes), the lines were extensive. … The absentee rate one year ago — Jan. 20, 2018 — was 3.1 percent, the TSA said.\n\n-- The length of the shutdown has stirred fear among Americans who rely on federal aid programs. The AP's Juliet Linderman reports: Millions of poor Americans who depend on food and rental assistance are becoming increasingly worried about the future. Most major aid programs haven't dried up yet. But each day the stalemate in Washington drags on, the U.S. inches closer to what advocates call a looming emergency. Those dependent on the aid are watching closely under a cloud of stress and anxiety. … The impact of any lapse in these programs would be dramatic and unprecedented: The USDA says there has never before been a break in food stamp benefits since the program was made permanent in 1964.\n\n-- Some schools in the D.C. area are hiring furloughed government employees as substitute teachers to help them make ends meet. Morgan Smith reports: Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia has already placed furloughed workers in the classroom as substitutes. … School systems in the District, Maryland and Virginia are hosting workshops and job fairs for furloughed employees, and some schools are planning more. Hundreds of federal workers in the region have attended the events with hopes of securing temporary jobs. On Friday, crowds of furloughed federal employees poured into the auditorium at the Montgomery County Public Schools building in Rockville to attend a school system hiring event for federal workers, who can apply for positions as teachers, substitute teachers, maintenance staff, bus drivers, clerical staff and security staff.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) declared her candidacy on Jan. 21 and became the fourth woman to enter the 2020 presidential race. (Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) entered the Democratic presidential primary, proposing a $3 trillion tax cut for the middle class and a Medicare-for-all system. Jeff Stein reports: Aides said Harris's platform will incorporate Sen. Bernie Sanders's Medicare-for-all health-care proposal, while also pushing enormous tax relief intended to help low-income renters and boost incomes for working-class families. In that combination, Harris appears to be unique. Several other liberal presidential candidates favor Medicare-for-all and new government spending programs. … Harris, by contrast, is expected to run on both a single-payer health program projected to cost more than $30 trillion, as well as tax benefits that would significantly reduce federal revenue. … But some critics on the left, who have begun scrutinizing Harris's record as a prosecutor in California, are likely to question whether cutting tax revenue will make it more difficult to enact the kinds of social programs that have become increasingly popular among the Democratic base.\n\n-- The choreography of the announcement carried abundant symbolism, the New York Times's Astead W. Herndon notes. Ms. Harris entered the race on the holiday of Martin Luther King's Birthday, an overt nod to the historic nature of her candidacy. Her timing was also meant to evoke Shirley Chisholm, the New York congresswoman who became the first woman to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president 47 years ago this week. In addition, Ms. Harris will hold her first campaign event on Friday in South Carolina, where black voters are the dominant force in the Democratic primary, rather than start off by visiting Iowa and New Hampshire, the two predominantly white states that hold their nomination contests first. She will hold a kickoff rally Sunday in Oakland, Calif., her hometown, and a town hall in Iowa later next week.\n\n-- Potential 2020 candidate Joe Biden, becoming the latest Democrat to apologize for past apostasies, expressed regret for quarterbacking the 1994 crime bill that worsened racial disparities in drug sentencing. The New York Times's Herndon and Jonathan Martin report: Mr. Biden said he regretted supporting the tough-on-crime drug legislation of the 1980s and 1990s, expressing remorse in particular over a bill that created different legal standards for powdered cocaine and street crack cocaine. 'It was a big mistake that was made,' Mr. Biden said of the measure, which has been criticized as disproportionately affecting black Americans. 'We were told by the experts that 'crack, you never go back,' that the two were somehow fundamentally different. It's not. But it's trapped an entire generation.' The former senator, who helped write the 1994 crime bill now cited as having led to an era of mass incarceration, went even further, allowing that he 'may not have always gotten things right' in regards to criminal justice.\n\n-- The 2020 Democrats collectively used MLK Day to make their pitches to black voters. Michael Scherer and Annie Linskey report: Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote at an event in Boston, while another contender, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), called on 'white women like me' to bear the burden of fighting racial injustice at a New York event. … Two other potential candidates, Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) sat side by side in the front, middle pew at Zion Baptist Church in Columbia, S.C., for the King holiday prayer service and then spoke at a later event. ...\n\nBefore the mostly black audience at the morning's National Action Network event in Washington, ... [Michael] Bloomberg said he could not argue that 'every decision I have made as mayor was perfect,' though he did not specifically distance himself from the stop-and-frisk policing policy he supported over the objections of civil rights leaders such as Al Sharpton. Instead, he talked about his efforts to improve schools in New York, reduce pollution in black and Hispanic neighborhoods and his leading role in funding groups that advocate for gun regulation. ...\n\nTrump and Vice President Pence briefly visited the King memorial in Washington for a wreath-laying near the statue of the slain civil rights leader. They made no formal remarks. 'Good morning, everybody. Great day. Beautiful day. Thank you for being here. Appreciate it,' the president said before departing.\n\n-- The GOP has reached a deal to create a new fundraising platform the party hopes will compete with ActBlue, which directed $700 million in small-dollar donations to Democrats during the midterms. Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: Following weeks of closed-door discussions, Republicans have agreed to create a new platform dubbed Patriot Pass, which will be used to cultivate and process online donations. The GOP — whose jungle-like ecosystem of vendors has long fought bitterly over contracts and dollars — has struggled in the past to create such a unified system. … After watching dozens of their candidates get massively out-raised [in 2018], Republicans are looking to Patriot Pass to close the gap. The new tool is expected to launch next month.\n\n-- Iowa Democrats are considering major changes to their 2020 caucus in preparation for record turnout. Politico's Natasha Korecki reports: The party is shopping for larger facilities to fit expected overflow crowds, investing in new technology to stave off check-in and head-counting snafus and pushing individual 2020 campaigns to create their own voter registration programs. And to abide by new rules set out by the national party, Iowa Democrats are even studying the possibility of what once would have been unthinkable: 'Tele-caucusing,' which would allow absentee voting by phone or possibly online for any Democrat who couldn't make it on caucus day.\n\nWEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- A new tell-all book about the Trump White House depicts the president's staffers as absolutely out of control while serving an erratic leader easily bored by policy. The book, Team of Vipers, was written by former West Wing communications aide Cliff Sims. Philip Rucker recounts one of Sims's anecdotes about Trump berating former House speaker Paul Ryan: Trump watched on television, increasingly angry as [Ryan] criticized his handling of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville. He held the remote control 'like a pistol' and yelled for an assistant to get the Republican leader on the phone. 'Paul, do you know why Democrats have been kicking your a-- for decades? Because they know a little word called 'loyalty,' ' Trump told Ryan … 'Why can't you be loyal to your president, Paul?' The tormenting continued. Trump recalled Ryan distancing himself from Trump in October 2016, in the days after the 'Access Hollywood' video in which he bragged of fondling women first surfaced in The Washington Post. 'I remember being in Wisconsin and your own people were booing you,' Trump told him, according to [Sims]. 'You were out there dying like a dog, Paul. Like a dog! And what'd I do? I saved your a--.' …\n\nSims depicts Trump as deeply suspicious of his own staff. He recalls a private huddle in which he and Keith Schiller, the president's longtime bodyguard and confidant, helped Trump draw up an enemies list with a Sharpie on White House stationery. 'We're going to get rid of all the snakes, even the bottom-feeders,' Trump told them. White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly told the staff that he viewed his job as serving the 'country first, POTUS second,' which Sims interpreted as potentially hostile to Trump's agenda. Sims recounts that Kelly once confided to him in a moment of exasperation: 'This is the worst [expletive] job I've ever had. People apparently think that I care when they write that I might be fired. If that ever happened, it would be the best day I've had since I walked into this place.' …\n\nAt times, Trump evinced less rage than a lack of interest. Sims recounts one time when Ryan was in the Oval Office explaining the ins and outs of the Republican health-care bill to the president. As Ryan droned on for 15 minutes, Trump sipped on a glass of Diet Coke, peered out at the Rose Garden, stared aimlessly at the walls and, finally, walked out. Ryan kept talking as the president wandered down the hall to his private dining room, where he flicked on his giant flat-screen TV. Apparently, he had had enough of Ryan's talk. It fell to Vice President Pence to retrieve Trump and convince him to return to the Oval Office so they could continue their strategy session. …\n\nPerhaps the book's most cinematic chapter of chaos is 'The Mooch Is Loose,' a reconstruction of Anthony Scaramucci's 11 days as White House communications director. Sims was Scaramucci's right-hand man and describes the flamboyant aide's hunt for 'leakers,' which began with his own staff. Scaramucci assembled the 40-odd media aides and threatened to fire them all, Sims writes, as if he were a 'fire-breathing dragon that had just returned from laying waste to the unsuspecting peasants in the village.' Sims writes that Scaramucci ordered them to reply to anyone in the White House instructing them to leak information to a reporter, including then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, by saying: 'I cannot do that. I only report to Anthony Scaramucci and he reports directly to the president of the United States.' Even Trump was amused. 'Can you believe this guy?' the president told Sims. 'He's completely out of his mind — like, on drugs or something — totally out of his mind. We'll figure it out, but the guy is crazy.'\n\n-- Sims, a Trump loyalist, is not overly critical of Trump, but he doesn't paint a completely flattering portrait of the commander in chief either. The New York Times's Maggie Haberman reports: The book's descriptions of Mr. Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, defy the public perception of their marriage. Mr. Sims paints Mrs. Trump as protective of her husband as it related to his staff. … In another scene, Mr. Sims describes the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, explaining to Mr. Trump that little could be done about a journalist he did not care for when he asked why the person could not be 'suspended.'\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani tried to back off from his comments that negotiations about a potential Trump Tower in Moscow stretched through November 2016. Seung Min Kim reports: In a statement Monday, Giuliani said his comments were purely hypothetical and not based on any conversations with the president. His statement Sunday, made on NBC's 'Meet the Press,' that Trump associates had continued negotiations about the real estate project deep into the 2016 campaign had again raised scrutiny into then-candidate Trump's posture toward Moscow, including his call in July of that year for Russia to hack into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's emails. … [Giuliani said,] 'My comments did not represent the actual timing or circumstances of any such discussions.' He added: 'The point is that the proposal was in the earliest stage and did not advance beyond a free non-binding letter of intent.'\n\n-- Giuliani further muddied the waters by claiming to the New Yorker there was no evidence of the president directing longtime fixer Michael Cohen to lie on tapes to which the ex-mayor has listened. Rudy said the BuzzFeed story containing that allegation was false Because I have been through all the tapes, I have been through all the texts, I have been through all the e-mails, and I knew none existed. Then: I shouldn't have said tapes. They alleged there were texts and e-mails that corroborated that Cohen was saying the President told him to lie. There were no texts, there were no e-mails, and the President never told him to lie. Then: No tapes. Well, I have listened to tapes, but none of them concern this.\n\n-- Several people close to Mr. Trump have grown exasperated with Mr. Giuliani's public appearances, the New York Times's Maggie Haberman reports. They also expressed concern that he is increasing prosecutors' anger with the president and potentially creating a misimpression about the Trump Tower project in Moscow.\n\n-- Before Bob Mueller's office issued a statement casting doubt on the BuzzFeed story, the president's legal team contacted the special counsel requesting a response to the report. The Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus reports: The letter—in which the lawyers said they hoped Mr. Mueller would address the report expeditiously—marked the first time Mr. Trump's legal team has contacted the special counsel to ask the office to address a media report, [one person familiar with the matter] said.\n\n-- Contrary to repeated public statements from the Trump administration and GOP loyalists on Capitol Hill, Oleg Deripaska, the Russian oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin, stands to benefit greatly from the U.S. lifting sanctions on his companies. The New York Times's Kenneth P. Vogel reports: A binding confidential document signed by both sides suggests that the agreement the administration negotiated with the companies controlled by [Deripaska] may have been less punitive than advertised. The deal contains provisions that free him from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt while leaving him and his allies with majority ownership of his most important company, the document shows. … The new information could lend ammunition to criticism that the Trump administration either knowingly let a Kremlin-allied oligarch off easy, or was outmaneuvered by a sophisticated legal and lobbying campaign funded by his companies.\n\n-- Russian pop star Emin Agalarov canceled his U.S. tour amid a dispute about an interview with Mueller's team. CNN's Kara Scannell reports: Agalarov was set to launch a four-city US tour Saturday in New York. Looming over the impending engagement was the prospect of his being on US soil and subject to US law enforcement. Agalarov attorney Scott Balber said talks broke down at the end of last week and the decision to cancel the tour was made Monday. 'It's the only choice we had,' Balber said. 'I've been endeavoring to engage with the special counsel's office as well as various congressional committees and despite our best effort we haven't been able to reach an agreement on the terms.' The special counsel and congressional committees have expressed interest in talking to Agalarov about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which he initiated.\n\n-- An American banker with ties to Putin has attracted congressional investigators' attention for seeking access to Trump's presidential transition team. ABC News's Matthew Mosk, Katherine Faulders and John Santucci report: The banker, Robert Foresman, never got the role he was seeking with the fledgling Trump administration. … Foresman, who is now vice chairman of the Swiss bank UBS's investment arm, lived for years in Moscow, where he led a $3 billion Russian investment fund and was touted by his new company as someone who maintains connections to [Putin's] inner circle. … There has been renewed interest in Foresman in recent weeks, coming as prosecutors in New York have ratcheted up inquiries into the events that occurred during the Trump transition and in the lead up to the Trump inauguration.\n\n-- A lawyer for American Paul Whelan, who is being detained in Moscow on espionage charges, said his client was given a flash drive containing a state secret. But how he got it, what he was supposed to do with it, and whether Whelan knew that he had secret information is unknown, Vladimir Zherebenkov added. Whelan was detained in late December and will remain behind bars through at least the end of February after a Russian court refused to release him on bail. (Amie Ferris-Rotman)\n\n-- Michael Cohen threatened to sue CNBC in 2014 over Trump's low ranking in the news channel's list of the country's top business leaders. The Wall Street Journal's Joe Palazzolo, Michael Siconolfi and Michael Rothfeld report: Mr. Trump didn't crack the top 100 in the CNBC rankings, which were decided by a panel of experts appointed by the business channel to curate the list. As part of the process, CNBC held an online poll meant to guide the expert panel as it pared a list of 200 contenders down to 25. Mr. Trump had canvassed for votes on Twitter while Mr. Cohen, then his special counsel at the Trump Organization, enlisted a small technology company to use computer code to cheat the polls by repeatedly voting for Mr. Trump.\n\nThe Islamic State began a program in 2014 to make chemical weapons using both chlorine and a World War I-era toxin known as sulfur mustard. (The Washington Post)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- An Iraqi scientist who is imprisoned in Irbil described the aid he provided to the Islamic State in producing chemical weapons. Joby Warrick reports: Suleiman al-Afari, who is 52 now and on death row, recounted his recruitment and life under the Islamic State in a rare interview inside the fortresslike headquarters of the Kurdistan Regional Government's Counterterrorism Department. An affable, neatly groomed man, Afari is among the few known participants in the Islamic State's chemical weapons program to be captured alive. He described in matter-of-fact detail the terrorist group's successful attempts to make sulfur mustard — a first-generation chemical weapon that inflicted tens of thousands of casualties during World War I — as part of an ambitious, little-understood effort to create novel weapons and delivery systems to defend the Islamic State's territory and terrorize its opponents. His account was confirmed and augmented by U.S. and Kurdish officials who participated in missions to destroy the Islamic State's weapons plants and to kill or capture its senior leaders.\n\nThe stories shed new light on a chemical weapons project that was unique in the history of modern terrorist groups, with university laboratories and manufacturing facilities and a cadre of scientists and technicians. Weapons created by the Islamic State were used in scores of attacks on soldiers and civilians in Iraq and Syria, collectively inflicting hundreds of casualties, U.S. and Iraqi officials say.\n\n-- U.S. spies have been secretly meeting with their North Korean counterparts for a decade, according to the Wall Street Journal's Michael R. Gordon and Warren P. Strobel. The secret channel between the [CIA] and spies from America's bitter adversary included two missions to Pyongyang in 2012 during the Obama administration by Michael Morell, then deputy CIA director, and at least one by his successor, Avril Haines, say current and former U.S. officials. The channel appears to have gone dormant late in the Obama administration. Mike Pompeo re-energized it while CIA director, sending an agency officer to meet with North Korean counterparts in Singapore in August 2017. By early 2018, a whirlwind of secret and public talks were underway, which brought together Messrs. Trump and Kim in a pomp-filled Singapore meeting in June. The intelligence channel played a role. The two sides are preparing for a second summit in late February.\n\n-- A think tank report identified another secret North Korean missile base days after the White House announced plans for a second summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un. Lena H. Sun reports: The report, released Monday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the base is one of approximately 20 undeclared missile operating bases, part of Pyongyang's ongoing ballistic missile program. Researchers at the center's Beyond Parallel project said the latest report provides more evidence that North Korea is not dismantling its weapons facilities. 'While diplomacy is critical, and should be the primary way to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem, any future agreement must take account of all of the operational missile base facilities that are a threat to U.S. and South Korean security,' the report said.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nDeripaska, the Russian oligarch accused of election interference who just got sanctions relief from the Trump administration, is staying away from Davos this year, per a Post correspondent in Moscow:\n\nKamala Harris's communications director tweeted a photo of the newly announced presidential candidate:\n\nHarris's press secretary added this:\n\nHarris's deputy press secretary emphasized her common points of background with her boss:\n\nA PBS NewsHour reporter analyzed the specifics of Harris's announcement:\n\nA CNN reporter remarked on the number of women already running for president:\n\nThe communications director of C-SPAN remembered another black woman who sought the Democratic nomination:\n\nAn NBC News reporter shared this photo of a Democratic senator and 2020 contender meeting with a former gubernatorial candidate:\n\nBooker responded to a Twitter user who asked about his 2020 plans:\n\nA New York Times reporter noted what a difference three years make:\n\nAn Atlantic writer observed that 2020 candidates composed MLK tweets reflecting their campaign priorities:\n\nThe president and the vice president visited the MLK memorial:\n\nRep.

Caro: I am constantly being asked why it takes me so long to finish my books. Well, it's the research that takes the time—the research and whatever it is in me that makes the research take so very much longer than I had planned. I'm currently working on the fifth and final book in 'The Years of Lyndon Johnson,' about the nineteen-sixties. I am also planning to write a full-scale memoir, describing in some detail my experiences in researching and writing my books about Robert Moses and Lyndon Johnson—my experiences in learning about these two men and their methods of acquiring and using power—and also the efforts that were made to keep me from learning about these men and their methods.\n\nWhich leads to a final question: Why am I publishing these random recollections toward a memoir while I'm still working on the last volume of the Johnson biography, when I haven't finished it, while I'm still—at the age of eighty-three—several years from finishing it? Why don't I just include this material in the longer, full-length memoir I'm hoping to write? The answer is, I'm afraid, quite obvious, and, if I forget it for a few days, I am frequently reminded of it, by journalists who, in writing about me and my hope of finishing, often express their doubts in a sarcastic phrase: 'Do the math.' Well, I can do that math. I am well aware that I may never get to write the memoir, although I have so many thoughts about writing, so many anecdotes about research, that I would like to preserve for anyone interested enough to read them. I decided that, just in case, I'd put some of them down on paper now.\n\n-- Chicago Tribune, It started when he couldn't grasp a pen. Diagnosed with ALS at 37, former Obama staffer hopes to use campaign skills to raise funds for a cure, by Alison Bowen: Brian Wallach and his wife, Sandra Abrevaya, are poised to launch a group they hope will fund research, and finally find a cure, for a disease many know by its acronym but not by the faces and experiences of those enduring it. On Tuesday the Kenilworth couple, both 38, will launch I Am ALS, an effort born out of months of researching not only what might help Wallach, but also trying to understand why such a devastating disease is less funded and less understood than others. They hope to put some of the skills they honed in the Obama White House — listening, organizing, fundraising — toward this new challenge.\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT: Colorado lawmaker Lori Saine claims blacks, whites were lynched in 'nearly equal numbers' for being Republican following Reconstruction, from the Denver Post: A Colorado representative from Weld County claimed blacks and white Republicans were lynched in 'nearly equal' numbers following Reconstruction and chastised the main sponsors of a resolution honoring Martin Luther King Jr. Day during a speech on the House floor Friday. 'We have come a long way on that arc since the Reconstruction, since whites and blacks alike were in nearly equal numbers lynched for the crime of being Republican,' Rep. Lori Saine, R-Firestone, said. She then went on to allege that a fellow lawmaker was told her skin color was the reason she couldn't introduce a resolution honoring King. HOT ON THE RIGHT: Notre Dame to cover up Christopher Columbus murals, from the AP: The University of Notre Dame will cover murals in a campus building that depict Christopher Columbus in America, the school's president said, following criticism that the images depict Native Americans in stereotypical submissive poses before white European explorers. The 12 murals created in the 1880s by Luis Gregori were intended to encourage immigrants who had come to the U.S. during a period of anti-Catholic sentiment. But they conceal another side of Columbus: the exploitation and repression of Native Americans, said the Rev. John Jenkins, president of Notre Dame. It is a 'darker side of this story, a side we must acknowledge,' Jenkins said in a letter Sunday.\n\nDAYBOOK:\n\nTrump will receive his intelligence briefing and have lunch with Pence.

The bill still needs the House's approval, but it is expected to pass there. … The minimum-wage measure, sponsored by four Democrats, died in a 19-to-21 vote, with every Democrat in favor and every Republican opposed.

No further details were immediately available.\n\nChristine Maria Kaufmann was born in Lengdorf, Austria, on Jan. 11, 1945, to a German father and French mother.\n\nShe made her acting debut in 1952 and appeared in European films, including the Italian-made sword-and-sandal drama The Last Days of Pompeii (1959) opposite Steve Reeves. Her best-known film was Town Without Pity (1961), as a sexually precocious German girl raped by American soldiers occupying her town. Kirk Douglas portrayed the Army defense attorney.\n\nA New York Times reviewer wrote that Christine Kaufmann, as the ill-fated, ruined girl in the case, who is found to be less than the perfect child her parents imagine her to be, contributes a beautifully shaded stint in a role calling for nuances of feeling and delivery.\n\nFrom left: Actress Allegra Curtis, her son Raphael and her mother, actress Christine Kaufmann, in 2010. (Uwe Anspach/European Pressphoto Agency)\n\nMs. Kaufmann won a Golden Globe for most promising female newcomer. She appeared in several other English-language films, including Taras Bulba (1962) and Wild and Wonderful (1964), both opposite Curtis.\n\nCurtis left his wife, Janet Leigh, to marry the Austrian-born starlet in 1963, despite an age gap of 20 years. They had two daughters, Alexandra and Allegra, before divorcing in 1968. That same year, Curtis wed 23-year-old model Leslie Allen. It did not last.\n\nAfter her marriage to Curtis, Ms. Kaufmann resumed a long career in television and film in Europe and also wrote health and beauty books. She married three more times. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.
Food flash: The James Beard award winner plans to close the fine-dining restaurant at the end of June and reopen it as something even more luxe in October. His ultimate goal is nothing less than a world-class Italian restaurant. If his previous work around the city (Del Mar, Fiola Mare, several branches of Sfoglina) is any indication, Washington can look forward to just that next fall. Well, that and some bug eyes and clogged arteries, but I'm getting ahead of the story.\n\nTrabocchi isn't waiting until the last minute to make changes. Last summer, he pulled the plug on lunch service, and already, he has assembled a team of talents, including executive chef Josh Kaplan and head sommelier Jennifer Foucher, to prepare for the next iteration of Fiola. I returned recently to take a pulse check and was pleased to find multiple ways to use the dining destination. The current Fiola lets you order from an a la carte menu in a supposedly casual Ezio Room to the left of the entrance. Customers seated in the main dining room, where pools of space surround the tables and a wall of stone is punctuated by windows into the kitchen, can build their own four- or five-course dinners from a range of dishes or leave the decisions in the hands of the kitchen via tasting menus that can run to seven courses.\n\nIf you've been to any of his establishments, you know Trabocchi has a problem with restraint. In his world, more always trumps less, and what you think you're getting — even in the Ezio Room, designed for folks who prefer a few plates to a three-hour meal — always adds up to something greater when the extras are factored in. Dinner opens with a gratis snack from the kitchen (maybe chicken broth poured over a delicate cup of mushrooms, including last-of-season truffle) and a trio of house-baked breads; even if you decline dessert, three sweets show up, trailed by a little to-go bag with bite-size cookies, caramels and other confections. I realize some people love that sense of generosity, and who am I to ask a chef to cut back?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUltimately, diners have to decide what strategy suits them best. Here are two ways to experience Italian bounty.\n\nDinner in the Ezio Room\n\nThe scent and the taste of just a few tablespoons of broth — that welcome from the chef — transport us to a distant forest. In reality, we're ensconced in a small venue near the bar, dressed with white chairs, curtains the color of honey and a chandelier composed of dozens of clear glass globes. (Ezio is Trabocchi's middle name.)\n\nA highlight reel from the dinner that follows: Italian culatello, the king of prosciuttos, carved into crimson slices, coaxed into ruffles and accompanied by tigelle, a ringer for an English muffin; a snow-white ball of soft burrata, glossed with olive oil, speckled with spicy long pepper and set into a nest of thread-thin fried leeks; and dense and delicious duck breast, its surface crackling with ground coriander, star anise and other warm spices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe wonderful advantage to deciding my own number of courses is the ease with which I can remember and appreciate the thought that went into them — the gold leaf winking from the burrata's nest, for instance, and the sumptuous complexity of the duck. The latter is flanked with poached quince and seared foie gras; gaps in the plate are filled with a regal sauce cooked up from confit, cognac and red wine.\n\nPerfectly sated, we decline dessert. Unable to take no for an answer, the pastry kitchen sends out small almond financiers, chocolate bonbons wrapped in gold foil, and blood orange fruit jellies. We sigh, smile — and somehow make the sweets vanish.\n\nDinner in the Main Dining Room\n\nA confession. I don't eat the way I used to, even a few years ago. One or two courses and a few bites of meat go a long way these days, and I'm more inclined than ever to fill up on fish and vegetables. But criticism is about transcending personal taste, and Fiola is one of the most indulgent restaurants in town. Throwing caution — plus my better judgment and a fitness resolution — to the wind, I sprang for the ultimate dining experience at Fiola. Let's call it the Five Stages of Dining.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnticipation. Trabocchi seldom shows his hand ahead of time. When he labels something a Grand Tasting Menu, you know it's a sign to buckle up and embrace the spectacle to come. Sure enough, the first course — a single briny Shigoku oyster topped with minced wagyu beef tartare and a black carpet of caviar — makes a diner wonder how the kitchen might top itself. Delivered in a raised cup of crushed ice, the cool marriage of sea and turf is no more than a tablespoon or so of food, but everything about it is clean, pure, indulgent. No less than champagne will do as a chaser. Vying for your attention nearby are spongy rosemary focaccia, soft country wheat and a pull-apart roll lit with cracked pepper and laced with grated cheese. The butter is French. The olive oil is from south of Sicily, with a fragrance that mimics sun-kissed green tomatoes. Of course you try them all. Of course you'll later regret it.\n\nDelight. Lightly seared foie gras tastes like a new luxury when it's sliced as thin as paper and staged with three kinds of apple (poached, pickled, caramelized) and a sauce that resonates with charred lemon, duck jus and fried capers. A fragile pinwheel of fried bread escorts the second course of the night. One bite is not enough. And how good to see Trabocchi's signature lobster ravioli make an appearance. I look up to see a fleet of servers, eagle-eyed as Secret Service agents, attending to diners' needs. The pamperers include Foucher, recruited from the acclaimed Del Posto in New York. It's tricky with lobster, she says. You'd think burgundy with seafood, but then there's ginger in the seasoning. Her response is to pour a bright rosé from Campania.\n\nConcern. The lobster is plump and sweetly fresh, but I detect only a whisper of ginger; the dumpling, thicker than I remember it, proves rich but blandly so. And the following branzino is far from the light interlude you might anticipate, given a base of shredded leeks cooked in butter and an add-on of oysters in a froth of zabaglione and prosecco. Neat touch: a shock of red on the plate, an emulsion coaxed from red king prawns and butter. Delicious? Yes. But also stuffing at this point. Every course seems to be borne on multiple beautiful plates, and the stemware is so light, you worry about crushing the wine glasses with just your fingers. I'm thinking one of the hardest jobs at Fiola is washing dishes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFatigue. A block of flesh? Now? Veal Rossini garnished with earthy black truffles looks straight out of a medieval banquet. I feel my arteries hardening as I lift the meat to my lips and (try to) savor the work that has been lavished on this fifth dish, set on a verdant ring of lettuce puree thickened with herbs and cream. Frankly, I'm half-tempted to raise my napkin and signal surrender. Instead, I place my knife and fork in the done position (talk about an understatement!) and pretend to be excited for the incoming cheese course. It turns out to be a fabulous knob of Piemontese goat cheese alongside an amber nugget of honeycomb, fragrant as an orange grove. No need to pretend, then.\n\nAcceptance. Did you think that was The End? Ha! We like drama here, a server tells us as she pours liquid nitrogen around an intermezzo: a sparkling granita flavored with yuzu and fennel and framed for a few seconds in fog. Momentarily, I'm roused from my stupor, a sensation that lasts only until the first of multiple desserts arrives. Ten-year-old rum is splashed over a lovely layering of cake, apple confit and chantilly balls flavored with caramel and chocolate. Hell suddenly feels like heaven, thanks to pastry chef Claudia Barrovecchio, who's also responsible for Fiola's divine breads. Our eyes pop as the table is covered with fanciful little sweets with the grace of a jeweler showing off gems. Alas, every bit of stomach space is filled to capacity. We ask for the finery to go. A ball of foie gras ganache rolled in chocolate makes for a heady breakfast of champions the next day.\n\nI'm compelled to ask Trabocchi: Has he ever eaten the whole $220 enchilada, so to speak? He pauses. Then he laughs. Once, he says. The chef knows where I'm going with the question. He blames the largesse of the seven-course spread on his Italian DNA. We can't help ourselves, he says. Overfeeding people is his homeland's way of expressing generosity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI get it, I get it, Fabio. But I can't be the only diner who would love to see in the future Fiola more vegetables and a lighter, tighter approach here and there. Already, his team's cooking is great in small doses. Some trims might lead to better concentration — more gratefulness — in the dining room. Having done both this season, I'd much rather float out than roll out.\n\nFor stories, features such as Date Lab, Gene Weingarten and more, visit WP Magazine.\n\nFollow the Magazine on Twitter.\n\nLike us on Facebook.\n\nEmail us at wpmagazine@washpost.com.
It's rush hour on a November evening in Washington's busiest regional rail hub, but swarming commuters must yield to a much more potent tide. The Federalist Society has taken over the Main Hall of Union Station for its annual black-tie gala. The stone walls of the vast, vaulted concourse are bathed in pale red and blue, while larger-than-life white spotlight cameo silhouettes of James Madison's head — the society's trademark — crown the columns and glow on video screens. Two hundred and twenty sold-out tables, each set for 10, await the throng funneling through a block-long tent, where $200-a-plate tickets are checked; inside, exclamations of celebration and reunion echo and blend into a deafening roar.\n\nListen to this and other great stories from The Washington Post Magazine on the Curio app.\n\nEven when the crowd simmers down, it's so hard to hear in the cavernous hall that the words of retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah — who is receiving an award — are mostly lost to history. Whatever he's saying, I'm sure it's good, says Lew Olowski, who, like me, has crept closer to try to hear. He was a human rights activist studying at Georgetown Law a decade ago when, he tells me, joining the Federalist Society expanded his mind to see both sides of issues. Now he's general counsel for an organization helping poor pregnant women get a leg up and, not incidentally, keep their babies. His ears prick up at isolated morsels of Hatch's talk: … religious freedom … administrative state. … See what I mean? Olowski says. Music to my ears.\n\n(Illustrations by Sam Spratt for The Washington Post)\n\nThere is much for this crowd to celebrate. The conservative and libertarian society for law and public policy studies has reached an unprecedented peak of power and influence. Brett Kavanaugh, whose membership in the society dates to his Yale Law School days, has just been elevated to the Supreme Court; he is the second of President Trump's appointees, following Neil Gorsuch, another justice closely associated with the society. They join Justice Clarence Thomas (who said last spring he's been a part of the Federalist Society now since meeting with them … in the 1980s), Chief Justice John Roberts (listed as a member in 1997-98) and Justice Samuel Alito (a periodic speaker at society events). The newly solidified conservative majority on the court will inevitably decide more cases in line with the society's ideals — which include checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning. In practice, this could mean fewer regulations of the environment and health care, more businesses allowed to refuse service to customers on religious grounds, and denial of protections claimed by newly vocal classes of minorities, such as transgender people.\n\nThis illustration is based on Howard Chandler Christy's 1940 painting, Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States, with contemporary players on both sides of the judicial contest. 1. Stephen Breyer, 2. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 3. Sonia Sotomayor, 4. Elena Kagan, 5. Chuck Schumer, 6. Kamala Harris, 7. Leonard Leo, 8. Vice President Pence, 9. Orrin Hatch, 10. Chuck Grassley, 11. John Roberts, 12. Susan Collins, 13. Lindsey Graham, 14. Mitch McConnell, 15. President Trump, 16. Samuel Alito, 17. Neil Gorsuch, 18. Clarence Thomas and 19. Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nBut having allies on the highest court of the land is just the top layer of the Federalist Society's expanding sway. For one thing, there is the judicial nomination process itself. When Trump was campaigning in 2016, he made the shrewd and un­or­tho­dox move of publicizing a list of 11 conservative legal stars that he promised to draw from if he got a chance to pick a Supreme Court justice. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, played a key role in suggesting the names, along with Trump's future White House counsel, Don McGahn (also a society member), and the conservative Heritage Foundation. The list was expanded twice to include Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and others. Leo took a leave from his job at the Federalist Society to advise the White House on the confirmation process for Gorsuch and Kavanaugh — reprising a role he played for the George W. Bush White House in putting Roberts and Alito on the court.\n\nThe next most important segment of the judiciary — the federal appeals courts — is also filling up with Federalist Society members: Twenty-five of the 30 appeals court judges Trump has appointed are or were members of the society. Our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the president has outsourced his selection of judges, McGahn quipped to a Federalist Society gathering in 2017. That is completely false. I've been a member of the Federalist Society since law school. Still am. So, frankly, it seems like it's been in-sourced.\n\nKavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito and Thomas are all at the banquet — a record turnout of Supreme Court justices for the annual affair. There's also a trio of Trump's once and future Justice Department leaders: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (alumnus of the Federalist Society's Harvard Law School chapter), recently fired attorney general Jeff Sessions (frequent society speaker) and acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker (recommended by Leonard Leo to be Sessions's chief of staff). It's as if the players in the recent melodramas surrounding the Justice Department are minor actors compared with the Federalist Society itself — which provides the enduring climate within which storms on the right come and go.\n\nTo close the gala, McGahn and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell settle in armchairs below the giant Madison heads for an onstage tete-a-tete, during which they all but spike the football over the current pace of appointing conservatives to all levels of the federal judiciary — the judges project, as McConnell calls it. At the appeals court level, in particular, Trump has made more appointments than all other presidents at the same point in their presidencies, according to research by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. (At the district court level, however, Trump's pace lags behind that of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.) My goal … is to do everything we can for as long as we can to transform the federal judiciary, because everything else we do is transitory, McConnell says. The closest thing we will ever have an opportunity to do to have the longest impact on the country is confirming these great men and women and transforming the judiciary for as long into the future as we can. McConnell notes that the judges list played a big part in getting Trump elected. The majority leader looks out over the gathering almost mistily as he concludes: I hope you are proud of what we've done.\n\nAs pumped as anyone is Olowski, watching with me from the side. But to understand what the Federalist Society has achieved and where it's headed, he advises me to look beyond the scorecard of confirmed judges — and to instead consider the intellectual sparring and professional grooming going on at Federalist Society chapters and forums across the land.\n\nThis advice resonates with what I had been picking up over a couple of weeks of conversations with people in and around the organization: Much of the Federalist Society's influence comes not from its very public Washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level. And so, a glimpse of the impact yet to come could be had at far tables fanning out to the corners of Union Station where the sound is bad — the law students and professors from Houston, Boston and Los Angeles; the young lawyers at the dawn of long careers scarfing fancy food at tables underwritten by their firms. Let the politicians build the coalitions to confirm conservative judges and roll back the administrative state, Olowski says. That's not the Federalist Society's job. The Federalist Society's job is to put these ideas out there. And of course, as James Madison could tell us, ideas tend to outlive presidents, political majorities and even judges.\n\nWorking with President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the goal is to transform the federal judiciary.\n\nThe original ambition was not so grand. A handful of conservative law students at the University of Chicago, Yale and Harvard in the early 1980s wanted an outlet for their maverick notions of the law amid the liberal domination of the legal academy. When we started the Federalist Society, we didn't know we were starting the Federalist Society, Lee Liberman Otis, one of the Chicago co-founders, told me. We thought we were starting groups at each of our law schools. … 'Let's start something where we could talk about those ideas.' \n\nThe students announced a national symposium to be held at Yale in the spring of 1982. Word spread ahead of the conference, and so many letters came from students at other schools asking how to start a chapter that Otis says she and another co-founder quickly drafted a guide. Daniel Kelly was a senior at the College of the Holy Cross and applying to law school when he heard about it. Thrilled at the prospect, he and some friends drove 100 miles from Worcester, Mass., to New Haven, Conn., and slept on the floor of a friend's Yale dorm. They were saying something that seemed completely plain sense and true to us, Kelly recalls, which is when you look at the Constitution, you should look at the way the framers wrote it and interpret it as best you can based upon the intention of the framers. Kelly is now head of the Federalist Society lawyers chapter in Boston, where, in late October, Sessions gave one of his last speeches as attorney general.\n\nSpeakers at that first symposium included future justice Antonin Scalia, who was then a law professor at the University of Chicago and a mentor to the campus Federalist Society chapter. Choosing as his topic The Two Faces of Federalism, Scalia presumed that his audience was on a mission to influence national policy, and so he told the gathering: I urge you, then — as Hamilton would have urged you — to keep in mind that the federal government is not bad but good. The trick is to use it wisely.\n\nMuch of the Federalist Society's influence comes not from its very public Washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level.\n\nAnother speaker was future solicitor general Ted Olson, who was then an assistant attorney general in the office of legal counsel. I didn't have any idea how far it would go or what it would become, Olson told me, but I did feel at the time … this is something interesting happening here. In his address to that first symposium, he said: I sense that we are at one of those points in history where the pendulum may be beginning to swing in another direction. Of course, we do not know now, and no one will really know until many years from now, whether the 1980 elections have wrought a significant and long-lasting change. But I think that there is an opportunity here; and the organization of this society and this symposium is a cause for optimism and a sign that perhaps something is happening.\n\nFrom there, the story of the Federalist Society's influence became the story of approximately 70,000 random epiphanies. That's roughly the number of active participants in the society today, according to its leadership. My admittedly unscientific sample of a dozen Federalists' personal stories — backed up by political scientists' more systematic research into the question — suggests that each individual Federalist is akin to an excited synapse in a sprawling hive mind with no one actually in charge.\n\nI have a very distinctive beginning story, Randy Barnett told me over eggs at a diner in Logan Circle a few days before the society's annual national convention in November. There was no Federalist Society when I was a law student, so I didn't know anything about it. I heard about it, and my impression of it was it was going to be a very right-wing organization, and I'm a libertarian — I'm not a conservative.\n\nToday, Barnett is a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown and an influential voice in the legal wars over the Affordable Care Act, medical marijuana and the like. But his first encounter with the Federalist Society came in 1986, two academic postings ago, when he was a relatively junior professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. A student invited him to speak on a panel at one of the early Federalist Society national student symposiums. Barnett was reluctant because he thought his perspective would be unwelcome, and anyway, he taught contracts, not the Constitution. But he was ambitious enough to want to rub shoulders with the legal celebrities who would also be invited. So he said yes.\n\nHe was on a panel about freedom of association. Most people consider it a hallowed right — yet it is one that is not mentioned in the Constitution. Some legal theorists fret over assorted rights being smuggled into the Constitution by activist judges. On the panel, Barnett knew he was seated beside a conservative advocate of judicial restraint. And so, Barnett told me, I said at the end of my little talk, 'I know what you're thinking: What gives lifetime-appointed judges the power to protect a right that isn't actually mentioned in the text of the Constitution?'  He recalled that he paused dramatically. And then, as I had prepared, my next thing was to read the text of the Ninth Amendment, which says the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. And when I said that, this huge roar [of approval] came up from the audience.\n\nBarnett realized he had misread the Federalist Society. Despite his initial impression of a closed conservative sect, the society seemed open to testing a diversity of ideas — and speaking on that panel changed his professional life. He switched from contracts to constitutional law. He made himself an expert on the Ninth Amendment, which got him involved in a case seeking to protect people from federal prosecution for using medical marijuana in California, where the state had legalized it. The case ended up relying not on the Ninth Amendment, but on the commerce clause — a strict reading of which is a favorite Federalist tool for curbing federal power. Barnett argued the matter before the Supreme Court in 2004. He lost — but in the process he developed some subtle jujitsu moves with the commerce clause.\n\nFederal appeals court appointments President Trump has appointed more judges to the federal appeals courts than all other presidents at equivalent points in their presidencies.\n\n\n\n30 Donald J. Trump\n\n12 Barack Obama\n\n16 George W. Bush\n\n19 Bill Clinton\n\n22 George H.W. Bush\n\n19 Ronald Reagan\n\n\n\nFigures provided by Russell Wheeler, visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nAnd that is how he had an arsenal of commerce-based arguments ready when the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. By then Barnett was a leading voice of the growing libertarian wing of the Federalist Society, and he became one of the architects of constitutional claims at the core of lawsuits against the health-care plan. His participation in the legal assault on Obamacare was hatched at — where else? — the Federalist Society's national convention in the fall of 2009, where, in the hallway of the Mayflower Hotel between sessions, he happened to bump into a clutch of fellow Federalists discussing the health-care legislation. (Josh Blackman, a popular Federalist social media force and a professor at the South Texas College of Law, documented the moment in his 2013 book, Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare.) Barnett told me how one person in the group says, 'You want to do something about this?' I said, 'Sure.' … And he said, 'Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast because it's going to come out of committee very soon.' \n\nA few weeks later, Barnett and co-authors Nathaniel Stewart and Todd Gaziano issued a 16-page legal memorandum via the Heritage Foundation that outlined a constitutional case against the health-care measure. According to Blackman, the paper became a source of talking points during congressional debate and laid the framework for subsequent court challenges; Barnett represented one of the plaintiffs.\n\nUltimately, of course, to the distress of most Federalists, the Supreme Court upheld the law in 2012. Yet to Barnett and others, it was still a victory for future deployments of the commerce clause argument against federal overreach, because a majority of the court agreed with the commerce-based critique. Instead, in his opinion upholding the measure, Chief Justice Roberts found other grounds to support the law.\n\nThis is how the Federalist Society influences things, Barnett told me. It's not the dark-money cabal. … By having free and fair discussion, it involves people, gets them interested, and they oftentimes will do something about that.\n\nSurfacing judicial candidates to be appointed when conservatives are in power is just one byproduct of the society's work — and maybe not the most important one.\n\nBarnett's experience is a typical example of how different the society is from the stereotype of a traditional top-down Washington pressure group. The society itself lobbies for no policies; it never signs amicus briefs or represents clients in cases. No one at Federalist Society headquarters in Washington dictated Barnett's moves or told him how to advocate for what positions. It's just that at a few gatherings made possible by the Federalist Society that Barnett happened to attend, synapses fired, a corner of the hive mind engaged, and Barnett took it from there. Multiply that chemistry tens of thousands of times over the past 36 years and you have the Federalist Society's true source of power.\n\nIt's a remarkably successful example of what political scientists call a political epistemic community — an interconnected network of experts with policy-relevant knowledge who share certain beliefs and work to actively transmit and translate those beliefs into policy, as Amanda Hollis-Brusky argued in her 2015 book, Ideas With Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution. Hollis-Brusky documented the impact of such a community: Focusing on key recent Supreme Court decisions on hot-button issues such as campaign finance, gun control and state sovereignty, she found that as many as two dozen people with Federalist Society connections played some role in crafting the arguments, arguing the cases, clerking for the judges or issuing the rulings.\n\nThat community now includes more than 200 student chapters at law schools, where Federalists are a minority presence, but a significant one. The Georgetown chapter has more than 100 members out of about 2,000 in the law school. The Federalist Society is one of our most active student organizations, law school Dean of Students Mitch Bailin told the society's national student symposium on campus in March. Of particular impact and importance to me, they regularly, happily, engagedly partner with our student organizations across the viewpoint spectrum to ensure the widest range of ideas are explored on the issues of the most urgent consequence.\n\nFederal district court appointments Despite President Trump's record pace of appeals court appointments, at the federal district court level he lags behind some recent presidents at the same point in their administrations.\n\n\n\n53 Donald J. Trump\n\n39 Barack Obama\n\n83 George W. Bush\n\n107 Bill Clinton\n\n48 George H.W. Bush\n\n67 Ronald Reagan\n\n\n\nFigures provided by Russell Wheeler, visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\n\nOnce students graduate, they can pick from more than 90 lawyers chapters around the country. Kaytlin Roholt graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 2014, clerked for two federal judges, served as a special counsel to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley during the Gorsuch nomination, and now practices at Jones Day and is a member of the steering committee of the Federalist Society's D.C. chapter for young lawyers. Regardless of where I am, I know that a Federalist Society event is a place where I can go to sort of stay current in the legal issues, to continue learning while practicing, she told me. What we really try to do on the young lawyers chapter is create spaces for people to engage with these issues that they wouldn't really be able to do during their day-to-day life as a lawyer. Panel organizers try to include advocates of liberal perspectives so ideas get a good workout. Together, the student and lawyers chapters put on about 1,500 programs a year.\n\nMany individual Federalists are political and ideological warriors, though never in the name of the Federalist Society. Rather, society events provide the proving ground where they hone their arguments, seize a chance to shine and come to the attention of mentors higher up in the political-legal hierarchy. In that sense, the Federalist Society is a talent network and placement agency as well.\n\nWhile the Federalist Society may never take an official position on anything, conservative funders know who their friends are. Ever since the founding symposium at Yale in 1982 was bankrolled largely by conservative organizations, the society has enjoyed steady financial support from the right. The group raised $20 million in 2017; more than $300,000 came from interests related to conservative activist funders Charles and David Koch.\n\nMost of the money went toward supporting the chapter programs and staging conferences — in other words, tending to the network and the idea factory. What makes Leonard Leo so consequential is not because he's so smart or whatever, it's that he's sitting at the center of an enormous network, says Steven Teles, author of The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement: The Battle for Control of the Law and a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. He has lots of information, and that information isn't just his; it's that those things bubble up through those relationships … spreading through all these people who know each other, and they develop reputations and linkages, which then have lots of other consequences.\n\nSurfacing promising judicial candidates who can be nominated when conservatives have electoral power is just one byproduct of the network, and on its own maybe not the most important one, Teles explains. There's a supply-and-demand relationship between the judges and the network. The judges need scholarship and arguments extending Federalist principles into new areas. Where new legal theories depart from the status quo, they need them to be vetted and legitimized through public debate. They require targeted cases raising questions that provide an opening to move the law. Without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, Teles says, you're not going to maximize what you got through the electoral process.\n\nI met Leo at the Federalist Society's offices in Washington. Despite the fact that in his personal capacity while on leave from the society he put so much effort into advising the Trump administration on judges, he endorses the network theory of the society, telling me, It's less about who gets what job and more about building a community that can be self-perpetuating and self-sustaining and self-driving.\n\nThe Federalist Society's Leonard Leo, having helped create a list of Supreme Court candidates, is one of Trump's judge whisperers.\n\nLiberal legal advocates and scholars realized they were in a serious battle for the law with the Federalist Society after the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore in 2000, handing the White House to George W. Bush. Peter Rubin, then a professor at Georgetown, founded the American Constitution Society to win hearts and minds of students, lawyers and judges.\n\nPeter, among others, saw Bush v. Gore and recognized that we'd been snookered, Caroline Fredrickson, president of the ACS, told me. The left had been sleeping on its laurels, still living in the Warren Court and all of the sudden we were going to have the Roberts Court. And so the idea was to found an organization that would help organize progressive lawyers to protect the core fundamental values that we see in the Constitution.\n\nImitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and a measure of how much the Federalist Society had already shifted frames of reference was the liberal response. ACS was very explicitly founded to do the same kind of work that the Federalist Society has done, Fredrickson says. We, too, have chapters across the country. … We also organize events. We have a group of scholars and experts who work with us on efforts to explain the Constitution and our laws to the broader public. But the ACS still lacks the reach of the Federalist Society, as measured in chapters and budgets. Fredrickson attributes the gap to legal institutions and opportunities on the left being more diffuse than on the right. Also: They do get a lot more corporate support than we do because it's in the interest of the corporations, she says. They want to get rid of regulations.\n\nThe traditional liberal response to the Federalist Society has included pointing out how suspiciously convenient it is that the jurisprudence advocated by society members so often yields conservative results. The conservatives reverse-engineered their preferred methodologies of interpreting the Constitution and legal statutes to reach the ends they want, goes this line of attack. Those methodologies are known as originalism and textualism because they are said to be founded in a search for the original meaning of the Constitution and the literal texts of legal statutes.\n\nBut more recently another liberal position has emerged, and it shows what the Federalists have achieved. This position might be summed up as: If you can't beat them, join them — methodologically, at least. A number of liberal scholars have applied themselves to the task of showing how, in fact, originalist approaches can yield progressive results. As this train of thought has flowed out of the academy, liberal originalist logic is, more and more, showing up in legal briefs and even in Supreme Court dissents. Advocates of all stripes know they must be ready with textualist arguments because, thanks in large part to the work of the Federalists, it's more likely than ever that the judge deciding a case will want to hear that perspective.\n\nFor too long progressives were ceding that constitutional ground to the right and organizations like the Federalist Society, says Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive think tank and law firm that fashions originalist arguments. When you actually look at the text and history of the entire Constitution, particularly focusing on the transformative amendments that were enacted in the wake of the Civil War, you really see an arc of progress that pushes our country toward inclusion, equality and greater democracy that tells a very different story from a lot of what the folks on the right, including the Federalist Society, would have you believe about our Constitution. The CAC has made originalist arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion rights. Its position is that those rights are guaranteed by a textual and historical understanding of the original meaning of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. The CAC also is using an originalist reading of the foreign emoluments clause as it represents members of Congress who claim Trump is unconstitutionally benefiting from foreign payments.\n\nEven Federalists come down on both sides of some of these questions. In 2013, years after he spoke at the founding Federalist Society symposium, and after he won Bush v. Gore, Ted Olson returned to the Supreme Court to overturn a California proposition banning same-sex marriage. For their part, many liberal scholars and lawyers continue to reject originalism in favor of a vision of the Constitution flexible enough to embrace changing times and evolving notions of human rights. Still, even critics of originalism are forced to acknowledge the new reality: Despite recent work demonstrating the bankruptcy of these [originalist] approaches, liberal lawyers trying to get progressive results at the Supreme Court have already begun trying to pick off conservative justices through a calculated embrace of the theories, Richard Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine, wrote recently in Slate.\n\nLeonard Leo told me he disputes the notion that the Constitution contains either conservative or progressive values, and he denies that originalism is rigged to reach conservative and libertarian results. The Constitution is a structural road map for how to ensure accountability and transparency in government, he said. And there are timeless values in it that are tied to the weaknesses of human nature and the danger of unlimited authority being vested in one person or a group of people. … You're practicing originalism appropriately when you're doing so without looking behind the curtain and trying to predetermine results.\n\nBut he welcomes liberals to the Federalist Society's jurisprudential worldview: There are liberals who work really hard at trying to develop a neutral, originalist approach to interpretation, he said. The fact that people may come out differently occasionally — that's okay. Half the battle is just agreeing that it is essential.\n\nTrump's Supreme Court appointees, Neil Gorsuch, left, and Brett Kavanaugh, both have Federalist Society connections.\n\nBack at the black-tie gala in Union Station — as McGahn and McConnell conclude what can only be described as a sedentary victory dance; as the four Federalist-friendly justices disperse into the night; as deputy AG Rosenstein and acting AG Whitaker linger for pictures with groups of giddy fans — I ponder: What now? Having reached this summit, what's left for the Federalist Society to conquer?\n\nI found some clues during the three days of the national convention at the Mayflower Hotel that bookended the gala. The judges project is still clearly in high gear, and with two sitting Supreme Court justices in their 80s — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, and Stephen Breyer, 80 — there's an incentive to keep the list of candidates fresh. Numerous candidates-in-waiting were on display at the conference. I counted 24 appeals court judges on the program — including 15 just elevated by Trump — and at least 11 of the names on Trump's expanded list of potential Supreme Court nominees were scheduled to participate over the three days.\n\nSome of the judges were treated as rock stars, especially Amy Coney Barrett, named by Trump to the 7th Circuit. More than one convention speaker got a rise out of audiences by recalling Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's gaffe of telling the Catholic Barrett during her confirmation hearing that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern. The lunchtime panel on stare decisis (the legal doctrine that calls for courts to respect precedent) was full — and several attendees told me it wasn't the topic that drew them, it was the presence of Barrett moderating the panel. Judge, welcome back to Washington — and I hope you'll come back for good sometime soon! one of the panelists, Kannon Shanmugam, an appellate advocate and partner at Williams & Connolly, said to Barrett, drawing cheers from the audience.\n\nIn hallways and during panels, networking continued to mix with intellectual ferment. I ran into Josh Blackman, the Texas professor and blogger; he was scheduled to be on a panel where he would urge judges to tweet more and make decisions easier to search online. All the action does go on in the hallway, he told me. At dinner last night I met with friends old and new who had things they wanted to tell me, things they wanted me to think about, things I want to write about. As long as you have your eyes and ears open, you always are able to connect in new ways.\n\nChecking out a number of panels, I was impressed that, true to its claim, the Federalist Society really had invited capable liberal advocates to try to rebut conservative perspectives. People always treat me politely in these circumstances, but they always look at me in bemusement about how wrong I am, W. Neil Eggleston, former White House counsel for Obama, quipped during the session on stare decisis. He cautioned the newly empowered majority on the Supreme Court against overturning landmark decisions such as Roe v. Wade just because it could with slim 5-to-4 majorities.\n\nMeanwhile, for all the Federalist Society's steamrolling progress on display, I detected a sign of tension that may, too, carry into the future. Near the conclusion of the gala, while McGahn and McConnell are still gloating, I notice a figure standing at a high-top with a drink in the bar area. It's George Conway III, husband of Trump communications counselor Kellyanne Conway. George is surrounded by some friends, and none of them is paying much attention to McGahn and McConnell.\n\nGeorge Conway's Federalist Society pedigree is impeccable. He has been a member since 1984 — two years after the founding symposium — and he serves on the society's board of visitors. But he has also publicly criticized his wife's boss's actions on occasion. And he shook the conservative legal establishment when, just before the convention, he and a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers announced the formation of a group called Checks and Balances because, they said, Trump threatens the rule of law. George Conway had even told the New York Times that there's a perception out there that conservative lawyers have essentially sold their souls for judges and regulatory reform.\n\nAs I approach, Conway is being congratulated by people coming up from all sides.\n\nChecks and Balances! says one admirer.\n\nIsn't it great? says Conway.\n\nHow's Kellyanne feeling?\n\nAh, she could do without it.\n\nAnother, much younger lawyer approaches.\n\nI got that email, he says.\n\nYou going to come? asks Conway, referring to a recruitment meeting planned for the next day.\n\nI already put the word out.\n\nTurning to me, Conway says: That's one of the young people who just loves what we're doing. … He's a recent law school graduate, a few years out, and a clerk for a really prominent judge here in the District. … The younger people really feel it, and their view is: This will end, the current era. And they're going to be around a long time, and they're not worried that it's going to affect their careers.\n\nChecks and Balances, as Conway explains it to me, is not an attack on the Federalist Society but a reminder of the core principles the society has stood for ever since that band of students gathered at Yale. And now, here in a corner of the vast, tingling network, another connection is being made.\n\nDavid Montgomery is a staff writer for the magazine.
Female creators rise in all their splendor and defiance in Donna Seaman's wonderful new book that chronicles the lives of seven American artists. These women, one of whom died only in 2007, have already been mostly forgotten by the art world, which Seaman sees as inexcusable and here does her best to correct. She claims her book, Identity Unknown, is not a work of art criticism or a feminist manifesto but her own exploration of the forces that propelled these women to create while facing obstacles their male counterparts didn't have to consider.\n\nSeaman's interest stems from long personal experience. Her mother, Elayne Seaman, produced elegant ink paintings. Watching her work as a little girl gave Seaman an early understanding of her mother's passionate need to create. Seaman went on to become an art student herself and flirted with the idea of pursuing the field professionally but got sidetracked by her love of writing, particularly biographical profiles, which she approaches with empathy and ample curiosity.\n\nAmong the seven artists explored in Identity Unknown is Louise Nevelson, who built large and intricate black wood sculptures that resembled ancient temples. A Russian Jewish woman who was born in 1899, Nevelson grew up in Maine using wood scraps and other discarded objects for her creations that were always painted black. She also loved to make open-faced boxes, which she felt brought order to chaos. Seaman believes Nevelson's affinity for transforming old and battered pieces of wood into new forms was inspired by her own brokenness. She came to America with her parents to escape the pogroms, and her mother was often beset by depression. She created Sky Gate, New York, a gigantic black wood wall that stood in the mezzanine of 1 World Trade Center before its collapse. She also created two Holocaust memorials in Israel and Japan. Seaman describes Nevelson's great walls and towers as wooden poems, each box a stanza, each piece a word, yet they are not tethered to any one language. They speak to everyone.\n\n[The legend of Georgia O'Keeffe]\n\nAnother of Seaman's subjects is Gertrude Abercrombie, who painted stark landscapes filled with regal female figure with feline eyes. A telephone appears in her work as a recurring motif. Seaman believes her portraits suggest her fear of entrapment and her simultaneous desire for security and safety. Her paintings contain ivory towers, blocky houses and empty rooms that sometimes resemble cells. Split Personality shows the lower half of a woman standing in a long skirt while the upper half of her body hovers nearby. Abercrombie suffered from insecurity and drank too much. She found the demands of motherhood and marriage exasperating. Based in Chicago, she never had a major gallery show, and her renown was short-lived. Seaman laments her disappearance, believing that in her paintings we see a flatland, an open-air stage under the moon's eye.\n\nThe Chess Match, by Gertrude Abercrombie. Oil on canvas. (Gift of Gertrude Abercrombie Trust/Collection of the Illinois State Museum)\n\nSeaman's list of artists is sure to introduce most readers to figures they don't know. Loïs Mailou Jones was a black artist who painted luxurious impressionistic watercolors and oils with a palette knife. She was drawn to the busy marketplaces of Haiti for inspiration. She later became fascinated by African cultural motifs and created intricate textile designs that she illustrated in stunning watercolors. Ree Morton worked as a sculptor using twigs and branches while living as a Navy spouse and raising three children. Joan Brown created swirling expressionistic paintings.\n\nWhat makes Seaman such an enchanting biographer is her willingness to embrace uncertainty, often stopping mid-narrative to pose questions regarding an artist's possible intentions. She is intrigued by Christina Ramberg's erotic drawings of bound and broken women wearing tightly fitted undergarments, often with their faces hidden or missing. She considers the possibility that her work is a meditation on the eroticism of bondage, but her research leads her elsewhere. In a 1973 interview, Ramberg said, Watching my mother getting dressed, I used to think that this is what men want women to look like; she's transforming herself into the kind of body men want. I thought it was fascinating … In some ways, I thought it was awful. She goes on to speculate about Ramberg's intentions: Was Ramberg commenting on the peculiar ordeals women subject themselves to in order to achieve body shapes deemed desirable and fashionable? Did she see women as captives of a sexist society? Or could it be that her female torsos are fitted with impregnable corsets as armor that mocks the iconography of sexual invitation? Seaman brings this same inquisitiveness to the work of Lenore Tawney, who spent endless hours making enormous hanging structures composed of thousands of threads painstakingly woven together.\n\nSeaman finds connections that seem to tie these women to one another.\n\nShe notices how most of them rely on autobiographical expression and how they like to use materials others deem worthless. She is impressed by their determination, despite the forces that threatened them, and their ability to keep working, often without outside nurturance or mentoring. Most of them were open to changing mediums as they evolved. Morton grew obsessed with painting decorative bows, flags and banners in deliciously shiny colors. Jones became intrigued by African masks, which she incorporated into her paintings. Brown went on to create outdoor sculptures filled with bright colors and bold geometric designs that reflected her growing interest in Eastern mysticism and later experimented with charcoal and graphite. When her work as a painter began to trouble her, Ramberg temporarily switched to sewing magnificent quilts, using stacks of fabric remnants she found in Japan. Abercrombie, in her later years, switched her focus to painting objects such as coffee grinders, shaving brushes and mugs using jolly pinks and soft grays as her compositions grew more formulaic and less nuanced than the gloomy self-portraits she had produced earlier.\n\nWhen Seaman was a young aspiring artist at the Kansas City Art Institute, she would spend hours looking at old black and white photographs of Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and other luminaries sitting happily in a cafe, engaged in lively conversation. Usually, there would be a woman or two among them with a dismissive caption that read identity unknown. She remembers feeling indignant at their casual erasure, but now, in this captivating book, she has resuscitated their complex and accomplished lives.\n\nElaine Margolin is a writer and critic in New York.\n\nRead more: Dada and the unmaking of the twentieth century
I was excited to read Adèle. I'd read and enjoyed Slimani's The Perfect Nanny, which was published in the United States last year. Nanny had captured the imagination of so many for its spare writing and merciless observations, as well as for the stark subject matter, starting with a dead baby and touching on race, class and gender divides. I thought — I hoped — Adèle, Slimani's first novel, which was published in French in 2015 and won Morocco's Prix La Mamounia, might be similarly enjoyable. The premise, about a married woman in the grips of extramarital sexual compulsion, squarely fit within the parameters of the dark crime stories I most like to read.\n\nA few pages in, I knew I would not send in a blurb for Adèle. I kept reading, in hopes my mind would change, but it did not. I could not endorse a novel I so disliked. A few months later, I wonder at the roots of this response. My standard rejoinder, when asked if I don't like a book, is that it's not to my taste. Slimani's novel, however, took me somewhere deeper, more primal. This was no cerebral reaction, but a visceral one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCompare The baby is dead, the first line of The Perfect Nanny, with Adèle has been good, the first line of Adèle. The former is a stunner, a system shock. Why is the baby dead? How did the baby die? It's so plainly stated. Of course you want to know more. The latter, however, is more passive. It stops the narrative. It invites a response of so what? because the reader has no context to care why this woman was bad, or if she was bad, or why her emotions even matter.\n\nThe opening is unfortunately a harbinger of what ails the rest of this novel. We are expected to believe that a person like Adèle — outwardly successful, with her marriage to a well-to-do surgeon husband, an ascendant career in journalism, adorable children — has an inward void that can only be slaked, temporarily, by random sexual encounters. This dichotomy is meant to be transgressive, all the more for the lack of explanation for Adèle's extramarital desires. It's not.\n\nThe encounters, as they accumulate, grow tedious. Perhaps this is Slimani's point, that sex won't solve problems, that indulging in base desires can make you miserable. If so, it's a point made countless times before in fiction (and in memoir) with far more emotionally resonant results. Adèle glides through the narrative on a numbness-inducing wave, the kind far better executed in Pauline Reage's The Story of O or Elizabeth McNeill's Nine and a Half Weeks or the complete works of Anais Nin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdèle isn't likable, but that's also irrelevant. She's barely a character, so there is little for the reader to react to. Worse, all the other characters — her husband, her children and a paramour who can't stay casual — are paper-thin constructs. Reading Adèle — such a far cry from The Perfect Nanny — was like being in the middle of a blocking exercise in a play rehearsal. Move her here, move him there, see what happens, if anything happens at all.\n\nI'm all for novels that transport me somewhere surprising and fresh — and someplace erotic certainly counts. Sexual congress reveals so much about character, whether rooted in romance, hatred, awkwardness, even humor. There is nothing more thrilling than when a writer, through her unique voice and sentences, gets at deep emotional truths through the connection of two humans with their hearts, minds and bodies. Pleasure in text transforms to pleasure in the reader's mind, and that's empowering, though often equally discomfiting.\n\nImmediately upon finishing Adèle, I put the book down, and picked up Nine and a Half Weeks and reread it for the dozenth time. Then I promptly reread The Perfect Nanny to see if my opinion of that novel had diminished. It had not. Perhaps, in time, readers will see The Perfect Nanny as Slimani's actual first effort, and forget Adèle existed.\n\nSarah Weinman is the author of The Real Lolita: The Kidnapping of Sally Horner and the Novel that Scandalized the World and the editor of the Women Crime Writers series.\n\nADÈLE\n\nby Leila Slimani
The word honeymoon dates to the fifth century, when wedded couples would drink mead (sweet wine) during the first month, or moon, of marriage. In Victorian England, it meant visiting family and friends who couldn't attend the wedding. Only later would the meaning evolve into a romantic holiday for two.\n\nBut while it was once de rigueur for the happy couple to depart right after the reception, delayed honeymoons are increasingly common, according to wedding industry experts and insiders. According to honeymoon trend data from the industry platform WeddingWire, couples who report leaving one to two days after the wedding have declined by 13 percent since 2015.\n\nWhen you consider both wedding and travel trends, it often makes sense to delay a honeymoon.\n\nLindsay Landman, a wedding and event planner based in New York City, attributes the shift to the evolution of wedding timetables. It used to be that you got married on a Saturday, had your ceremony and reception, and then everyone went on their merry way, says Landman. Now it's very infrequent for a wedding to be a one-day affair. Today's celebrations often unfold over the course of an entire weekend, with welcome drinks the night before, activities the day of the ceremony and brunch the day after. By the time it's all over, couples might need some time to decompress before jetting off on a honeymoon.\n\nThe rise of the destination wedding has played a role, too. The number one reason people say they want to do a destination is that they want to be able to spend time with people, says Landman. The result is a group vacation that culminates with I do, a trip that precludes many couples from immediately embarking on another voyage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDestination weddings not only require additional expenses but additional vacation days. You can't just leave your job on a Thursday evening. Now, you have to leave on a Tuesday night, says Landman. Even if you're not flying, you're packing up and doing a mini-vacation for the wedding itself.\n\nDelaying a honeymoon makes sense from a travel planning perspective, as well. Stephanie Park is the co-founder of Journy, an online millennial-focused travel agency that provides users with personalized itineraries. We either see people who are planning honeymoons really, really early, or they've already been married for a while, and now they have the free time to devote to planning the perfect trip, says Park.\n\nAnd she means perfect. With honeymoons, most times it's a once in a lifetime experience, you've saved up all this money for your wedding and your honeymoon, says Park. It's a lot of pressure to put on a single trip. You do need the time to plan. And if you see travel as the competitive sport it has become on social media, you might feel the compulsion not just to design a never-to-be-forgotten trip for two, but to curate a vacation that will make your Instagram followers envious.\n\nOther couples also need to recover financially before they can take a dream trip. According to the most recent data from wedding site the Knot, the national average cost of a wedding in 2018 was $29,200; of a honeymoon, $5,342. Some people need a little breathing room to recoup and reinvest, says Landman. And waiting allows them to make use of a honeymoon fund. Couples can register on sites such as Journy, Honeyfund and others.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are more intangible benefits. Delaying helps anticipation, as well as finances, grow. Doing it six months, a year, even 18 months later gives you something to look forward to, says Rachel Sussman, a therapist who specializes in marriage and relationships.\n\nPlanning the trip and traveling together is also good for your marriage, Sussman adds. She recommends that people planning a honeymoon — or really any vacation — make time to really talk about what they want from that trip, down to the way they expect to spend the days. People really need to have that conversation and get on the same page, she says. Do you want to see every site there is? Do you want to relax and sleep in? Talk to each other and figure that out before you go.\n\nBut don't let the opportunity to go somewhere slip away, because traveling together has benefits. We all have a tendency to get caught up in our daily routine, Sussman says. Sometimes you can get into a rut and it can feel mundane. Just being together is a way to connect, and it doesn't need to be a big fancy trip. It could be an Airbnb in your own city in a different neighborhood.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd even if it isn't the perfect vacation, that can be good for the marriage, too. If you end up with a bad experience, it's good to have to figure out how to handle that together. What if one of you gets sick? What if there's a problem? she says. It's a little microcosm of your relationship and a good way to use your skills together; being outside of your comfort zone together is a good thing.\n\nAs for my own honeymoon, we waited for a variety of reasons, including all of the above: wedding expenses, lack of vacation days, time-intensive planning. Our research started about six months after tying the knot. Eleven months after our wedding day, we spent two weeks hiking, swimming and relaxing on a trio of remote Greek islands. But by far the best thing about waiting was that it extended the bubbly feeling of being just married and the celebration of our life together.
A mere 24 hours later, after producers were reportedly bombarded with calls from networks who saw the fan uprising, NBC executives made the announcement: They would pick up the show for a sixth season. (This also made financial sense, because the show is produced by Universal Television, which shares a parent company with NBC.) Twitter rejoiced, as one of the nicest shows on television had been saved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine, while critically beloved, didn't get very high ratings on Fox; its creators say it's one of the most-watched shows on Hulu. So as we wait to see if the move to NBC — and the drama surrounding its near-demise — causes a spike in live TV viewers, we can confirm: The show, which returned Thursday night, is essentially the same. However, there are a few small (but key) differences since the network jump:\n\n1) The characters can swear now (sort of).\n\nTurns out that Fox is very strict about certain TV standards, but NBC is basically a free-for-all! Terry Crews, who plays Sergeant Terry Jeffords, said that Fox had more restrictions.\n\nAD\n\nWe could not do any bleeping out, we could not do any fuzzy nudity. . . but NOW there's lots of bleeping, lots of fuzzy nudity, Crews told Buzzfeed's AM to DM, and joked, It's like 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' after dark. If you ever had a hardcore movie version of 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine,' that's what you're going to see on NBC right now.\n\nAD\n\nThat seems like a slight exaggeration, though the premiere did have one memorable bleeped-out line. (We can't repeat it here, but let's just say it had to do with a misunderstanding about what an abbreviation really meant.) However, it doesn't sound like the new rules are going to drastically alter the show.\n\nIt is edgy and jokes that are definitely not G-rated, but I am conscious of the fact that we have a strong family fan base, executive producer Dan Goor said to Variety. So we wouldn't gratuitously change the characters.\n\nAD\n\n2) We get a glimpse of depressed Captain Holt.\n\nHolt (Andre Braugher) has been through tough times, but when he found out he didn't get the New York police commissioner job, he went off the deep end in a way viewers have never seen. Specifically, he flew to a resort in Mexico to drown his sorrows in margaritas and wear colorful T-shirts with slogans such as What's Up, Beaches? and DTF: Down to Fiesta.\n\nAD\n\nUnfortunately, it was the same resort that Jake (Andy Samberg) and Amy (Melissa Fumero) were going on their honeymoon, because they all used the same discount code offered by Gina (Chelsea Peretti.) Holt swore he wouldn't be a buzzkill, but he was so sad, he couldn't help himself. What is it about me that screams, 'Loser'? he wondered as he interrupted Jake and Amy's couples massage. When he wound up by them in the pool on a raft, he said sadly, I can't even float right. Just push me away. Everyone else does.\n\nAD\n\nJake and Amy gamely tried to include him in their activities, such as a class called Sensual Food Tasting: The Art of Feeding Your Lover and a trip to the spa, though they had different takes on the mud masks. Amy: I love the way the mud revitalizes your skin. Holt: And I love how it masks my shame.\n\nEventually, Holt realized that there was more to life than the NYPD, and decided to quit — until Jake and Amy brought him back from the edge, using some fairly creative methods.\n\nAD\n\n3) Charles and Gina are no longer going to be brother and sister.\n\nCharles (Joe Lo Truglio) loves reminding people that even though he and Gina once had a brief fling, they're also brother and sister, because his dad later married her mom. It appears that special time has come to an end — Charles's dad and Gina's mom are getting a divorce. At first, Gina tried to tell Charles it wasn't that big of a deal (The average American marriage lasts fewer than two days), yet Charles was still devastated. Turns out her mom was cheating on his dad, which should lead to some awkward story lines in the future.
It's hard, as you know, but I'm managing, thank you.\n\nShe drew close, cupped her small wrinkled hands over both my cheeks, and said, Oh, honey. It's going to get a lot worse.\n\nMonths later, her prescient words began to make sense. Late one night, I stopped at my local Walgreens. This was the kind of errand my husband, Mark, would have run. The parking lot was dark, and I was the only customer in the store.\n\nI checked out and scurried to my car, quickly locking the driver's door. Then I grabbed my cellphone and began dialing Mark's number. He'd want to know I was safely on my way home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd then I remembered. Mark was gone.\n\nA new and frightening darkness engulfed me that night. No one knew or cared that I was at Walgreens. No one was waiting for me to come home.\n\nOvernight, I was catapulted into a club I never signed up for: divorced or widowed women, alone after decades of building a life with a partner with whom they had planned to grow old.\n\nI was widowed in my early 50s and couldn't imagine spending the rest of my life this way. But what were the chances, I wondered, at this stage in life, of finding another partner? And what were the odds of meeting someone with my sexual orientation?\n\nI've recently learned I fall into a category called demisexual. It's on the asexual spectrum, and it means I'm someone who doesn't get sexually aroused before I'm emotionally connected.\n\nAD\n\nMy friends warned me it was unlikely I'd meet a demisexual match online, but when I got lonely, I decided it was worth a try.\n\nThe hookup apps were plentiful and the options wide open. One or two clicks would lead me to a threesome … or connect me with married men, if adultery wasn't a problem.\n\nAD\n\nI approached this new world like I had my search for the perfect small breed poodle mix. I read books and articles on how to navigate dating sites. I talked to friends who had tried them. I crafted countless personal profiles and a list of questions in an effort to weed out unwanted matches.\n\nWhat are you looking for in a partner? I'd type to a virtual stranger. And What matters most to you in a relationship?\n\nAD\n\nThe usual response went something like this: I'm looking for a sexy woman who wants to have fun and who will complete me.\n\nIf email exchanges led to follow-up phone conversations, my questions grew more personal.\n\nI'm so sorry about your divorce, I'd say. I'm wondering what you've learned from the failure of your marriage that might make you a better partner next time around?\n\nTo that one, most replied, I've learned to never again date a woman as crazy as my ex-wife.\n\nI often talked about my values around monogamy and commitment with my matches, but I didn't bring up the elephant in the room — sex — until I met them in person.\n\nAD\n\nOnce, a promising date flew in from the Midwest. We'd planned a bike ride our first day together. As I handed him a helmet, he said, Something you should know about me — I don't wear bike helmets and I don't wear condoms.\n\nAD\n\nGood to know, I said.\n\nAnother man I met had a lot going for him. We had chemistry within minutes. Over a glass of wine, I asked, So, what do you think about casual sex?\n\nReally? he asked. You want to talk about casual sex on our first date?\n\nYes, I do, I responded, because I don't want to waste your time.\n\nOkay, he said. I think ideally, sex belongs inside a serious, committed relationship, but who really waits for that anymore? It's close to impossible.\n\nI knew that being a demisexual, or even worse, a virgin in my 20s, makes me strange to some people.\n\nWhen I was a correspondent for ABC News, I once pitched a story to my senior producer about a large movement of Christian teenagers who had vowed to stay sexually pure until marriage. I thought the trend was significant enough to merit news coverage. My bosses in New York disagreed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose kids are weird, my senior producer said. I don't know any normal person who waits until they're married to have sex.\n\nI paused. Yes, you do know someone who waited, I said.\n\nYou're kidding, he said. You were a virgin when you got married?\n\nYes, I replied.\n\nWere you fat? he asked incredulously.\n\nNo, I said.\n\nWere you frigid?\n\nNo.\n\nThen what was wrong with you?\n\nNothing was wrong with me. I learned more about sex than I'd like to admit in the back seat of my high school boyfriend's Dodge Dart Swinger.\n\nChoosing virginity was an act of rebellion against my parents, whose marriage ended disastrously in an adulterous affair when I was just 7. My father ran off with his young secretary in the middle of a cold Ohio night, with me and my sister in tow.\n\nAD\n\nBy the end of his life, my father had married and divorced five times, leaving a disjointed clan of step, half and whole siblings picking through the rubble.\n\nAD\n\nMy front-row seat to the dark side of unrestrained sexual desire drove me to search for a radically different philosophy of love and life.\n\nAt the University of Texas, I walked to class daily past a tower inscribed with the words, Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.\n\nOne night, a group of students introduced me to Jesus, the author of that quote. Following him changed the trajectory of my life. It shaped everything from what I majored in to how I voted to whom I dated. I never turned back.\n\nAD\n\nMy faith wobbled, though, and I lost my bearings when I lost my husband. The church had nothing to say about how a woman, widowed and alone in midlife, was supposed to manage romantic desire.\n\nI eventually met several kind and witty men online whom I dated for a while, but I lost hope of finding another life partner.\n\nAD\n\nI think I gave up the night my date arrived at the restaurant wearing a What would Jesus do? wristband. Over dinner he told me he was seeing a faith healer because his last girlfriend broke up with him after she caught him sexting the woman he had been sleeping with before her.\n\nPlenty of chapters in my life have had unhappy endings. This isn't one of them.\n\nAD\n\nOne day, during a break from my online dating experiment, my demisexual match showed up. Call it a coincidence or a stroke of divine intervention. While on a walk around a nearby lake, I ran into an old friend. He told me about someone he wanted me to meet.\n\nA few weeks later, Robin invited me to dinner to a local Italian restaurant. There, on its rooftop on a breezy April evening, I learned he too had been married 25 years. He was divorced, but still raising one of four sons, so he hadn't been dating much.\n\nAD\n\nWe shared stories of how our faith had helped us overcome devastating losses. We had both mentored troubled teens. His faith and mine had been deepened by visits to Israel.\n\nWe talked until the restaurant closed.\n\nWhen I asked Robin my question: What are you looking for in a partner? his answer stopped me short.\n\nHe simply said, A woman who loves God more than she loves me.\n\nThe last time I'd heard those words, they'd come from my late husband, when we were dating.\n\nWhat began at a rooftop dinner four years ago eventually led to a new life commitment. Loving Robin is a daily reminder that spiritual and emotional intimacy may be the greatest aphrodisiacs of all.
He and his business partners, Daisuke Utagawa and Yama Jewayni, own two other restaurants on the block, the adjacent Daikaya and Bantam King around the corner, plus Haikan and Hatoba in the Atlantic Plumbing Building and the Navy Yard neighborhood, respectively. Ahead of opening their fifth venue, the owners referred to the unnamed space as next door so often, Jewayni finally asked how it translated in Japanese. Tonari, he was told. The word stuck.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe concept has a name in Japan: wafu Italian. The Japanese are good at borrowing from others and making it their own, says Fukushima.\n\nGood products help. The noodles for Tonari, made with flour from Hokkaido, come from the same company in Sapporo, Nishiyama Seimen, from which the owners buy their ramen joints. Expect some nice chewiness from the pasta. The dough for the pizza relies on flour milled in Japan and a base finished by Lyon Bakery in Maryland. The result yields a cross between focaccia and Detroit-style.\n\nConsider a few small plates to start. Slivered snow peas, edamame and a drift of ricotta, a salad tied with yuzu vinaigrette, make a bright beginning. Tonnato and roasted avocado isn't a marriage that occurred to me before. Trust me when I tell you the curtain of tuna-anchovy sauce over the buttery fruit is inspired, as are the grapefruit pieces nestled under the avocado, a surprise spark.\n\nI've yet to encounter a pasta I wouldn't want to twirl again. But if you're looking for something you won't find in an Italian restaurant, the springy tagliatelle tossed with baby sardines, olive oil and red pepper flakes rivals the long, thick bigoli made creamy and rich with a puree of sea urchin, white soy sauce and kombu (seaweed) stock. Tonari also makes a meaty Bolognese that gets its pleasant funk from natto, or fermented soybeans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere's no other pizza in town quite like Tonari's. The seductive crust — pillowy in the center, crisp on the edges, faintly sweet (like Japanese bread) — is aided by a pan that's brushed with the same kind of rice oil used to cook tempura.\n\nYou can get clam, pepperoni, Hawaiian pizza anywhere, a server says one night, pushing us instead toward a creamy topping of tangy Kewpie mayonnaise and canned corn, along with scallions and brick cheese. A companion compared the combination to dessert, and I agree, it's too sweet for dinner. Savory is more my speed: sliced pepperoni with pickled jalapeños or a scattering of clam, edible seaweed and (lots of) garlic.\n\nUtagawa says Tonari is the least Japanese of our restaurants. Yet the design renders it the most Japanese looking. Host to the showy tiled pizza oven, the ground floor is bright and bustling. My preference is a perch upstairs, where half the seating obliges diners to slip off their shoes, drop to the floor and tuck their legs into spacious holes beneath low tables. (Servers get a workout with all the bobbing up and down to fill water glasses and crouching to add and remove plates.) Standard tables populate the rest of the second floor, set off with a handsome moss garden and alive with the sound of jazz.\n\nThe space is certainly familiar to the owners, who looked at the building as a home for Daikaya before opting to open the ramen source next door.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn evening of pasta and pizza are best followed by something light for dessert. The kitchen obliges with a refreshing grapefruit granita covering vanilla ice cream, a combination that goes down like a creamsicle (easily). At the table, a server gives the confection a spritz of grapefruit perfume, a sensory enhancement Fukushima recalls from his time at the novel Minibar by José Andrés, and yet another reminder you're eating somewhere deliciously different.\n\n707 Sixth St. NW. 202-289-8900. tonaridc.com.

After we got married, he still went deathly cold on me if I so much as mentioned quitting. The situation has become so bizarre that he won't even go to the office without me.\n\nWhat is the psychology behind this behavior?\n\nNewlywed\n\nNewlywed: When it comes to relationships, I seldom react with total certitude, because I acknowledge that most relationships are complex, layered and — with effort — are often reparable.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, I am alarmed by your situation. I believe that you should not only leave your job, but you should also leave this relationship — and take extreme care when you do so, because — based only on what you report — this is a risky and potentially dangerous situation for you.\n\nAD\n\nThe psychology behind your husband's behavior is fairly transparent. Yes, he is being possessive. Now that you are married, he feels entitled to clamp down on his possessiveness, which has morphed into extreme control.\n\nGiven the dynamic in your marriage, you should take steps to avoid getting pregnant. Pregnancy and a child would likely delay or prevent your exit.\n\nI hope you will take your situation extremely seriously and develop a safety plan for when you are ready to leave. Victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) are at an extremely heightened risk when leaving, and it is important to have a plan in place.\n\nAD\n\nYou could take the first steps by contacting the National Domestic Violence Hotline (thehotline.org or call 800-799-7233). It is important to make sure you contact the Hotline safely — if you and your husband share a computer at home and if he can check your phone or computer searches at work, you could be at risk. Do your research and make the Hotline call from a friend's computer or phone.\n\nAD\n\nI genuinely hope I am overreacting to your situation. I also hope you will take this very seriously.\n\nDear Amy: My daughter, Annie, joined a local theater group five years ago. Her younger brother (there is a five-year age difference) is now old enough to join, and has asked to enroll.\n\nAD\n\nShe is livid. She says that it is her thing and that letting him be part of it will ruin it for her.\n\nShould I deny her brother the opportunity to participate in this theater group, or let him join, at the risk of upsetting her?\n\nConcerned Mother\n\nConcerned Mother: As a sibling, I understand this dynamic. Each sibling quite naturally wants to have their own thing. Many siblings instinctively avoid one another's specialties and special interests.\n\nAs a parent, however, I don't think you should let your daughter push the family around. Annie does not get to own theater as an overall pursuit.\n\nAD\n\nDionysus, the Greek patron of the theater, would not be pleased.\n\nAD\n\nYou know the dynamic in your household, and if your son is interested in this mainly to bug his sister, then you should encourage him to pursue something else.\n\nOtherwise, I believe you should let your son join this theater group. Tell your daughter that — if he's interested — he deserves to pursue this and that you are going to let him give it a try.\n\nUnlike in sports, where a five-year age difference would put the children on different teams, these two are likely to perform in productions together. I encourage families to get their kids involved in theater because the sense of community and togetherness in performing encourages pro-social behavior.\n\nAD\n\nOnce Annie adjusts to this, it could be a bonding experience for both.\n\nI assume Annie will find a way to discourage her little brother from close contact during rehearsals, but you should caution your son to give his sister plenty of space. She is not going to want to hang out with him.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: I'm responding to Grounded, whose retired husband was spending their money traveling while she worked.\n\nWhen someone asked me why I didn't accompany my husband on his vacations, I simply told them that one of us had to be the responsible adult.\n\nPointed yes, but it answered the question without having to say much more.\n\nElsie\n\nElsie: Yep, that covers it nicely.
I dated a guy for four months after we were set up on a blind date. We were both in the same career field, and I felt we had a lot in common and got along amazingly. He talked about me meeting his family. I've never considered marriage or kids and all that, but this guy made me feel things I never had before. Looking back, there were signs this was completely one-sided. He stopped responding one day and I didn't think much of it. But days turned to weeks, then months. I was a wreck.\n\nFast-forward two years and I'm offered a part-time job at a hospital, which I accept. And who is assigned to train me? My ghost. He acted as if he didn't even know who I was, which hurt so much. I left every shift in tears because I clearly still had feelings for him. I only lasted a few months before quitting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n— L.H., 33, Michigan\n\nI have ghosted someone. I thought we could actually be BFF after she visited me from another country after a five-year hiatus. I was so happy to see her. Her visit was very meaningful to me. I stripped my heart and soul for her and let her know everything about me.\n\nPerhaps it was too much, too soon. She felt overwhelmed. She said that she had her own troubles. I tried to stay in touch after she left, texting her on a daily basis. She responded sporadically. When I told her about times where I thought people had treated me unfairly, she showed no empathy. She also forgot my birthday. Last time we texted, it was to celebrate her birthday. I made a PowerPoint presentation with pictures of places where we met, a cake, a book I said I would give to her if we lived in the same country.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI am happy that the last time we texted we ended in an amicable way. After many horrible heartbreaks, I have finally understood that people usually don't change, and even more important, I should not expect them to change. I don't think she is a bad person. We just cannot be friends, so why stay in touch?! She has texted me and emailed twice in the past six months. I have not responded. What for? If we do not call, text, hang out, visit each other's home, then we are not friends. I feel bad — I know ghosting shows my incapacity to deal with this in a better way. But why bother? I don't expect to see her ever again.\n\n— Antonio Cervantes, 42, Vancouver\n\nAD\n\nOne time a guy I was seeing for a few weeks reached out to make plans for the next day, and then I never heard from him again. I was trying to reach out to say, No big deal if you're not interested, can I just know you're okay? I was actually checking obituaries … then I reached out to say, Hey no big deal, can I just have my parking pass back? Nothing. Ended up running into him out on the town a few months later. He closed his bar tab, pretended to be on his phone and walked out right past me.\n\nAD\n\nAnother time this guy ghosted me after a couple of months. He reached out wanting to apologize and explain … then ghosted me again. My most recent: I was talking to a guy for almost six months (longish distance). It's going on two weeks now with nothing, after we used to text every single day. My goal in dating right now is to meet a guy who would actually dump me.\n\nAD\n\n— Jackie M., 34, Seattle\n\nAs a young woman I was ghosted by a man who turned out to have a serious problem with alcohol. It was humiliating, but I knew I was way better off without a substance abuser in my life.\n\nHowever, many years later I was ghosted by a woman I had thought of as my best friend for six years, and that was more hurtful by far. When someone who has called you every day, professed undying friendship and sisterhood, supported you, advised you, defended you and included you in everything they did for years, suddenly locks you out of their orbit with no warning and no explanation, it's easy to feel really misused.\n\nAD\n\nWhen I did manage to get my ex-friend to speak to me on the phone, she told me that her seeming abandonment of me was all in my head. Mutual friends I consulted agreed that it wasn't all in my head, but clammed up completely when pressed for further information. To this day I have no idea what, if anything, I did to bring this ghosting about, and as a result, I'm still hurt by it.\n\nAD\n\n— D. Gunderson, 50, Albuquerque\n\nMy brother was a mean drunk and alcoholic for all of his youth. He's also a crybaby, uses others, throws loud tantrums and takes no responsibility for his behaviors. He is 65.\n\nI saw him two years ago and he is exactly the same. Absolutely no growth. I finally ghosted him, as trying to explain or justify my exhaustion with his mean-spirited behaviors would have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nAD\n\nI just don't care about him anymore. There are times when ghosting is the best way to handle a situation. I feel so much better now!\n\n— Skylar, 66\n\nI had been dating a guy for almost two months. Everything seemed like it was going well — we had made plans to go out the following weekend. Then he texted me that he was in the emergency room and would need to cancel our date. Of course I was worried, so I texted and called him numerous times to see how he was doing, but he didn't respond. Eleven days went by and I constantly went back-and-forth between worry, confusion and anger that he might be ghosting me. I finally texted him are you dead? He told me he was just released from the hospital after emergency heart surgery.\n\nAD\n\nI felt terrible. I asked him how he was doing and how I could support him. He said he needed time to recover and would follow up soon. I never heard from him after that. I texted him to follow up a couple of times, with no response. It was one of the most frustrating experiences of my life, because I had no idea what was real and what wasn't. Was he ghosting me the first time and just felt bad when I asked him if he was dead and made up the whole story about the surgery? Or was the surgery real and the relationship was just too much to deal with? I'll never know.\n\nAD\n\n— Sarah Little, 32, Alexandria, Va.\n\nI am a ghoster, not a ghostee. I probably started when I was 18. I think something is wrong with me. I hate the feeling I get when a girl lectures me over text on how rude it is to ghost. I genuinely agree with those sentiments … and yet I've continued to ghost on relationships, at events and even in my professional life. A part of it for me is low self-esteem. I've never dated a girl in Washington, D.C., that I could see myself satisfying and being good to long-term. After a handful of dates, or in rare cases a couple months, I inevitably feel like I am wasting their time and they could be doing better without me … soon after that, I ghost.\n\nAD\n\nI am sure a handful of young women in this city are confused, but I hope better off and participating in more fulfilling relationships with better men. I think I should seek help, and I would love to learn more about the psychological profile behind your average ghoster. I don't get any sick pleasure out of not showing up somewhere or ceasing a line of communication. I feel horrible about what I have done (or not done) and I just hope whoever I have done wrong is happier now than they were whenever they interacted with me.\n\nAD\n\n— Anonymous, 28, Washington, D.C.\n\nWe met through an online dating app in July 2017. Instant connection, lots of emails and texts. First date was at his house. Talked for hours, first kiss. Then he left to travel, which he did frequently. After a few perfunctory texts, he disappeared. I was a wreck for weeks, having never been ghosted before. I got over it, just by the passage of time.\n\nAD\n\nSpring 2019, our paths cross again. I'm cynical, but he makes all the effort. He asks me out to dinner. He comes over to my house for wine a few days later. He suggests we have coffee Saturday mornings at my house, after his bicycle riding group is finished. He comes over to my house to cook me dinner. On a Friday night, about three months after we are reacquainted, he texts me a picture of himself presenting that week at a conference, from the plane, as he was coming home for the week. No text from him Saturday morning about our standing coffee date. I text him at noon. I text him later that day.\n\nAD\n\nBy Sunday late morning, I'm in a panic, thinking that he's been hit by a car on his Saturday morning bike ride. No response from him. By Monday, I sent my final text, saying that I had no idea where he was, if he was even still alive, but that I didn't want to move forward until I was important enough to him for him to respond to me. Turns out, he was still alive, very much so. I later learned that his roommate, whom he described as his ex-girlfriend in the process of finding a new place to live, was NOT his ex.\n\nEventually, I reached out to his ex; we had an amazing, healthy conversation, and I now consider her a friend!\n\n— Laura B., 54, Portsmouth, N.H.\n\nI was ghosted by my ex of four years. I last heard from him two days before Christmas. I'd been giving him some space because he had a sick relative and was stressing about school. I didn't hear from him again until I got a Happy Birthday! text in February. I did not respond.\n\n— Janice, 48, Herndon, Va.
I was thinking about this correlation while considering writing a love and money column for Valentine's Day. After the roses have wilted and the candy has been eaten, can your love withstand financial volatility? Here are four lessons couples can learn from the current stock market downturn.\n\nYou've got to have a plan. I've worked with people who, when I ask them to tell me their investment strategy, just stare back at me with no clue about what I mean. But it's times like this, when the market is trending down and making people panic, that you need to ask yourself: What's my investment plan?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAre you just throwing money into your workplace retirement account without knowing where your funds are invested? If so, you may find that you're not aggressive enough or that you're taking too much risk. The younger you are — depending on your tolerance — the more you can afford to risk. But if you're closer to retirement, you want to make sure you're not being too risky at a time when you'll soon need to live off your investments.\n\nIn either case, you're less likely to be panic-stricken by a plunge in the stock market if you have a plan.\n\nLikewise, when looking for a financial soulmate, what's your plan? I wanted to marry a saver. I didn't want to be married to someone who thought a credit card was his emergency fund. What are your non-negotiables?\n\nAD\n\nDon't let your emotions cloud your judgment. Some investors are in full panic mode right now. I understand the fear. You see gains disappearing and you become concerned about your financial future. But if you've got a long horizon ahead — 20 or more years until retirement — this current market storm may just be a blip.\n\nAD\n\nThe same advice goes for looking for a soulmate. Don't let your feelings cause you to ignore financial red flags. Love does not conquer all.\n\nMore than half of Americans with debt said it has negatively impacted their life. Of those, one in five said the debt is causing tension in their relationships with a spouse or partner, according to a recent survey by the American Institute of CPAs.\n\nDon't take more risk than you can afford. At the end of the day, you literally have to sleep. And if your investment portfolio is so risky that you're suffering from insomnia and night sweats, you many need to be more conservative in your investment choices.\n\nAD\n\nWith love, don't risk your peace of mind by staying with someone who doesn't share your financial values. For example, are you willing to fall in love with someone who is deeply in debt but not concerned about paying it off?\n\nAD\n\nFinder.com surveyed 2,000 Americans about what types of debt they considered a relationship deal-breaker.\n\nThree out of every four people surveyed considered credit card debt a good reason to kick someone to the curb. Payday loans came next, followed by student loans.\n\nI don't think you should dump someone just because he or she has debt. However, if the person is an unrepentant spendthrift addicted to credit cards, that can become a huge problem if you're an ardent saver who loathes debt.\n\nAD\n\nManage your expectations. None of us should be shocked the market is down. It's always going to be in flux. So, we have to learn to live with the highs and lows.\n\nThis is also true in relationships. I met a wife fuming that her husband couldn't manage money.\n\nHow did he handle his money while you were dating? I asked.\n\nAD\n\nThe question made her pause. He hadn't changed.\n\nYou knowingly married an elephant and now you expect him to act like a giraffe, I joked.\n\nI suggested they seek counseling and take a financial class to help them manage their money differences.\n\nIn the relationship with both your partner and your portfolio, don't let emotions rule the decision making, said Michael Eisenberg, a CPA and member of AICPA's Financial Literacy Commission. Developing a plan, whether for financial purposes or for personal purposes, will help you analyze and understand strengths, weaknesses and risks.\n\nWhether you are investing in the stock market or looking for love, the more you know, the less likely you'll end up broke or with a broken heart.
The statement by Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez immediately set off a debate among the dozens of U.S. bishops, who, like U.S. Catholics, are bitterly divided on the direction of their extensive denomination and its entanglement with partisan politics. Those divisions are coming to a head in the figure of Biden, who makes it clear with his weekly churchgoing, his frequent references to Catholic teachings and culture, and his use of Catholic symbols that he will not accept the view of conservative Catholics that he is not part of the church.\n\nWednesday's dispute over how to contend with the new president included dueling comments from leading bishops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a time of growing and aggressive secularism in American culture, when religious believers face many challenges, it will be refreshing to engage with a President who clearly understands, in a deep and personal way, the importance of religious faith and institutions, Gomez wrote in his statement. At the same time, he added, I must point out that our new President has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender. Of deep concern is the liberty of the Church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.\n\nGomez called the continued injustice of abortion a preeminent priority.\n\nWithin hours, Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago and an ally of Francis, issued a sharp rebuke to Gomez and his supporters in putting together the statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToday, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued an ill-considered statement on the day of President Biden's inauguration. Aside from the fact that there is seemingly no precedent for doing so, the statement, critical of President Biden came as a surprise to many bishops, who received it just hours before it was released, Cupich wrote, challenging the idea that Gomez's words were endorsed by or represent U.S. bishops. The internal institutional failures involved must be addressed, and I look forward to contributing to all efforts to that end, so that, inspired by the Gospel, we can build up the unity of the Church, and together take up the work of healing our nation in this moment of crisis.\n\nUSCCB statements about previous presidential elections and inaugurations took a more positive and collaborative tone. In 2016, the conference put out a statement congratulating Donald Trump, saying it looks forward to working with President-elect Trump to protect human life from its most vulnerable beginning to its natural end.\n\nA request for comment from Gomez was directed to the USCCB.\n\nOther bishops put out more subtle rebukes of Gomez.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSan Diego Bishop Robert W. McElroy said he was echoing Pope Francis' message to President Biden and calling for dialogue, not judgment; collaboration, not isolation; truth in charity, not harshness. … It is a pathway of reconciliation that places the healing of our society ahead of any specific policy issue, in the recognition that repairing the soul of our country is the pre-requisite for any sustainable effort to advance the common good. … Most importantly of all, Pope Francis' message to President Biden fundamentally speaks to him in his humanity, a man of Catholic faith striving to serve his nation and his God.\n\nHours earlier, Biden attended Mass at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, a soaring cathedral in downtown Washington and one of several where Biden attended Mass as vice president. It is also where the funeral for the first Catholic U.S. president, John F. Kennedy, was held. There, Biden heard a homily by the Rev. Kevin O'Brien, a friend and former official at Georgetown University who heads Santa Clara University.\n\nMy deepest prayer for you today, as a priest, citizen and friend, is that you always remember that the Lord is near and no matter the sound and fury around you, that God wants to give you peace, a deep-seated peace that will sustain you. Let all of us hear the good news today: The Lord is near, so no need to worry or to be afraid, O'Brien said during the Mass.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden also received a message Wednesday from the pope.\n\nUnder your leadership, may the American people continue to draw strength from the lofty political, ethical and religious values that have inspired the nation since its founding, said Francis, who had called Biden on Nov. 12 to offer his congratulations and to discuss working together on issues including poverty, climate change and integrating immigrants and refugees.\n\nLike Biden, Francis focuses on Catholicism's broad call for the disenfranchised and suffering, and less on Catholic doctrine about topics such as abortion, gender identity and sexuality. Biden's Catholic image has angered many U.S. bishops, who last year created a special committee in response to the reality of a Catholic U.S. president who supports abortion rights and same-sex marriage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe chairman of that group, Detroit Archbishop Allen Henry Vigneron, on Wednesday directed questions back to the USCCB.
Starting a side hustle. You may have started driving for Uber, delivering food for Postmates or taking on other freelance work as a way of bringing in extra cash. But the move can trigger a tax bill, tax experts say. For starters, you are probably not having taxes withheld from the paychecks you earn as an independent contractor, says Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant and tax expert with TurboTax. That means you could be hit with a tax bill at the end of the year, she says.\n\nAD\n\nSome freelancers who still have a traditional 9-to-5 job may be able to avoid that tax hit by having more taxes withheld from their paychecks by their main employer, Greene-Lewis says. For other people, the surprise tax bill may be a hint that they may need to start making estimated tax payments every quarter to avoid falling behind on taxes, she adds.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that freelance earnings of $400 or more are subject to self-employment taxes, meaning that you must pay both the employer and employee share of Social Security and Medicare taxes. That adds up to a total tax rate of 15.3 percent, says Cari Weston, a director with the American Institute of CPAs. However, self-employed workers can also deduct the employer portion of those payroll taxes, which account for half of the tax rate, or 7.65 percent, Weston says. They may also be able to write off some other business-related costs associated with their side gigs, such as advertising, marketing and software, that can help lower their tax bill, Greene-Lewis says.\n\nSaying I do. Once the vows are exchanged and the honeymoon is over, married couples filing their first joint tax return could come across what's known as the marriage penalty — or a higher tax bill than they would have owed if they each filed separately. This typically happens when the two spouses earn similar incomes. Getting married can land them in a higher tax bracket and therefore result in a bigger tax bill, Weston says.\n\nAD\n\nFor example, a couple with each spouse earning $100,000 a year would pay nearly $800 more in income taxes after getting married than if each person had filed separately as a single person, according to a calculator from the Tax Policy Center. Depending on how much each spouse is withholding from his or her paycheck, the difference could result in a tax bill. (However, some couples may end up with a lower tax bill, or what's known as a marriage bonus. If one person is not working or earns significantly less than the other spouse, it could put them into a lower tax bracket.)\n\nFiling for divorce. If you got divorced, then you probably won't qualify for some of the tax deductions you claimed as a married person. For example, divorced couples with children will find that only one parent can claim child-related tax breaks, such as the adoption credit, the earned-income tax credit and education credits, says Dave Du Val, chief customer advocacy officer at TaxAudit.com. For some people, becoming single could also mean landing in a higher tax bracket, Greene-Lewis says, especially if their spouse earned significantly less money — and brought them into a lower tax bracket.\n\nAD\n\nTapping into your retirement account. If you withdrew money from, say a 401(k) or an individual retirement account, then you might owe Uncle Sam. People who withdraw money before age 59½ must also typically pay an early-withdrawal penalty tax of 10 percent unless they qualify for an exception because of a medical emergency, purchase of a first home or another financial hardship.\n\nAD\n\nFinancial firms will usually automatically withhold 20 percent before paying out such early-retirement distributions, but it may not be enough to cover all of the taxes and penalties owed, Du Val says. For some people, the withdrawal may push them into a higher tax bracket, which could increase their overall tax bill, Greene-Lewis says.\n\nSelling your home. You may owe Uncle Sam if you sell a home for much more than what you bought it for. If you're single and made a profit of more than $250,000 on your home, or if you're married and had gains greater than $500,000, then you may owe taxes on the sale. Also, any gains from the sale of a vacation home or rental property generally needs to be reported as capital gains, which would make it subject to a 20 percent tax if the home has been owned for longer than a year.\n\nLosing your job. Some people may not realize that income received from unemployment benefits is taxable, Greene-Lewis says. While recipients are given the option of having taxes withheld from their unemployment checks, some people may overlook that or decline if they are in a tight financial situation, she says. However, taxes on those benefits will be due when they file their tax returns and could eat into any tax refund they are expecting.\n\nAD\n\nReceiving an inheritance. If someone dies and leaves you an asset that they would have owed taxes on, that asset is now taxable to you, Du Val says. For example, say you inherit a relative's retirement savings. If the person would have owed taxes on the savings, you would owe income taxes on that inheritance, he says. Many common forms of inheritance, however, including life-insurance payouts and cash transfers, do not trigger tax bills for the recipient, because there was no tax bill owed by the person who died, Du Val says. Some very large inheritances that are greater than $5.49 million per individual may be subject to the estate tax of up to 40 percent.\n\nAD\n\nPeople inheriting property could also face tax bills depending on what they do with it. Take the example of a person who inherits a house and sells it right away. He may not owe any taxes if the sale price is the same as the inherited price, Weston says. But someone who inherits a house and sells it years later at a higher price would owe taxes on the difference, he says.\n\nWinning a vacation, car or other prize. You probably already know to expect a huge tax bill if you strike it rich by winning the lottery. But winning noncash prizes such as a car, or a vacation, can also trigger a tax bill, Weston says. Winners will typically owe income taxes on the cash value of that prize and should report it on their tax returns. Some game shows will make that reporting easy by sending participants a 1099 form, Weston says.\n\nAD\n\nBut some people may also face tax bills after coming across less obvious prizes, such as fans who catch a home-run ball at an important baseball game. That ball has value and is taxable, Du Val says. If you returned the ball in exchange for tickets or a memorabilia such as a signed jersey, that may also be considered taxable income, but tax experts say the rules are not clear.
Instead, she has been busying herself with finding a new school for Barron in Florida and working on her own farewell video message to the country, which she released Monday.\n\nSeveral people who have been in touch with Melania Trump said she is aware of the intense criticism both she and her husband have gotten since the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot, but that unlike her spouse she appears completely unfazed. They said she would have been happy to attend President-elect Joe Biden's swearing-in ceremony, as every outgoing president and first lady have for the past 152 years. But rather than dwell on what could have been, she focuses on what she has control over: choreographing her own exit, trying to cement her legacy as a first lady who devoted much time to renovations of the White House, and making plans to continue her Be Best initiative. Quietly, she has also been working with Chief Usher Timothy Harleth to facilitate the move-in of the Bidens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe has hours left as first lady, but she is not the type to wander around the rooms of the White House in deep reflection of what happened, of what could have been, said one person in touch with her. She is Melania — she keeps the focus on what's next.\n\nAnother said that unlike her furious husband, Melania is good.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump released her own farewell video message to the country on Jan. 18. (FLOTUS/Twitter)\n\nSince Jan. 6, every day has dumped more bad news on the president, including his historic second impeachment. But one person close to the president said it can be hard to predict what will bother him most and that even with all that was going on, he was particularly upset that Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez, Tom Hanks and other stars agreed to perform as part of Biden's inaugural celebrations.\n\nPresident Trump, in his days as the star of The Apprentice reality-TV show, often attended star-studded events. A believer in the power of being associated with marquee names, he invited Elton John and Billy Joel to his and Melania's wedding in 2005. But his harsh rhetoric, hard-line immigration policy and other stances during the 2016 campaign led Hollywood to largely boycott his inauguration. Now as Trump rages about what he describes as unfair treatment from all sides — from people he hired, from businesses he helped with his policies, from members of his own party and even from celebrities — his wife just shrugs and moves on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn her seven-minute farewell message video, Melania Trump said she was humbled to serve as first lady and called it the greatest honor of my life. She singled out all of the people I have taken home in my heart, including soldiers, law enforcement officials, children, mothers, caregivers and all the nurses, doctors and other health-care professionals who have responded to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nShe read from prepared remarks at a White House lectern and did not specifically address the Capitol riot or her husband's role in stoking it, but she stressed her concern about violence. Be passionate in everything you do, she said. But always remember that violence is never the answer and will never be justified.\n\nShe urged Americans to focus on what unites us, and to rise above what divides us, to always choose love over hatred, peace over violence and others before yourself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTogether, as one national family, we can continue to be the light of hope for future generations and carry on America's legacy of rising our nation to greater heights through our spirit of courage, goodness and fate, she said.\n\nThe video was designed in part to separate herself from the president's pugilistic tone, according to a White House aide. Some had hoped that she would at least mention, if not welcome, incoming first lady Jill Biden, but she did not.\n\nAfter she departs the White House with her husband Wednesday, she plans to duck out of the spotlight for a while, friends said. But she plans on resurrecting her Be Best campaign that focused on children's well-being, including raising awareness of the dangers of cyberbullying and opioids and other drugs.\n\nAD\n\nShe plans to continue and expand it, said Kellyanne Conway, a former White House adviser who has stayed in touch with her. She knows her input and influence on her legacy issues can be greater outside the White House.\n\nAD\n\nMelania Trump has been told that she will have fewer restrictions and a freer hand to do what she wants once she is no longer first lady. Paolo Zampolli, a businessman and former modeling agent who introduced Melania to Donald in the 1990s, said she is absolutely determined to grow Be Best and continue all the work she did for children.\n\nThe soon-to-be former first lady also is expected to be involved in the site selection, planning and design of the Trump presidential library, which probably will be located in Florida. Her stepdaughter Ivanka Trump also has expressed interest in the library and has bought a new home in Florida. Right from the start of the Trump administration, Melania, 50, and Ivanka, 39, clashed. Even before Melania officially moved into the White House, Ivanka Trump told people she would like the first lady's office to be renamed the first family's office. Both women also wanted to decorate the Oval Office — in very different styles — until the president stepped in and canceled both plans.\n\nAD\n\nThe library location has not even been scouted yet, but Ivanka has made her interest clear, said one person aware of the discussions. As usual, Melania will have to contend with the other family members.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to Barron, Trump has three children from his first marriage — Ivanka, Don Jr. and Eric — and one daughter, Tiffany, from his second marriage.\n\nMelania Trump had hoped her husband would win in November: She campaigned for him, flying in the final days before the election to key states, including Wisconsin, where she called Trump's first impeachment a sham and described Biden as a socialist. But while President Trump spent two months disputing the election results, his wife accepted that Biden had won.\n\nAD\n\nConway said the first lady has urged the president to end his stop the steal campaign that alleged voter fraud, and that she did not support holding the Jan. 6 rally.\n\nShe was against the protracted challenge to the election results, especially after the results were certified, Conway said. I know she was against the [Jan. 6] rally and saying things to him. I think she thought it was futile and possibly chaotic. She was the only family member who was not there.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Conway, the first lady was complying with requests for record-keeping regarding items at the White House and not watching television when a mob first breached the Capitol. When she saw what was happening, she urged her husband to intervene and end the riot.\n\nAD\n\nMelania Trump wants to be seen as independent from her husband, but how successful she will be at that task is unclear. Although she did not support the president's false claims that the election was stolen from him, she has over the years backed up other highly controversial claims by her husband, including his birther conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States and therefore not a legitimate president.\n\nThe first lady also remained silent for several days after the deadly riot, and then sounded oddly absorbed with her own image at a time of national crisis in a statement she released Jan. 11. I find it shameful that surrounding these tragic events there has been salacious gossip, unwarranted personal attacks, and false misleading accusations on me, she wrote, while also calling for a national healing.\n\nAD\n\nMaryAnne Borrelli, a professor of government at Connecticut College, said it is going to be difficult for the first lady to separate herself from a president impeached for inciting violence at the Capitol. We don't know all she has done behind the scenes, Borelli said, but people know she did not invite Jill Biden to the White House and joined her husband in abandoning other powerful political symbols of the transfer of power.\n\nAD\n\nSomeone who has known Melania Trump for many years said people forget that she only became a U.S. citizen in 2006. She is the first spouse of a president who did not grow up speaking English and was raised modestly in a socialist country. As an old friend said, no matter how bad some days in the White House were, it was still a dream come true.\n\nOver the last four years, my family has had the immense honor of being able to call the 'People's House' our home, Melania Trump said in a separate statement released Monday that was aimed at raising awareness of all the renovations she oversaw in the White House. Widely criticized for focusing her efforts on the White House tennis court while people were dying in the coronavirus pandemic, this time she addressed the devastating and unexpected loss of life and hardship, and said that as a result, it was with a great sensitivity to the wider national backdrop that I unveiled two long-planned projects on the White House grounds.\n\nAD\n\nHer parents, who have been a constant presence with her in the White House, also are moving to Palm Beach. While the president's team waged legal battles alleging widespread fraud, the first lady, who has a considerable wardrobe and shoe collection, began packing right after the November election. It may come as no surprise then that, according to several people who know the couple, Melania Trump is far more mentally ready for the post-presidency than her husband.
But in February 2017, journalists uncovered anti-Semitic and homophobic tweets on an account belonging to Meklat, and his meteoric rise was quickly overshadowed by a staggering fall.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow Meklat is back, attempting to clear his name. Last month, he published a book, Autopsie, which contends that young people are drawn to social media without fully understanding the consequences it might have on their lives. And he has launched a full-fledged apology campaign, making the rounds on all the major talk shows to explain himself to a highly skeptical public. Central to his argument: Second chances are rarely given to people of color, to whom extra scrutiny always applies.\n\nOften — always — I say that I'm sorry. Because it's true. My apologies are extremely sincere. But sometimes, I feel that there's still a suspicion, he said in an interview with The Washington Post. In France, I think that essentially it's different for someone who's called Medhi to say he's sorry.\n\nSome young people of color are national heroes in France. Among them is Kylian Mbappé, the 19-year-old star of the French national team that won the 2018 World Cup. Souvenir jerseys bearing his name are ubiquitous.\n\nBut it's true that other young minorities have been scrutinized out of public life. A prime example is Mennel Ibtissem, a 22-year-old singer who dazzled with a rendition of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah on France's version of The Voice competition. But viewers scrolled through her social media history and found comments that appeared to excuse the July 2016 terrorist attack in Nice, when a man drove a truck into a crowded promenade. Under pressure, Ibtissem withdrew from the competition.\n\nIn Meklat's case, at issue are nearly two dozen tweets he posted under the name of Marcelin Deschamps, which he says was inspired by the Dada artist Marcel Duchamp. Ostensibly to parody the average lower-middle-class French voter, Meklat used the account to attack any number of public targets, but the remarks against gays and Jews elicited the most outrage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn one of these, Marcelin Deschamps calls for a physical attack on Alain Finkielkraut, a conservative Jewish intellectual and the son of Polish-Jewish refugees who escaped the Holocaust.\n\nThey should have broken his legs, Meklat wrote, that son of a whore.\n\nAs part of his apology tour, Meklat called Finkielkraut and asked to see him. I was touched by that, Finkielkraut said in an interview. He invited Meklat for tea and was curious to hear what he had to say.\n\nWe talked. He seemed engaged in the work of redemption, and he apologized for the extremely violent, and notably anti-Semitic tweets. But I don't know if it was sincere or a kind of opportunism, Finkielkraut said, noting that he disapproved of how Meklat presented himself as a victim. He was between penitence and accusation.\n\nAD\n\nFor some, especially in the Jewish community, Meklat embodies what in France is called the new anti-Semitism, a hatred of Jews particularly among immigrants and their offspring. Twelve Jews have been killed in France since 2003, more than any other country in Europe. In most of those cases, the suspects were young men of Arab or West African descent.\n\nAD\n\n[Meklat] incarnates a part of the mentality of the difficult neighborhoods, where there is a strong strain of anti-Semitism and an obsession with Jews, said Noémie Halioua, a French journalist and author of a book on one of the recent anti-Semitic killings, in which she called the likes of Meklat a bigger threat to Jewish safety than the rise of the far right.\n\nIt's evident that I'm not an anti-Semite, Meklat said, when asked to respond. It's impossible.\n\nAD\n\nHe pointed to his body of work, including a number of columns he and his collaborator, Badroudine Saïd Abdallah, wrote for Libération's Bondy Blog on the theme of anti-Semitism in the banlieues.\n\nThese are things we dealt with, that we were aware of, he said. It's inconceivable that I would be the fruit of this anti-Semitism, what you call the 'new anti-Semitism' or even historical anti-Semitism, because of course France has always been a country marked by that question.\n\nIn Paris, it came as quite a shock that Meklat was given a book deal with Grasset, one of the most prestigious French publishing houses.\n\nAD\n\nI didn't want Grasset to become an instrument of rehabilitating some hypocrite, Olivier Nora, Grasset's president, said in an interview. But after reading the manuscript and meeting Meklat, who was then working as an assistant in a perfume shop, Nora overcame his reservations. (He skipped the usual step of presenting the concept to Grasset's editorial board, which he knew would pan it.)\n\nAD\n\nI understood in reading this kid, for a part of his generation, that words spoken or written in the virtual universe were themselves virtual and had nothing to do with the real world, said Nora, who also happens to be Jewish. I don't say that as an excuse for him, just as something that struck me.\n\nThe publisher added: I have a number of authors in my catalogue who I know when they were young wrote some indefensible things which embarrassed them today but which I know they've made disappear.\n\nAD\n\nYouth seems to be Meklat's ultimate defense. I think you have to remember that I was 18 when I created it, Meklat said, referring to the Marcelin Deschamps account.\n\nAD\n\nThe controversial posts, however, continued into his 20s.\n\nParisian tastemakers have yet to rule definitively on Meklat.\n\nFrédéric Martel, a French writer and radio personality active in the gay community, once invited Meklat to speak on a panel defending same-sex marriage. In discovering his anti-Semitic and homophobic messages, I felt betrayed, he said.
Mr. Lankford began working for the News, then an afternoon newspaper, in 1959, when the civil rights movement was gaining strength, along with White resistance to it. For several years, he seemed to be everywhere in the South, covering major civil rights flash points.\n\nAD\n\nWorking as both a reporter and a photographer, Mr. Lankford won numerous awards for his front-line coverage, which sometimes put him in danger. He covered the Freedom Riders, the civil rights activists who rode buses into the South to protest segregated transportation facilities, only to be attacked by White thugs and often jailed.\n\nAD\n\nHe covered marches and other demonstrations led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth in Birmingham and across the South. Pretending to be a student, he photographed James Meredith in class when Meredith became the University of Mississippi's first African American student in 1962. He outran U.S. marshals to the local Associated Press office, which put his picture on the news wire.\n\nMr. Lankford reported on the bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963, which killed four Black girls. He took a memorable photograph of civil rights marchers, led by John Lewis and Hosea Williams, crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965. The peaceful marchers were beaten by White police officers on a day so notorious that it became known as Bloody Sunday.\n\nAD\n\nThat man was present for almost all the historical civil rights events, former Birmingham police officer Teresa Thorne, who interviewed Mr. Lankford for an upcoming book about the civil rights era, told the News. He had a lot of respect for Martin Luther King Jr. and Fred Shuttlesworth. He admired their courage. He was on a friendly basis with them.\n\nAD\n\nDuring those years, Mr. Lankford was not just a multi-portfolioed Birmingham News reporter, Diane McWhorter wrote in Carry Me Home, her Pulitzer Prize-winning history of the civil rights movement in Birmingham. He also had a secondary identity as a surrogate cop, spy, and 'have gun, will travel' agent provocateur.\n\nAt the behest of Vincent Townsend, assistant publisher of the News, Mr. Lankford had a lavish expense account to buy wiretap and photographic surveillance equipment. He had a truck with a phone company logo on the side and became adept at climbing telephone poles and putting wiretaps on the lines. He entered churches and union meeting halls to put surveillance devices in place.\n\nAD\n\nHe also worked closely with Birmingham's police department, which was led until 1963 by the notoriously brutal segregationist Eugene Bull Connor. One of Connor's detectives introduced Mr. Lankford to members of the Ku Klux Klan, which saved his life at least once. After he photographed White gangs beating civil rights protesters, Mr. Lankford was roughed up in an alley by Klan members until one of them recognized him as Bull's boy.\n\nAD\n\nHe was embedded with the police department, Thorne told the News in its obituary of Mr. Lankford. By his own admission, he became too involved and too close for an objective journalist. He did not regret it one bit.\n\nMr. Lankford said he was trying to balance the responsibilities of covering a White police force and Black civil rights leaders. At the same time, he was trying to please his boss, Townsend, a Birmingham power broker who wanted to know every word they're saying . . . 10 minutes after they've said it, Mr. Lankford told McWhorter.\n\nAD\n\nOne scheme Mr. Lankford learned of was a plot by local officials to assassinate Shuttlesworth, one of Birmingham's most important civil rights figures. The attempt failed, but no one — including Mr. Lankford — reported it to federal authorities at the time.\n\nA young frightened country kid trying to be a police reporter, he said, knows he can't snitch on a cop and get away with it.\n\nAD\n\nAnother time, Mr. Lankford was riding with police as they tried to follow King and his brother, the Rev. A.D. King, to what the police thought would be a rendezvous with women who were not their wives. Mr. Lankford said his task was to pull down King's trousers as vice squad agents stormed the room. The police lost the King brothers' car in traffic, which Mr. Lankford later said was the best outcome for all concerned.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1963, Mr. Lankford was riding with a police detective past the headquarters of the neo-Nazi States Rights Party, whose leader, J.B. Stoner was later imprisoned for bombing a Black church. When the detective shouted, Now!, Mr. Lankford rose up in the back seat and fired a shotgun blast at Stoner's car, blowing off the roof.\n\nHe also wiretapped a meeting in which his onetime protector, Connor, promised to give firefighters a pay raise if he were reelected as public safety commissioner. When word got around, Birmingham voters changed the city's form of government, forcing Connor out of his job.\n\nAD\n\nMy father understood the vital role the free press plays in monitoring the actions of government at every level, Mr. Lankford's daughter Dawn Bowling said in a statement to The Washington Post. His relationships uniquely enabled him to report on and photograph countless historical events that may have otherwise not been made public.\n\nAD\n\nThomas Earl Lankford was born Sept. 20, 1935, in Piedmont, Ala., and grew up in Hokes Bluff, in northeastern Alabama. His father was a steelworker, his mother a homemaker.\n\nAt the University of Alabama, from which he graduated and received a master's degree in journalism, Mr. Lankford was editor of the school newspaper.\n\nAfter working in Birmingham, he was editor of the Huntsville News from 1969 to 1977. He later worked in public relations in New Orleans, then spent 18 years in Saudi Arabia, doing public relations for construction projects and a Saudi royal commission.\n\nAD\n\nWhen he returned to the United States in 1999, he worked as a commercial truck driver until he had a serious heart attack in 2008. He later became a greeter at a Walmart.\n\nAD\n\nHis first marriage, to Sherry Dean Murray, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 35 years, the former Chalermporn Tan Changseang of Gadsden; two daughters from his first marriage; a brother; and five grandchildren.\n\nMr. Lankford's surveillance activities and arrangements with police may have violated modern journalism ethics, but he maintained that he was merely doing what was needed to document the turbulent times he witnessed.\n\nEverything we did, he told McWhorter, was certainly for the public good even if we did not go by the letter of the law.
Three months after our wedding, everything changed. One night I tried to initiate sex (this was something he said he wanted me to do). He said that he didn't want to have sex with me because I had gained weight and he was no longer attracted to me.\n\nI was hurt and humiliated.\n\nFirst of all, I had only gained five pounds and was at a completely normal weight. But I went on a diet and lost it all. I tried to be the perfect wife so he would accept me.\n\nAD\n\nWhen I was pregnant he wouldn't come near me. He is a good man. He is home at night, helps around the house and has been a good provider, but these rejections continue to affect me deeply.\n\nAD\n\nI have managed to put this issue aside, and we have had some wonderful years. But it has caused me to feel insecure, especially because after childbirth and aging my body has changed. I don't want him to see me naked. He doesn't show any empathy, even at our counseling sessions.\n\nHe told the counselor that he married me because I was beautiful. I suppose that's a compliment, but I feel ripped off. I married this man for love and emotional security.\n\nHow do I deal with this?\n\nAD\n\nHolding On\n\nHolding On: As a newly married man, your husband was showing you who he was. He may love you deeply, but his relatively narrow sexual preferences are quite obvious.\n\nYour shame over his rejections means that you have spent the last quarter-century justifying someone else's superficial and unkind assessment of you.\n\nAD\n\nThis armchair psychologist wants to look you in the eye and remind you that no one else has the right to define you!\n\nAt this point, your goal should be to find ways to reframe your reactive emotions and find a way to fairly assess this relationship. Do you want to stay with him?\n\nI hope a day will come when you can stop pinning your personal self-esteem to your husband's narrow metric, and quite honestly love yourself for everything that you are, and exactly as you are. When you do, you will come into your own power, and the balance in your marriage will shift. Individual counseling would be very useful for you.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: My husband's cousin Jonathan is extremely well off. Jon and his wife invite us to many of their parties for their four children, and we attend every single one, bringing a gift each time.\n\nAD\n\nRecently we attended a baby shower for their fourth child, bringing an expensive gift and a blanket I had knit for them. We never got a thank you.\n\nWe bought our house last year and invited family and friends over to celebrate. Jon and his wife said they would attend with their four children but did not show up.\n\nWe saw on social media that the two of them went out to a nice dinner that same night. We were hurt.\n\nToday my mother hosted a beautiful baby shower for our first child.\n\nAD\n\nMy husband's extended family (including Jon's wife) were invited. She declined.\n\nI'm now very tempted to decline any of their gift-giving invitations from now on, but my husband says we should be the bigger people. Am I being petty?\n\nConfused\n\nConfused: I don't think you are being petty. I think you are being proportional.\n\nAD\n\nIt is natural to consider pulling back from people who don't appreciate or reciprocate. What you shouldn't do is proactively decline all future invitations.\n\nTheir behavior toward you has released you from feeling 100 percent obligated to accept every invitation they issue. From now on, you should spend time with them if/when you want to.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: Finding My Way described life after discovering her guy was talking to other women, receiving nude photos and was registered on a dating site.\n\nI know it sounds crazy, but I actually put up with this when we were dating and then went on to marry the guy!\n\nI hope she doesn't make the same mistake.\n\nLearned the Hard Way\n\nLearned the Hard Way: Reading the signs, accepting the truth and making rational choices will help Finding to avoid your fate.
Born of my experiences and grave concern for today's families, I started studying Apple's parental controls 18 months ago. I wanted to be prepared for the Pandora's box I knew I would be opening when I bequeathed my 11-year-old daughter with my hand-me-down iPhone, and I wanted to better understand the angst of my generation.\n\nSince then, I've spent 100-plus hours researching the existing functionality, talking with experienced parents and conducting focus groups to understand the complexities involved when parenting technology, and what the barriers are to using Apple's parental controls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter counting 393 steps to set up parental controls for the five devices I manage, I can tell you that not only is Apple's existing offering onerous and labyrinthine, but also that we parents do not have the technology we need.\n\nRaising kids in this digital age is a tricky game, and I often feel as though I have a devil and an angel on my shoulders. Although I want to encourage our kids in their development of 21st-century skills and prepare them for future STEM careers, I'm also concerned about the addictive nature of these devices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFurther, I find it negligent that there is no automatic notification of available parental controls when we create an Apple ID or set up a new device.\n\nIn my research, I found that parents just don't know, and how would they without proper outreach? This is particularly alarming when the default settings on all Apple devices are set to allow explicit content.\n\nGiven that 78 percent of teenagers now have iPhones, every time a child is born, so is an Apple customer. We are building their pipeline of customers for the future, and Apple can do better.\n\nWhile Apple did announce on Jan. 8 that further feature enhancements are planned, it also said, We lead the industry by offering intuitive parental controls.\n\nAD\n\nI don't believe this, and that's why I sent Apple chief executive Tim Cook this three-page letter offering to share my insight with his engineering team.\n\nAD\n\nBarring the chance he reads it and actually does something about these ideas, I have created this Parental Controls Resource Guide for parents of younger children to inform them of Apple's basic functionality and to show them how to use it.\n\nIn my experience, parents are increasingly playing the role of chief technology officer of their households, and we are on the front lines dealing with the daily aggravations these devices impose on our interactions with our kids. It could and should be so much easier, and I'm concerned that Apple doesn't understand the severity of the problem.\n\nAD\n\nWhile at every level our trust in Silicon Valley has been rattled, and Common Sense Media and the Center for Humane Technology is now calling for more accountability, I would like to see more collaboration and partnership.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of just sitting back and accepting what Silicon Valley hands us, we need to advocate for the technology we need. We cannot afford to be bystanders to our future.\n\nJulie Paul is the founder and CEO of Heard it From a Friend.

Dear Amy: My husband and I have been married for six years. He is a Christian, and is active in his church. I am an atheist. While he tries to convert me on occasion, we have no problems with our religious differences. In fact, the conversations we have are some of the highlights of our marriage.\n\nMy husband is not a tidy man. He rarely does any cleaning, but will help with the dishes or laundry sometimes, and that's good enough for me. The one area that I have (slightly) nagged him about over the years is his car. I usually end up waiting for his car to get really bad, then go and clean it out myself, or pay to have it detailed while he is at work.\n\nI regularly ask him to clean out his car, but in six long years, he has never done it. Until yesterday. Yesterday, he suddenly spent two hours cleaning out his car. I was thrilled! Then, he told me why he cleaned out his car.\n\nApparently, his pastor had needed a ride somewhere. After the ride in my husband's car, the pastor gave my husband some great advice: Clean out your car. And he immediately did it.\n\nAmy, I am happy that my husband finally cleaned his own car. But I'm a little upset that after six years of me asking him to perform this small task, he listened to his pastor and not to me.\n\nAm I looking a gift horse in the mouth, or am I right to feel a bit slighted?\n\nBent Out Of Shape\n\nOne reason your husband has never cleaned his car is because every once in a while — when it gets really bad — a magical elf appears and does it for him. If he has been an especially good boy, the elf actually pays for the car to be professionally detailed while he's at work! No wonder he has religion: Because in his life good things just . . . happen!\n\nThe way to stop nagging is to simply stop. Disengage. Most of us listen to people outside our families a little more closely than we listen to family members. This dynamic is why you can bug your child about something for years, but the minute a peer says the same thing, it becomes true.\n\nYour husband is showing you that he understands that cleanliness is next to godliness. You should roll your eyes at the source of this sudden transformation, and tell him you hope it sticks.\n\nDear Amy: My husband and I are friends with another couple. We usually get along great and have lots of fun . . . except when the male friend, Jack, goes into braggart mode.\n\nJack will start in on my husband, stating he can beat him at any game, especially racquetball. My husband made the mistake of asking Jack to play racquetball — more for exercise than competition, but he has stopped asking since the chest-beating started.\n\nJack's wife excuses his behavior by saying, This is just Jack being Jack. Jack blames the behavior on his competitive upbringing.\n\nIt is obnoxious, annoying and happens too often. Jack went so far — once — as to call us both stupid, later apologizing.\n\nAny suggestions on how to get this to stop?\n\nHad It\n\nYou can draw Jack's attention to his behavior and see if he is willing to change (his apology to you means that he knows he crossed the line). People who brag are overcompensating in the most obvious way.\n\nThe next time he flies into full-braggart mode, you can try to slow things down and get his attention by saying, gently, Jack, you know we would still like you even if you weren't the best at everything? You don't have to prove your greatness to us — we're your friends. Repeat, if necessary.\n\nKindness might be the way to kill off this terrible habit.\n\nDear Amy: I was shocked by your response to Not your Chum in Chico, who didn't like it when coffee clerks made small talk. Bah humbug! Why be such a grouch when people are just trying to be friendly?\n\nDisappointed\n\nI love pleasantries, but don't like specific comments regarding what I am purchasing, or whether I look tired, stressed, happy or sad. I realize that clerks have a very tough and repetitive job to do, and that they are sometimes forced to greet customers in a specific way. I think that for most people, a smile, a simple greeting and then fulfilling the order competently is appreciated.
Dear Heloise: A standard pillowcase makes a good cover for a large standing mixer. I got one to match my kitchen decor.\n\n— Mrs. G., via email\n\nDear Heloise: Laundry experts agree that ladies should wear a bra two to three times before laundering it, but not on consecutive days.\n\nSince I don't like putting unwashed clothing back into my dresser drawers, I devised a way to keep track of how often a bra has been worn so I know when to launder it.\n\nAD\n\nI have two S-hooks hanging from the rod in my closet. After a bra is worn once, it goes on the first hook. After the second time, it goes on the second hook. One more wearing, and washed it gets! At times, I have three or four bras hanging on the S-hooks ready to be worn.\n\nAD\n\n— P. A., via email\n\nDear Heloise: This isn't my original idea, and I'm not sure where I heard it, but I have repurposed a hand soap dispenser to use it as a toothpaste dispenser. I find it to be very convenient and better than a tube. I used a little water to begin with for the right consistency to be able to dispense. It's a winner.\n\n— A Reader, via email\n\nDear Heloise: My family and I like to share and experiment with jams, jellies, flavored cream cheeses and other bread spreads.\n\nAD\n\nWe slice bagels into ½ -inch slices vertically instead of slicing the bagel once horizontally. This gives us a small section of bread to use to sample our toppings.\n\n— Caroline H. in Pennsylvania\n\nDear Heloise: I've always heard the adage: Marriage is 50-50. It's not. Marriage is 100-100. Each person has to give their all to the marriage every day.\n\nAD\n\n— J.W. in California\n\nDear Heloise: I'd advise folks to make sure their house numbers are visible from the street. The numbers, whether attached to the house or painted on the curb, can fade, chip, fall off, be covered in snow or dirt — not good. They must be legible.\n\nThere are companies out there that will paint numbers on your curb, or check with a neighborhood kid. Make sure all paint jobs correspond with your homeowner's association's rules and regulations.\n\nAD\n\n— James W. in Massachusetts\n\nDear Readers: When a recipe calls for veggies to be chopped, diced or minced, do you know the difference? Let's take a look:\n\nChop: Large, rough, uneven pieces\n\nDice: More uniform, prettier pieces, to sprinkle on top of dish, perhaps\n\nMince: Small, fine pieces — flavors are more easily released from minced foods, such as garlic!\n\nDear Heloise: A reminder to your readers: Wash cloth masks frequently.

Climate and Energy\n\nBiden would reshape how America powers itself in the name of fighting global warming, an epic conversion requiring a $2 trillion down payment over his four-year term. It would surely be a heavy lift to get through Congress, even if he argues that it's a good way to stimulate the economy. Biden's climate agenda drives his approach to energy issues. He has vowed to ban new oil and gas permits on public land and water. Many planned oil, gas and mining ventures -- even those on private land -- face heightened risk of rejection or longer approval times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n• Rejoin the Paris Agreement on global warming. Trump withdrew the U.S. from this pact, through which almost 200 countries have pledged limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\n\n• Kill the Keystone XL pipeline, the TC Energy Corp. project proposed to ferry 830,000 barrels of crude daily from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska.\n\n• Make the U.S. electricity system carbon-free by 2035, meaning if there are any emissions, they will be captured. That will require much more solar and wind power and a revamp of the electrical grid. Coal and natural gas still produce more than 60% of U.S. electricity.\n\n• Make the U.S. economy reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This promise relies on tougher fuel-efficiency standards accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. To make them run, Biden would install 500,000 public charging outlets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump redirected billions of dollars to upgrade barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border, made it harder to gain asylum in the U.S. and barred immigration by citizens of 12 countries. Biden calls immigration an irrefutable source of our strength and can tweak policy on his own. But his more ambitious plans would require the approval of Congress, which hasn't passed a major immigration law since 1986.\n\n• Undo Trump's country-specific immigration bans, restrictions on asylum-seekers and expansion of the public-charge rule, which denies legal-resident status to immigrants deemed likely to need government assistance for things such as food.\n\n• Stop spending on the U.S.-Mexico border wall and direct funds instead toward higher-tech border enforcement.\n\nAD\n\n• Raise to 125,000 the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. in 2021. That's up from Trump's cap of 18,000 in 2020, and from the target of 110,000 for 2016, the year before Trump became president.\n\nAD\n\n• Increase the number of employment-based visas beyond the current annual cap of 140,000.\n\n• Restore protections blocking deportation of 660,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, a group known as Dreamers.\n\n• Create a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.\n\nTaxes\n\nBiden would raise taxes on several fronts to finance his domestic agenda but says only people earning $400,000 or more would pay a higher amount. His best chance to implement his tax-hike plan would likely be if Democrats win big in the 2022 congressional midterm elections, increasing their majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nAD\n\n• Raise the top federal income tax rate to 39.6%, where it was before Trump and congressional Republicans cut it to 37% starting in 2018. This top rate would apply to income beyond $400,000 (more for married couples filing jointly).\n\nAD\n\n• Raise the corporate tax rate to 28%. Trump and congressional Republicans slashed it to 21% from 35%.\n\n• Impose a minimum annual tax on U.S. companies equal to 15% of profits reported to investors to prevent companies from using legal tax breaks to reduce their tax bill below that level.\n\n• Enact a payroll tax of 12.4% on income earned above $400,000 to boost the solvency of the Social Security system and expand benefits. Currently, only wages up to $137,700 are taxed to fund the Social Security program.\n\nAD\n\n• Tax capital gains as ordinary income, which would almost double the current 20% rate on stock trades and real estate deals for people earning more than $1 million a year. This would effectively eliminate the so-called carried interest tax break enjoyed by private equity managers.\n\nGuns\n\nAs a senator, Biden had a hand in adopting mandatory background checks for gun sales, which exist to this day, and a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons, which expired in 2004. The gun rights lobby, despite recent turmoil in its ranks, remains a potent political force.\n\nAD\n\n• Create federal grants to encourage more states to enact red flag laws allowing family members or police to ask a court to temporarily remove firearms from people exhibiting violent behavior.\n\nAD\n\n• Require more FBI criminal background checks. Biden would stop exempting private sales unless the transaction is between close family members. He also wants to allow the government 10 days, up from three, for the checks to be carried out.\n\n• Resurrect the semiautomatic weapons ban and another on high-capacity magazines. This time, Biden says, manufacturers wouldn't be allowed to skirt the law by making minor changes that don't limit the weapon's lethality, as was commonly done to undermine the effectiveness of the ban from 1994 to 2004.\n\nHealth Care\n\nRoughly 20 million Americans have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The measure became law in 2010 without the support of any Republicans in Congress. The Trump administration eliminated a financial penalty for noncompliance and cut funding for programs that help sign people up. Biden says he would protect what remains of the law, and expand it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n• Eliminate the earnings cap on Obamacare tax credits that subsidize the purchase of health insurance. The cap currently limits the benefit to those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level.\n\n• Lower the eligibility age for Medicare, government health insurance for the elderly, to 60 from 65.\n\n• Offer a public option insurance plan run by the federal government that Americans could consider alongside private plans.\n\nForeign Relations\n\nBiden sees the U.S. at the head of the table, leading the world to address the most urgent global challenges. Under Trump, the U.S. retreated from its historic leadership role, creating a vacuum that China tried to fill. Biden vowed to recommit the U.S. to multinational institutions, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nAD\n\n• Revoke Trump's plan to quit the World Health Organization.\n\nAD\n\n• Revive the 2015 multinational deal intended to limit Iran's nuclear work in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. Trump scorned it as one-sided. Biden says the U.S. would rejoin if Iran returns to compliance with its terms.\n\nTariffs and Trade\n\nDon't expect a swift reversal of Trump's America First policy. Biden pledged on his campaign website, There is no going back to business as usual on trade.\n\n• Re-evaluate Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. Biden said he would work with U.S. allies, with the goal of exerting collective leverage to force China to change its economic practices.\n\n• Get input from labor and environmental groups in any trade negotiations. This would include any potential revival of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which proceeded without the U.S. (and with a new name) after Trump withdrew in 2017.\n\nAD\n\nEducation and Child/Elder Care\n\nBiden's $775 billion plan to offer universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, plus improved child care and elder care, is premised on Congress passing Democratic bills that haven't gotten through before.\n\n• Forgive up to $10,000 in student loan debt per American. This appears to be something Biden could do on his own, though it would be expensive -- $390 billion, by one measure.\n\n• Raise Social Security benefits for people over the age of 78, for those with low income and for widows and widowers.\n\n• Guarantee 12 weeks of paid leave from work for new parents or those caring for an ill family member. An employee on leave would get two-thirds of his or her pay, up to $4,000. The bill Biden supports would fund this by increasing the payroll tax paid by employers and workers.\n\n• Make two years of community college tuition-free for all, and all public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose family incomes are below $125,000.\n\nOther Domestic Policies\n\nBiden's promised union members he'd be the strongest labor president you've ever had. While serving as vice president, he got out ahead of President Barack Obama in publicly supporting same-sex marriage.\n\n• Extend existing civil rights laws to ban discrimination in employment, housing and other areas against LGBTQ Americans.\n\n• Give the 21 million Americans who work for the federal government and state governments the right to unionize, which currently exists only in some states.\n\n• More than double the federal minimum wage in stages to $15 by 2026, up from $7.25, where it was set in 2009.\n\n• Spend $50 billion in his first year to repair roads, highways and bridges.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com
Little did Hegstetter know what the night was to bring when she posted a pregame love note on Instagram. I sit here thinking about everything that you have been through the last five years to get to the point. You get to end your career at The University of Alabama on the biggest stage possible, she wrote. You have carried yourself with poise, grace, and kindness throughout it all. No one is more deserving than you 75. I can't wait to see what the future holds for you and no matter what it is you'll be a rockstar. I love you with all my heart and can't wait to watch you run out one last time for the Tide!
Adapted from an online discussion.\n\nDear Carolyn: I have been with my boyfriend for almost a year and in many ways he is the best guy I've ever been with, but there is one recurring issue we've had. To make a long story short, we work for the same organization but different offices. We met during a three-day work trip and hooked up after spending a night at the bar. Two days later, he told me he was married but it was complicated; he didn't wear a ring so I didn't know. We went back home and didn't talk again for almost a month.\n\nDuring that month, he left his wife. During that month, an old friend with benefits had also come to town for a couple days that I hooked up with.\n\nNow he is divorced and we've gotten pretty serious, but he can't get past that I hooked up with someone else after he and I hooked up. I've apologized approximately 1.3 million times, cut off all contact with the friend (and every other male in my life), changed my phone number, changed my email address, etc., but he still doesn't trust me and brings this mistake up on an almost daily basis. I've offered to go to counseling with him but he doesn't want to.\n\nIn every other way we have a great relationship and I feel like if we can just get past this issue, everything else would be perfect. Do you have any advice for us?\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nTrust Issues\n\nTrust Issues: If I can just get past the unremitting smell of raw sewage from the treatment plant next door, this would be my dream house.\n\nIf I can just get past my car being on fire on the side of the road, this would be the best road trip of my life.\n\nIf I can just get past his daily reminder that he thinks I'm a bad person just waiting for my chance to cheat on him, this would be the best guy I've ever been with.\n\nPlease revoke your consent to be treated like dirt.\n\nYou don't have a great relationship. You can't, not when someone is fixated on your perceived deficit(s).\n\nFor the sake of argument, let's say your leaving him is the jolt he needs to become permanently untroubled by your seeing someone else before you actually got into a relationship with him (ahem). You, then, will still have to reckon with his hypocrisy: His messing around with you motivated him to get out of his marriage to date you. Your learning that Mr. Fling had become available motivated you to end things with Benefits Guy. Same thing, except that his was orders of magnitude worse.\n\nYet he not only carried this hypocrisy around with him for almost a year, but he also beat you over the head with it daily. And HE's the one claiming the high ground? HE doesn't TRUST you? Perfect, my chair-bound butt.\n\nIt's such an obvious outrage that your lack of outrage concerns me. Why wasn't it your first reaction to say, You are judging me? Bye. No one, no one is more valuable to us than basic decency. To internalize that is the best emotional safeguard there is.
I also have a problem with my wife coming home drunk enough to pass out on the floor two or three days a week, every week.\n\nShe thinks I'm being unreasonable and doesn't care to talk about any of this. I don't know how else to approach this. Can you help?\n\nAD\n\n— Worried Spouse\n\nWorried Spouse: You don't say where you live, but I'm going to assume that (between the time you wrote this and its publication) your wife's barhopping has been interrupted by the pandemic.\n\nAD\n\nYour wife doesn't want to talk about this because, well, it's human nature to avoid being confronted with your own risky behavior. And her behavior is very risky. Even without the additional factor raised by the pandemic, she is risking her health, her career and her marriage.\n\nDrinking to unconsciousness is a very serious danger sign. Health care workers have extremely high paced and stressful jobs. A paper published by Mayo Clinic Proceedings noted that approximately 10 percent to 12 percent of physicians are estimated to have an addiction disorder (alcoholism would be one example).\n\nAD\n\nThese days, many health care workers are undoubtedly feeling even more stress, and yet, their patients need and deserve to be treated by people who show up for work healthy: with adequate sleep, not hung over and not jonesing for their next after-work drink. You should do everything possible to intervene and get your wife some desperately needed help.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: My boyfriend of three years has made friends (online) with a woman in Europe.\n\nThey sing together on an app created to share music. That's where they met. The songs sometimes feel intimate. It bothers me. To be fair, the songs are out there for others to join in, so it's not as if it is entirely private.\n\nAD\n\nShe has now become part of his daily life. They exchange Facebook messages so often that when he clicks on messages she is the first person who pops up, even before me.\n\nHe says that I'm overreacting and that my thoughts seem psycho since she lives in Europe and is married, and we are in California.\n\nMy problem is with the constant daily interactions. She's up at 4:30 or 5 a.m. local time in her home country, listening to his new recordings and commenting on them.\n\nWho does that? She gets up at the crack of dawn, and the first thing she does is listen to my boyfriend's recordings, commenting on how beautiful/lovely his voice is? (Which it is, by the way.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe says she admires his talents. I say it's a bit more. Am I overreacting?\n\nHe says they talk about art. I trust him, but I don't like their interactions and how all over him she is.\n\nHelp. Am I being paranoid?\n\n— Confused\n\nConfused: Your boyfriend seems to have a superfan.\n\nIf he was performing live and the same woman came to his show, night after night — excessively fangirling him — you would both notice it, and, rather than calling you psycho, he would handle the fan-friendship by behaving in a way that encourages her enthusiasm but discourages an emotional involvement that is threatening to you.\n\nFans are centrally important to a performer, but they belong in a category where the artist encourages their enthusiasm, while discouraging an exclusive or predatory sort of relationship that would interfere with their home lives, as well as the work.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNo, I don't think you're being paranoid. I think this fan-relationship bothers you because it has become very time consuming, seems to be growing, and because your boyfriend is encouraging it, while at the same time blaming you for following your instincts and honestly expressing your concern.\n\nDear Amy: Hanging On had a longtime partner who had terrible hygiene and lazy household habits. You focused on their unhealthy relationship, but this person needs to see a doctor!\n\n— Upset\n\nUpset: Hanging On has a partner who seems to have an array of problems, which had been percolating for the entire length of their 30-year relationship. I agree that she needs help.
The twist in Céline Sciamma's intriguing but inert take on the genre is that the couple is two women: Marianne (Noémie Merlant) has arrived at the stately Brittany home of Héloise (Adèle Haenel) to paint her portrait, which is to be sent directly to a potential suitor in Milan in the 18th-century equivalent of match.com. Héloise, a moody young woman given to deep, meaningful looks and moody walks on the beach, has no interest in posing, which is why her strategically-minded mother (Valeria Golino) has asked Marianne to pursue her enterprise in secret, gathering her material from observational subterfuge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat contrivance and the stolen glances it entails gives Portrait of a Lady on Fire an extra frisson of danger, even if Sciamma and her audience know exactly where this will lead: Drenched in fetishistic pleasures (those bodices!) and a faint mist of tragedy, the film is less about the narrative itself than its attempt to marry eroticism and feminist theory. As an exercise in watching — Marianne watches Héloise, who watches Marianne, as the viewers watch them both — Portrait of a Lady on Fire becomes a critical treatise on the male gaze, which for a century has reduced women to passive objects. Much in the same way Lorene Scafaria played with those ideas in Hustlers last year, Sciamma obviously has fun subverting those traditional norms; and, like Greta Gerwig's Little Women, her film is steeped in the economics of marriage as a form of security and lifelong servitude.\n\nIf Sciamma's imagery (diaphanous scarves and, in one sequence, a strategically placed mirror) is often too-obvious, and her love for pregnant silences and doleful stares begins to feel tiresome, the filmmaker makes sure that Portrait of a Lady on Fire looks sensational: Claire Mathon's sensuous cinematography, glowing with candlelight and embers, is as much a character as the gorgeous women on screen. True to its title, Portrait of a Lady on Fire generates more than its share of heat, even if it never truly becomes an engulfing flame.
Dear Amy: My nephew and his wife recently had their first baby. We live in the same city, and are close. he day the baby was born, doctors thought she might be seriously ill. Tests revealed that she was fine.\n\nThe new parents only allowed grandparents to go meet her in the hospital.\n\nMy nephew texted me a few weeks later to tell me that I was permitted to meet the baby, but that the pediatrician said that the baby shouldn't be around children, so my kids, ages 11 and 9, were not allowed to come over for at least two months.\n\nI said I wouldn't meet the baby until my children could. I was upset at the exclusion.\n\nI understand wanting to protect a child, but there are photos at my mom's house with many different people holding the baby for her one-month birthday. She is now three months old. I realize this is not the baby's fault. It might be mine, for not going to meet her, but my kids were hurt and I was angry.\n\nHow can I gracefully respond to my nephew when I do meet his baby?\n\nUpset Aunt\n\nFirst-time parents are often nervous about exposing their baby to the world. The family had an early health scare, and now they are doing what they think is best for their baby.\n\nYou should be tolerant. They're figuring things out. They might be overprotective, but they are the parents and you should respect their role.\n\nIf the message in the early weeks was that your children should not meet the baby, you should have dealt with your kids' disappointment like a good parent does — encouraging your kids to handle this temporary moratorium in a mature fashion. Instead you joined them, and now you're all sulking.\n\nThe way to respond to your nephew when you finally meet the child is to make a fuss over the baby, telling the young father how perfect and wonderful she is. Apologize for not meeting the baby sooner. Tell him you were upset your children were prevented from meeting their cousin and ask him to forgive you for your pettiness.\n\nDear Amy: I recently celebrated my marriage with an amazing wedding! We had the best night of our lives, and so many guests told us it was the best wedding they had ever been to.\n\nWhile enjoying reading cards and opening gifts, we were shocked to find 35 of our 140 guests did not leave a gift. We have racked our brains. Was the gift table too hard to find? Are they planning on sending a gift? Were some gifts stolen?\n\nThe probability of this is low as the area was secure and well-supervised. The table was a little tricky to spot, but the venue wasn't that large.\n\nWe are honestly feeling hurt. As an aside, my husband and I paid for the wedding ourselves and many of our friends knew this.\n\nSeveral people have suggested discussing this directly with the offending guests. This is a really tricky situation, but that number is so surprisingly high.\n\nAny advice on how to approach this sticky situation?\n\nBaffled Bride\n\nMany people don't bring gifts to a wedding. If they are traveling to the ceremony, they may prefer to ship gifts to the couple's home for the couple to open after the (presumed) honeymoon. Wedding guests are also aware of the hassle some couples face of guarding gifts and transporting them after the reception.\n\nI'm sure few wedding guests picture the couple keeping score, as you and your husband seem to be doing.\n\nIf you sincerely believe that some gifts might have gone missing, you must follow through with guests to let them know of your concern.\n\nIf you suspect that some guests have simply decided not to give you a gift, then you must politely accept this choice, remembering that you didn't have a public wedding celebration for the purpose of receiving gifts, but as a gift to your community of loved ones, so that you could share your joy with them.\n\nDear Amy: I appreciated your advice to Worried Future Mother-in-Law, whose daughter was marrying a guy whose mother was belligerent when drunk. They were worried about the wedding.\n\nWe faced something similar in our family. We had a friend who was willing to hang out with our alcoholic family member to intervene, if necessary. It wasn't.\n\nBeen There\n\nI'm happy this worked out for all of you.
We look for the best people in the world and that's who they were, said Carol Blythe. We're very excited.\n\nThe 155-year-old church severed ties with the Southern Baptist Convention in 2012: It was at loggerheads with the group on several issues, including the SBC's stance against homosexuality. Calvary Baptist still affiliates with American Baptist Churches USA.\n\nAD\n\nAmerican Baptist Churches USA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAD\n\nSarratt and Swearingen come to Calvary from Greenville, S.C., where Sarratt has been serving as associate chaplain for behavioral health in the Greenville Health System and Swearingen as associate chaplain at Furman University, according to a news release from the church.\n\nWe have found it so easy to fall in love with Calvary and its long-standing commitment to be a voice of justice and compassion for those who perpetually find the wholeness of their humanity disregarded and maligned, the couple said to the congregation Sunday, according to the church.\n\nSarratt has also been filling the role of part-time associate minister at Greenville Unitarian Universalist Fellowship.\n\nAD\n\nThe women met in the First Baptist Church of Greenville, and were both ordained there after it adopted and implemented a nondiscrimination policy in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nSarratt, who holds an MBA from the University of Virginia, left the corporate world after she felt called to ministry and obtained her master's in theological studies from Emory University.\n\nSwearingen, who is fluent in Spanish, earned a Master of Divinity from Duke Divinity School, where she won an award for her preaching.\n\nIn 2014, after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage, and the court denied South Carolina's attempt at a stay, Sarratt told the Greenville News that the couple knew many who chose sexual identity over a life of faith, but that there is no need to sacrifice either.\n\nAD\n\nButler, Calvary's previous senior minister, left to serve in the same position at New York's the Riverside Church in 2014.\n\nCalvary Baptist was founded by abolitionists who broke away from another Baptist church where congregants had refused to pray for Union soldiers during the Civil War.\n\nCo-pastoring is a growing trend in U.S. houses of worship, with many churches and couples finding that sharing the often-emotionally heavy workload can benefit both the clergy and the congregants.
The movies I grew up on were entertaining, escapist, sometime edifying. But I didn't see myself in any of them. My Brilliant Career changed that. For the first time, I experienced that powerful transference that occurs when the life on screen seems to be mirroring your own, not just its external trappings but its most intimate, even shameful, interior.\n\nAs the film opens, Sybylla Melvyn is writing from the ramshackle farm she has grown up on in the Australian bush, obliviously scrawling her memoirs as a dust storm rages outside. It's 1897, and her family wants their eldest daughter either to marry well or get a suitable job to help support them. Sybylla, played by Judy Davis, chafes against those options, confessing to her little sister, I want to do great things.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat she means by things is unclear, but it has something to do with meeting people who talk about books and words and have visions. Later, after she re-connects with a childhood friend — played by dreamy Sam Neill in one of cinema's most classic meet-cutes — she's offered a suitable marriage everyone expects her to jump at with gratitude and relief. But she declines. I can't lose myself in somebody else's life, she tells him, when I haven't lived my own yet.\n\nMy Brilliant Career is best known as the feature debut of Gillian Armstrong, who adapted Miles Franklin's novel with note-perfect compositional detail and effortlessly graceful pacing. Most importantly, she cast Davis as Sybylla, marking a breakout moment for the actress, who played her character with just the right mix of headstrong confidence and nagging insecurity. Along with Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock, Bruce Beresford's Breaker Morant and Fred Schepisi's The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, My Brilliant Career was considered part of a New Wave of Australian filmmaking that engulfed American art houses in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nAll of that cinematic history was lost on me as I watched Davis deliver a breakthrough performance that astonished me for its uncanny proximity to my own hopes, fears, outlandish ambitions and self-sabotaging hauteurs. We both played the piano — Schumann's Kinderszenen — and we both had fractious relationships with our mothers. With her ungovernable mass of red hair and equally prodigious smattering of freckles, her face seemingly devoid of makeup, Sybylla even looked like me, sort of.\n\nI might not have lived on a farm, but growing up in Iowa, I nursed similar aspirations to escape, become a writer and live a life of excitement, cultural sophistication and creative inspiration. Like Sybylla, I was blessed with an abundance of intellectual confidence. But that bravado bumped up against a chronic lack of feminine vanity when it came to the opposite sex, masking a deep-seated certainty that I was undesirable and, by extension, unlovable. As Sybylla complains in the film: It's bad enough being born a girl — but ugly and clever . . .  She didn't have to finish that sentence. I knew exactly how it ended.\n\nAt the end of My Brilliant Career, Sybylla mails off her manuscript to a publisher, facing a new dawn with characteristic optimism. A few years later, I took a similarly bold chance, moving to New York to pursue that vague future I had visualized back in Des Moines. Sybylla's pronouncement wasn't literally ringing in my ears, but it was whispering: I'm not marrying anyone. I'm going to have a career. Literature, music, art. . . . I've not made up my mind yet.\n\nI got an entry-level job at a magazine, began writing short articles and eventually went freelance — one of my first assignments being an interview with Sam Neill (eight years after I'd first seen him on screen, now in his early 40s, he was still dreamy). Like lots of women my age, I was having a blast making new friends, dating and savoring Manhattan's art, culture and nightlife. I really did meet people who talked about books and words and had visions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut, when it came to romance, that all-important lasting connection was proving elusive. It turned out that Sybylla's wasn't the only voice I had internalized. As her family friend Aunt Gussie says at one point, Loneliness is a terrible price to pay for independence.\n\nIt turned out that Gussie, not Sybylla, would be the unofficial mascot for 1980s, when the media became obsessed with myths about ticking biological clocks, work-life balance and having it all. In 1986, Newsweek published an article suggesting — falsely — that single women over 40 were more likely to be killed by a terrorist than to get married. The narrow Victorian standards of acceptability and autonomy that Sybylla rejected in My Brilliant Career would prove dispiritingly resilient in countless portraits of women grappling with their desire for professional achievement and personal happiness. From Broadcast News to Sex and the City, from Working Girl to Insecure, the driving question is whether a woman can find and express her authentic sense of self without paying the terrible price of a solitary life. (Meanwhile, we have yet to see the definitive movie about a man worrying about juggling work and fatherhood — indeed, we have yet to see any movie about such a unicorn.)\n\nWatching My Brilliant Career today, I am still amazed at how closely Sybylla's fictional persona tacked to my own young self, and I can see that, for all our confidence and determination, we were also off-puttingly arrogant and self-absorbed. Now in the throes of caring for elderly loved ones back home in Iowa, I wish I hadn't been so hellbent on leaving in the first place. Even through a different lens, though, watching someone finding her artistic voice never fails to evoke a frisson of recognition and vicarious triumph. As a critic, I know firsthand what it means to see yourself reflected on screen, and the psychic damage that's inflicted when you don't.\n\nAD\n\nAD
My son and I have talked several times about this possibility and about how counseling could help.\n\nNow he is having trouble in his intimate relationships, but he's closed to the idea of therapy. He is otherwise a really good man, thriving in his career and regarded by many as a really charming guy. How can I help?\n\nAD\n\n— Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: I'm so sorry this happened to your family.\n\nI think the most helpful thing you can do for your son now is accept that you have done what you can. At least on the matter of his getting help.\n\nAD\n\nYou spoke to a grief counselor at the time; you shared with your son what you learned, several times; you love him and see the good in him.\n\nThe rest is up to him. And that's so difficult, I know. It is human nature to want to fix things, to connect dots, to do the obvious, aaagh!\n\nBut they're his things, his dots. And your obvious is your own — even when someone is visibly suffering for the lack of it. You've given him what he needs. As long as he is competent to manage his own life, he is free to mismanage it, too.\n\nAD\n\nBut there are still two things you can do outside the scope of his decision on going to therapy. You can keep loving him and seeing the good in him, toward the goal of maintaining the health of his relationship with you. One good connection can be the model for eventual others.\n\nAnd you can overrule your impulse to see this version of him at 29 as the person he'll be for life. He's an adult but still a young one, plus we are all protean in a lot of ways; just think of yourself at various ages and stages if you doubt this. Plenty of non-traumatized adults go on to adopt courses of action they had once pooh-poohed as silly, unnecessary, fine for somebody else. Maturity is a powerful force.\n\nAD\n\nAs are peers: You haven't been able to persuade him now, but someone else, someone who loves this really good man and is frustrated by the intimacy issues, even someone he loses due to his stubbornness, may have the leverage he needs.\n\nAD\n\nStand by, with no open wringing of hands.\n\nDear Carolyn: Recently, I began digging into my family's history and ancestry, particularly since all my grandparents are gone and the family is drifting apart. One of my uncles, Ted, has gone through periods of being the family black sheep, and I am no longer close with his kids, my cousins.\n\nLong story short, I was under the impression Ted had been married twice, once leaving him a widower and the other ending in divorce. According to a marriage license I found on a well-respected genealogy site, he's been married thrice. This third marriage was actually his first, brief and resulting in no children, when he was in his early 20s.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI have been sitting on this information for a year. I want to ask my mom, his sister, about it, but I'm worried that if she doesn't know, then it will only make their fraught relationship worse. I'm not sure if she would confront him about it, or their other siblings, and what the fallout would be — or even if his kids know about it. What should I do?\n\n— Possible Sole Bearer of a Family Secret\n\nPossible Sole Bearer of a Family Secret: Squat sounds pretty compelling. Unless you're the bupkis type. Or fox-all, to put it slyly.\n\nYou write of possible fallout — but what of any benefits? What would your family gain by knowing?\n\nTruth is often its own worthy end, yes. But I can see that applying here to one of Ted's kids . . . say, because one of them keeping this secret might affect the chemistry among others. It would apply maybe to Ted's siblings. Or to others after Ted and his generation are gone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs only a not-close-anymore niece, though, and amid all these siblings still able to speak for themselves, you risk coming across as a pest.\n\nTed is still Ted. Your family is still your family — his early marriage has no effect on the head count. It's not a scandal, or a game-changer, or a truth that's straining itself to get out and therefore a burden to you. It's not presenting any kind of meaningful challenge to Ted's entitlement to some privacy.\n\nIt is, in other words, a fine thing to sit on unless and until you're certain you need to speak up.
And that was on top of earlier action to pass gun control, ease abortion restrictions and enact the Equal Rights Amendment.\n\nDemocrats pulled back in some areas, suggesting a limit to the state's new blue status. A controversial ban on assault weapons never got a vote in the Senate, though the House of Delegates kept a version alive. Neither chamber approved a repeal of the state's right-to-work law. Campaign finance reform has seen little action.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVirginia has not become the East Coast version of California, said University of Mary Washington political scientist Stephen Farnsworth. But Virginia is clearly being governed in a far more liberal direction than has been the case in decades, if not ever.\n\nThe shape of this year's 60-day session came into clearer focus on Tuesday, the crossover deadline for passing bills in the House and Senate and sending the measures to the opposite chamber for consideration.\n\nThe changes have touched off extreme responses in some GOP quarters, from the massive pro-gun rally that shut down Richmond streets last month to the suggestion that liberal places such as Arlington and Alexandria should rejoin the District of Columbia and rural red counties should secede to West Virginia.\n\nAD\n\nThe ideological tension boiled over into Tuesday's invocation in the House, where the Rev. Robert M. Grant Jr. of the Father's Way Church in Warrenton gave a prayer that railed against abortion and same-sex marriage, prompting most of the Democratic caucus to walk out. Even a few Republicans retreated to the rear of the chamber.\n\nAD\n\nThere is a time and a place for everything, Del. Matt Fariss (R-Campbell) said afterward. This is a time we need to work together and not be divisive.\n\nDemocrats say they have marching orders from last fall's elections, which gave them full control of the legislature for the first time in a generation, with majorities of 55 to 45 in the House and 21 to 19 in the Senate. In concert with Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, the caucus is empowered to enact sweeping change.\n\nAD\n\nThe sheer volume of legislation Democrats unloaded this year has been staggering, leading to an unusual number of long floor sessions and late-night committee meetings.\n\nRepublican leaders have repeatedly accused the new majority of cutting corners in their haste to shake up the status quo.\n\nI think they are moving very far, very fast, House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) said. What you're seeing is a huge shift in the way Virginia operates going forward.\n\nAD\n\nTo Democrats, that's the whole point.\n\nOver and over on Tuesday, lawmakers marveled that they were approving ideas that had gone nowhere in two decades of Republican dominance.\n\nToday is a good day, Del. Roslyn Tyler (D-Sussex) said before voting to raise the minimum wage after 10 years of failure.\n\nAD\n\nOn the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) had long proposed giving undocumented immigrants a driver privilege card, which would include a notice that it could not be used for voting — something offered in neighboring Maryland and in the District.\n\nThose bills always died — until Tuesday, when the Senate approved the measure. The House went a step further, making immigrants eligible for a conventional driver's license — though not the Real ID-compliant license that will be required to board an airplane or enter a federal facility, starting in October.\n\nAD\n\nThe House and Senate also voted to make certain undocumented immigrants, often referred to as dreamers, eligible for in-state tuition at state colleges and universities.\n\nAD\n\nIn other ways, Democrats have been cautious about pushing their advantage. Many of their newly gained seats are in suburban districts that until recently favored Republicans. Lawmakers are also protective of Virginia's prized Triple-A bond rating, which contributes to the state's status as a top place for doing business.\n\nOne major area that has seen little public action so far is the state's two-year, $135 billion budget, which is on a different schedule than other types of bills. Lawmakers have proposed hundreds of amendments to the spending plan proposed by Northam, but the measures are making their way through committees and have yet to get to the floor.\n\nHere are several major policy areas that have seen action during the session, including some that faced crucial votes on Tuesday.\n\nGun control\n\nThis issue was the showpiece issue for Democrats, who promised action after last year's mass shooting at a Virginia Beach municipal building.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe House has been more aggressive on this front than the Senate, passing all eight bills called for by Northam. They would institute universal background checks; limit handgun purchases to one per month; require owners to report a firearm theft or loss within 24 hours; give local officials the authority to pass gun restrictions; tighten the prohibition on guns for someone under a protective order; make it a felony to recklessly leave a gun in reach of anyone 18 or younger; and create a red flag law allowing authorities to seize weapons from someone deemed a threat. The chamber narrowly approved an assault weapons ban Tuesday, 51 to 48, after struggling over how to define those firearms and how to enact the ban.\n\nThe Senate has passed five of the governor's gun-control bills. On Tuesday, it rejected a measure on reporting lost or stolen guns. The sponsor of the assault-weapons bill withdrew it from consideration, and the child-access bill died in committee.\n\nCasinos and sports betting\n\nBoth the House and Senate have advanced bills that would let five cities — Portsmouth, Norfolk, Danville, Bristol and Richmond — seek a public vote on whether to build casinos.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe measures would empower the state lottery to oversee casino gambling, but they differ on many details, including the amount of tax revenue that would come back to the state and localities. Both chambers on Monday also approved versions of a bill that would allow sports betting and the online purchase of lottery tickets.\n\nEnergy: Despite many Democrats running last year on pledges to refuse political contributions from Dominion Energy, the state's biggest electric utility, the regulated monopoly is having a successful session.\n\nA Senate bill to prohibit taking campaign money from Dominion died in committee. And both houses are advancing sweeping environmental legislation called the Virginia Clean Economy Act that Dominion has had a strong hand in shaping. The measure sets goals for switching to renewable energy sources in coming years and helps safeguard Dominion's investments in wind and solar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Green New Deal Act with stricter environmental guidelines died in House committee. There was no similar version in the Senate. The House did pass a bill restoring some powers of the State Corporation Commission to oversee Dominion's rates.\n\nWorkers' rights\n\nThe House approved a bill allowing collective bargaining for public employees, but carved out exceptions for legislative aides as well as for employees of hundreds of constitutional offices around the state: sheriffs, commissioners of the revenue, treasurers, commonwealth's attorneys and circuit court clerks. Virginia is one of only three states, along with North Carolina and South Carolina, that forbid collective bargaining for the public sector.\n\nThe Senate passed a bill giving localities the option of allowing public-sector collective bargaining. How the two versions will be reconciled is uncertain.\n\nAD\n\nThe Senate on Tuesday passed a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $11.50 by July 1, 2023, then divide the state into regions where the wage would vary based on the cost of living. The House voted along party lines, 55 to 45, to approve a bill raising the wage to $15 an hour by July 1, 2025.\n\nCriminal justice\n\nThe House has voted to decriminalize marijuana, imposing a fine of no more than $25 for simple possession. A House measure to legalize pot was defeated, with Democrats saying the state is not ready for that step. The Senate passed a decriminalization bill late Tuesday.\n\nThe House and Senate have both voted to double the threshold for felony larceny to $1,000.\n\nConfederate memorials\n\nThe Senate voted along party lines Tuesday to give local governments control over Confederate statues. Earlier the session, the Senate passed a bill to find a replacement for the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee that represents Virginia in the U.S. Capitol. The House voted along party lines Tuesday to remove Lee's statue from Statuary Hall, and approved the local control bill by a vote of 53 to 46.\n\nAbortion\n\nThe House and Senate have passed bills to repeal a state law requiring that a woman seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound 24 hours beforehand. The measures would allow health professionals who are not doctors to perform the procedure, adding nurse practitioners in the Senate version, and physician assistants and nurse practitioners in the House bill.\n\nVoter access
1917 Marianne Seregi, design director at National Geographic: To be honest, I was dreading being taken to 1917. But after seeing this poster, I kind of want to watch it. The typography is clear and striking. The 9 and the 7 both point you in the direction of the action. The imagery shows the beginning of a moment, which makes me want to see where it ends. For me, this is the most compelling poster of the lot.\n\nDJ Stout, art director and partner at Pentagram: I admire the attempt to do something unique here. The majority of movie posters these days are rigidly formulaic. This bold typographic approach, a huge number 1917 used as a window framing two unrecognizable soldiers running across a war-torn battlefield, is refreshingly different. It's nice to see something other than the typical close-up beauty shots of famous actors. This graphic visual approach reflects the film's emphasis on action, breathtaking scenery and cinematography, which has earned it an Oscar nomination in that category. This poster makes me want to see the movie.\n\nCraig Ward, typographer: This is a really strong, confident poster. It gives you exactly the right amount information — a place, a time, a situation and the two protagonists — and nothing more. You're either in or you're not. As with Parasite, the type here is very coherent and entirely set in just two weights of Futura [font], which is very restrained for the medium. It flows well and leads your eye toward the soldiers and the landscape by virtue of you literally reading the poster. It tells a story.
There are no shoulds here, and even if there were, my guess is you'd want financial advice from someone who doesn't routinely find forgotten cash in her coat pocket. But here's the deal from a psychological standpoint: a satisfying marriage means that you share your lives, your dreams, your plans and your setbacks. Many of these, like it or not, involve money.\n\nSo, while the ins and outs of who has what account number may vary (and indeed, some couples find relief in having certain money in individual accounts), it's nonetheless going to be counterproductive to take the stand that everything is separate. This isn't just because of day-to-day tediousness, though that's significant (do you go halfsies on orange juice? The unexpected new roof?). Rather, it's because of the mentality of marriage. Individual debt and unwise spending hold both of you back, and individual triumphs are something for a couple to celebrate, together. Why cut each other off from the joint experience?\n\nHe thinks I'm seeing a quack\n\nQ. My boyfriend went through an awful time with his ex-wife, years of marriage counseling that did nothing. This has made him think all counselors and therapists are quacks. I have been seeing a therapist on and off for problems with body image and eating that I developed years ago in college. He recently found out and is very against it. He says I'm wasting my money and that his goal is to get me to stop. I am tempted to tell him I stopped but I know this is not a long-term solution. How do I get him to see that this is right for me? —Frustrated\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, because he was in a marriage that was unworkable, an entire branch of health care must be fraudulent? (Hey, I've got spinach in my teeth. So dentistry must be a scam!)\n\nHis stance is disturbing not just in its illogic, but also because he is trying to control the way you take care of yourself. How can he object to your doing something that you believe (and that studies agree) is good for your emotional health? And why would he want to? Being so bold as to make it a goal to thwart what you consider to be your mental health progress is, honestly, worrisome. You know therapy's right for you. If he doesn't trust you on that, you might use some of your therapy time to figure out if it's the relationship that's wrong.\n\nSend your questions for Baggage Check to Dr. Andrea Bonior at baggage@wpost.com.
I'm glad we can finally get back to work here, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said after the vote. He called the shutdown a manufactured crisis characterized by damaging partisan theatrics.\n\nAD\n\nThe breakthrough came Monday after Senate Democrats bowed to pressure to reopen the government, joining Republicans in backing an immigration and spending compromise that was quickly denounced by liberals and immigration activists.\n\nAD AD\n\nAD\n\nRoughly 60 hours after government funding lapsed, a bipartisan group of negotiators in the Senate prevailed with leadership and trading Democratic support for reopening the government for a commitment by Republicans to hold a vote resolving the status of young undocumented immigrants by mid-February.\n\nPresident Trump welcomed Democrats' decision to relent and said the administration would work toward solving the problem of very unfair illegal immigration.\n\nAD\n\nI am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses, he added in a statement.\n\nAfter the Senate voted on Jan. 22 to reopen the government, The Fix's Aaron Blake examines what Democrats lost and won in their standoff over DACA. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\n\nBut the resolution of the three-day stalemate exposed a growing rift between two groups of Democratic senators: those facing tough reelection campaigns in states Trump won, and those courting liberal voters ahead of possible 2020 presidential bids.\n\nChanneling rage from immigration activists, the possible 2020 candidates were highly critical of their leaders' willingness to trust that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will allow an immigration vote after Feb. 8 if senators cannot strike a deal before then.\n\nAD\n\nI believe it's been a false choice that's been presented between keeping the government open and resolving the DACA issue, said Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who voted no. I believe we can do both.\n\nAD\n\nA majority of Democrats had forced the shutdown with demands for a vote on legislation to protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients, known as dreamers, from deportation after Trump canceled the program. The final bill did not include these protections, nor any specific guarantee of a vote.\n\nOther possible White House contenders who voted against the bill included Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nDemocratic and independent senators who relented in the standoff said they did not necessarily trust McConnell, but had faith that the bipartisan negotiators, including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), would force him to abide by his commitments.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFrankly, our trust is more with our colleagues, that they will hold him accountable, said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who is up for reelection this year in a state Trump won.\n\nA commitment this public, with this much fanfare — that's kind of hard to back away from just three weeks from now, said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who sided with Democrats on Friday in the vote that produced the shutdown.\n\nCollins, Flake and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) helped broker the agreement, with Flake and Graham shuttling between huddles with McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) for much of the weekend. During bipartisan meetings in Collins's office, senators had to use a talking stick to avoid unproductive crosstalk. They eventually switched to a basketball, according to Manchin, because it was easier to toss back and forth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell had said Sunday night and Monday morning that it was his intention to take up legislation addressing DACA, border security and other issues if Democrats agreed to fund the government until Feb. 8.\n\nThis immigration debate will have a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides, he said Monday.\n\nThe effects of the shutdown over the weekend were relatively muted: halting trash pickup on National Park Service property, canceling military reservists' drill plans, switching off some government employees' cellphones.\n\nBut the shutdown's continuing into Monday meant that hundreds of thousands of workers stayed home and key federal agencies were affected. Federal contractors will see payments delayed, and the Internal Revenue Service will slow its preparations for the coming tax season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSenators did not extract a promise from McConnell that would pave the way for an immigration bill's passage through the House or its approval by Trump.\n\nStill, some Democratic senators said the deal created the conditions for success.\n\nYou have to be optimistic that we are trusting each other and trusting the process we are putting in place and that over the next 17 days, we will get to a bill that can get a commanding vote in the Senate, not just barely pass, Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said.\n\nThis, combined with legislation to address a bevy of other issues — long-term spending levels, disaster relief and funding for opioid treatment and community health centers — would create unstoppable pressure on the House, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAdvocates for dreamers were less convinced.\n\nRep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) blasted his Democratic colleagues in the Senate for shortchanging Latino voters, an increasingly critical voting bloc for the party.\n\nAD\n\nIf the Republicans said we are ending same-sex marriage, but we promise Democrats a vote later; or we approve of oil drilling in every national park, but you'll have a vote later — do you think the Democrats would say yes? This shows me that when it comes to immigrants, Latinos and their families, Democrats are still not willing to go to the mat to allow people in my community to live in our country legally, said Gutierrez, one of Capitol Hill's most vocal advocates for dreamers, in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nA top liberal political strategist on immigration issues spoke for many of those in an uproar after the vote.\n\nWe're pissed off. We're not naive to the politics. But give me a f-----g break. They do something heroic Friday night they climb down Monday morning, the strategist said.\n\nSenate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said he hoped to be celebrating with DACA recipients after a possible victory in three weeks.\n\nAD\n\nTo all the 'dreamers' watching today: Don't give up, he said on the Senate floor. I know your lives are hanging in the balance.\n\nThe vote to end debate on the spending bill came together quickly after Collins and several other senators said they wanted a firmer, more detailed commitment from McConnell.\n\nIt would be helpful if the language were a little bit stronger because the level of tension is so high, Collins told reporters outside her office.\n\nA Republican aide involved in the talks said that McConnell and his team were considering putting their plan in document form with more detail as a way of convincing some Democrats to support the short-term bill.\n\nAhead of the vote to end debate, Schumer warned McConnell to keep his word.\n\nI expect the majority leader to fulfill his commitment to the Senate, to me and to the bipartisan group, and abide by this agreement. If he does not . . . he will have breached the trust of not only the Democratic senators, but members of his own party as well, Schumer said.\n\nAD\n\nStill, the relief among senators upon reaching a deal was palpable. As the voting began, Schumer shouted from his seated position. Lindsey! Thank you, my friend, he said as Graham approached and shook his hand. We wouldn't be here without you.\n\nWith the negotiations focused on the Senate, Trump remained on the sidelines for much of the weekend, using Twitter to interject his opinions.\n\nDemocrats are acting at the behest of their far left base in advocating for dreamers, he argued Monday morning.
For Olga Massov, that looks like a fragrant, restorative chicken-and-rice soup; G. Daniela Galarza shared a version of Italian wedding soup; and I developed a recipe for an easy farro-and-kale soup with peanut butter and a hint of spice.\n\nAD\n\nEach brings all of the warmth, comfort and flavor you might desire this time of year without leaving you feeling weighed down and ready for a nap immediately after eating. So if you are looking for a recipe or three to help kick things off on the right foot, soup's on.\n\nRestorative Chicken and Rice Soup\n\nAs a Russian immigrant, I grew up with a familiar collection of Eastern European and Ashkenazi Jewish recipes: latkes, sharlotka, borscht. But it's the chicken soup, a.k.a. Jewish penicillin, that I remember most vividly from my sick days as a child (and I got sick a lot). Eating the soup made me feel like I was slowly being brought back to life.\n\nA few years ago, I was working as an editor at Phaidon, and my boss asked me to edit a manuscript from Elizabeth Street Cafe, the popular Vietnamese-inspired restaurant in Austin. One of the recipes was a comforting, congee-like chicken-and-rice breakfast soup. Eating it made me feel nourished and restored. I made it over and over, tweaking here and there, and finally creating my own version, an amalgamation of the Eastern European and Asian traditions: looser, brothier, but still every bit as aromatic as the original.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVisually, the soup is a feast for the eyes: bright green leaves of aromatic Thai basil and cilantro, as well as thin rings of chile, crunchy mung bean sprouts, bright white slivers of onion and deep red dots of sambal oelek. Fish sauce and brown sugar form a strong umami backbone, making you crave another spoonful even before you've swallowed your first. At home, we jokingly call this soup the corpse reviver, and for good reason. Whatever ails you, a bowl of this elixir — heady broth, aromatic with ginger, star anise, clove and cinnamon, thickened with glutinous rice, and fortified with pieces of chicken — instantly makes you feel revived and nourished.\n\nItalian Wedding Soup\n\nNothing, it seems, about the dish we call Italian wedding soup is straightforward. Not its name, which is an imperfect translation of minestra maritata, meant to refer to the careful marriage of its ingredients — not its place on a wedding menu. And not its ingredients and preparation, which vary widely from region to region in Italy. In the United States, it's best known, and well-loved, as a soup of greens, tiny pasta and meatballs, flavorful and fortifying.\n\nAs a child, it was a soup my babysitter, whose family came from Southern Italy, made for me and my brother on cold winter nights when my parents worked late. I remember helping shape the meatballs, tucking the squishy meat into my cupped palms. I remember the sound of her chopping crunchy greens and tender herbs and the smells that filled the kitchen, pungent and rich: garlic and pork and a tickle of spice. There would always be sausage in the soup, too, but I'd count the tiny meatballs in each bowl, pick around the greens and ask for extra cheese to sprinkle on top. Mostly, I remember it being a warming comfort, as all great soups should be.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis recipe is dedicated to those memories. There are several steps, but they lead to a satisfying soup that can be on the table in under an hour. While the broth simmers with spicy sausage, carrots and celery, mix up the meatballs, then roast them; tiny meatballs cook quickly. When they're done they go into the soup along with tiny pasta — orzo or ditalini or whatever you'd like — and lots of chopped leafy greens. Escarole is traditional, but kale, spinach, chard, collards or any dark leafy vegetable works well. Lemon zest and juice perk up the dense, meaty broth. I like to serve each bowl topped with chopped herbs and lots of grated cheese.\n\nFarro, Kale and Peanut Butter Soup\n\nThis is my first recipe for Voraciously, so I developed a dish that is very representative of my style — not too many ingredients, straightforward instructions, and flavors that intrigue and excite.\n\nI tend to think of recipes more as guidelines than prescriptions. While, yes, everything that I publish should work and taste delicious as written, you know your tastes better than I do, and you should make adjustments as you see fit. Salt and spice are two components that first come to mind in this regard, but this idea extends to the remaining ingredients, where I will try to point out ideas for substitutions, as appropriate, that can help you make use of whatever you already have on hand, what is more easily accessible or what aligns more with your palate. In the style of Tabitha Brown, it's your business.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBack to this particular dish: The ingredients listed in the recipe title do the bulk of the work in flavoring this soup, while a handful of pantry basics, along with a lone jalapeño, round everything out and add a hint of background heat. The result is simple, comforting and full of nutritious grains and dark, leafy greens. (This soup also happens to be meat- and dairy-free for anyone who is looking for vegan recipes.) And though you might be skeptical of putting peanut butter in your soup, I'm sure you'll turn into a believer after your first spoonful.\n\nDid you make any of these recipes?

Alexei Navalny — Zakhar's father and Russia's main opposition leader — and his Anti-Corruption Foundation are under attack by Russian authorities, which last year designated the group a foreign agent and accused it of money laundering.\n\nSomeone took 30,000 rubles that I saved up from my account, Zakhar messaged his father Monday. There was a similar message from his wife, Yulia.\n\nAD\n\nAnd his daughter.\n\nAnd his mother.\n\nNavalny announced Tuesday that authorities not only seized the contents of his bank account, but also those of his son, wife and daughter, Daria, who is studying at Stanford and found out about the problem when she tried to buy breakfast in a cafe. Navalny described those accounts as having been emptied and frozen.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition, he said, his parents were informed that their account was blocked, two days before their pensions were due.\n\nThis is very unpleasant, frankly speaking, Navalny posted on his website Tuesday. My parents are elderly people, pensioners. Like anyone, they might get sick. They need to buy medicine and so on, and now what? How shall we pay for housing and utilities?\n\nAD\n\nNavalny says the money-laundering case — which asserts that his foundation survives on illegally laundered funds of illegal origin — has no basis. The foundation subsists on donations from supporters, he wrote.\n\nPutin is getting scared and vindictive. He's just frozen all the bank accounts of Alexey Navalny, his elderly parents and even his children, tweeted Bill Browder, a prominent Putin critic. Browder spearheaded a campaign that led to the 2012 Magnitsky Act, U.S. legislation that sanctions foreign officials involved in human rights abuses. It is named after Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian tax auditor who died in prison after he was jailed for exposing Russian corruption.\n\nOn Monday, Navalny was informed that billionaire Oleg Deripaska, who has strong ties to the Kremlin, was suing him for unknown reasons.\n\nNavalny has been barred from running for election and has frequently been jailed and harassed. The latest actions against the family's bank accounts came on the third anniversary of a scathing YouTube video by Navalny and his team that exposed the wealth of Dmitry Medvedev, then Russia's prime minister. The video showed drone footage of a palatial residence outside Moscow with towers, glass houses, sweeping lawns, a pool, a garage, a small forest, a lake and even a house for ducks.\n\nThe 49-minute video, viewed more than 33 million times, helped precipitate a sharp decline in Medvedev's popularity and that of his government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPutin dismissed Medvedev and the government in January and named Mikhail Mishustin as prime minister — who was soon fingered in a new YouTube video by Navalny. It alleged that Mishu­stin's family owned property worth about $50 million, even though the he has been a civil servant for 22 years.\n\nThe director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, Ivan ­Zhdanov, also saw his accounts and those of family members frozen Monday. Zhdanov has been charged with failing to comply with a court order to take down the Medvedev video.\n\nIn the fall, masked police raided Navalny's offices in 30 locations across Russia. The Investigative Committee, a federal unit that reports to Putin, accused employees of the Anti-Corruption Foundation in August of obtaining more than a billion rubles (nearly $16 million) in funding by criminal means, a figure later revised to 75 million rubles, or nearly $1.2 million. On Monday, authorities debited 75 million rubles from Navalny's account, noting that this was the result of a criminal case. ­Zhdanov's account was also debited.\n\nThe action comes as Putin faces a crucial moment, with plans for a vote on constitutional changes that analysts see as opening a way for him to retain power after his presidential term ends in 2024. Authorities are sensitive to criticism over the constitutional amendments, apparently fearful that if voter turnout falls short, it could undermine the plebiscite's legitimacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPutin recently submitted his proposed constitutional amendments to the State Duma, or lower house of parliament. They include conservative measures designed to appeal to traditionalists: references to Russians' faith in God, to Russian unity and to the Russian values passed down through generations from forebears, as well as an amendment stating that marriage exists only between a man and a woman.\n\nThe amendments will be packaged in one bill, with Russians able to vote yes or no in a nationwide plebiscite next month.\n\nAnother element includes a bar on ceding any Russian territory, raising doubts on whether disputed lands including Crimea and the Kuril Islands, known in Japan as the Northern Territories, could ever be returned to Ukraine and Japan respectively. The amendments would also give Russian law precedence over international law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey would enshrine the constitutional status of the State Council, a body that analysts believe could be used as a vehicle for Putin to wield power after 2024.\n\nPutin is nervous again. He is worrying and stamping his feet, Navalny posted in a blog on his website Tuesday. People are laughing at his amendments. Nobody is even angry any more.
Jerry Krause looks on as the Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan talks about his new contract with the team in 1988. (Mark Elias/AP)\n\nJerry Krause, the general manager of the Chicago Bulls during a 1990s dynasty that included six NBA championships with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen leading the way, has died. He was 77.\n\nThe team confirmed his death on March 21 but did not provide further details. The Chicago Tribune reported that Mr. Krause had recent health issues that included osteomyelitis, a bone infection.\n\nMr. Krause spent 18 seasons leading the Bulls' front office and was a two-time NBA executive of the year. He helped put together a run that ranks among the most successful in NBA history and made the franchise a worldwide brand.\n\nWith Jordan and Pippen on the court and coach Phil Jackson pulling the strings from the sideline, the Bulls dominated in a way few teams have. Mr. Krause, who took over as general manager in 1985, was responsible for surrounding Jordan with the pieces that helped create two championship three-peats in the 1990s.\n\nMr. Krause hired Jackson from the Continental Basketball Association as an assistant to Doug Collins and then fired Collins in favor of Jackson following a run to the Eastern Conference finals in 1989. At the time, it was not a popular move. But it paid off in a big way.\n\nChicago Bulls general manager Jerry Krause during a 1995 press conference. (Michael S. Green/AP)\n\nThe same goes for the 1987 draft-day trade that brought Pippen to Chicago. On top of that, Mr. Krause drafted Horace Grant with the 10th overall selection that year, adding another major pieces to the championship foundation.\n\nDraft picks such as Toni Kukoc, Stacey King and B.J. Armstrong also played prominent roles on those teams. Mr. Krause also signed key contributors John Paxson, Steve Kerr, Bill Wennington and Ron Harper. Dennis Rodman, a flamboyant force on the glass, was acquired in a trade.\n\nMr. Krause also hired assistant coaches such as triangle offense architect Tex Winter and Doberman defense mastermind John Bach.\n\nHe had a great eye for talent, and his ability to build a team is unrivaled, said Paxson, now executive vice president of basketball operations for the Bulls. He's one of the best the league has ever seen.\n\nJerome Richard Krause was born in Chicago on April 6, 1939. He played catcher on his high school team and won a scholarship to Bradley University in Peoria, Ill. He later told the newspaper Crain's Chicago Business that his dream of playing professionally was snuffed by a semipro manager who looked him over and quipped, Son, don't miss no classes.\n\nMr. Krause quit school and, in 1962, found work as a self-described flunky with the Chicago Cubs, doing everything, he told Crain's, from filing minor league reports to warming up pitchers. He then became a scout for a variety of teams and began to prosper.\n\nI got fascinated with scouting, he told Crain's. It's the same as intelligence work.\n\nAs a scout for the Baltimore Bullets, he was responsible for drafting Hall of Famers Earl Monroe and Wes Unseld. He helped select Jerry Sloan, Norm Van Lier, Clifford Ray, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon as a scout for the Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Lakers and the Bulls in an earlier stint.\n\nMr. Krause also worked for baseball's Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, White Sox, New York Yankees, New York Mets and, most recently, Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nBut he is best remembered for his time as the Bulls' general manager.\n\nFor all their success, it wasn't necessarily a smooth ride. Jordan referred to Mr. Krause as crumbs for doughnut residue on his clothes. A feud with Mr. Krause contributed to Jackson's departure and the disintegration of the dynasty following the second three-peat in 1998.\n\nIt didn't help Mr. Krause's image when he was quoted as saying, Players and coaches don't win championships, organizations win championships. He insisted he was simply trying to give scouts and employees behind the scenes their due.\n\nThe Bulls, meanwhile, ranked among the league's worst teams after the breakup of the dynasty. Mr. Krause retired as GM in 2003.\n\nHis first marriage, to Sharon Bergofsky, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife, the former Thelma Frankel; two children; and four grandchildren.\n\nAssociated Press
These findings were part of a 16-page report assembled by 300 young people at a week-long conference sponsored by the Vatican. It drew, too, on online submissions from 15,000 others.\n\nWe, the young church, ask that our leaders speak in practical terms about subjects such as homosexuality and gender issues, about which young people are already freely discussing, the report said.\n\nAD\n\nIt was less clear how the group wanted the church to reframe its message. The young people, ages 16 to 29, did not find consensus on issues like contraception (artificial birth control is banned for all Catholics, even married couples), cohabitation before marriage (frowned upon) or abortion.\n\nAD\n\nThe report also pushed the church to find ways to connect to young people, who often feel indifference, judgment and rejection from the church.\n\nThroughout, the report called on the church to incorporate women more fully into church leadership. Women cannot serve as priests, which means they're absent from the church's upper ranks. Young female Catholics said they feel alienated as a result.\n\nAD\n\nSome young women feel that there is a lack of leading female role models within the church, and they too wish to give their intellectual and professional gifts to the church, the report found.\n\nThe report also called on the church to accept that technology is a way of life for young people. The focus should not be condemnation, they wrote, but rather guidance on how to combat online addiction and use technology responsibly.\n\nAD\n\nAt the beginning of the conference, Pope Francis urged the young people — selected by their national bishops' conferences, universities or church movements — to be honest. That is reflected in the final report, which notes that young people are leaving Catholicism because of indifference, judgment and rejection. It also called on the church to more fully acknowledge its mistakes, such as the clergy sex abuse scandal.\n\nAD\n\nSome mentors are put on a pedestal, and when they fall, the devastation may impact young people's abilities to continue to engage with the church, the report said.\n\nThe document will be incorporated into an October synod of bishops, focused on how to better incorporate young people into the church.\n\nIt isn't clear what that will entail. But at a Palm Sunday service on Sunday, Pope Francis urged young people to keep shouting and not allow the older generations to silence their voices.\n\nAD\n\nThe temptation to silence young people has always existed, he said in his homily, delivered to an audience of thousands in St. Peter's Square. There are many ways to silence young people and make them invisible. Many ways to anesthetize them, to make them keep quiet, ask nothing, question nothing. There are many ways to sedate them, to keep them from getting involved, to make their dreams flat and dreary, petty and plaintive.\n\nAD
So we're left with an unrevealing portrait of a towering sports figure, the dots connected by people who either have known Woods, worked with or for Woods or covered Woods as members of the media. And that's fine; it wouldn't be a documentary without all that. But imagine how enlightening it would have been to see something along the lines of Woods reacting to old clips or interviews shown to him on a tablet as Michael Jordan did in ESPN's mostly acclaimed Chicago Bulls documentary from last year. Or, really, to see Woods — at this stage of his life, with the wisdom that comes from decades of busy adulthood — react earnestly to anything at all.\n\nThe treasures are few in the film, which is directed by Oscar-nominated documentarians Matthew Heineman and Matthew Hamachek and is based upon a 2018 biography of Woods by Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian. Woods's high school girlfriend, Dina Parr, humanizes the golfer with 1990s-era home video of Woods acting like a goofball teenager and stories of their time together. But she also reveals he had no life skills and ended their three-year relationship in a handwritten letter in which Woods said he felt used and manipulated by you and your family.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n(That letter also is old news, having been obtained and published by E Online in 2009.)\n\nTiger hints but never comes right out and says that Woods's father and mother ordered him to end his relationship with Parr. Earl Woods looms especially large in the documentary, whose two parts are cleaved into the time in which Tiger's father was alive and the time after he died in 2006. (Woods's mother, Kultida, gets a brief mention as a strict disciplinarian but otherwise is not talked about much, though the revelation that she often referred to rival Phil Mickelson as Hefty instead of the embraced nickname Lefty drew a chuckle.)\n\nEarl Woods was a Vietnam veteran who put a club in Tiger's hands when the latter was barely a toddler. He taught his son to deal with on-course distractions by jingling his keys in his pocket or talking loudly with others while Tiger was putting. He also was prone to saying outlandish stuff such as this (in 1996, while Tiger still was in college):\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy heart fills with so much joy when I realize that this young man is going to help so many people. He will transcend this game and bring to the world a humanitarianism which has never been known before. The world will be a better place to live in by virtue of his existence and his presence. This is my treasure. Please accept it and use it wisely.\n\nAs for how Tiger felt about his dad anointing him as the Chosen One, all we get is a clip of a much younger Woods saying, That's just a dad speaking.
My entire childhood, my parents were a unit that lived under the same roof, slept in the same bed, and shuttled my brother and me to soccer and marching-band practice. Sure, there were arguments, but they always recovered. I didn't need my parents to have some grand love story. I just wanted them together in a way that was comfortable and safe to return to no matter how far away I lived. That was what I felt was promised to me when I was born.\n\nOf course, those are the selfish thoughts of a 23-year-old who had not yet seen her parents for who they really are — two humans who made a choice to get married and who made a choice to have kids. They were not soul mates, and there was no guarantee they would stay in love forever. But I still held out hope because I couldn't accept the alternative: that the two people I loved most no longer were in love.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter my parents split, they sold the house I grew up in, put their stuff in storage and found small apartments a town away from each other. I watched my mom tell her aging, Depression-era parents that, after 25 years, she was divorcing my dad. I watched my dad shop for groceries and cook for himself for the first time. I moved out of state not long after the divorce. But when I'd visit him, I was always struck by how much our lives paralleled each other's. We both were diving into the unknown, living in cramped one-bedroom apartments, managing credit card statements and coming home at dawn (him because of a graveyard shift working at a printing press at a factory, me because I was 23 and living in a major city where the bars were open until 4 a.m.).\n\nA few years later, my mom started dating. At this point, I had to acknowledge once and for all that my mom was more than my mom, more than a person who was married to my dad. She was looking for love and companionship, just like I was. It was really weird at first, but after the initial shock wore off, we were able to have candid conversations about what it's like to date after 25 years. The short answer? It's bizarre.\n\nLuckily, it was not long before she met a man who is perfect for her. They've been married now for more than three years. When they are together, they act like newlyweds who are very much in love. Growing up, I never evaluated my parents' happiness with each other. But to see the way my mom acts now with her new husband, their dynamic is almost unrecognizable to that of her and my dads. I always wanted my parents to be happy, but more important to me was to survive growing up. To do that, I felt I needed to be raised in a two-parent household, no matter what.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEight years after the divorce, my dad and I are in similar stages of life. I just turned 30 and am getting ready to leave the city I ran away to when I was 23, for another, bigger city. My dad is close to 70 years old, retired, with his condo up for sale. When we talk on the phone each week, he tells me about his anxiety about where he'll go and what he'll do when his place sells. Me, too, I say. I have to find a job and make new friends and figure out a whole new transit system. I'm overwhelmed.\n\nBefore the divorce, we never used to talk openly about our feelings, but now we've both grown up. Neither of us has anything to prove, which puts us in great positions to be each other's sounding boards.\n\nThis is not where I pictured my mom or dad at this point in their lives, but it makes sense. On one hand, you don't completely change when you have kids, but you continue to evolve. My parents were humans before I came into this world, and they will continue to be as I grow up and make my own life. I couldn't meet them when they were kids, and I didn't try to know them as adults when I was a child. But now I'm excited to explore our relationship as mutual adults, navigating the real world together.
When she applied for another academic position, the hiring researcher remarked that he didn't hire women because they too often stayed home with sick children. Later, an employment agency reviewed her résumé and dismissed her as just a housewife who went back to school.\n\nDr. Sandler had run head first into a problem that had only recently been given a name: sex discrimination. Knowing she was not alone, she embarked on a campaign that would change the culture on college campuses — and eventually the law with the passage in 1972 of Title IX, the landmark legislation that banned sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDr. Sandler, who was widely celebrated as the godmother of Title IX, died Jan. 5 at her home in Washington. She was 90. The cause was cancer, said her daughter Deborah Sandler.\n\nTrained in psychology and counseling, Dr. Sandler devoted decades of her life to documenting, analyzing and stopping the forms of discrimination — subtle and overt — that held women back academically and professionally in educational settings.\n\nWhen she began her advocacy efforts, many university departments arbitrarily limited the number of women they would hire. Others hired no women at all. Some disqualified married women. Some colleges barred female students from chemistry and other departments that were deemed more suited for men.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Sandler investigated and found that there was no federal law prohibiting discrimination against women in educational fields. There was, however, an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson that prohibited sex discrimination by organizations with federal contracts.\n\nAD\n\nIt was a genuine 'Eureka' moment, she later recalled in an account of her work. I actually shrieked aloud for I immediately realized that many universities and colleges had federal contracts, were therefore subject to the sex discrimination provisions of the Executive Order, and that the Order could be used to fight sex discrimination on American campuses.\n\nDr. Sandler joined the Women's Equity Action League and, as the one-member Federal Action Contract Compliance Committee, challenged 250 educational institutions with allegations of sex discrimination. She also coordinated a letter-writing campaign that, by her account, generated so much Congressional mail that the Departments of Labor, and Health, Education and Welfare had to assign several full-time personnel to handle the letters.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the National Women's Hall of Fame, where Dr. Sandler was inducted in 2013, her efforts led to the first federal investigation of sex discrimination on campuses.\n\nAD\n\nShe worked for a House subcommittee with oversight of the matter and for the Health, Education and Welfare Department as momentum grew, culminating with passage of Title IX. Its chief legislative champions included Rep. Edith Green (D-Ore.), Rep. Patsy Mink (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.). Today, Title IX is widely known as the guarantor of equal access to collegiate athletics.\n\nFor decades after the law was passed, Dr. Sandler continued her activism for gender equality in the classroom. As a speaker and author, she sought to draw attention to what she and a fellow researcher, Roberta M. Hall, in a widely read 1982 academic paper termed the chilly classroom environment for women.\n\nAD\n\nFemale professors, she found, were more likely than male professors to be challenged on their credentials. Those with PhDs were not consistently addressed as Dr., and students expected greater leniency from women when they failed to complete their assignments.\n\nAD\n\nFemale students, for their part, were more likely to receive an uh-huh from a professor when they participated in class, rather than the more engaged response that might greet a male student.\n\nWhen Title IX was passed, I was quite naive, Dr. Sandler said. I thought all the problems of sex discrimination in education would be solved in one or two years at most. When two years passed, I increased my estimate to five years, then later to 10, then to 50, and now I realize it will take many generations to solve all the problems.\n\nAD\n\nBernice Resnick — she went by Bunny — was born in New York City on March 3, 1928. Her parents ran a women's clothing store in New Jersey.\n\nSexist practices, she recalled, seemed practically part of the natural order of the world. When I applied to college it was openly known that women needed higher grades and test scores in order to be accepted, she recalled in a history of Title IX. No one complained — it was just the way things were.\n\nAD\n\nShe received a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College in 1948 and a master's degree from the City College of New York in 1950, both in psychology, and a PhD in counseling from the University of Maryland in 1969.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Sandler spent two decades as the director of the Project on the Status and Education of Women at the Association of American Colleges until she stepped down in 1991. She later held associations with institutions including the Center for Women Policy Studies in Washington and was a sought-after witness in discrimination and sexual harassment cases. As an activist, she also highlighted the danger of rape on campuses.\n\nDr. Sandler's marriage to Jerrold Sandler ended in divorce. Survivors include two daughters, Deborah Sandler of Martinez, Calif., and Emily Sanders of Los Angeles; and three grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nLater in her career, Dr. Sandler explored the chilly environment on campus that greeted minorities much as it greeted women. Interviewed in 1994 by the publication Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education, she reflected on the rejection that sent her on a path of advocacy.\n\nAD\n\nI don't think I would have noticed if they'd said you come on too strong, she said. The problem was that phrase too strong for a woman.
Both sexes are encouraged to marry at relatively young ages. But there's an extra burden on women due to the disproportionate amount of single men. As Jon Birger wrote in his 2015 book Date-Onomics: How Dating Became A Lopsided Numbers Game, in the Orthodox dating pool there are 12 percent more available women than men. Within the community, this imbalance is called the shidduch (or matchmaking) crisis.\n\nWe feel the onus is on us, said Naomi, a 42-year-old teacher at a modern Orthodox day school outside Manhattan. It's almost like the [matchmakers] are desperate to get the women married because there are so many of them. We don't sense they tell the men to get a better profile picture or do this, do that. It's more like 'oh, the women are desperate for you, so it's okay, you can do whatever you want.'\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHowever, the bigger issue for a modern Orthodox single woman may not be her relationship status, but how she is treated by her community because of it. For me, it is a 'crisis' because I think we are looked at differently. I think we are forgotten, Naomi said.\n\nShe described how she feels her ideas are often dismissed by her colleagues, who are mostly married Orthodox women. I definitely get treated differently at work. I think they just think I don't know anything. If I mention a recipe, they'll just ignore me, Naomi said. She said she feels it in more substantive areas, as well, such as working with young students, because she herself is not a mother. I don't sense they really think I know what I'm talking about when I'm working with the kids.\n\nOther single women in the modern Orthodox community shared similar experiences of feeling slighted by community members because they were not married. Slowly you start to realize your single status, and realize that even though you might have a master's degree or be accomplished in your work, people in the religious community still talk to you as if you are in high school, Eryn London, a 31-year-old rabbinical student at Yeshivat Maharat, wrote in an email. She described how, at her parents' synagogue, very rarely do the young married couples talk to me.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToby, a 38-year-old psychotherapist in Manhattan, said she suspects she isn't afforded the same privacy and respect that married congregants are. When she visits her family in Atlanta and goes to their synagogue, she says that people stop me, and the first thing they say is, 'How's your social life?' or 'How's dating?'\n\nI feel like I'm doing something wrong because I'm not married — and then, they feel this need to tell me what I'm doing wrong, Toby added. If someone were trying to get pregnant, would they experience the same thing? I don't know, but I do feel people probably treat me a little different than if I were married.\n\nWhat may contribute to this treatment is that many of the Orthodox obligations for adult women are tied to being married. Sharon Weiss-Greenberg, who is the executive director of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance and has advocated for better treatment of singles in the community, said the high value on being married starts with the first mitzvah, or good deed, described in the Torah: You shall be fruitful and multiply. While this line can be interpreted in different ways, many view it as a commandment to have children. And some, such as Rabbi Aryeh Citron, dean of Yeshivah College in Miami Beach, Fla., view it as a directive to have as many children as possible.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nToby brought up her frustration with not being able to fulfill some of the obligations traditionally designated for a woman her age, including those regarding sexual behavior. Since premarital sex is forbidden, only those who are married can practice the laws of niddah, which include regulations for when sex is permitted in regard to a woman's menstrual cycle and after she gives birth. Practicing niddah also involves getting to immerse in the mikveh, the ritual bath, and purify one's self. While some might see the laws of niddah as a burden, a woman who follows them is considered to be doing a religious deed or good works, akin to lighting the Sabbath candles or keeping kosher. In a way, it's a privilege to practice the laws of niddah — a privilege denied to all who are not married.\n\nI feel like the commandments specifically designed for me as a woman are not something I can do. It makes me feel like I can't be Orthodox in that way I was always taught I was supposed to be, she said.\n\nThe separation between married and single Orthodox Jews goes beyond religious responsibilities. It's embedded in the culture, too. Many single women said couples and families tend not to invite them over for Shabbat meals. As a result, they end up feeling isolated, not just at weddings or other family milestone events, but every week. The ritual of sharing a Shabbat meal with family, friends or community members is a cornerstone of Orthodox culture.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNaomi said that she's taken on the responsibility of organizing and hosting some of her single friends, but she's tired of always being the one to make the meals and wishing the families I knew would invite me. Toby also said that Shabbat has become lonely and, thus, a burden. I would much rather be going out than sitting in my apartment, she said. You're also taught you're supposed to love Shabbat, and I don't.\n\nNaomi said she has sensed that, if couples were to invite her for Shabbat, they would feel pressured to have other single people come, too. So they end up excluding singles altogether. They could invite me, but then they don't know who to invite me with, so, I think they just don't, she said. I think they're just not sure what to do with me. I find they look at me differently. They don't see me as someone they can be friends with, because I'm not in their life station.\n\nIf this divide between singles and marrieds remains, it may hurt the modern Orthodox community at large — not just its single congregants. At best, single women have less of an incentive to be active participants if they are not viewed as such. At worst, they leave the community, as some women said their single friends have.\n\nWeiss-Greenberg warned: If they're going to make people who are single, for whatever reason they are, feel different or less than, then they're missing out on all they could be contributing.
While I oppose the nomination of Brian Buescher to the U.S. District Court in Nebraska, I stand strongly against those who are fomenting religious bigotry, citing as disqualifiers Buescher's Catholicism and his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, Gabbard said in the op-ed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBuescher was a Republican candidate for Nebraska attorney general in 2014.\n\nDuring his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in November, and in written questions that he answered in early December, Buescher was asked about his public statements during his 2014 campaign, his position on issues such as abortion as well as his membership in the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal society.\n\nThe organization has in recent years taken steps into the political realm, funding anti-same-sex marriage initiatives in a number of states.\n\nAmong those questioning Buescher over his membership in the Knights of Columbus were Hirono and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). In response to one question, Buescher defended his membership in the organization, which he said does not have the authority to take personal political positions on behalf of all of its approximately 2 million members.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn recent weeks, the senators' grilling of Buescher has become the topic of a number of pieces in conservative media, with some comparing it to California Democrat Dianne Feinstein's questioning of the religious beliefs of another Trump nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, in 2017.\n\nGabbard in her Tuesday op-ed argued that if Buescher's religion and membership in the Knights of Columbus were disqualifying, then President Kennedy and the late senator Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) would have been 'unqualified' for the same reasons.\n\nWhether we think of ourselves as Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Sikh, Buddhists, Jews, atheists, agnostics, or anything else, it is imperative that we stand united in our commitment to protect religious freedom and the right to worship or not worship, safely and without the fear of retribution, Gabbard said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHirono's office responded Wednesday that Gabbard was mischaracterizing her questioning of Buescher, and that the senator was voicing her concerns about the nominee's past public statements rather than his religion.\n\nIt is unfortunate that Congresswoman Gabbard based her misguided opinion on the far-right wing manipulation of these straightforward questions, Hirono spokesman Will Dempster said in a statement.\n\nHe added that over the past two years, Hirono has been attacked by right wing ideologues for her examination of Donald Trump's ideologically-driven nominees to the courts.\n\nSenator Hirono asks all judicial nominees — particularly those who have expressed very strong personal ideological views in conflict with Supreme Court precedent — if they can be fair, Dempster said. She asked Mr. Buescher, who has a clear record of anti-choice activism, whether he could separate his personal beliefs from decisions he would make if confirmed for a lifetime appointment on the federal bench.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, Gabbard spokeswoman Lauren McIlvaine said Gabbard will always fight for religious freedom and oppose religious bigotry — no matter where it comes from or to whom it's directed.
But Gillibrand's transformation had already begun. The day of her appointment, she vowed to work on a bill to strengthen background checks with a fierce critic of her gun record, then-Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.). The following day, she told an audience in Harlem that she could perhaps be flexible on gun control.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new senator proved more than flexible. She voted against the NRA's entire agenda and received an F-rating from the group by her next election, less than two years later. Her shift on guns was so rapid that it drew a word of caution from McCarthy, who became an ally.\n\nI remember saying to her one time, 'Don't change your mind so fast — learn the issue first,'  McCarthy said.\n\nGillibrand overhauled her political identity during this period, abandoning the conservative positions that made her popular upstate and embracing or even moving further left than the liberal consensus on guns, immigration, Wall Street and same-sex marriage. As the Democratic Party itself moved left, she staked out positions popular with the party's swelling base of liberals, a posture most evident when she called for abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. She has voted against President Trump's agenda more than any other senator.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGillibrand's evolution seemed to reach its apex last week when she introduced herself as a candidate for president and a fighter for liberal values. But her shift in views from a decade ago is already raising questions among Democrats and provoking attacks from Republicans eager to define her as a flip-flopper.\n\nExperts who have followed Gillibrand's rise said the impression that she has hair-trigger judgment and an overriding instinct to capi­tal­ize on the political moment could prove more problematic than any one shift on policy.\n\nThis urge to have answers now, now, now is strong and can come across as inauthentic, said Ted Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who has observed Gillibrand. It's okay to say, 'I didn't know.' It's okay to engage audiences. But it's not okay to compensate for the not knowing and the not engaging with a super strong position immediately in order to win them over. The thing about growth is that it takes time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJonathan Tasini, a labor activist and supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who weighed a primary challenge against Gillibrand in 2010, said the Democratic left should not reflexively turn its back on candidates who have changed positions.\n\nThe thing we have to look at is: Does the evolution make sense? Is it a whiplash evolution or does it have some content to it where you can see someone changing? I don't know the answer, in all candor, with Kirsten Gillibrand, he said.\n\nGillibrand, now 52, has often described her changes of view as epiphanies. On the subject of guns, she tells about meeting in 2009 with the parents of a Brooklyn teenager who was killed by a stray bullet. She dropped her NRA-backed positions as a result, she says.\n\nAD\n\nWhen you absorb any amount of someone's pain that they're living in that moment, it's hard to ignore it, Gillibrand told GQ last year. It changed my view completely and it changed my view immediately. It wasn't an evolution. It wasn't a thoughtful process. It was immediate.\n\nAD\n\nLast week, she said her shifts reveal political courage.\n\nI think it's important to know when you're wrong and to do what's right. And I will do what's right, and I will fight for what's right, and I don't back down from those fights, she said Wednesday at a news conference in Troy, N.Y.\n\nGillibrand has gone against her own party on a number of matters related to women. She crossed fellow Democrats with her bipartisan push to remove the adjudication of military sexual assault cases from the chain of command. The plan failed to advance to a final Senate vote in March 2014.\n\nAD\n\nShe alienated the Clintons and some of their allies in 2017 when she became the highest-profile elected Democrat at that point to say Bill Clinton should have resigned over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. She had previously benefited from their support, financial and otherwise.\n\nAD\n\nThat same year, she was the first senator to call for the resignation of Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) after he was accused by eight women of groping or forcible kissing. Dozens of colleagues followed; Franken, who denied some allegations and said he remembered other encounters very differently, said the next day that he would leave the Senate.\n\nThe Franken episode angered some on the left who felt Gillibrand abandoned Franken for her own gain. Through a spokesman, Franken declined to comment for this piece.\n\nAD\n\nI will stand up for what I believe in, especially when it's hard, Gillibrand said Wednesday. With Sen. Franken, it's sad for many people, but after eight allegations of sexual harassment and groping, credible allegations at the time, I just couldn't stay silent. My job was not to stay silent. I couldn't defend it. . . . If some wealthy individuals — that makes them angry, that's on them, she said.\n\nAD\n\nSusie Buell, a major Democratic donor who has criticized Gillibrand's handling of the episode, wrote in an email to The Washington Post that she saw Gillibrand as the leader in the force calling for Franken's resignation, calling it a rush to judgment at a very intense moment.\n\nIt has nothing to do with wealthy people not wanting women being protected. It is about a great US senator, Al Franken, being accused and then driven out of his seat without the opportunity to defend himself. That to me is not acceptable, Buell wrote.\n\nAD\n\nStill, some liberal activists are not convinced the decision will be a problem for Gillibrand.\n\nIf we're going to be the party who believes women — and I think we should — Kirsten took a courageous position and that should be acknowledged, said Neil Sroka, communications ­director for Democracy for America, a liberal political action committee.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans have already started to hammer her.\n\nIf you looked up 'political opportunism' in the dictionary, Kirsten Gillibrand's photo would be next to it, Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said last week. From jumping on the 'abolish ICE' bandwagon to turning on the Clintons, Gillibrand always goes where the political wind blows. Democrats know it, which is why she's barely registering in the polls.\n\nAD\n\nYet that ignores a central facet of Gillibrand's policy changes: She has swung left in line with and occasionally ahead of Democratic voters, the sort of moves voters typically reward, not punish. The share of Democrats who want stricter gun laws has risen by 20 points since she embraced that view in 2009. What were once liberal views on immigration and LGBT rights have become mainstream.\n\nAD\n\nIn the Senate, Gillibrand has fought for the LGBT community, helping to lead the successful effort to repeal don't ask, don't tell, the policy barring military service by out gays and lesbians, and pushing legislation to stop discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nHer aides are particularly sensitive to her record on same-sex marriage and how it is described. Gillibrand started to vocally support same-sex marriage when she was appointed to the Senate. Under criticism at the time, she noted that she had backed a New York gay-marriage bill the previous year.\n\nAs a member of the House, Gillibrand said she personally supported same-sex marriage but argued for civil unions and letting states decide what to call them.\n\nI think the way you win this issue is you focus on getting the rights and privileges protected throughout the entire country, and then you do the state-by-state advocacy for having the title, she told an LGBT publication not long before her Senate appointment, according to the Advocate.\n\nWhile support for same-sex marriage is unanimous among high-ranking Democrats now, her position was common at the time among party leaders. Only two senators publicly supported same-sex marriage as of early 2008, according to Baptist Press, the news service of the Southern Baptist Convention. Gillibrand was among about six senators, all Democrats, who supported it at the time of her appointment, the news service reported. (As president, Barack Obama didn't formally support same-sex marriage until 2012.)\n\nImmigration represented a more dramatic shift for Gillibrand. As a House member, she opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants and supported making English the official language and deputizing police officers to act as immigration agents. After joining the Senate, she began to support comprehensive immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship, along with other liberal priorities on immigration.\n\nIn late June, Gillibrand denounced ICE as a deportation force and joined calls by liberal activists to abolish it. She was the first U.S. senator to take the position, and at the time, her language put her further to the left than her potential Democratic presidential rivals. Abolishing ICE and replacing it with a different agency is now a position shared by much of the field.\n\nI don't think ICE today is working as intended. . . . I believe that it has become a deportation force, and I think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues, Gillibrand said on CNN's Cuomo Prime Time.\n\nPeter Rivera, a former New York labor commissioner who in 2009 said Gillibrand's then-\n\nopposition to amnesty borders on xenophobia, said she accepted his invitation to meet with Hispanic legislators and has been completely supportive of their agenda ever since.\n\nI attacked her, Rivera said. I was opposed to her and she did not hold that against me. For all intents and purposes, she broke bread with me and said I want your support.
But Trump told congressional leaders he will not sign the measure, said incoming House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\n\nAD\n\nThe president's not going to sign it . . . Now's the time to come together, find common ground and solve this problem, Mc­Carthy said. I didn't find the Democrats were wanting to negotiate today.\n\nThe closing of Washington's star attractions has left many tourists and furloughed locals frustrated with both President Trump and Congress. (Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)\n\nAD\n\nTrump has invited congressional leaders back to the White House on Friday for more discussions. But neither side offered any indication that a deal was within reach.\n\nThe jostling between Trump and top Democrats reflects how Washington's new balance of power will not immediately break the impasse that has shuttered large parts of the government since Dec. 22. And with no obvious path to a compromise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday said the shutdown could drag on for weeks.\n\nAD\n\nThe 12-day government shutdown has entered a new and unruly phase. Before the meeting, Trump leveled a series of false claims about immigration and the federal budget. Democrats countered by accusing the president of intransigence and said they would not yield to his demands.\n\nNo, construction hasn't begun on President Trump's wall and there is not funding to begin construction. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nWe have given the Republicans a chance to take 'yes' for an answer, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) the expected incoming House speaker, said after the meeting. Earlier, Trump said the shutdown would go on as long as it takes.\n\nAD\n\nThe shutdown's effects are spreading, particularly in the Washington region. The Smithsonian Institution closed its museums and the National Zoo on Wednesday. Trash and human waste are piling up at national parks.\n\nAD\n\nThe District of Columbia has stopped issuing marriage licenses because of cutbacks to its funding, and the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a number of other agencies have suspended or scaled back a variety of services for families and businesses.\n\nAs Trump and Democrats scrap over the wall, both sides have all the power they need to block the other. Democrats can use their House majority — or a Senate filibuster — to stall any legislation that includes additional money for a wall. Trump can veto any bill that doesn't, and Senate Republicans have said they won't advance any legislation that lacks the president's blessing.\n\nAD\n\nTrump wants $5.6 billion for the construction of 200 miles of wall along the Mexican border. Some Republicans have suggested he would be willing to accept a lesser amount, but he tried to dismiss this idea on Wednesday.\n\nAD\n\nHe also rejected the negotiating position of his own top advisers. Vice President Pence in December approached Democrats with a compromise offer of $2.5 billion for border security and wall improvements. But Trump on Wednesday said he would never accept that deal.\n\nSomebody said $2.5 [billion], Trump said to reporters. No. Look, this is national security we're talking about.\n\nDemocrats have signaled a willingness to approve $1.3 billion for border security as part of a broader spending bill, and a portion of that money could be used to replace and repair existing sections of wall and fencing. But they have drawn the line at the use of any additional taxpayer money for the construction of a new wall.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president on Wednesday continued to advance false claims about where the wall money would come from and why it is needed.\n\nHe said the wall would be paid for by Mexico through savings to the United States under a new North American trade agreement. But the trade agreement has yet to be approved by Congress, and trade experts said such savings are uncertain.\n\nHe also wrote in a Twitter post that Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. This is also not true. Some walls and fencing have been replaced during the Trump administration, but there is little evidence that new barriers have been established along the 2,000-mile border.\n\nAD\n\nAnd in remarks to reporters during a televised Cabinet meeting, Trump estimated there are between 30 million and 35 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. That number is roughly triple the estimate his own Department of Homeland Security offered several weeks ago.\n\nAD\n\nPelosi is under extreme pressure from liberal groups not to give in to White House pressure for any wall funding. McCarthy said Trump wanted to have the next meeting on Friday, after leadership elections in Congress, and Trump has suggested Pelosi is opposing money for the border wall because she is worried about losing support from liberals.\n\nBut Pelosi has rejected the notion she is opposing the wall for purely political purposes, and many Democrats have rallied to her defense.\n\nAD\n\nThroughout the 2016 presidential campaign and earlier in his presidency, Trump told voters he would build a concrete wall, 30 feet tall in most places, to keep people out. He also promised that Mexico would pay for the wall. Since becoming president, though, he has shifted this promise, saying the money must come from U.S. taxpayers.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the shutdown, Trump has offered much different descriptions of the barrier he wants to build along the Mexico border. He has said at times it would be a traditional wall, but he has also rejected the idea of a wall and described it as a series of steel slats. He recently offered a picture on Twitter of vertical posts with pointed tips, but other government officials said they were not planning to erect anything that looked like that.\n\nThe shutdown began after Trump rejected bipartisan congressional efforts to fund many operations through Feb. 8, insisting that any deal must contain wall money. His demand infuriated many Republicans who had been working to avoid a shutdown, but most have followed his lead and are insisting Democrats broker some sort of compromise.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats on Wednesday sought to ramp up pressure on Republicans to reopen the government, even suggesting they push off a debate about the border wall to a later date.\n\nAD\n\nI said, 'Mr. President, give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said after the White House meeting. He could not give a good answer.\n\nTwo congressional aides briefed on the exchange said Trump told Schumer the president would look foolish if he backed down now. White House officials didn't respond to requests for comment on this exchange.\n\nDespite the far-reaching impacts of the shutdown, much of the federal government has not been touched. Major agencies such as the Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services have already been funded through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, thanks to spending bills passed by Congress last year.\n\nHouse Democrats on Thursday plan to pass two bills: one to fund the Department of Homeland Security at its current level through Feb. 8, which would continue the $1.3 billion in border barrier funding; and the other to fund the rest of the government through Sept. 30, at levels negotiated on a bipartisan basis in the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nThat would make it possible for McConnell to send Trump a bill to reopen most of the government, while setting aside the fight over the wall.\n\nTrump and some conservative Republicans have said the fight over wall funding is necessary now because it's the best point of leverage, believing Democrats will rush to fund government programs and offer up some money in return for GOP votes. That has proved not to be the case.\n\nWednesday's meeting was crafted by the White House as an opportunity for DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to brief Democrats on problems along the Mexico border, but Democrats quickly interjected and said they wanted to talk about efforts to reopen the government.\n\nThe last time Schumer and Pelosi met Trump at the White House, on Dec. 11, it turned into a bizarre televised squabble during which Trump claimed he would be proud to shut down the government over the wall and insisted he would take ownership of any shutdown. The agencies that are unfunded and in shutdown mode include Homeland Security, which pays for the wall; as well as the departments of Agriculture, Justice, Interior, Transportation, State, and Housing and Urban Development. NASA is also partially shut down, along with the National Park Service and an array of smaller agencies.\n\nSome 800,000 federal workers are affected, including around 350,000 who have been furloughed while the rest stay on the job wondering whether they will end up getting paid. In past shutdowns, Congress has approved retroactive pay once the impasse has been resolved. But the many government contractors affected may never make up their lost paychecks.\n\nThe current shutdown is the longest since a 16-day partial shutdown in 2013 over the Affordable Care Act.
We've seen it so many times before that our reactions are instinctive, no matter the brutality. When Nazis go down, our spirits lift. Theaters full of people clap and whoop. Movies have taught generations of film-goers to revel in righteous violence.\n\nAD\n\nThings are a little more complicated in the real world.\n\nAD\n\nIn the last weeks there have been a couple of high-profile incidents that we can file under the general category of violence against Nazis, to keep things simple. The first happened during Donald Trump's inauguration when Richard Spencer, the man who coined the phrase alt-right, was punched in the face while giving a television interview on the streets of Washington. Spencer claims he isn't a Nazi, though he's been described as a white supremacist who longs for an ethno-state and wants to ban interracial marriage, so feel free to use whatever term you see fit. (He prefers identitarian.)\n\nThen there's Shia LaBeouf, who launched a live-stream art installation that same day. For the piece, participants are supposed to show up to the Museum of the Moving Image in New York and say the words he will not divide us into a camera. The protest art has led to counter-protests, though, and LaBeouf hasn't taken too kindly to some of the Nazi rhetoric trolls have brought with them. At one point, a man tried to inconspicuously say the white nationalist slogan 1488 into the camera before the actor started screaming he will not divide us into the man's face and tried to aggressively shepherd the interloper away from the camera. Later, LaBeouf was arrested after another altercation — though the impetus for that situation is unclear.\n\nThe incident involving Spencer quickly turned into a meme, with some reveling in the glory of seeing a white nationalist get punched. One was Barack Obama's former speechwriter, who was impressed by the industrious Twitter users who set the punch video to music, including Born in the USA and The Boys Are Back in Town.\n\nMeanwhile, a debate over whether hitting Nazis is an excusable act erupted online.\n\nIn an interview with Newsweek, former New York Times Magazine Ethicist columnist Randy Cohen seemed perturbed by the very question.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou have an ethical right to defend yourself against a physical assault, he said. But you do not have the right to respond to contemptible beliefs with physical violence. You organize politically. You struggle. You resist. You march. You vote. You run for office. We are not thugs and we don't respond with thuggery! (He did however admit that a little schadenfreude was only natural.)\n\nBut who can blame the people grappling with this question? Pop culture has coaxed us into believing that, when faced with horrible villains, the noble response is physical aggression. The vast majority of people who saw Spencer get assaulted watched it on a screen, which removes them from the true impact of the act. Zoe Daniel, the D.C. bureau chief for Australia's ABC News, witnessed the attack and tweeted that it was a pretty nasty moment. Seeing something that shocking in person is very different from coming across it on social media, where the herd mentality urges viewers to join in on the jeering.\n\nMovies and television have celebrated vigilante justice for decades, from Charles Bronson avenging his wife's murder in Death Wish to Dexter — with a serial killer who's likable because he murders other, worse serial killers — to the recent MTV show Sweet/Vicious, about two college women getting vengeance on rapists, among other unsavory characters.\n\nBut we rarely see the realistic effects of what happens when people take revenge into their own hands. One exception is the best picture nominee Moonlight. (Some spoilers ahead.)\n\nThe movie takes place in three parts, examining a Miami boy's tumultuous journey to adulthood as he attempts to avoid bullies, not to mention his crack-addicted mother, while coming to terms with his sexuality. During the second chapter, Chiron (Ashton Sanders) is a high schooler who suffers through a cruel and heart-breaking incident spearheaded by his twisted nemesis (Patrick Decile). Following the violent encounter, Chiron breaks down. But then, after icing his bruised face, he decides to retaliate. He marches through the halls of his school, walks into a classroom, picks up a chair and breaks it over his bully's back.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe movie-goer in us is trained to cheer at such a bold act. But in Moonlight, the consequences are dire. Chiron ends up in a juvenile detention center, where he creates an armor of muscle, makes some connections and becomes a drug dealer.\n\nAsked about the scene, the Oscar-nominated writer-director Barry Jenkins said that audiences have reacted in varying ways.\n\nSome people break out into rapturous applause and some people are deathly hurt, he said during a trip to Washington late last year. Because you break the bully, but something breaks in you.\n\nJenkins adapted the movie from a play by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who was also in town. The story is based on the playwright's life, and he said that he often goes back to a similar moment from his past.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the things to this day I wrestle with is my reaction, which was much less physically violent than that, but the hardening that happens and the psychotic break, he said. Does it make me a coward that I didn't go back and kill those boys? Or does it make me smarter?
While I'm away, readers give the advice.\n\nOn using gifts as overtures to peace:\n\nMy ex-husband apparently slipped a gift under my tree while picking up the children.\n\nI spent the next 24 hours talking myself into not touching it — not on Christmas Eve, when it would stir unwanted emotions, and not in front of the kids, in case I say something snide.\n\nIt hit me what was missing: the apology. Sure, maybe my ex had woken up on the right side of the bed for the first time in 23 years. But to jump from meanness to a gift without a bridge of apology is a cheap way to go about reconciliation. It's what I have struggled with all along: being asked to suck up all those feelings and smile when a kindness is finally offered. Sure, it's the nice thing to do, but it's also another form of abuse.\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/The Washington Post)\n\nEx\n\nOn people who go wild after a divorce:\n\nAfter a long, hard marriage I had to find myself again. And while this was happening things were scary, hard, depressing and lonely. I lost my head for a while.\n\nMy married friends all said, Enjoy being alone, but even if they were divorcing they had kids to come home to, I didn't.\n\nSo to all the people out there who think, Wow, this person has lost their mind, yes, we do lose it. We are lonely, scared, depressed and trying to figure out our lives again. Don't judge us. Just be there for us when we are crying or laughing or even doing stupid things. It takes time.\n\nThe Friend\n\nOn angles you might not want to consider but should anyway when deciding to be a stay-at-home parent:\n\nMy husband encouraged me to stay home with our infant, but I worked one mile from home and did not want to give that up only to listen to him tell me a year later that it was time to go back.\n\nAs it turned out, he ended up leaving me for a woman he had worked with only a few months. My job outlasted my marriage and I shudder to think how much more helpless I would have felt during this devastating time had I not been employed.\n\nDivorced but Employed\n\nOn couples who disagree about having children:\n\nMy mother wanted children. My father most definitely did not. She badgered, pestered and finally convinced him to cooperate.\n\nMy life was spent torn between an overly enthusiastic mother and a resentful father. My father disliked me for taking my mother's attention and devotion away from him. My mother forced me to take the place of the multiple children she always dreamed of. I was a nuisance to one and the center of all existence to the other.\n\nI married at 18 to escape that toxic environment and had two children before I was ready to become a parent myself. My parents spent the remaining 40 years of their lives in bickering, miserable discord.\n\nChildren change everything in a relationship. Parents should either be on the same page, or divorce and find a partner whose need to procreate matches theirs. Otherwise, the result is wounded, confused offspring who are never sure whether they are wanted or despised.\n\nWisconsin
Dear Miss Manners: I am at a loss to come up with a polite reply to a rather common observation. Friends and acquaintances who have not seen me in a while seem to feel compelled to tell me that Your hair is long.''\n\nAs I have, indeed, been growing my hair out for a few years now, I am quite aware that it is longer than it used to be.\n\nTheir failure to add even a modest compliment to this rather pointed observation leads me to suspect that they do not like my new hairstyle. I am loath to say something to the effect of, Yes, do you like it?'' because, frankly, I do not want their opinion (it is hard enough for me to decide on personal grooming matters; I do not need input from everyone I know), and in any case they seem to have already made their true opinion known by their rather loud silence.\n\nReminding them of their mothers' admonition (If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all …'') seems a bit much. I notice that gentlemen who shave, or add, facial hair are often subjected to the same insensitive observations. Any thoughts on how best to respond?\n\nIn assuming that such comments indicate disapproval, you fail to allow for the propensity people have for stating the obvious. It is common, as well as idiotic, for people to be constantly informing others that they are tall or short or redheaded.\n\nMiss Manners would allow you to reply in the same spirit by validating their observations. The response to Your hair is long'' should be, Yes, it is.'' If you want to be chummy, you could add, I grew it.''\n\nDear Miss Manners: Is it appropriate to drink out of your cereal bowl?\n\nNot Miss Manners' bowl, she trusts. It would certainly upset her breakfast.\n\nBut are there others it might upset? Anybody else at the breakfast table? That person hiding behind a newspaper or tablet counts, as there could still be a peek. You would be safer drinking that last bit when you take the bowl into the kitchen.\n\nDear Miss Manners: As I'm sure you know, traditionally the bride's family comes up with the cost of the wedding. But now that marriage has become so diversified, who holds that responsibility? Grooms to grooms, brides to brides — and has this changed the tradition as far as straight marriage goes?\n\nThat custom was causing trouble long before gay weddings became legal. It referred to a time when brides were married from under their parents' guardianship, and the wedding expense was offset by the expectation that all subsequent living expenses would be paid by the bridegrooms.\n\nMiss Manners need hardly point out how silly it is to apply this automatically to brides who are out on their own and self-sufficient. Weddings are family occasions, and families should talk them over and decide, without pressuring one another, what each element feels it can comfortably contribute. Only then should the plans be made so that they are affordable.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Pointing is one option. Another is to read back the description that most menus find necessary when the name is so clever as to be unidentifiable:\n\nI would like the pastrami on rye with Tabasco, cayenne pepper and a side of pomme frites.\n\nMiss Manners recommends reserving complaints for someone, such as a manager, who is in a position to make a change. If none is available, the suggestion box or the restaurant's comment section on its website will do.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDear Miss Manners: My husband had been widowed 10 years before we met. He had three early-adult children, and I was divorced with one high-school-age and one early college-age children whom I raised by myself.\n\nMy entire family loves and includes my husband in every occasion. After nine years of marriage, with no conflicts between myself and my husband's family, my husband's children still exclude me from every occasion.\n\nI was included on his son's wedding invitation as and Fam, but I wasn't seated with family, given a place at the reception table or included in pictures. The couple's dog was given the place that the groom's father's wife would traditionally have been given — I was given a folding chair in the kitchen doorway because there was no place card for me at any table.\n\nAD\n\nI am not included in family holiday gatherings, although last year I was notified that I owed a significant amount for the rental of a cabin for a Christmas gathering that I wasn't invited to and didn't attend because I didn't know about it.\n\nAD\n\nI have attended gatherings and grandchildren's birthday parties, even though I wasn't included on the invitations, and each time I have been treated as an outsider, again asked to step out of family photos.\n\nI behave as graciously as possible, but it continues to be very uncomfortable for me, even though my husband doesn't see it that way. Today's invitation came again addressed only to my husband.\n\nIs it rude for me not to attend? Is it inappropriate for me not to send a gift? My husband never gives a gift — I have always been the one to give the gifts.\n\nAD\n\nHow can it be rude not to attend an event to which you were not invited?\n\nBut when you say there have been no conflicts between yourself and your husband's family, Miss Manners can only conclude that you use the term in a very literal sense. There is an enormous conflict — whether your husband is able to see it, and whether you are too gracious to make a scene.\n\nFamilies have been broken by lesser provocations than those you describe. If your husband is unable or unwilling to defend you, you need no excuse to decline invitations that were never made.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

I read in the New York Times today that if I run for president, one of my problems will be that I like Republicans, Biden said. He made the sign of the cross. Bless me, father, for I have sinned.\n\nThe story in question, by Alexander Burns, described an October 2018 visit to Michigan where Biden collected $200,000 to speak to a business group and praised Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) as one of the finest guys I've ever worked with.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe comment angered local Democrats, who came within five points of ousting Upton. The grumbling underlined a paradox of the 2020 Democratic primary: Even as Biden leads in speculative polls, even as some senior Democrats insist he could roll past President Trump, few in the party — including his rivals — are treating him like a front runner. No major candidate is waiting on Biden to decide; none of them believes he can clear the field.\n\nIf you compare Biden's on-paper strength to what we saw in the past few contests, it would make sense to call him a front-runner. The only serious poll of Iowa so far, December's Des Moines Register/CNN poll, put him at 32 percent in the first caucus state, 13 points ahead of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt). Every national poll of Democratic votes, which don't mean much at this stage but generate plenty of news, has put Biden on top. Polls testing him against the president consistently put him ahead.\n\nSo why isn't he treated like Hillary Clinton was, with potential rivals scurrying out of his shadow? In conversations this week, operatives working with most of the candidates already running for president offered a number of reasons. Some imagined that Biden could carve out a lane for himself; some speculated that he could collapse once a presidential bid moved from fantasy to reality.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis newsletter usually stays away from blind quotes, but the best way to capture a conversation that's happening all the time among Democrats was to let these operatives speak freely. In general, you can identify three reasons why they believe Biden, unlike previous front-runners, was not scaring anyone. These people are paid to elect somebody else, but this is the chatter happening when Democrats turn off the microphones.\n\nWhere's the grass-roots support? Multiple operatives described Biden as a genuinely beloved figure among Democratic voters but not one who had turned his popularity into a real network of support. He did not waste his time after leaving the White House: He wrote a memoir about his son Beau's death from cancer, he went on a multistate speaking tour, he launched a PAC, and he campaigned for dozens of Democrats, especially in places where other party figures were not terribly popular.\n\nBut he did not scare off Democrats by building, or letting his supporters build, a pre-campaign operation. There was some scoffing about Ready for Hillary, the 2013-2015 effort to organize potential supporters of the 2016 nominee, but it raised millions of dollars and hosted scores of events. During the invisible primary of the same period, Clinton and allies scouted for talent and communicated to those who weren't picked that it would be a mistake for their long-term plans, if they worked for someone else.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPeople may have assumed she was heir apparent, but she got her campaign moving and started grabbing top staff, one operative said. That is not the case with the Biden people.\n\nBiden has also lagged some lower-polling candidates in the trackable metrics of enthusiasm. To cite just one: Sanders has 7.5 million followers on Facebook and Elizabeth Warren has 3.1 million, while Biden clocks in at 1.5 million. Sanders and Warren have used that network to launch legislative pressure campaigns and organize bustling campaign events; Biden has not.\n\nJust in neutral, technical terms, I don't think Biden's seen as being on the cutting edge of grass-roots organizing, another operative said. Traditionally, his base has been high-dollar donors.\n\nAD\n\nWhat's his age again? This came up again and again: Biden would be the oldest nominee of any major party, and his nomination would set up a contest of two men in their late 70s, with implications that Biden's supporters have not seriously processed.\n\nAD\n\nThe idea that Biden would crack the Trump coalition with his appeal to white working-class voters was simply not flying with rival campaigns; they'd heard it about Hillary Clinton, who was seen as able to win back Democrats who'd left out of frustration with President Barack Obama. When they're exposed to the heat of a campaign, brands can hold strong, or they can melt.\n\nThere's been a fairly condescending notion from Democrats that to win back Trump voters you have to go in and look comfortable in white working-class communities, one operative said. That won't pass in the Democratic Party anymore. If you try that, you're going to hear 'Hey, you voted to send our jobs overseas,' and that's right in Trump's strike zone. He's got some experience in nailing Democrats who voted for these trade deals.\n\nAD\n\nSeveral operatives also argued that Biden, despite two national elections at Obama's side, would struggle to excite the voters who were hardest to turn out.\n\nAD\n\nWe lost in 2016, and the largest single factor in that loss was that we coudln't match our previous performance with the Obama coalition, one of them said. We couldn't match the enthusiasm. That is a long-run problem — how does he inspire more enthusiasm than Hillary? Young black voters who fell off in 2016 weren't excited by Hillary, so how does Joe Biden fix that? Is it when people start talking about his votes against busing?\n\nWhat about his gaffes? Speaking of those votes: Biden's potential rivals are extremely well aware of his long voting record, which put him on the record for everything from the antiabortion Hyde Amendment (now officially opposed by the Democratic platform) to crack/cocaine sentencing disparities to legislation that made it harder to declare bankruptcy.\n\nAD\n\nTalking points distributed by Biden allies say that he could run as a progressive champion who was outspoken on LGBTQ rights even when every pundit around said that it was a political mistake. His rivals point out that Biden would be the only Democrat who cast a vote in favor of a national ban on same-sex marriage, in 1996. Only one other potential candidate, Sanders, was in office that year.\n\nAD\n\nThe question is whether voters let him play by a different set of rules or not, said one operative. I hear people bring Anita Hill up a lot, so it'll be interesting to see how much apologizing he has to do. He does not start in a good position on women's rights. But he's in a better position to explain it than someone Democrats have never heard of.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the people working for other candidates think that Biden's framing for a potential campaign has put him in a weaker position. The Upton comment was one example of a Biden refrain: that he can get both parties to come to the table and cut deals on issues of obvious national importance.\n\nAD\n\nThere's no reason that by 2025, we can't have most of our energy coming from renewables, Biden said Thursday. It's all within our grasp, but for special interests. He recapped the implementation of the 2009 stimulus package by saying that it required us to work together, because our backs were against the wall. The reaction from rival campaigns: Which Republicans does he think the next president will have to deal with?\n\nAD\n\nThe 'let's hold hands and be bipartisan' shtick will not work, one operative said.\n\nAnother operative was blunter: The Biden of Democrats' dreams was not the 76-year-old Biden who appeared on the stump. This might have been the simplest critique, and clearest argument for why other Democrats do not fear Biden.\n\nAD\n\nWho did the operatives worry about? Really, no one, and none were exactly glib about Biden's potential challenge. He had the ability, they said, to enter the race with massive national attention, with polls showing him well ahead of Trump, and with some Democrats quickly endorsing him. But after 2016, they simply were not afraid of front-runners.\n\nAD WATCH\n\nThe Partnership for America's Health Care Future, launched with some ballyhoo in December, is an all-hands effort by insurance and drug companies to suppress support for Medicare-for-all before it's too late. Efforts like this have been brutally effective in state elections, with hundreds of millions of dollars raining down to block health-care ballot measures.\n\nAD\n\nThe first national ad by the new group isn't inspiring many liberal nightmares. The length of a pop song, it tells the story of a health-care system that pretty much works as is but is too expensive for some people.\n\nSome people are proposing we start over and eliminate employer-provided insurance, says a narrator. Whether it's called Medicare-for-all, single-payer or a public option, a one-size-fits-all health care system will mean all Americans have less control.\n\nWe know that more is coming, as the Intercept scooped some of these internal plans in November. But roping the public option into the single-payer discussion, which worked for Republicans in 2010, is a tougher task now — it makes no changes to private plans whatsoever and has become the universal compromise position of the Democratic Party.\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\nWho's your top choice among Democratic presidential candidates? (Marquette, 400+ registered Wisconsin voters)\n\nJoe Biden — 32%\n\nBernie Sanders — 23%\n\nElizabeth Warren — 15%\n\nBeto O'Rourke — 12%\n\nCory Booker — 8%\n\nKamala Harris — 8%\n\nAmy Klobuchar — 5%\n\nJulián Castro — 4%\n\nThe Wisconsin primary falls in the middle of the nominating process, usually boiling down to a do-or-die choice between two candidates. It's highly unlikely that the ballot, next year, will include every name on this list. What's interesting is how much room for growth there could be for lesser-known candidates. More than 90 percent of Democrats start with opinions of Biden and Sanders and 70 percent start with an opinion of Warren. A majority of Wisconsin Democrats have no opinion, right now, on the rest of that field.\n\nWho do you think is mostly responsible for the partial shutdown of the federal government? (Fox News, 1,008 registered voters)\n\nPresident Trump — 51%\n\nRepublicans in Congress — 3%\n\nDemocrats in Congress — 34%\n\nAll — 9%\n\nAnother day, another clear majority of voters putting shutdown blame on the president. There has been no shift in these numbers since the shutdown began; the president's only comment on shutdown polling has been to refer to a crosstab in one poll that suggested Latino voters were moving his way since last year. (This was probably a small sampling error.)\n\nON THE TRAIL\n\nHave you hugged a mayor today? It wasn't planned this way, but the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting came to Washington at a narratively ideal time: the point in the government shutdown when the city began to ask whether it would ever end.\n\nIf we ever shut down the government over a policy dispute, we'd be run out of town on a rail, said South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nAmerica right now is crying out for leadership, leadership I know exists in this room, said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in a Thursday speech. It's time to demand that Washington follow our lead, instead of the other way around.\n\nGarcetti, who has not declared anything about 2020 but has made several trips to primary states, came to the meeting with a story to tell. A six-day teachers' strike ended with a 6 percent raise and a commitment to shrinking class sizes, most of what the unions had wanted.\n\nI have a good relationship with the school district and the union knows me and trusts me, so it seemed clear that I could do things other people weren't able to do, Garcetti told the New York Times.\n\nThe mayoral pitch, which we're going to hear more and more this year, has an advantage over a pitch from any other sort of Democrat: It is a story of endless building, compromises and success. Most mayors who've taken office since 2010 have presided over economic growth; the controversies that can dog them, starting with accusations that gentrification and big businesses are benefiting the most from the economy, are overwhelmed by stories about how well these mayors know their communities.\n\nI'm running because of Los Angeles — if I run, Garcetti said at a Thursday news conference. I'm running because I can accelerate [the work we're doing] on homelessness. I'm running because I can accelerate the work we're doing on the environment. It would be a positive thing for my city.\n\nButtigieg and Garcetti are two of four mayors who are either in the race, seriously considering it, or confusing people by not ruling it out. The latter two, Mike Bloomberg and Bill de Blasio, are political rivals with an incredibly similar pitch: If you doubt that the country can work again, come to New York.\n\nWe balance our budgets, we save for a rainy day, and then we get handed this shutdown! de Blasio said.\n\nFrom the back of the room, something was hard not to notice: When members of the Trump administration arrived to speak to a bipartisan group of mayors, they did not mention the shutdown. And they got very little applause.\n\nAt the conference, every mayoral pitch overlapped: Mayors were into negotiation, not brinkmanship. Another common thread: No one can ever again say that a job less weighty than governor or senator was too little experience for the presidency.\n\nNo Queens-born developer had just been elected straight from TV, as a reality star, and then one was, Garcetti said.\n\n2020\n\nLarry Hogan. He has welcomed, for the first time, chatter about potentially running for president; he told reporters today that both the president and the speaker of the House were to blame for the shutdown and its theatrics. Let's figure out border security, and let's get people to work, and let's let the State of the Union take place like it always does, he said. Worth noting: That's largely the Democratic plan, not the Republican one.\n\nMichael Bennet. The senator from Colorado isn't discussed much as a presidential candidate, but he has been poking around, and Thursday he had the first semi-viral moment of his career, raging from the Senate floor at Sen. Ted Cruz over the Texan's role in the 2013 shutdown.\n\nMike Bloomberg. He'll talk to Virginia Democrats on Friday morning, then spend next Tuesday crisscrossing New Hampshire.\n\nTerry McAuliffe. The former Virginia governor set a March 31 date for an announcement on his 2020 plans, whether he runs or not.\n\nSherrod Brown. He's filling in his dignity of work tour schedule now, with a Jan. 30 kickoff in Cleveland followed by a substantial trip around Iowa, and a Feb. 8 visit to New Hampshire.\n\nElizabeth Warren. As first reported by The Post's Jeff Stein, she will unveil a plan with a new tax on Americans with more than $50 million in assets.\n\nREADING LIST\n\nTraumatized by 2016, only slightly healed by 2018, Democratic primary voters are still not sure what to think about electability, except to worry about it.\n\nThe unfinished business of Bernie Sanders, by Jason Zengerle\n\nA look inside the senator's head as he has considered whether to run for president or not, a question that he approaches differently (though not too differently) whenever it is asked.\n\nThe incredible thing about the movement in the Democratic Party's left flank is how few people are pushing it and how young they are.\n\nCOUNTDOWN
The 300th homicide has become a grim yet familiar milestone in Baltimore. For more than a decade, such a death toll was unheard of. Then the city surpassed 300 killings in 2015, and every year thereafter.\n\nAD\n\nSome city leaders dismiss any significance to the 300th mark, saying it's a callous and arbitrary measure. No man is merely a number and the city is no safer with 299 murders than 300. Yet the count draws attention, thrusting Baltimore onto Internet rankings of violent cities. The number weighs on the minds of City Hall leaders and on the streets. A criminologist who came to town in 2015 said Baltimore seems consumed by its homicide count.\n\nAD\n\nAll this meant Richardson knew the 300th murder would bring a flood of attention; she got ready. But when the phone call came, everything went to pieces.\n\nShe met Bernard Richardson in 1999 while a student at Morgan State University. He was five years older than she and training to become an electrician. They had come to a group study for the Five-Percent Nation, a social movement centered on Islam that stresses family, history and Black pride.\n\nAD\n\nWe had very strong feelings about the city and what we can do to help, Zy Richardson said.\n\nShe grew up in Pittsburgh; he came from the Parkside neighborhood of Northeast Baltimore. Bernard Richardson attended Patterson High School. In 1993, when the football team made the playoffs, he started at wide receiver.\n\nAs members of the Five-\n\nPercent Nation, they chose new names. Zy meant beautiful Black woman. He settled on Shallah for God. He was a serious and intentional man. When he spoke, everyone listened. They dated for seven years, married in 2007 and raised two children. The Richardsons taught their son and daughter to take pride in themselves and their Black community. They named them King and Queen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShallah was an amateur sketch artist who practiced tai chi. His bookshelves were full of Black history and economic empowerment, health and nutrition, graphic design and color palettes. He would read the 5th-century Chinese military treatise The Art of War and Marvel comics.\n\nIn 2002, he and a high school pal started a peewee football program. They never figured their little football program would become the biggest, most successful in Baltimore. Or that they would instill a sense of self-worth in so many city boys during trips to Florida to play in — and win! — the peewee national championships. To players, he was simply Coach Shallah.\n\nAs a 10-year-old quarterback, Jihad Muhammad faced the pressures of leading the winning Parkside Warriors on the field. One day in practice, it became too much. Crying, he walked off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShallah went after him. They sat under a big tree. The boy told his coach how it felt that his dad wasn't in the house. For an hour, they talked about everything except football. Next practice, Jihad was back. He won the MVP trophy that year.\n\nHe felt extra responsibility to help young men through football develop positive life lessons, Zy Richardson said.\n\nShallah wasn't some fiery coach. Rather, he would pull a boy aside to make a point. After practice, he would remind players to eat well, and do their homework and their pushups.\n\nThen he would drive to watch a rival team and record the game. He would spend hours studying the video to uncover the tendencies of 10-year-old running backs. Other coaches called him the brains behind the Warriors.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2009, the boys traveled to Florida and beat a team from Staten Island, to win their first national championship. Some of the boys had never before left Baltimore. Florida surprised them: Warm weather in December? They returned to their city as national champions.\n\nAD\n\nAll they ever see is Baltimore City, and everything that comes with being in Baltimore City, from the poverty to the abandoned buildings, said Dennis Harding, who co-founded the program with Richardson. They're kind of in a box. They don't want to step outside. . . . We had to do a lot of psychological and emotional prepping.\n\nThe Warriors returned to the national championships for four consecutive years. They didn't have money to fly to the annual game in Florida, so the coaches rented vans. The night before, the team slept at Shallah's house so no boy could be late.\n\nAD\n\nZy Richardson laughs at the memory of the 10-year-olds bundled in sleeping bags everywhere, her house full of boys.\n\nIt was very much like the Super Bowl for them, she said.\n\nShe also understood this was about more than football for Shallah.\n\nAD\n\nHe felt extra responsibility to help young men through football develop positive life lessons, she said.\n\nThe football program became so popular that within a decade the Parkside Warriors were fielding 18 teams — each with its own coaches — for ages 6 to 14. Peewee football consumed Shallah's life. In 2014, he quit.\n\nHe stopped to dedicate and put more time into his family, said Harding, the co-founder.\n\nThen Zy and Shallah divorced after eight years of marriage.\n\nAD\n\nWe were better apart as co-parents, she said.\n\nThey both attended the graduations and recitals of the children. They kept close. In August, he remarried and rode off with his new bride in a horse-drawn carriage.\n\nThree months later on a November morning, his new wife was frantically calling Zy. Shallah had been attacked.\n\nHe had walked outside his home in Northwest Baltimore when a man ran up and stabbed him in the chest, police wrote in charging documents. Wounded, he made it back inside to tell his wife who had attacked him, the officers wrote.\n\nAD\n\nHis wife told police that she had a son with the man and that he had spoken badly about Shallah. Police arrested Karl Anderson and charged him with murder. He's being held without bail awaiting trial. His attorney declined to comment.\n\nAD\n\nShallah, 44, died at the hospital, becoming the city's 300th homicide.\n\nZy's cellphone buzzed with a barrage of news stories. Now, she was seeing his death discussed across Facebook and Twitter and the Instagram page Murder Ink. She felt angry.\n\nShallah was a gentle man; he didn't deserve a brutal death. She wanted to scream: How can a man like this die in this way?\n\nI felt this heavy burden to explain Shallah, she said.\n\nHarding watched the news in anguish.\n\nIt was all [about] the 300th murder, he said. That's not the way we want to remember him.\n\nOn the night before he died, Shallah called his son and they talked for an hour.\n\nAD\n\nHe had plans to get back into coaching, said King Richardson, a freshman at Morehouse College in Atlanta. I was just happy for him. The hard stuff was over.\n\nAt least 28 people have been killed in Baltimore in the month since Shallah's death. The homicide count ticks up day after day. Zy's cellphone buzzes with news of each murder.\n\nIn her loss, she sees the number differently. The count doesn't minimize the violence, but expands it.\n\nZy sees the depth of her children's pain. More than 300 families share such anguish.\n\nShe's stunned to realize the ocean of grief across the city.
It is therefore no surprise Hollywood had to remake it.\n\nAD\n\nThe real surprise, however, is that Downhill, starring Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (who also has a producer credit), is respectful enough of the source material to avoid cheap laughs and maintain the original tone of acerbic honesty. It isn't great. It's a watered-down version of the original, but it's still pretty good: neither wise nor profound, yet sometimes smart and with sharp elbows — especially if you have nothing with which to compare it.\n\nFerrell and Louis-Dreyfus play Pete and Billie Stanton, a married couple who are vacationing in the Austrian Alps. With their two sons, they're staying in a fancy ski village, billed as the Ibiza of the Alps and geared toward party-hearty adults, not parents of rambunctious tween boys. As it happens, there's a more appropriate family-friendly resort a mere 20 minutes away. This unfortunate booking by Pete — who throws money around like he's trying to impress people, or buy their affection, including blowing $2,000 on an abortive day of something called helicopter skiing — turns out to be only the first of a handful of bad decisions on his part.\n\nAD\n\nDuring lunch one day on the outdoor terrace of a chalet-style restaurant, a controlled avalanche is set off by the resort's snow management staff, leading to a impulsive choice by Pete that he will instantly regret, and that will slowly, over the course of the film, start to eat away at the veneer of harmony and civility that the world sees when they look at the Stantons, revealing the weaknesses beneath.\n\nAD\n\nDownhill replicates many of the touches that made Force Majeure so powerful, alternating between long, static images of chilly snowscapes with more intimate scenes of heated psychodrama, and ratcheting up that tension with occasional, gunshot-like explosions in the distance that accompany the release of pressure on the slopes by avalanche management equipment. If there's one thing that fans of the first film will miss, it's the cavernous architecture of the original film's hotel interior, which served to further isolate and emphasize the smallness of the central characters.\n\nIn their roles, Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus resist a natural temptation to mug for the camera, wisely choosing restraint over release. Their characters aren't quite as poignant as the couple in Force Majeure, but these two comedians give the drama a go, ultimately finding an equilibrium between jokes — and frankly, there aren't many of them — and the film's sometimes unsettling emphasis on the more hard-to-swallow comedy of awkwardness.\n\nDownhill is, at heart, a story about two wildly different interpretations of the same event: one from the stereotypically female perspective of a nurturing mama bear; and the other from the somewhat more caricatured point of view of the fragile, egotistic male — nicely embodied by the fleshy, feckless Ferrell. For fans of the actor's serious roles (Everything Must Go being a prime example), it's a treat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJust don't expect Anchorman's Ron Burgundy.\n\nAt times, the screenplay (co-written by Jesse Armstrong and directors Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) is overly obvious, hammering home the theme of marital discord. Amid all the squabbling, there are references to tackling the Beast — the nickname for the resort's hardest slope. And Billie makes a crack at one point about going to Switzerland, which comes across, in context, as a reference to seeking neutral ground. Even the film's title, Downhill, makes literal the state of something in decline.\n\nIn one painfully uncomfortable scene, Billie trots out the Stantons' two sons (Julian Grey and Ammon Jacob Ford) so that the kids can corroborate, in front of the couple's guests (Zach Woods and Zoe Chao), Billie's version of events. She sends the boys to their hotel room to watch TV with the line: Thanks, guys. You can go back to your funny movie.\n\nFor us, there is no such option. Downhill has a few yuks, but for the most part, it cuts the comedy, substituting that icky feeling that comes from being trapped on a train, plane or bus, trying not to eavesdrop on the couple in the next row. They aren't exactly arguing, but rather stewing in simmering silence.

Dear Carolyn: I married an aimless man. He is six years my junior and I love him more than anything in life; he is, in many ways, the man of my dreams. We married in the summer of 2015, so we're still figuring things out and I'm hoping this is just a bump.\n\nI work full time in a field that I love and am successful in, and I am also the primary breadwinner and money manager in our household. We have no kids, so our money goes to bills, living and fun, which is a nice place to be.\n\nMy husband, however, is in his mid-30s and is still struggling to find something he enjoys, is fulfilled by and that helps contribute to our home. He went through IT training and landed a job but came to hate it and quit about six months in (for good reason). He now works an hourly job part time that he knows isn't enough.\n\nHowever, each new career or interest gets the same amount of excitement (knife-sharpening, leather work, IT, Web development), then his attention fizzles after a while and it's on to the next thing, and repeat.\n\nIt's frustrating to always worry about what would happen if I suddenly couldn't work or cover us with my company's insurance, and hard always being the realistic heavy. He doesn't seem to share my worries. He had a traumatic childhood, and it's my understanding that this can create a certain amount of failure to launch in adulthood. I encourage him to seek therapy to help work through it, but so far he hasn't shown interest.\n\nI don't know how to help him find his path or help him understand that in order for us to eventually live our dream of travel and a beach life, we have to put in a lot of work first. He thinks of me as an occasional dream-crusher when I bring him back down to Earth, and I don't want to be that, but there has to be a contribution to our home that is worthwhile and consistent to get us where we want to eventually be.\n\nBreadwinner\n\nBreadwinner: Does there, though?\n\nMeaning, are you sure he shares your ambitions? I could be wrong, but I see a gap between the life you say we want and the one he intends to live.\n\nTake travel and a beach life, for example: Maybe you envision retiring to it in comfort, and he'd be fine tending bar for tourists. If he just nodded agreeably to the dreams of the person he loves, then he wouldn't be the first.\n\nAnd that isn't the only potential difference worth scrutinizing. The proper roles in your marriage are worth a look, too (or healthiest roles, most functional, most realistic: discuss). You seem to operate on the expectation that you'd both have career-oriented jobs and both share the financial weight. But plenty of marriages involve — on purpose or out of necessity — one spouse as primary breadwinner and one in a different role, anything from homemaker to freelancer to volunteer to primary caregiver for children.\n\nDid you discuss this before marriage, or did you both act on a set of assumptions? If you discussed it, has he changed his mind since then? If he hasn't changed his mind, have circumstances changed enough to warrant a mutual rethinking of roles anyway?\n\nYou could also take a closer look at what's going on with him. Maybe he's traumatized, as you say (in which case an appointment for you with a good therapist could be eye-opening). Or maybe there's undiagnosed ADHD at work in his serial career enthusiasms; it's certainly one of the signs. Or maybe what you're witnessing is the passive aggression of someone who doesn't want to stick with a career path (or anyone's expectations thereof) and also doesn't want the consequences of admitting this out loud.\n\nSo before you get into the issue of a spouse who is underemployed, I urge you to look into the various components that are, to my eye at least, underexamined: who you married, what you both want, what will actually work.\n\nThis is not to say you have to sign on enthusiastically to whatever you find. That your beloved-above-all-else blames you for your dream-crusher skepticism, for example — instead of blaming his own inconsistency — says you'll be getting plenty of chances to draw firm and compassionate lines.\n\nBut you do need to accept what you find regardless — and proceed accordingly in whatever direction you choose from there — instead of continuing to hold out for a version of him that keeps doggedly not coming true. Such holdouts are prime conditions for stress and embitterment. At a minimum, I urge you to start living like a sole breadwinner and sock much of that money away.
The R&B singer's artist page has been removed from RCA's website. According to Variety's report, the singer's catalogue remains with the label. Representatives for Sony Music and RCA declined to comment.\n\nThe split with Sony comes after a Lifetime docuseries chronicled years of sexual misconduct allegations against Kelly; Surviving R. Kelly became one of the network's highest-rated programs in two years and dominated conversation on social media for days. Prosecutors in Chicago made a public plea following the series for victims or witnesses to come forward.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKelly faces the most significant professional repercussions of his career. He's increasingly become a pariah among other artists, with Lady Gaga, Chance the Rapper and Phoenix recently apologizing for working with the singer. Several musicians are reportedly looking to remove collaborations with Kelly from streaming services.\n\nAfter decades of abuse allegations R. Kelly's accusers ask if his music will finally stop. (Whitney Leaming, Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)\n\nOn Wednesday, a protest led by social justice organizations Ultraviolet and Color of Change took place outside Sony's New York headquarters, with demonstrators holding signs with messages such as RCA Drop Kelly! and Black Girls Matter.\n\nThis victory belongs to the survivors of his abuse — their brave testimonies played a critical role in pushing RCA to drop R. Kelly, Arisha Hatch, a managing director at Color of Change, said in a statement Friday.\n\nAD\n\nKelly's split with RCA is huge for the African American community and for African American women across the nation because their voices were finally heard, said Tony Gray, a Chicago-based, longtime urban contemporary radio consultant. For those radio stations that are still playing his music, I think they're going to have to take a harder look at whether to continue to play his music, based on the decision by the label to separate themselves.\n\nAD\n\nKelly, who through his attorneys could not be reached for comment Friday, has long denied the allegations against him. An attorney representing the singer has previously described the docuseries as another round of stories used to fill reality TV time.\n\nParting with Sony marks a shift in the musician's career. Kelly, who signed onto the now-defunct Jive Records in the 1990s, was a reliable hitmaker for the label. (RCA absorbed Jive artists in 2011.) He produced massive hits, from the raunchy Bump n' Grind in 1994 to the Grammy-winning I Believe I Can Fly in 1996, a fixture of graduation ceremonies and church services. He also has writing credits on songs by massive stars such as Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson.\n\nFor years, the industry turned a blind eye to Kelly's alleged behavior. The Post's Geoff Edgers reported in May that this disregard played out on many levels, from the billionaire record executive who first signed the dynamic young vocalist in the early 1990s to the low-paid assistants who arranged flights, food and bathroom breaks for his traveling entourage of young women.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEdgers reported that the culture of open secrets and official avoidance set root around the onset of Kelly's relationship with his protege Aaliyah, whom he married when she was 15 and he was 27. The marriage crumbled days later when Aaliyah informed her parents, who got it expunged.\n\nIn 2000, the R&B star was dogged by claims that he had sex with underage girls in Chicago, first reported on by the Chicago Sun-Times. Jim DeRogatis, then a music critic at the outlet, was later anonymously sent a sex tape that he turned in to authorities. Kelly was charged with child pornography, and six years later, the case went to trial. More than a dozen witnesses identified the person in the video as an underage girl, but neither she nor her parents testified. Kelly was acquitted on all counts in 2008.\n\nKelly's trial became a media sensation. In the midst of it all, he achieved some of the biggest hits of his career, including Ignition (Remix) off his 2003 album, Chocolate Factory. In 2005, he began releasing the 33-part Trapped in the Closet, which instantly became a music phenomenon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA broader cultural shift has occurred in recent years as the conversation about sexual misconduct by men in positions of power has become more pervasive, from renewed attention on claims against Bill Cosby (he was convicted of sexual assault in 2018) to bombshell accusations of sexual harassment against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.\n\nIn 2017, DeRogatis reported for BuzzFeed on parents' claims that Kelly brainwashed their daughters and was keeping them in an abusive cult — allegations that once again drew attention to the singer's behavior. (One of the women, in a remote interview with TMZ, said she was with Kelly willingly.)\n\nKelly was actively touring at the time of the BuzzFeed report but canceled several concert dates after its publication. His last album with RCA, 12 Nights of Christmas, came out in October 2016, though he released a 19-minute track on SoundCloud in July, addressing many of the allegations against him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing the BuzzFeed report, activists launched the #MuteRKelly movement, a grass-roots campaign calling for boycotts of his music.\n\nOn Friday, #MuteRKelly co-founder Oronike Odeleye said in a statement that the campaign was grateful to Sony and RCA for finally doing the right thing but will continue to fight to remove his music from radio, streaming services and concert venues.\n\nWe will not stop until the community at large has completely divested itself from R Kelly, and he can no longer use his wealth to insulate himself from the consequences of his crimes, she said.\n\nThis post has been updated.
Dear Amy: My brother and his wife are expecting a third child.\n\nMy sister-in-law is pushing to have the baby use her last name because her side of the family doesn't have any boys to carry on the name.\n\nThis has caused a huge rift in our family. My older parents are heartbroken.\n\nI would like to know, is it an accepted social practice to have different last names within the same family? Would not having the same last name as siblings cause any negative emotional impact to this third child?\n\nWhat would be a compromise in this situation? I am thinking of suggesting a hyphenated name (her last name, his last name). What do you think?\n\nThank you for your wise advice.\n\nConcerned Sister\n\nConcerned Sister: My first piece of advice is for all of you to remember that this baby has two parents who are making decisions regarding their children. This is their issue (not yours), and the best thing you could do is to urge your brother and his wife to deal with your parents.\n\nYou could influence your parents by encouraging them to accept this family's choice with equanimity.\n\nMany families sport various last names within the family unit. (In my family of five daughters, there are four surnames.) Rarely, families choose to divide the spouses' surnames between children; and this can cause paperwork hassles and some issues when traveling as a family, but you should assume that your brother and his wife are anticipating this.\n\nHyphenating one child's name when the other children don't have a hyphenated last name seems more cumbersome than giving the child the mother's surname — nor would it cut down on the questions or explanations as the child moves through life.\n\nChildren can adjust to this quite easily: Two of us have our dad's last name and our baby sister has mom's last name, is all the explanation they need to give.\n\nDear Amy: My husband and I are having marital problems. He's abusive, controlling and has cheated on me at least five times. He takes any money I get and doesn't cook or help with our daughter. He is an alcoholic.\n\nI want things to work out, but he doesn't make any effort. I love him so much. I don't want to lose him. He is the love of my life. I've been with him since I was 17, and I'm going to be 21 at the end of the month.\n\nI don't know whether to try to save my marriage, because he hasn't changed. He keeps saying he will, but doesn't. I'm a stay-at-home mom. I don't know what I'd do without him. He doesn't want to go to marriage counseling because he says it doesn't work.\n\nI'd be devastated if we fell apart. He isn't only my husband but my best friend and my other half, all wrapped up in one. I don't think he understands that.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\nSad Wife\n\nSad Wife: It is a shame that you love your husband more than you seem to love yourself, or value your daughter's future. Because raising a child in a household with abuse, drinking and cheating will teach her that this is okay. If she thinks that this is okay, then she might choose this for herself, some day. I hope you want a better life for her.\n\nYou describe your husband as your best friend. But is this how friends treat one another? No.\n\nYou are young. You are still maturing into your own adulthood. The journey toward your own healthier future will start with you learning how to love and value your own life. I hope you have people in your corner who will help you to see your strengths.\n\nYou should assume that your husband will not change. You are capable of change, however, and you need to. Change starts with one step, and counseling (for yourself) could help you to take that first step.\n\nDear Amy: Waiting described her relationship of 10 years. She said she was 28 and her boyfriend, 26. You said, You have been in this relationship for almost half your life. Why didn't you point out that this duration was almost half of HIS life?\n\nDo the math, lady.\n\nUninspired\n\nUninspired: He didn't write to me. She did. But I also realize that I didn't describe the math correctly (nor did you). I should have referred to this as almost a third of her life.
Here's a rundown of the scenes from Season 2 that made us cry the hardest, in chronological order:\n\nHere are just a few of the most tearful moments from the second season of This Is Us. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)\n\nA Father's Advice (Season 2, Episode 1)\n\nPresent-day Rebecca (Mandy Moore) 'fessed up to Randall (Sterling K. Brown) that Jack immediately knew Randall was theirs after the loss of one of their triplets. She wasn't so sure.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSometimes in marriage, someone has to be the one who pushes to make the big moves. Oftentimes in our marriage, yes, it was your father. Our marriage wasn't perfect, it's true. But none are. Your father wasn't perfect either, but he was pretty damn close. As close as they come. He pushed a stranger on me, and that stranger became my child, and that child became my life. He became you.\n\nThe 20s (Season 2, Episode 6)\n\nThe Big 3 are in their big 20s, and Randall is Randalling-out at the prospect of becoming a dad. So, naturally, he lays out all his anxieties on the hardware store salesperson. As one does.\n\nBabies come with the answers. They come out, they look up at you. They tell you who you are, the salesperson says. Tomorrow, you'll have all the answers you need.\n\nThe Most Disappointed Man (Season 2, Episode 7)\n\nThe whole dual judge story line got me good. And while the letter Rebecca wrote about never giving up on her family was emotional, young William's (Jermel Nakia) courtroom speech about being the most disappointed man and turning to drugs after losing everything in life — his mother, his love, his son — ravaged my heart, and the ball kept rolling when his judge made William promise to stay clean, and to picture the judge's old, wrinkly white face anytime William was tempted.\n\nNumber One (Season 2, Episode 8)\n\nKevin (Justin Hartley) finally breaks down, and it breaks us in the process. His front lawn meltdown and literal cry for help (I just need somebody to help me) reveals why losing his necklace in a rush to get more painkillers is such a wake-up call.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat necklace is the only thing I have left in my life from my dad, he cries out. It's the only thing I have.\n\nThen he adds: Can't you see I'm in pain? Yes, yes we can.\n\nNumber Two (Season 2, Episode 9)\n\nThis entire episode was brutal for the tear ducts. I mean, it's about Kate's miscarriage, so there was no way around it.\n\nWhen Toby (Chris Sullivan) tells Kate (Chrissy Metz) the miscarriage happened to him, too? Or how about when Rebecca shows up on Kate's doorstep, and her daughter falls into her arms? We were a bit of a mess after this hour of network TV.\n\nNumber Three (Season 2, Episode 10)\n\nGod bless Sterling K. Brown's single-tear-rolling-down-the-cheek move, which he employed to great effect while playing Randall saying goodbye to Deja.\n\nAlso, William alert! And bonus, it's young and old William (Ron Cephas Jones. Every time this man comes on the screen, I get ready to weep). The heartbreaking montage showing what could have been if William had knocked on the Pearson family door — Randall's biological father being present for the big stuff — ruined me.\n\nThe Fifth Wheel (Season 2, Episode 11)\n\nOooh, the answer to the juiciest question of all: Mom, which of us do you love most? For Rebecca, her confession that Randall was just easier to love than Kevin got us good.\n\nThat'll Be the Day (Season 2, Episode 13)\n\nWe were a bit on edge this entire episode, because we get the sense this is the last day on earth for Jack (Milo Ventimiglia). But the whole bit about him secretly recording teenage Kate singing? Oof. She gets mad when she catches him, telling him no one else sees her as he does. But after watching the tape and seeing the beaming pride on her dad's face, she tells him to never stop looking at her that way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat, and he says Katie girl and that wrecks us each time.\n\nSuper Bowl Sunday (Season 2, Episode 14)\n\nThis is the big one, folks. The moment when Rebecca finds out Jack has died. Hope you called in sick from work after this one.\n\nTwo other scenes that stand out in this gut-wrenching episode: Rebecca telling Miguel he needs to stay strong or take a walk because she has to go ruin her kids' lives (telling them Jack died), and adult Kevin's heart-to-heart with Jack by Jack's tree.\n\nThe Car (Season 2, Episode 15)\n\nI may be in the minority here, but the aftermath of Jack's death ruined me way more than the moment itself. This entire episode was chock full of tears: the funeral, seeing the teenage Pearsons fight and cry, Rebecca being all out of sorts. Shall I invest in Kleenex stock?\n\nAD\n\nBut let's highlight two moments: The visit between Dr. K (Gerald McRaney) and Rebecca at Jack's funeral gave us more insight into Jack's fears over fatherhood and allowed us to revisit the lemon analogy (which, wow, has lasted decades for the Pearsons. Man, that's some bit!).\n\nThe second big tear-jerker came when Rebecca took her kids to Jack's favorite tree (and we got the sweet backstory on that one). She tells her boys their jobs are to be teenagers, not men of the house, and that no matter what Kate thinks, Jack's death wasn't her fault. Rebecca will spend her entire life trying to make her see that.\n\nThis Big, Amazing, Beautiful Life (Season 2, Episode 17)\n\nThis look into Deja's life was much needed and beautifully done. So by the time we get to the end when Deja tells Randall, I'm really tired, it carries enough weight to make us break down.\n\nThe Wedding (Season 2 episode 18)\n\nOld Jack was sweet to see and may have caused a few drops to fall for you. But one of the biggest gut-punches came when Rebecca and Kate have a heart-to-heart just before the wedding ceremony.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMom, you're not in my way, Kate reassures. You are my way.\n\nAs if that wasn't intense enough, we immediately cut to the wedding ceremony itself. We don't get to hear the vows (and honestly, thank you). Instead, we get a flashback voice-over from Jack — That's gonna be one lucky guy, the guy who gets to marry you, Katie girl — and his promise to walk her down the aisle.
A thick-shouldered pragmatist who had no use for ideologues, Mr. Miller led the campaign to legalize casino gambling in Maryland and, despite his centrist views, facilitated the passage of progressive laws including legalization of same-sex marriage and the repeal of the death penalty.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNearly two years after he announced his cancer diagnosis, Mr. Miller's passing unleashed a wave of grief in Annapolis and further sealed a complete leadership transformation at the State House he presided over for 33 years. Because of his illness, Mr. Miller relinquished the Senate presidency in October 2019 but retained his seat as a rank-and-file member until Dec. 23, when he resigned.\n\nA shrewd tactician, Mr. Miller controlled the Senate under six governors and endured as opponents derided him as an autocrat, as demographics in his home base of Prince George's County shifted, and as Maryland's political culture drifted left.\n\nMike Miller was the cornerstone for all the progress that has occurred in the state over the past three decades, said Timothy F. Maloney, a prominent trial lawyer and former Democratic state delegate representing Prince George's. There has been no major initiative that has occurred without Mike's leadership. He saw everything from a historical context and tried to get ahead of history to see where things were going.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA backslapping raconteur, Mr. Miller was a singular presence as he ruled the Senate. His mane of white hair and chiseled features invited reminders of the Founding Fathers, at least in appearance — comparisons that Mr. Miller rarely discouraged.\n\nMr. Miller sometimes got himself into trouble for his freewheeling banter. In 1989, as he was emerging as a statewide political force, he used a profanity to describe Baltimore, a blunder that quashed whatever hope had to run for governor.\n\nAs the Senate's leader, Mr. Miller was unafraid to lacerate rivals, accusing Gov. William Donald Schaefer (D) of hiring eunuchs and sycophants and comparing Parris N. Glendening (D), then Prince George's County executive, to a baboon. In the heat of one election season, he promised Democrats would bury Republicans six feet deep, faces up.\n\nMr. Miller clung to his grudges as if they were prized treasures. Those who crossed the boss, as one colleague described betraying Mr. Miller, could find their legislative proposals — and their political careers — extinguished. After then-Del. Patricia H. Billings (D-Montgomery) opposed legislation he supported, Mr. Miller sent her a Christmas card. I haven't forgotten your vote, he wrote.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWorking for Mike was like working in the Mafia — you go out feet first, said Gerard Evans, a lobbyist and longtime friend. You're either in the organization or — if you p----d him off — you were dead politically and functionally.\n\nMr. Miller could offer foes a second chance, but only if it served a larger political purpose. If he needed you, he brought you back, said former state senator Gloria G. Lawlah (D-Prince George's), who mended fences with Mr. Miller after a falling-out. He was the master of power and control.\n\nMr. Miller waved off suggestions he commanded the Senate with a heavy hand, saying he sought to delegate power and promote fellow senators.\n\nAD\n\nGrudges? Not him, he insisted.\n\nI forgive and forget, he said during an interview for this obituary. Honestly and truly.\n\nAsked who, if anyone, intimidated him over the years in Annapolis, Mr. Miller, without hesitation, said, I was never afraid of anyone.\n\nPrince George's Democratic Party boss\n\nThomas Vincent Mike Miller Jr. was born Dec. 3, 1942, in Clinton, Md., where his grandfather founded B.K. Miller's, a general store that Mr. Miller's father eventually took over. At the intersection of Old Branch Avenue and Woodyard Road, the store was a center of Prince George's life, a few yards from the church where the Miller family attended services and down the street from the modest brick building where Mr. Miller eventually opened a law office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs the oldest of 10 children, Mr. Miller navigated family squabbles — often instigated by his volatile father — and developed skills that helped him later maneuver in Annapolis. From boyhood through early adulthood, Mr. Miller worked at his family's store and learned lessons that would stay with him as a politician.\n\nYou were taught the customer was always right. And so when I ran, I treated my constituents like they were my customers, Mr. Miller said in the interview. It gave me huge exposure to people, their issues and their problems.\n\nHis parents' politics spanned the Democratic spectrum, with his father a conservative and his mother a New Dealer who encouraged her son to go to law school. She was determined that I was not going to work in the store, he once told The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nHe got his introduction to politics in 1962 as a driver for Frank Small Jr., a Republican gubernatorial candidate who lived next door to the Millers. Mr. Miller befriended Small's press consultant, Lawrence J. Hogan Sr., who would become a U.S. congressman and Prince George's County executive. Hogan's son, Larry, for whom Mr. Miller babysat, became Maryland governor during the last years of Mr. Miller's reign in Annapolis.\n\nAD\n\nHe had more political contacts at 18 years old than I've ever had any time I've been alive, Thomas Farrington, who worked alongside Mr. Miller in the Young Democrats in the 1970s, once told The Washington Post.\n\nMr. Miller graduated from the University of Maryland in 1964 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and a law degree in 1967. In 1965, he married Patricia Given, a college classmate. In addition to his wife, survivors include five children — Melissa Miller of Chesapeake Beach, Michelle Miller Fink and Melanie Miller, both of Annapolis, Tommy Miller Jr. of West River, Md., and Amanda Miller Stokely of Sunderland, Md. — as well as three brothers, five sisters and 15 grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1970, with the backing of the Prince George's Democratic machine, Mr. Miller won his first political race, capturing a House of Delegates seat. Four years later, he was elected to the state Senate as a conservative Democrat.\n\nAD\n\nAs an intern in Mr. Miller's office in 1977, Evans learned that his boss could be unreasonably demanding. At Mr. Miller's urging, Evans suggested legislative ideas, including a bill allowing victims of domestic abuse to seek compensation.\n\nDon't ever suggest another bill! Mr. Miller yelled, according to Evans. Mr. Miller, he said, was afraid of seeming too liberal in a conservative district. It was nothing more basic than getting reelected, Evans said. His core was delivering as a retail politician.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Miller's early years in the state legislature and his reign as a boss of the Prince George's Democratic organization coincided with the county's transition from majority White to majority Black. Mr. Miller adapted by forging alliances with a number of rising Black leaders.\n\nNonetheless, some African Americans chafed at what they regarded as Mr. Miller's dictatorial control over local politics. He appears to be with you, former state senator Tommie Broadwater Jr. (D-Prince George's) once told The Post. If you don't know him, you'll think he's the best of buddies. But he will stab you in the back.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Miller, when asked about Broadwater's description, replied: That's not a bad analysis.\n\nIn Annapolis, Mr. Miller's influence was growing. Melvin Steinberg, then the Senate's leader, described Mr. Miller as his enforcer and appointed him chairman of the powerful Judiciary Committee.\n\nBlair Lee IV, then Montgomery County's chief lobbyist, learned the consequence of opposing legislation Mr. Miller supported one day as he walked along a State House corridor. All of a sudden I saw this curly-haired guy coming around the corner. He sees me and puts both hands on my lapels and backed me against the wall, Lee once told The Post. He has got an Irish temper and an Irish humor, but you never know which one he'll be in at that minute.\n\nIn 1986, as Schaefer became governor, the state's 47 senators elected Mr. Miller Steinberg's successor. At 44, Mr. Miller assumed the Senate's throne, fueling chatter that he was on a glide path to becoming governor. Three years later, Mr. Miller hosted a swanky fundraiser in Baltimore, an event that many regarded as his statewide coming-out party.\n\nAD\n\nA few hours before the fundraiser, Mr. Miller agreed to an interview with a local television reporter, who asked why he was hosting the affair far from his legislative district. It helps educate my constituents as to why Baltimore needs the economic help, Mr. Miller said. I mean Baltimore is a goddamn ghetto. It's worse than inner-city Washington, D.C. It is shit.\n\nI hope you're not going to play this on tape, Mr. Miller said, laughing nervously before adding that Baltimore is a war zone. I mean, it's crack. I mean, it's these dime bags of PCP. . . . Fifty percent of the kids that start out in school don't graduate. So looking at things from a statewide perspective, we really have to do things to help.\n\nThe station aired Mr. Miller's comments, causing a furor that dogged him for decades. Mr. Miller cited the incident as his sole political regret.\n\nBut Mr. Miller also said he did not regret that the incident may have ended his statewide potential. As it turned out, he served another three decades as Senate president, his influence uninterrupted at the State House while moving trucks pulled up to the governor's mansion across the way every four or eight years.\n\nDealmaker and consensus-builder\n\nOf all the governors who presided during his reign, Mr. Miller said his favorite was Marvin Mandel (D) because he knew how to build support for legislation and would reward you for working with him. The worst governor, he said, was Schaefer, because he didn't understand governance. He wanted to spend money that we didn't have to spend. He thought he could print money in the basement of the State House.\n\nBy his own account, Mr. Miller's crowning achievement was the legalization of casino gambling and the subsequent launch of gaming in Prince George's, despite fierce opposition from church leaders and civic groups. In a show of political gamesmanship, Mr. Miller forced two special sessions of the Assembly, after which the fate of what became the MGM Casino at National Harbor was left to voters to decide in a 2012 referendum. It passed by 100,000 votes.\n\nEverybody wants to take credit for MGM, Lawlah said. It was Mike Miller's baby. He never took his eye off of it.\n\nMr. Miller survived various threats to his power, including a failed attempt to oust him in 2000 led by state Sen. Thomas L. Bromwell (D-Baltimore). Two years later, the legislature's ethics panel rebuked Mr. Miller for yelling at two appeals court judges about a pending dispute over redistricting maps. He also faced scrutiny from federal prosecutors investigating contributions to a campaign fund he oversaw. No charges were filed.\n\nMr. Miller often attributed his political endurance to his ability to see what's going to happen before it happens. Despite his own reservations, he facilitated the abolition of the death penalty in Maryland in 2013 after polls showed the public supported the ban. Even as he voted no, he allowed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage to move forward in 2012, a shift he attributed not only to political pragmatism but to his friendships with people who were gay.\n\nHe didn't live in a world where he would substitute his core beliefs for what he saw as the larger consensus, said Todd Eberly, a St. Mary's College of Maryland political scientist. He's a good representative of what it used to be like when two sides were able to compromise.\n\nFor all his adaptability, Mr. Miller was stubborn when it came to history. In 2017, he was widely criticized for opposing the removal from the state capitol grounds of a statue of Roger Taney, the Maryland-born Supreme Court chief justice who supported the 1857 Dred Scott decision that Blacks in free or slave states could not be citizens.\n\nMr. Miller, who regarded himself as the curator of State House history, hung portraits on his office walls of past Maryland governors, including segregationists. He also had a rendering of the trial of Mary Surratt, a Clinton native and a co-conspirator in President Abraham Lincoln's assassination.\n\nSomebody could walk into my office and say, 'Why is that picture on your wall?'  Mr. Miller said in the interview for this obituary. Because of my love of history, I'm not politically correct. But, you know, they were products of their times. They're products of history.\n\nAs 2019 began, Mr. Miller divulged that he had cancer but kept showing up in Annapolis, eager to demonstrate his vigor even as he was undergoing chemotherapy. I'm in the game, I'm on top of it, I'm right there, he told reporters one afternoon before unleashing a string of invectives, as if to prove his point.\n\nEver the pragmatist, he had reached out months before to four newly elected senators, progressives who had defeated his more moderate lieutenants in the 2018 Democratic primary. He understood that his style of politics — dealmaking and consensus-building — had become an antiquated art form in an era dominated by President Trump and extreme rhetoric.\n\nAs much as anything, he yearned for a return to the political center.\n\nIt's really time for me to get out of politics, he said in the interview. Our democracy is the oldest in the history of the world, but it's on very shaky legs. I see the Democrats going further to the left, and the Republicans going further to the right, until something absolutely horrible happens and people realize they've made a terrible mistake.\n\nWhatever happens, Mr. Miller said, it would no longer be his problem.\n\nHis time, he said, had come and gone.
But Sam and Shifra, who are 30 and 28, respectively, and both freelance art directors and filmmakers, had never before done long-distance the way they had to in 2020: stranded on different continents, each thousands of miles from where they met and fell in love, with virtually all travel across the globe halted indefinitely.\n\nThere were definitely some days that were super tough, especially because we just didn't have any timeline, Shifra said in a Zoom interview from Amsterdam.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat was the hard part. If you know it's going to be six months, you can mentally prepare, Sam chimed in from beside her on their couch.\n\nResearchers suspect that long-distance relationships are more common nowadays than they were 20 years ago, as remote communication is cheaper and more efficient. But even with the help of texts, emails, FaceTimes and Skype calls, long-distance relationships like Sam and Shifra's faced a new obstacle in 2020: Pandemic-related travel restrictions around the world wiped out months' worth of plans and decimated morale.\n\nSome couples saw relations deteriorate and eventually break down under the strain. Others simply canceled reservations, postponed plans and did their best to cope with the disappointment. Sam and Shifra, though, found that the time apart made them more certain than ever that it was time to commit to each other — and to being in the same place — forever.\n\nIt started simply enough, at a bar in Manhattan's Alphabet City. Sam and Shifra exchanged what they think was probably Snapchat handles (it was, after all, 2015). She invited him to a work event. He invited her to a Super Bowl party. Shifra, who is from India, was living in the United States on a student visa, and by the time it expired a year later, they were inseparable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeparate they did, though: Shifra returned to her family's home in Bangalore while she applied to American graduate schools, and Sam packed up his New York apartment and moved west for a job in Los Angeles. In the summer of 2016, Sam was visiting Shifra's family when she received her acceptance letter from Virginia Commonwealth University, and they spent the next two years visiting each other on opposite coasts.\n\nAfter graduating in 2018, Shifra moved into her own place in Sam's neighborhood. But their brief, blissfully convenient year as a short-distance couple came to an end on June 4, 2019. Shifra got an email saying her company could no longer support her work in the United States. Her H-1B visa application to stay in the country was being rejected.\n\nDevastated, Shifra spent that afternoon dodging Sam's phone calls. I thought this would break us, Shifra remembered. I thought I would have to go back to India, so I [was] like, 'I'm not going to ask him to, like, move to India.' \n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShifra called her father, though; then her father called her sister, and her sister called Sam. Sam kept on dialing Shifra's number, and when she finally picked up, through tears, she told him she didn't know what the news meant for their future.\n\nSam didn't miss a beat. He was like, 'I'll just move with you,'  Shifra said. Like, without a hesitation. Sixty days later, the two had given away or sold most of what they owned. They moved to Singapore, where Shifra transferred into one of her employer's overseas offices.\n\nAt the time, people asked us, 'You've already been together for so long. Why don't you just get married to stay in the U.S.?'  Shifra remembered. But it felt like a cop-out. That would have been a decision based out of fear of leaving versus, like, a decision out of love for each other.\n\nIn early 2020, after finding Singapore was not quite their style, Sam and Shifra decided to try another city they had been eyeing: Amsterdam. They made what they thought would be a quick stop in Bangalore before their planned arrivals in Amsterdam: He would arrive in March. She would follow in April.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSam landed in Amsterdam on March 12. Within days, as embassies were shuttered and travel restrictions went into effect worldwide, it became clear Sam would be in the Netherlands by himself indefinitely.\n\nSam and Shifra spent the next five-and-a-half months video-chatting constantly, sometimes watching movies together. Back when they were taking turns visiting each other in California and Virginia, Sam said, We would try to cram all of our relationship into those four days every month. But this time, they made an effort to spend time together virtually while apart.\n\nWe did creative projects together, Shifra said.\n\nWe painted together, Sam added.\n\nAD\n\nStill, living apart had its lonesome moments. Sam knew no one in the Netherlands. Time differences led to desolate, empty hours. When they reunited, they decided, they would propose to each other.\n\nGoing through all this put it into perspective for us: 'I don't want to lose you. I want to stay together, no matter what,'  Shifra said. I've never felt more sure about it.\n\nOn a rainy Thursday in late October, two months after Shifra finally arrived in Amsterdam, Sam sent her on a scavenger hunt. It ended with Shifra dancing next to a canal in a homemade tube-man costume and Sam riding up on a boat in a matching get-up, an homage to their first couple Halloween costume. Then he gave her a diamond that had belonged to his family for more than a century.\n\nShifra proposed back a few days later, giving Sam a custom bolo tie and a card game she had designed. Titled Monogamy: Seal the Deal, it was based on Monopoly Deal, a game they play often. Properties included several of their past addresses; instead of a Go to Jail card, Shifra's said Go to the Airport.\n\nSam and Shifra aren't the only ones whose engagement was sparked in part by the pandemic. But for them, marriage means something more than just being partners forever.\n\nWhen he asked me to marry him, he was like, 'When we first met, we were living in boroughs that were 10 miles apart. Then we moved to different cities that were 3,000 miles apart. Then we moved to different countries that were 9,000 miles apart. Then we were in the same city, just one mile apart. Then, again, we were in different countries,'  Shifra recited by heart.  'Now, finally, we are under the same roof.'  From here on out, Sam and Shifra have agreed, they'll spend no more than the length of the average business trip away from each other. For them, marriage will mean never living under different roofs again.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more:
Maybe Huger's etiquette lessons are finally proving effective.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe really are just a fun group, Dixon said. We also have our little share of drama, but nothing too serious.\n\nEvery group has its touch of clique-iness, though. It was apparent in the first season that Dixon and Bryant are among the closer gals in the group. We balance each other out; she's a little bit more of a fire cracker, Dixon said of Bryant. We can just sit in a room all day and crack jokes and have fun.\n\nAnd while Darby said she thinks she is the most like Samuels out of everyone in the group, the newcomer seems more smitten with someone else.\n\nThat's my girl, that's my sister, Samuels said of Jackson-Jordan. We get along the most. We talk every day, whether we're filming or not.\n\nAD\n\nAnd while the women seemed to have worked through any beef with one another, the hubbies, past and present, might be another story.\n\nAD\n\nTrailers show that all may not be well in paradise for Darby and her Australian beau. Although he attended the premiere event, Michael Darby was more removed than Karen Huger's husband, Raymond Huger, and Samuels's other half, former Redskin Chris Samuels, who posed for photos and accompanied their ladies during interviews.
That meeting has taken place, Kraft said here Monday, since the Patriots' season ended with their Super Bowl defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWe've had the meeting, Kraft said, speaking to a group of reporters at the annual league meeting. And just to be clear … we have meetings all the time. We're not a big, bureaucratic organization. We're a private company. We don't have boards we answer to. We answer to the fans the best we can.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe met. And I meet individually with each of them. But the thing that I don't know if it's completely understood, but Bill and Tom communicate and meet a lot and spend a lot of time communicating. I think the residual of this loss was really hard on everyone. But I sort of see that as a high-class problem because I sat in the stands when we never were in the playoffs at home for 20-odd years.\n\nThe union of Kraft, Belichick and Brady has produced five Super Bowl titles and, now, three Super Bowl defeats. There was speculation that last season could be the end of the trio's time together in New England. But it appears that all three will remain in place at least through the 2018 season.\n\nI think about tension, I think about my first year as an owner, Kraft said Monday. And I love Bill Parcells. But if you knew him as a coach, the players walked on eggshells. And maybe ownership did, as we went down the learning curve of how to get along. There was a great lesson for me to learn and train and try to understand how to be a good owner and at the same time how to work with a very strong and powerful coach.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe so-called tension gets greater when you lose. We were 10-6 our first year. The second year, at 5-11, we really had tension. … In any successful business, in a marriage, if you have a good relationship, there's gonna be things where you disagree. But hopefully you come together and you have a meeting of the minds and you discuss things. If everyone's all on the same page, usually things don't go as well.\n\nKraft also expressed support for Belichick, who has drawn some rare — for him — criticism of a coaching strategy for his decision to bench cornerback Malcolm Butler in the Super Bowl. Butler has since left the Patriots in free agency to sign with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nWith my fan hat on, you can come up with all kinds of reasons or things, Kraft said. But here's the deal: We in New England are privileged to, I believe, have the greatest coach in the history of coaching. … I have faith in Bill as a coach that I don't think there's anyone who has the football knowledge and expertise combined with understanding personnel, no one can merge those two worlds [better]. And he's done pretty well for us over the last 18 years. So, as a fan, I can question some of the moves. As someone who's privileged to be the owner of this team, I encourage him to keep going with his instincts and doing what he thinks is right.\n\nAD\n\nAD
I was preparing to co-chair the National Prayer Breakfast, an event with thousands of participants from around the world and from many faiths, where presidents from Kennedy and Nixon to Obama and George W. Bush had all spoken, and where the new president, Donald Trump was scheduled to speak. I was nervous about how the event might go and wrestled with my role.\n\nAD\n\nMy mind, though, was elsewhere, thinking about my parents, and the examples they had shown me of faith in action. My dad was in hospice with pancreatic cancer, facing his final days. I planned to visit him once the Prayer Breakfast was over, but despite his doctors' reassurance he would be with us for weeks more, as the sun rose, I wondered whether I should be with him instead.\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump had already brought controversy to the event. He had recently announced a so-called Muslim travel ban, offending many participants and impacting some attendees. Several longtime organizers of the breakfast urged me to speak immediately following the president and to help sustain the tradition of an uplifting, bipartisan and nonsectarian breakfast. I was on the agenda, and unsure of what Trump might say and how I would respond, whether to publicly rebut or even rebuke his actions, but after a sleepless night of reflection and prayer, I hoped I was ready for whatever might come.\n\nScripture warns us about those kinds of moments of uncertainty; Matthew 25:13 urges us to stay awake because you know neither the day nor the hour.\n\nAD\n\n* * *\n\nI thought about my dad, who knew something about being awake and ready in his faith and being unexpectedly called to serve God.\n\nAD\n\nHe was ready — and awake — when the pastor at our home church, Red Clay Creek Presbyterian, challenged our congregation to make real the call of Matthew 25:36: I was in prison and you visited me. My dad surprised himself by volunteering for regular visits with incarcerated men in the state prison. He had a lot on his plate with three young boys at home and a growing small business to run, but he rose to the moment.\n\nHe was ready when he noticed, on his first visit to the prison, a withdrawn man in the corner not interacting with anyone else, and he asked to be paired with him. Paul Byrne was a convicted murderer serving a life sentence. Paul was estranged from his family, and improbably, he and my dad developed a real friendship. Eventually, my dad invited him to our home during furlough weekends, and Paul joined our family, regularly fishing or hiking with my brothers and me, joining us at church, in our chores and in our meals.\n\nAD\n\nPaul had been coming to our home for about a year when our family situation changed dramatically. My dad's business was struggling, he was getting ready to move away for a new job, and the rest of us were staying behind. My parents' marriage was ending, and my mom was determined to find a home for my two brothers and me that she could afford alone. We went through our belongings — furniture, clothing, toys, and more — to sell at a Saturday garage sale. Paul helped, too; his main job was to keep the till as it filled with cash over the course of the day.\n\nAD\n\nOn Sunday, our whole family went to church together, including Paul, who knew this would be his last furlough weekend with us, maybe his last ever. After church, Paul took one last hike in the woods behind the house.\n\nWhen it was time, Dad sent me to get Paul for the drive back to the state prison near Smyrna, and I walked alone through the woods, calling Paul's name repeatedly. After a few minutes, I realized Paul had fled. I ran back to the house to tell my dad. Stunned, he rushed to the room where Paul stayed and found all the garage sale earnings still in the cigar box where Paul had deposited them. Paul, though, was gone.\n\nAD\n\nPaul walked and hitchhiked all the way to West Virginia before he was picked up and returned to prison. Years later, I visited him and asked why he had left behind the money from the yard sale. My dad and my family, Paul told me, were the only people who had ever shown him any kindness. He couldn't bear to do anything that might get us in trouble.\n\nAD\n\n* * *\n\nI shared that story of Paul at a weekly Senate Prayer Breakfast in 2011, soon after I was sworn in as a senator. A conservative senator came up to me afterward and said: I want you to forgive me, because when you ran for office, I heard terrible things about you, and I believed them. I even prayed for you to lose. Having heard you here, I know better now, and I hope we can work together.\n\nAD\n\nThat senator wasn't expecting to connect with me that morning, but he had come to that prayer breakfast awake and ready for God's grace, and it came to him when he least expected it. Over many years, I've experienced the same thing, and so have many of my other colleagues from both sides of the aisle.\n\nIt was those hopeful weekly experiences that led me in 2016 to accept the invitation to co-chair the National Prayer Breakfast the following February. This would be much different from the Senate Prayer Breakfast, though. It would involve thousands of guests and millions more watching on TV, all in the wake of the bitter 2016 election. I prayed that the same spirit of fellowship and openness I'd experienced at the Senate breakfast would somehow transcend the ugly and divided mood of our national politics.\n\nAD\n\n* * *\n\nFamilies separated by the ban hope a legislative solution proposed by Sen. Chris Coons and Rep. Judy Chu could prevent other American families from suffering. (The Washington Post)\n\nAs I drove to the hotel where the National Prayer Breakfast was being held, I thought about our simple but profound calling to live out our faith at all times, in all places.\n\nAD\n\nI'd been reminded of that just two days earlier, when I had been with the newly inaugurated president under very different circumstances, at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware for the dignified transfer ceremony of Chief Petty Officer William Ryan Owens, a Navy SEAL who'd just been killed in Yemen. Officer Owens was the first U.S. service member killed since Trump had been sworn in. As we stood together and prayed over the flag-draped coffin bearing Officer Owens's remains, and as we tried to comfort his grieving family, I could see the impact on the president. I wondered if it was then that he felt the weight of the office — and the consequences of his words and actions — on his shoulders. One of those recent actions was to block refugees from coming to our country, and I saw firsthand the devastating consequence of that ignorant decision. My mother, who decades earlier had taken on the Gospel's challenge to welcome the stranger by helping to resettle a refugee family from South Vietnam in our community, had recently read in our local newspaper that Delaware had not welcomed a single Syrian refugee.\n\nAD\n\nSo once again, she got involved, and by early 2017, she had coordinated with our church, Red Clay Creek Presbyterian, Jewish Family Services of Delaware and a prominent local mosque, Masjid Ibrahim, to bring a young Syrian family from a refugee camp to Delaware. Both parents were from a part of Damascus that had been hit by chemical weapons attacks from the Assad regime; they had met and married in a refugee camp and had a young daughter. Trump's new travel ban, though, meant the family couldn't come to the United States.\n\nOver the next two days, I wrestled over what I should say at the event following Trump's remarks. I debated challenging him publicly for the Muslim travel ban, but the night before the event, Max, a trusted friend and Howard Divinity School graduate, reminded me of Jesus' calling in Matthew 5:44 to pray for our enemies. He challenged me to believe in the power of prayer, to preserve this event's focus on prayer and to confront Trump separately. I wrestled with his advice all night, but around midnight, I decided he was right. I would have plenty of chances to speak out against the president's ban, but I had only one opportunity to help preserve an important national event focused on prayer.\n\nAD\n\nAt the breakfast the next morning, I privately expressed to the president my intense disagreement with the Muslim travel ban and said I would work to oppose it, but I also made a simple request: would he allow me to call him up to the lectern, place my hand on his shoulder and pray for him? Reluctantly, he agreed.\n\nPresident Trump attacked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Romney (R-Utah) Feb. 6 for justifying their impeachment actions on religious grounds. (The Washington Post)\n\nI've been asked many times since then why I made that decision, and the answer is that I've seen the amazing power of prayer and God's grace, even in the most challenging circumstances. If my parents could be brave enough to live their faith by welcoming foreigners and criminals with nowhere to go, and if my own political opponents could be humble enough to join me in prayer, shouldn't I be willing to do the same?\n\nAD\n\nNervous, I approached the microphone. I spoke for a few minutes and described how my father welcomed Paul into our home. Then I said, If my father's faith could give him the courage to do that, then the least I can do is show my confidence in the power of prayer. Despite my strong personal and political disagreements with Trump, I asked him to step forward. I closed my eyes, placed my hand on his shoulder, bowed my head and prayed aloud: Heavenly Father, we ask that you would give our president your wisdom, that you would open our hearts and his heart, that you would give us a heart for all your children. A heart of humility and grace. Amen.\n\nAD\n\nMy father died later that night, before I could see him one last time the next morning. I still had much to tell him, to learn from him and to thank him for. More than anything, I wanted to thank him for showing me what courage means and to always carry my faith — regardless of the difficulty of the situation — because we know neither the day nor the hour when we will need it most.\n\n* * *\n\nAD\n\nToday, three years later, some have questioned whether I made the right decision to pray for, and with, our president that day. My prayers that he might have a change of heart have not yet been answered, and I've spoken out regularly against his policies and positions. I've also continued fighting his travel ban, and I've written legislation to repeal it.\n\nI haven't stopped praying for him, though, and I haven't stopped praying with and for my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, even as our country has become more divided. In the most difficult moments, I've been reminded of a quote attributed to President Abraham Lincoln: I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.\n\nThroughout the past week, my commitment to prayer has been tested as much as any other time in recent memory. I've fought bitterly with my Republican colleagues over the rules of the impeachment trial, I've watched close friends within my own party battle fiercely with each other for our party's presidential nomination, and Wednesday, the Senate was once again sharply split as we cast our final votes on whether the president should be removed from office.\n\nAmid all of that, praying for my Republican colleagues and Trump has been particularly difficult, but I've been reminded that that's the point. After all, Jesus didn't simply call us to treat one another with kindness; He called us to do bold, difficult and challenging things. He challenged us to follow his example of spending time with outcasts and the seemingly unforgivable, from lepers to tax collectors, and He warned us that those things would invite criticism and rejection.\n\nI know that many Americans see Trump as a two-dimensional villain, a person beyond reaching or saving, and I know that publicly praying for him — as I will once again at this year's prayer breakfast — will invite criticism of me. Like anyone else, I don't enjoy that or seek that out, but I believe that the most important expressions of faith are the most difficult ones.\n\nI also believe that prayer is about having the humility to know we are all sinners and all fall short of what God would hope for us. Prayer is about restoring our faith in the future and that righteousness will prevail. Prayer is as much about having hope that we will be forgiven as it is about forgiving others. Prayer for me is about witnessing to the possibility of repentance and reconciliation, even across the hardest and most bitter divides.
Why Janet Reno Fascinates, Confounds and Even Terrifies America? By Liza Mundy\n\nWashington Post Staff Writer\n\nSunday, January 25, 1998; Page W06 And here, ladies and gentlemen, is the attorney general of the United States. Or rather, here is one image of her. She is a man. More startling, she is a man dressed in women's clothing – boudoir gear consisting of nightie and dressing gown, lacy and long, but not long enough to reach all the way to the floor and cover her lanky shins or her large slippered feet. In this installment of the running Saturday Night Live skits featuring Janet Reno as the central character, the attorney general, played by actor Will Ferrell, is lounging tummy-down on a frilly bed, watching a video of President Clinton as he hits up Chinese coffee-drinkers for cash. Yuck! she says, appalled. She is hulking and at the same time girlish, peering at the TV set through those trademark large-lensed glasses that make her eyes look obscure and remote, like tiny fish swimming in a fishbowl. On the bed is a pan of Jiffy Pop and a stuffed tiger named Simba. When the fund-raising video ends, the president himself appears, clambering through Reno's bedroom window. As played by actor Darrell Hammond, this Clinton is ingratiating, simpering, expansive, shorter than she is. He drops to his knees, tells Reno he loves her, begs her not to appoint an independent counsel to investigate his campaign fund-raising. Stunned, she yanks him off the ground and kisses him roughly, after which the fantasy dissolves and Janet Reno, attorney general, is shown to be making out with Simba the tiger. She is – has this been mentioned already? – a man. Also, she is tall. That's one thing. It may be the main thing, the thing that explains so much else. This is what Janet Reno would tell you. They do this sort of thing because she is so tall. She's tall, says former labor secretary Robert Reich, who is not, when asked what single thing strikes him about Janet Reno. The few times we did events together, I was reminded of just how tall she is. Well, yes, that's one point you can safely make about the attorney general. She is, without question, tall – 6 foot 1 – hence perhaps one popular image that has emerged of her, big and fearless, clomping through the corridors of Justice. What Reno's sister, Maggy Hurchalla, sniffingly calls the image of a large person with boots on. But that's just one of many images the culture has yielded during Reno's five-year tenure. One of the longest-serving attorneys general in modern history and arguably the most powerful appointed woman in American politics (given the inherent stature of her Cabinet post and her long-running investigative authority over the president), Reno has been in the public eye more often, or at least more dramatically, than anyone else in Clinton's Cabinet. She is doubtless the best-known attorney general since Robert F. Kennedy; citizens who couldn't pick William Barr out of a police line-up approach her in airports to confide some personal outrage. But even now – or maybe especially now, with the spin and finger-pointing that followed her decision not to appoint the independent counsel to investigate Clinton and Vice President Gore – the images of Janet Reno are dizzyingly multifarious. In today's political climate, with the parties battling for any incremental advantage, it's probably not surprising that the Democrats are spinning her one way and the Republicans another – that she's been portrayed, alternately and with equal conviction, as a flinty individualist and a pandering White House loyalist: A paragon of public virtue is how Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) put it, not long after Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, had gone on record saying how sad it was to see Janet Reno shredding her last remaining bit of credibility. And given her earlier career as state attorney in Dade County, Fla., and her current position as head, and figurehead, of the Justice Department – which is to say, the main Justice facility, the U.S. attorney operations, the Bureau of Prisons, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Marshals Service – it's probably also not surprising that she has attracted the ravings of a subterranean lunatic fringe. The fringe includes Internet fulminators upset by her Miami campaign against deadbeat dads or by Waco or simply by federal law enforcement in general. Among other things, the fulminators regularly fabricate bogus press releases (some of which have found their way into newspapers and provoked letters of inquiry from congressional offices) attempting to persuade the nation that Reno favors parental licensing, or that she believes that a cultist is one who has a strong belief in the Bible. But at a certain point, the images of Janet Reno these days cross over the predictable borders of political partisanship and even the ordinary borders of American heartland paranoia, and slip into someplace else entirely – the realm of intense cultural anxiety about women in power. There is something about her, rocklike and unbleached, that simultaneously fascinates and confounds and even terrifies the popular imagination: How exactly do you make sense of such a tall woman, such a strong woman, such a quiet woman, such a shy woman? How do you find a way to portray the complexities of an introvert who is constantly in the public eye, a lawyer who loves to work, a nerd, a physically rugged outdoorswoman who loves to kayak and hike, an aging woman, a woman who can sit through daylong congressional hearings with hardly a break? Why, you portray her as a man, or as a slut, or as a lesbian, or, better yet, as some strange and awful combination of the three! The Saturday Night Live skits may be good-natured, laughable, but they go out to an estimated 9 million viewers. And they are consistent with a pattern in which Reno, more even than other women in the Clinton administration, has been incessantly sexualized: In the SNL skits, on late-night TV, in jokes, in rumors, at Washington dinner parties, on at least one recent videotape in which small-time right-wing politicians declaim pompously against her, a videotape anonymously shipped to The Washington Post and labeled Janet Reno – Evil Lesbian. The culture gropes for an archetype, a way to understand her, some means of comparison. After the Waco disaster and her Truman-like assumption of responsibility, Spy magazine superimposed Reno's head over the pumped-up pectorals of Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator. More recently, the Weekly World News tabloid superimposed her head over the body of a fleshy model wearing a swimsuit and platform shoes (Janet Reno . . . as you've NEVER seen her before! promised the headline to the story, which purported to show how men in Japan salivate over Reno), while Jay Leno took the opposite approach, superimposing her head on the body of Xena: Warrior Princess, a TV heroine who is also a lesbian icon. The culture, in short, is confused. Is she Ma Kettle, hillbilly dominatrix? Is she Nurse Ratched, humorless and repressed? Is she Jimmy Stewart, Gregory Peck, Joan of Arc? She's hit from all sides. She's a man, she's a woman, she's a man-woman, she's straight, she's gay – but amazingly often, she's depicted sexually. Or at least with extreme attention to her personal appearance. On the World Wide Web, a search of Reno's name yields close to 34,000 entries, including not only news accounts and Justice Department press releases but also one Web site in which her haircut is superimposed over the visages of Demi Moore, Courtney Love, Jenny McCarthy and – yes – a man, Andy Richter. Another Web site, titled The Many Mellow Moods of Janet Reno, is frankly and rudely sexual, referring to a sensuous beast that lurks within the Attorney General's wacky two-piece cotton blend suits, and offering a number of stock newspaper photos accompanied by lurid captions. In contrast, a search of Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen – the only Cabinet member whose name appears on the Web more often than hers – yields entries like Secretary of Defense Earth Day Message and Slide Image: Defense Reform Initiative. Hence the paradox of Janet Reno. The woman famous for saying, I don't do spin, has been spun over and over again. Reno herself takes a benign view of all this. I think people just like to have fun, is what she says of the jokes, the tabloid photos, the Internet sites. There are those close to her who agree. Some people have stereotypical reactions to women in positions of leadership, says Maggy Hurchalla, and on the other hand you have curiosity, not even unkind curiosity, from people because they like her. But there are also those close to her who see something else going on. Among them is Reno's former deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who says that she doesn't normally like to look at things in terms of gender but who thinks that, in the case of Reno, it's hard to ignore. You can't look at the `Saturday Night Live' skits or listen to the comments made about her when she first came to Washington by Washington society, says Gorelick, and not think that if she were a man, her personal traits – like not particularly caring about fashion – would be considered okay. Then again, maybe people say these things because she's, you know, tall. It's because of her height; I don't read anything into it, says Carl Stern, former Justice Department public affairs director, who has consented to watch a videotape of the SNL Simba skit as a way of talking about Reno's public image – something that was, in a sense, his responsibility until he left the department in 1996. They have an ensemble cast, he says, pooh-poohing the fact that Reno is played by a man. Whoever fits the description, so be it. In this, Stern is adopting the line that Reno herself takes. Throughout her career the first female attorney general has downplayed gender, unlike, say, Supreme Court justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Sandra Day O'Connor, both of whom are from roughly the same generation as Reno, both of whom have made sex discrimination a crucial part of their public story lines. Even though (as she quietly said in her confirmation hearing) Reno, too, was denied a law job because of her gender, she has chosen not to go there, not to wave that particular flag. I don't think [gender] remotely occurs to her, says Anne Bingaman, former head of the antitrust division. Though Reno has advanced the cause of women at the Justice Department, in keeping with her stated intent to hire based on excellence and diversity, she has tended to surround herself with women who think of themselves more as individualists than as feminists, who prefer not to make an issue of gender, to keep their heads down and work. In her approach, she's also strikingly different from the other controversial woman in the Clinton administration, the other woman who has jokes and Web sites devoted to her hair and her sexuality, the other woman who has appeared on a tabloid cover in a bathing suit (and another time, holding a space alien baby): Hillary Clinton. In a sense, Hillary Clinton and Janet Reno both have been thrust into excruciatingly difficult roles for modern women to accommodate. Clinton in the highly symbolic, conventionally feminine role of first lady has one redoubtable host of expectations to cope with, and Reno, in the traditionally masculine role of top cop, has another. And both have coped in very different ways. Unlike Reno, Hillary Clinton came to Washington as a feminist networker, surrounded herself with women who made gender an issue first and foremost. Unlike Reno, she has at times attempted to parry the fulminators publicly. The response to her infamous 1992 campaign remark, I suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas, shows how risky it can be to answer the critics on their own terms. In a sense, Reno's head-down stance is consistent with her whole attitude toward publicity, which is to say: Go forward, do your work, don't make a lot of noise, don't spin. Whenever political appointees come to Washington, it's necessary to make a decision about how and whether to participate in the image-management industry. Madeleine Albright, for example, is one Cabinet member who pays close attention to how she looks and who she knows and how she's portrayed. In contrast, when Reno came to Justice she didn't even want a press office (in Miami, she fielded reporters' calls herself). When it became clear she had to have one, she chose Stern, a former law correspondent for NBC, to head it, with the idea that his natural inclination would be to distribute information rather than spin. According to Stern, she remains remarkably unconcerned about how people see her. When she cut down the medication she was taking for Parkinson's disease because it was interfering with her sleep, Stern says he quizzed her about the fact that this would make her tremor more pronounced. How would that look? How would it play out? Her reply, he says, was, So I'll be an old lady who shakes. But ironically, her lack of image management has in some ways made her a more inviting target for the leakers and the fulminators. As hard as she has tried to avoid the gender issue, it often simply proves impossible to avoid. She has encountered adversaries who attempt to discredit her through the crudest and easiest of means, by challenging her heterosexuality even as they offer absolutely no evidence – none – beyond her unmarried status. It's something that unmarried female politicians commonly run up against. In Virginia, when then-Attorney General Mary Sue Terry was running for governor, her opponent, George Allen, suggested his status as a family man was one reason why he was better qualified; in an earlier race an opponent had attempted to challenge Terry with a crude reference to her five ringless fingers. Similarly, an antagonist in Dade County, Jack Thompson, once approached Reno at a public forum, thrust a piece of paper in her direction, and demanded that she check a box saying whether she was heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual. Reno threw an arm around him, told him that she liked big, strong, handsome, kind, sensitive, intelligent men, and added, I understand why you might be confused. It was an adroit, sensitive parry of a label – dyke! – that many women are confronted with at some point or other, one that's so difficult to handle because, in responding, one runs the risk of protesting too much, or implying that there's something wrong with homosexuality. Moreover, it's a label that's impossible to disprove. Women, often, are polarizing, says political consultant Carter Eskew, something that will come as no surprise to working mothers, or to stay-at-home mothers, or to single mothers, or to unmarried women, or to women without children. Everybody has an opinion about the most personal choices a woman can make, and naturally these opinions get translated to the public arena. Reno thus remains an easy target despite her Olympian disregard of the rumormongers. In Washington, moreover, she also unnerves people because she is so introverted, such an inveterate non-schmoozer. During the week, she works. On weekends, she works, and, when she has a chance, hikes the C&O Canal or kayaks the Potomac – behavior that baffles the A-list crowd. Washington, particularly in the corridors of power, is a very normative environment, Jamie Gorelick says. So wonderful qualities that are endearing in another community are deemed unacceptable here. In short, even in Washington – in a city where married people are normal, where divorced people are normal, where people having affairs are normal – a single woman with a magnificent career and a host of abiding friendships and a set of rugged hobbies is suspected of being odd, of not having a life. Her lifestyle is not ordinary; it's not what most people do. This, in part, is the cultural assumption that the Saturday Night Live video taps into. Hence Janet Reno in her bedroom, wearing a nightie, alone with her fantasies. This is the main thing that Carl Stern notices about the video; this is what irritates him. What's grating, he says, is that the attorney general has not only a very normal sort of life but a nice life. Both in Florida and in Washington she has a great many friends whose homes she visits, and she goes to plays, her dance card is full. To portray her as a wallflower that nobody asks to dance is not only demeaning but inaccurate. She's a woman with a very active, full life – as I said, her dance card is full. For that reason, he says, I find it a little painful. I am interested,says John White, in the comment on the blue dress. White, professor of politics at Catholic University, is sitting in a room in the school's law library watching the same SNL tape. Outside, hundreds of would-be attorneys general, or simply would-be attorneys, are studying for pre-Christmas finals. Half of them are women. Which says a lot about how things have changed, how the law has changed, in this country, subsequent to Reno and Ginsburg and O'Connor's generation. In the initial wave of feminism, it seems the first thing women did, after burning their bras and declaring their freedom, was, in a rather contradictory gesture, to enroll in law school. None of this, White marvels, has changed the way women are depicted and seen – in Washington, or really anywhere. Does anyone, White asks rhetorically, talk about what Orrin Hatch wears? White has focused on a portion of the SNL skit where Reno gets a phone call from Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) and, in a Gidget-like moment, asks Conyers what he's going to wear to Congress the next day. A suit, he sighs. What are you going to wear to the Justice Department? My one blue dress, says Reno. It's a predictable joke, a jab at the much- remarked fact that Reno does seem to wear a blue dress every day, except for days when she wears a blue suit. For a male, such behavior would be less remarkable, expected. For Reno, the dress and the brush 'n' go short haircut receive more attention than probably any law enforcement initiative she's ever proposed. Like her unmarried status, they raise a red flag: People say, `Oh, bad glasses, bad hair, bad this, bad that,'  says consultant Neel Lattimore, former press secretary to Hillary Clinton. When was the last time Alan Greenspan got accused of wearing bad glasses? The point could be argued. Ours is, as John White notes, an age of celebrity, an age of TV, an age of visuals, an age of glare. Men do worry about their clothes, their hair, their wrinkles. Okay, says White, thinking. Proxmire, when he had his implants done in the '70s, those plugs put in, it was commented on. I'm trying to think of another example . . . Some male politicians make fun of themselves and the way they look. Mario Cuomo used to make fun of his own Italian appearance, Ted Kennedy of his weight – but in the early days, Kennedy's weight was seen as a barometer of whether he'd run for president. With men, he suggests, a change is related to political ambition; with women it would be striking but unrelated to ambition, a fashion statement. In other words, women in public positions are expected, far more than men, to be both competent and ornamental. And what's most different about Reno, White points out, is how the lampoons so quickly leave the realm of mere visuals and move into the sexual realm. I was trying to think of prominent male politicians who have been bachelors, and I thought of Sam Rayburn, who was married for weeks or maybe just days, and it was never discussed or commented on, White says. While single men may evoke some passing interest, and while it still may be difficult for a spouseless man to attain the presidency, unmarried men don't arouse nearly the suspicion that unmarried women do. Put it this way: There's no Web site devoted to The Many Mellow Moods of David Souter. Even so, it's tricky, figuring out to what extent Reno is treated the way she is because she's a woman. In important ways Reno has benefited from her gender: Gender is the reason I'm here, Reno says simply, acknowledging the fact that she was appointed in part because she's a woman. She's more recognizable and even, possibly, more interesting to some people because she's a woman. Yet the flip side is the over-scrutiny that goes with being the first woman anything – much less the first woman in the top cop role, a role that naturally attracts, for its first female occupant, over-expectation, a narrower path, a narrower tolerance for mistakes, says Laura Liswood, executive director of the Council of Women World Leaders, an association of current and former female presidents and prime ministers at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Feminist academics would say that it's also common for women in power to be sexualized the way Reno has been. That's the way you bring a strong woman down – you insult her, degrade her, portray her as sexually profligate, reduce her to her own anatomy. According to others, it's equally common for women to be de-genderized: It's a classic image, turning powerful women into powerful men, says Pippa Norris, associate director of research at Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, pointing out that the British satire Spitting Image portrayed Margaret Thatcher as Winston Churchill smoking a cigar. With Reno, what's notable is that both things happen. Some days she's Schwarzenegger; some days she's Xena; nobody can decide. In part, this may be a particularly American problem. Unlike countries with a tradition of queens or women occupying positions of feudal power, America has no cultural memory of powerful women. Look back into American history and whom do you come up with? Jane Addams? Betsy Ross? No one really seems to do, so the culture flounders for archetypes and keeps coming up with men. It was strictly based on the fact that she is – at least that she appears – physically big. And her demeanor appears to be kind of kick-ass. Six foot three, tanned, golden-haired, stubbled, wearing a jacket and khakis and not looking faintly like the attorney general, Saturday Night Live actor Will Ferrell is sitting in a borrowed office in the NBC building at Rockefeller Center. It's Monday, which means the cast and writers are starting to plan the upcoming show. Will there be a Reno skit? Ferrell doesn't know yet. Today they'll brainstorm with host Helen Hunt. Tomorrow they'll write. The rest of the week they'll rehearse and write, jettisoning stuff that doesn't work, even up to show time. This is Ferrell's third season with SNL. He started playing Reno about a year ago. The idea crossed his mind because he was interested in doing a part that's broad and physical. Then his girlfriend independently came up with the idea, and that solidified the notion. He liked the visual humor of a large woman manhandling people. I originally wanted to do this thing where she was almost like a bodyguard for President Clinton, Ferrell says, and they'd be in Cabinet meetings and she wouldn't say anything, and then if Clinton didn't like the person she'd be like, `Bill, do you want me to get rid of him?'  Instead, he and co-writer Scott Wainio came up with Janet Reno's dance party. In these segments, Reno is shown in trademark blue dress, partying in her basement, introducing guests mainly for the sake of humiliating them, quizzing teenagers and then telling them to shut up. We just kind of created this, like, tough woman who lives in this make-believe world, he says. Janet Reno as you've never seen her before! Their only aim was to be silly, Ferrell says, sitting in front of a monitor watching the Simba tape. This one is not a dance party skit, but the concept is the same: to emphasize her tough stiff awkward side – the only side of her that Americans are aware of, since the only time most of us see her is on TV, during high-profile confrontations – while making up this imaginary silly side. See! Ferrell says, as Reno's bedroom appears on the screen. Things like the fact that she's with the big Simba doll, and her bedroom's kind of frilly. Like, why would she have that? He watches as Reno clambers up on her bed. Between the glasses and the work of the wig department, Ferrell's is not a bad likeness. But the mannerisms aren't based on the woman, he says, just her broad outline. In this, Ferrell's Reno is very different from Darrell Hammond's Clinton, the only other running political character at the moment on SNL, which has produced some of the nation's memorable political impersonations, among them Dana Carvey's George Bush. Carvey was so Bush-like you could imagine him on the presidential succession list. Similarly, Hammond has studied Clinton so closely that he's developed a theory, in listening to him, that the president has had extensive dental work. Ferrell doesn't go in for details like that. I just sound the way she looks, he says, which is to say tough. When he dances, he patterns his jerky movements after those of a college chum. A male college chum. All he has to do, really, is be a tall tough woman with short hair, any tall tough woman with short hair, and voila, Janet Reno! Look over there, there's Gilligan's Island! On screen, Reno, using a pillow as an oar, rows herself and Simba on an imaginary raft to South America, where Clinton is on a state visit. Then she uses her window curtain to make a bridal veil for a fantasy marriage ceremony. Would they have focused on the attorney general's romantic life if the attorney general were a man? No, Ferrell says without hesitation. They'd only go after the sex angle if a man had done something to deserve it, if there was something there already, a Clinton thing, a JFK thing, a Gary Hart thing. But with Reno, the fun is that there's not an obvious sex thing. She's perceived as almost asexual in a way, so it's fun to do that she really dreams about . . .  Asexual? Well, I think, she just seems like a career-driven woman who is no-frills. On the screen, Clinton has now materialized in the attorney general's bedroom. I feel we're giving her the benefit of the doubt, Ferrell suggests, in that we've chosen to portray her as being repressed and dreaming about – men. Well, um, yes. Sure enough, in her screen fantasy, Reno is kissing the president. Ferrell is laughing. He's never seen the broadcast version before. But he does grant the point: If the attorney general were a man, would we be doing this sketch? Probably not. And let's say if a Madeleine Albright, a short little, quote `normal' woman was the attorney general, I don't know if we . . . It's weird. I hate to break it down into something as simple as the fact that she's tall, but it's almost as simple as that. She is, yes, tall. And she's 10 minutes late, which is uncharacteristic. One universally accepted truth about Janet Reno is that she starts meetings on time. This day, though, something has held her up. While she does not explain what that something was, she walks out of her office with hand extended, unapologetic but not at all arrogant, walking with a slight stoop that seems intended to de-emphasize the six-foot-oneness of her.  `Miss Reno' is fine, she says. Or maybe she said Ms. Reno. It's hard to tell. She talks softly, not tough, not Xena, not Terminator, not the person you imagine from the high-octane confrontations, sort of mumbling the comment into her shoulder as she walks head-down back to her office, having answered a question that's often put: what to call her. It's become a regular shtick between her and members of Congress, who persist in calling her General, perhaps because they still don't know, after five years, exactly what they should be calling her. Reno doesn't want to be called General. Her explanation is that originally the title referred to the attorney who did general work for the crown, general in the sense of general store. So I am an adjective, she likes to say, not a noun. The adjective settles into a love seat under a window in her office, and motions toward a chair nearby. In her low-key clothes and straightforward demeanor she comes across as what linguists would call unmarked. An unmarked expression is a neutral one, an expression that attracts no notice. To say Do you feel well? is neutral, unmarked; to say Do you feel bad? is unusual; it's marked. Similarly, an unmarked person is a person who blends in, who avoids standing out. It's easy for men to be unmarked – wear a dark suit, keep your hair trimmed – but more difficult for women. If you wear makeup and short shirts and high heels, that's one form of marking, but if you don't gussy yourself up, you're a marked woman, too, you're making a statement. Which may be why Reno's appearance attracts so much attention. Many women in politics go ahead and mark themselves – with bright red jackets, bright green suits, bright gold accessories. Reno takes the opposite approach: short haircut, staid predictable dress, no jewelry save for a watch and a pair of modest earrings, no makeup except a faint trace of lipstick, no rings or nail polish on her graceful white hands. The effect is to make her stand out like a pileated woodpecker. The harder she tries to get by without calling attention to her physical appearance, the more people wonder what she's doing. Some people think it makes her more authentic; others think it makes her look provincial; still others think it's a sexual signal. More likely, her demeanor is in many ways the legacy of her mother, Jane Wood Reno. Jane Reno, a newspaperwoman for the old Miami News, was a woman who lived large in the way that many American communities permit and Washington, mostly, doesn't: She loved the outdoors, she scuba-dived and went on days-long seaside hikes and swam naked, she built the Reno house with her own hands, she got stopped for drunk driving, she collected eccentric characters as family friends. She let the wind and the weather age her naturally; photos of her in later years show a woman, worn and wrinkled, full of character, full of interest. This last characteristic, this unadorned quality, this respect for one's natural face, seems to be a legacy that Reno has inherited. At the same time, she notes, Mother and I were different in so many ways. Her mother was, to use a Southern expression, a catbird; Reno isn't. Instead, what you see when you see her is the girl in high school who sits in the front row. The responsible one, as her sister says; the one who sat on her siblings when they misbehaved. The chemistry major, who, despite her mother's distaste for lawyers, applied to Harvard Law. The politician who says she dislikes publicity because I feel like I'm intruding on people . . . I've just not cared for it. Really, there's no easy way to describe a woman who is devoid of affect, who throws out a negative force field as she sits. It's brilliant. You can see how she rope-a-dopes Congress. She is not glib. She doesn't feel the need to help, conversationally. She deflates her own accomplishments at the same time as she's deflating conversation. She reveals that she buys her blue dresses from a catalogue – the attorney general, a catalogue shopper – but won't say which one. Wouldn't want publicity. As for the rustic, up-from-the-Everglades myth, she thought it was a hoot, she says, when in early profiles the press made this big deal about how her mother wrestled alligators; U.S. News & World Report even did an illustration of Janet Reno herself roping a gator. Wait a second. These alligators are a crucial part of the Reno story line. Is it not true that everyone in the Reno household knew how, if not to wrestle an alligator, to put one to sleep by turning it over on its back? Little alligators, she says, precise, lawyerly. Wouldn't want to self-aggrandize. As for all these other images of her, these multiple story lines, all these so-called portrayals – she is not convinced that they exist. I think I'm fairly transparent, she says. I think it's fairly obvious what I am. Maybe so. Maybe everybody has the same idea about Janet Reno that Janet Reno does. Maybe everybody sees this quiet, modest, determined person who loves the law and public service. What, then, about the jokes, what about all the images of her that the popular culture has produced? After much discussion among her aides before the interview, Reno declines to watch the SNL videotape. But she does agree to listen to a couple of the jokes told about her. To this one, from the Jay Leno show: The White House Christmas tree was cut down yesterday at a tree farm in North Carolina. Eighteen-and-a-half-foot fir. I guess the tree was driven to the White House, and then strapped to the back of Janet Reno, who carried it up. To this one, from Bill Maher's Politically Incorrect monologue: Janet Reno is really being called on the carpet. She and the FBI director are working together on this. She's saying it just seemed like a match when she went over to the FBI and all of J. Edgar Hoover's dresses fit perfectly. To this one, from David Letterman: I have to go down to the costume shop and pick up some more shoulder pads for my Janet Reno outfit. I think that people are having fun, she says, listening but not laughing. They're not particularly funny. But are they not interesting? Are they not telling? What about Jay Leno's remark that the independent counsel call was Janet Reno's toughest decision since boxers or briefs? What about these repeated attempts to make sense of a powerful woman by making her into a man or an ambiguous sort of woman/man? What about Saturday Night Live? I thought it was just kind of a spoof of this 6-foot-1 big old girl, she says mildly, then adds, in what is, for her, an outburst: I can't figure out why anybody's that interested in me. In her? Yeah. In her? Yeah, she says again.  'Cause I'm basically just myself. She's the attorney general! I know! she says. But I'm not any different from – I mean, if you asked my friends in Miami, I don't think they'd say I've changed. Which is not to say that she doesn't have some interest in how she's portrayed. She does in fact collect the cartoons about her, even, she reveals, the biting ones. The biting ones? Yes, she says. The biting cartoons. The biting cartoons? The real zingers, she explains, laughing now, seeing what the misunderstanding was. Given the context, it seemed plausible that there would be cartoons of Janet Reno . . . well . . . biting somebody. No, she says. There are none of those that she knows of. Nor, she says precisely, keeping the record straight, of me being bitten. Days later. Early morning. Time for the attorney general, the first female attorney general, the first 6-foot-1, blue-suited, shoulder-padded, catalogue-shopping, alligator-wrestling, Christmas-tree-hauling female attorney general, the attorney general who does not spin and does not bite, to go to New York City. Land of Saturday Night Live. Except that she's here for something else. Throughout her career, the attorney general who downplays gender has chosen to focus on one of the most basic women's issues: children. Being a woman may or may not have made it easier for her to flog the issue of juvenile justice, the problem of kids and crime. Whatever the case, she willingly does flog it. Part of the job of being a Cabinet member is traveling around the country in carefully orchestrated set pieces, giving speeches, talking to grass-roots groups, and she does this with energy and diligence. This day, she happens to be in New York, at an image factory, one of the world's most powerful: the advertising agency of Saatchi & Saatchi, whose first-floor lobby is, just now, thick with hair spray, perfume, dry-cleaning fluid, mousse, shoe polish, lip gloss, the collective effluvia of people who do not share Janet Reno's pared-down approach to personal presentation. Outside a velvet rope surrounding rows of chairs facing a makeshift stage, there are scores of employees of Saatchi & Saatchi, which has worked with the Justice Department's juvenile justice office to create a series of public service announcements designed to change the way people think about teens, to change the way teens think about themselves, to lure them into community organizing and away from crime. It's a smart campaign, funny, snappy, designed to show that while teenagers may sometimes seem threatening or grungy, that often has nothing to do with who they really are. Posters on the wall show photographs of teenagers who look like drifters and drug dealers but are in fact law enforcement activists. In the lobby is a 150-pound bell, made of confiscated handguns, that will be rung to launch the ad campaign. She'll be here on this side of the bell, the PR director is telling photographers, surrounded by a bunch of kids. He is talking about Reno, the main draw of the event. Also here is Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary, who will be singing an anti-crime version of his song Where Have All the Flowers Gone? titled Where Have All the Children Gone? Also here are a number of actual kids, members of Youth Force, an organization run by and for young people whose purpose is giving juveniles a voice in the justice system. One of its members, Lisa Figueroa, a short dark-haired girl with a pierced nose, introduces Reno with a moving speech in which she tells the Saatchi & Saatchi execs about how she grew up surrounded by drugs, how her father drank, how she started smoking pot, how under the influence she got pregnant, how she dropped out of school, how she has been straight for three years, how Janet Reno proved to me and all the teenage women in the country that I can do anything and being a woman won't hold me down . . . She has proven once again that women got it going on! The attorney general speaks, offering statistics to counter stereotypes (If you look at juveniles as a whole, it is only one-half of one percent that are arrested for any violent crime in a given year), and leaves, as she entered, to a standing ovation. An hour later, on the top floor of the Saatchi & Saatchi building, Lisa Figueroa is watching the SNL skit and seeing, with amazement, that in it the attorney general of the United States is played by a man wearing a nightgown. Oh no! she says with a wail. That's wrong! It is! It's like me taking Lisa, says her friend Cory Kadamani, also of Youth Force, and taking out her mind and her voice, and her attitude, and saying what I think she is, based on looking at her. Also here is Ramesh James, a tall longhaired young man of Trinidadian heritage about whom Cory says, speaking of personal presentation: He doesn't look like a youth organizer. He looks like he's going to give you a `Colombian necktie' and kill your brother and sister. Everybody laughs. Ramesh laughs. It's the story of his life. And true, he has been in trouble. Growing up in Queens, he says, he was jumped by some kids who beat him so badly with bats and pipes that he had to be hospitalized and is now deaf in one ear. He says he shot one of his attackers and was sent to a juvenile detention facility. Now he's on probation, working at Youth Force, a supervisor, responsible, articulate, intelligent, traveling with Lisa when she's invited to talk at events. It's always Lisa invited to talk at events. She's small and female. He's tall and male. He knows how Reno feels, being tall, being different. I could give the woman a hug, he says, struck by how real and human she appears in person. In fact, after the event was over, after they'd all finished singing with Peter Yarrow, Ramesh singing onstage with Youth Force, Reno singing from the front row, Ramesh did walk over to embrace the attorney general, who had made a point of hugging Lisa, but instead was edged away by security guards, he says. Tall guy, dark-skinned. Sorry, no hugs. He's used to it. They're all used to it. They get it, maybe better than anybody, what the jokesters are doing, the easy target that is appearance. They marvel at how, if they'd talked to Janet Reno on the phone, they would have thought her gentle, petite; how, based on the way she looks, people get a different idea entirely. They marvel at how impressions are formed, how people react to people who are not conventional, people who are not like them, people who do not walk the narrow norm. It's men, says Lisa. They can't see a woman being an attorney general. Some men, says another Youth Force member, J.J. Galay. I wonder, says Cory, if we'll ever have a black man or a woman or a Jewish president. They all wonder about this. They are not optimistic. They know about the power of image. They're just like Reno, they feel, because they're young, because they're different, because they're ethnic, because people see them and leap to conclusions. To Janet Reno she may be merely Janet Reno; to them she is Janet Reno, she is a woman, she is a tall woman, and all of those things affect how people deal with her, how they react. At the same time she is more than that: She is them. Nobody knows us, says Ramesh, and they sit there, four kids from the streets of New York, profoundly sympathizing with the attorney general of the United States.

There are no half measures to Kay Redfield Jamison's medico-biographical study of poet Robert Lowell. It is impassioned, intellectually thrilling and often beautifully written, despite being repetitive and overlong: A little too much would seem to be just enough for Jamison.\n\nRobert Lowell, Setting the River on Fire: A Study of Genius, Mania, and Character, by Kay Redfield Jamison (Knopf)\n\nNonetheless, Robert Lowell: Setting the River on Fire achieves a magnificence and intensity — dare one say a manic brilliance? — that sets it apart from more temperate and orderly biographies. Above all, the book demands that readers seriously engage with its arguments, while also prodding them to reexamine their own beliefs about art, madness and moral responsibility. Reading this analysis of genius, mania, and character is an exhilarating experience.\n\nFrom the late 1940s to the mid-1970s, Lowell was the most admired and talked-about American poet of his generation. Scion of a privileged New England family, he counted among many distinguished ancestors two notable poets — James Russell Lowell and Amy Lowell — as well as Percival Lowell, the astronomer who sighted what he thought were canals on Mars.\n\nProdigiously gifted, Lowell won his first Pulitzer Prize in 1947 for Lord Weary's Castle — which includes the famous long poem The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket — and still another in 1974 for The Dolphin. At least as important, though, is Life Studies (1959), which established a confessional style that would long dominate American poetry. In 1977, at the young age of 60, Lowell died suddenly of a heart attack while taking a taxi from the airport to the New York apartment of his former wife, the novelist and critic Elizabeth Hardwick.\n\n['Ted Hughes': A controversial biography shows the poet's darker side]\n\nAccording to Hardwick and others who knew him, Lowell was — most of the time — kindly, witty and loving. Unfortunately, along with all the advantages of being born into American aristocracy, the poet also inherited a manic-depressive illness that would wreak havoc in his life and cause an immense amount of pain to his family and friends. Periodically — 16 times or more during his adult life — his entire being would accelerate, shift into hyperdrive. He would inaugurate affairs with young women, spit out torrents of hurtful abuse, grow physically violent and delusional, and sometimes identify himself with Napoleon or even Hitler.\n\nIt might take a half-dozen burly policemen to subdue the over-revved Lowell, so that he might be taken away for care at McLean Hospital or Payne Whitney Clinic. There he would be given drugs or psychotherapy, both usually ineffective, or more usefully electroconvulsive shock treatments. Only in 1967 did physicians begin to prescribe lithium to control his manic depression. Because of it, Lowell would successfully manage his demons for the last decade of his life, except when he neglected to take the lithium or took too much of it.\n\nThroughout her book, Jamison views Lowell's strength of character as nothing less than herculean, as he reestablishes his life, again and again, after each shame-filled, soul-killing episode of insanity. She also explores the probable clinical link between mania, which can free up the inner self's mind-forged manacles, and artistic creativity. As Shakespeare wrote long ago, the lunatic, the poet, and the lover/ Are of imagination all compact. In the case of Lowell, who was all three of these, Jamison contends that instability and the relentless recurrence of his illness hardened his discipline while mania impelled and stamped his work.\n\nRobert Lowell in 1947 (The Associated Press)\n\nTo establish her diagnosis, this distinguished professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and author of the best-selling memoir An Unquiet Mind brings to bear everything she can think of. Jamison piles on a multitude of quotes attesting to Lowell's great genius, perhaps because the poet's reputation has diminished since his death. Like a modern Robert Burton, she digresses into an anatomy of manic depression — she feels that the contemporary term bipolar disorder sanitizes the horrors of this illness — and describes the kinds of treatment available in the past to the mentally disturbed.\n\nAlongside photographs of Lowell and some of the people he loved, she reproduces his medical charts and records, having been granted special access by the poet's daughter and executor. She also regularly underscores her points by citing Lowell's poems, concluding her book with an extended tribute to For the Union Dead, that majestic meditation on history, race and valor.\n\nRobert Lowell: Setting the River on Fire would be an unqualified triumph were it not for Jamison's penchant for overkill: Everything is treated a bit too expansively, many points and anecdotes are repeated twice or three times, and rather than quoting one authority, she quotes a half-dozen. While Jamison's prose, like her thought, always remains admirably clear and often striking, she's inordinately fond of declamatory effects — New England would be a light, a beacon, a spirit and an exemplar — and she noticeably favors the heavy melodrama of serial modifiers and nouns: Ancestry is preordaining, corrupting, benevolent, benign, damning.\n\n[Who Was Wallace Stevens? A new biography looks at the man and his work.]\n\nAbove all, though, Jamison's book is as much an apologia as it is a clinical analysis. The French say tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner— to understand all is to forgive all. Jamison recognizes that Lowell damaged other people's lives, but she excuses him because he really had no control over his behavior. Still, who speaks for all the young women he seduced with promises of love and marriage, then dropped? And who paid for all those expensive hospital stays? Lowell got away with a lot. Jamison concludes that great poetry even justifies the humiliation he consciously inflicted on Hardwick by printing her anguished private letters in The Dolphin. As Elizabeth Bishop angrily told him, Art just isn't worth that much.\n\nOr is it? Certainly, Robert Lowell: Setting the River on Fire is a book to be learned from and argued with. It is both empathetic and astute, as heartfelt as it is heartbreaking.\n\nMichael Dirda reviews books on Thursday in Style.\n\nOn March 2 at 7 p.m., Kay Redfield Jamison will be at Politics and Prose Bookstore, 5015 Connecticut Ave. NW.
The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, literary agent Gloria Loomis.\n\nMr. Bernstein first published in the New Yorker at 20 and distinguished himself as a combat correspondent during World War II with the military weekly Yank. His best-selling book of war dispatches, Keep Your Head Down (1945), was lauded for its expertise with dialogue and propelled a film and TV writing career that lasted into his 90s.\n\nAD\n\nHe contributed to the Hollywood western The Magnificent Seven (1960) and movies such as Fail-Safe (1964), starring Henry Fonda as the U.S. president facing a nuclear holocaust, and Semi-Tough (1977), a comedy with Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristofferson as football players.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Bernstein also co-wrote The Molly Maguires (1970), starring Sean Connery as a 19th-century Pennsylvania coal miner whose protests for better working conditions are violently suppressed. It was not a commercial success, even after Mr. Bernstein acceded to studio demands to tack on a love story. It was very downbeat, I guess, for most people at the time, he later told the Nomadic Press. You know, the hero got hanged and the villain got rewarded.\n\nThe son of a Brooklyn schoolteacher, Mr. Bernstein came of age during the Depression and said he was drawn to communism to battle fascism in Europe as well as racial and economic injustices at home. Communism, he wrote in his 1996 memoir, Inside Out, expressed what I wept for in movies, what moved and thrilled me the most: people fighting not only for themselves but for other people, and now for the whole world.\n\nAD\n\nHe was one of many prominent figures whose livelihoods and relationships were upended amid the Red Scare of the 1950s — an era of political witch hunts in which Mr. Bernstein's phone was tapped, his garbage was rifled through, and he was trailed by the FBI. It was nearly impossible to get off the blacklist without denouncing other alleged communists, an option he could not stomach.\n\nAD\n\nHe said the perception of fear was pervasive, but he also found it laughable that anyone would suspect the communists he knew of plotting a violent overthrow of the government. No one I knew in the Party ever dreamed of it, Mr. Bernstein wrote in his book. Our meetings might have been less boring if they had.\n\nNevertheless, he became unemployable under his own name from 1950 to 1958, and he asked friends to act as fronts to shield his identity as a writer. His work, although not his name, appeared on prestigious anthology shows such as Studio One, and he won awards he could not openly accept. At least one front earned a lucrative movie contract on the strength of Mr. Bernstein's scripts. Careers were made on my talent, he acidly observed.\n\nAD\n\nThe Front (1976) was based on that time of political hysteria. He originally wrote the film as a straightforward drama, but when he and a close friend, the once-blacklisted director Martin Ritt, shopped it around Hollywood, they were told the subject was commercial poison.\n\nAD\n\nIt only was greenlighted after Mr. Bernstein retooled the script as a partial comedy, and Ritt persuaded Allen, the writer-director and comedy star who was then at his most bankable, to star.\n\nNo responsible person in the movie industry ever offered me a serious role before, Allen quipped to the New York Times. The reason I did 'The Front' was that the subject was worthwhile. Martin Ritt and Walter Bernstein lived through the blacklist and survived it with dignity, so I didn't mind deferring to their judgment.\n\nAD\n\nAllen played a bookie who pretends, for a share of the profits, to be the author of TV scripts written by blacklisted writers. At first a political coward, he develops a conscience after a friend (played by the formerly blacklisted actor Zero Mostel) commits suicide. In the final scene, he utters a defiant profanity when hauled before the House Un-American Activities Committee.\n\nAD\n\nReviews for The Front were uneven, with many critics noting its precarious hodgepodge of humor, tragedy and politics.\n\nAlmost everything it does could have been done better, Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote. On the other hand, it is a very difficult movie to judge because it takes up a previously forbidden subject . . . and has the nerve, and grace, to take an absurdist view of that deplorable era.\n\nAD\n\nWalter Saul Bernstein was born in Brooklyn on Aug. 20, 1919. By his telling, he was a sports and film fanatic who had only passing awareness of world affairs before he was selected at 16 for a study-abroad program in France.\n\nIn Grenoble, he fell in with a group of English communists who engaged in impassioned discussions about the plight of the proletariat and the fight against Nazism. He saw striking workers all over the city singing the socialist anthem The Internationale, and Mr. Bernstein was soon brimming with revolutionary ardor.\n\nAD\n\nHe published a short work of fiction in the New Yorker in 1939, leading to regular contributions to the magazine's Reporter at Large column after his Dartmouth College graduation the next year and his enlistment in the Army during World War II. The military made him a press agent for the Broadway show This Is the Army, Irving Berlin's morale-boosting musical.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Bernstein was supposed to publicize how the active-duty service members in the cast were, in fact, working as hard as all other recruits. That seemed to be undermined by his New Yorker article showing a comedian who specialized in double-talk leading a calisthenics drill: Inhale! Outhale! Sidehale!\n\nA humor-impaired colonel threatened Mr. Bernstein with a court-martial. But New Yorker editor Harold Ross intervened with his good friend George Marshall, the Army chief of staff. Mr. Bernstein soon obtained a transfer to a new Army publication, Yank.\n\nAD\n\nAs a roving correspondent, he covered the brutal campaigns in Sicily and Italy. He also tramped a week over mountains in German-occupied Yugoslavia to obtain one of the first interviews by a U.S. newsman with the anti-fascist partisan revolutionary Josip Broz Tito.\n\nAD\n\nThe expedition to reach Tito, the future Communist strongman, was arduous but not without its cheerier moments. Mr. Bernstein recalled the partisans teaching him their patriotic marches, and they wanted him to reciprocate with rousing American songs. Stumped, he said the best he could do was Buckle Down Winsocki, from the Broadway musical Best Foot Forward, set in a military academy.\n\nWith the success of Keep Your Head Down, he was lured to Hollywood with the promise of writing screen adaptations of works by Chekhov and Dostoyevsky, but instead he found himself roped into shared credit on a minor Burt Lancaster film noir called Kiss the Blood Off My Hands (1948).\n\nAD\n\nHe saw more promise in the new medium of television, and his speed and versatility as a writer made him attractive to producers. But assignments dried up in 1950 after his name appeared in the influential anti-communist pamphlet Red Channels.\n\nAD\n\nWith the help of a sympathetic CBS producer, Mr. Bernstein concocted schemes to avoid detection by the panicky network brass on the lookout for communist writers.\n\nMr. Bernstein took a pseudonym, Paul Bauman, and the producer explained to his bosses that the author was a literary hermit who wrote from a mountaintop cabin in Colorado and did not have a phone. When that did not satisfy CBS executives, they arranged for Bauman to seek treatment in Switzerland for a rare tropical disease. Finally, when the ruse could go no further, the terminally ill Bauman jumped to his death from an alp.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Bernstein described writing for You Are There, a CBS historical reenactment program hosted by Walter Cronkite, as one of his most rewarding jobs. He and other blacklisted scribes churned out story lines spotlighting historic examples of intolerance — including the anti-Semitic Dreyfus Affair and the persecution of Galileo for heresy.\n\nThey were intended as veiled commentaries on the Red Scare, a literary guerrilla war, Mr. Bernstein noted. The show was popular and showered with awards, none of which he could accept. But Mr. Bernstein defined success, under the circumstances, in other ways: I was working.\n\nEven as Mr. Bernstein severed ties with the party after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, he continued using phantom names or fronts until the blacklist began to come undone amid legal challenges. His own reprieve was expedited by a studio chief who needed Mr. Bernstein's services on two Sophia Loren movies — That Kind of Woman (1959) and Heller in Pink Tights (1960).\n\nMr. Bernstein's later credits included Paris Blues (1961), starring Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier as American jazzmen in France; Yanks (1979) with Richard Gere as an American soldier in wartime England; and The House on Carroll Street (1988), a blacklist and Nazi drama with Kelly McGillis and Jeff Daniels. He also wrote and directed Little Miss Marker (1980), a flop remake of a Shirley Temple film.\n\nMr. Bernstein kept pitching ideas to cable networks through recent years, most in keeping with the social-justice concerns that defined his life. His teleplay for HBO's Miss Evers' Boys (1997), about the U.S. government's use of unsuspecting Black men to test the effects of syphilis, earned an Emmy nomination. He also reworked Fail-Safe into a live CBS-TV adaptation for producer George Clooney in 2000.\n\nHis marriages to Marva Spelman, Barbara Lane and Judith Braun ended in divorce. In 1988, he married Loomis. In addition to his wife, survivors include two children from his first marriage, Joan Bernstein and Peter Spelman; three children from his third marriage, Nicholas Bernstein, TV director Andrew Bernstein and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jake Bernstein; a stepdaughter, Diana Loomis; a sister; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nIn his memoir, Mr. Bernstein wrote that the blacklist caused so much havoc and confusion with hidden identities that he often was praised by writer friends for excellent work he had nothing to do with.\n\nMy denials were taken as signs of a becoming modesty, he wrote. There were certain advantages to this. It could take you far with attractive women who appreciated good writing. You had to choose, of course, between lust and honor, but that was no choice at all.
When playing the computer simulation of a card game, people who reported they overindulged in Facebook made big gambles at a higher rate -- even when they saw that taking risks in the game always came with big punishments. They played the game the exact way drug addicts typically do, while people who reported less time on social media made better decisions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis camp also reported feeling similar symptoms of dependence on social media similar to those who suffer from substance abuse -- including feeling overly emotionally connected to the platforms, or letting them disrupt focus on work or other daily tasks. They're constantly thinking about these platforms when they're not using them, said the study's lead author, Dar Meshi. They're losing sleep because they're on social media.\n\nTech addiction is an issue on Congress's radar -- and is quickly becoming a point of contention between tech companies and lawmakers who worry about the impact of pervasive platforms on citizens' health. Senate Democrats are preparing to introduce bills addressing technology addiction, including one that would allocate more public funding into research on the impacts of technology on children's psychology.\n\nThe widespread practice of designing technology products to be habit-forming, or to otherwise undermine user consent or autonomy, is a major concern, Senator Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told me in an email. I'm in the process of drafting legislation that would address this phenomenon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeshi said his findings underscore the need for more research into dependence on technology. Scientists still know very little about technology addiction. The National Institutes of Health launched a major study into how screen-time impacts children's brain development, as CBS News recently reported. But overall, researchers have largely focused on dependence on video games, and to date, research into social media dependence is just beginning.\n\nLawmakers and consumer advocates also want more data. Facebook and companies have built their platforms with habit-forming features aimed at giving users psychological rewards that keep them coming back for more. Their efforts have been effective — and lucrative. Though Facebook rarely gives exact figures on time people spend on its site, in 2016 it said the average person spends about 50 minutes per day across Facebook, Messenger and Instagram.\n\nLawmakers are especially focused on the impact of these sites and heavy screen time on children's health. Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) tells me he is planning to reintroduce a version of the Children and Media Research Advance (CAMRA) Act this Congress, which would allocate millions in funding for NIH to research the impact of technology such as mobile devices and video games on children and adolescents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nParents and policymakers alike are in the dark on pressing questions regarding how the technology children use every day is affecting their brains and bodies, Markey told me in an email. We need to get to the bottom of the cognitive, physical, and socio-emotional repercussions of young people's tech use and media consumption.\n\nThe bill gained sponsors on both sides of the aisle and in the House, but did not move forward in the last Congress. Markey's staffers tell me they're collecting co-sponsors to reintroduce the bill. Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) was a House co-sponsor of the legislation, but he did not run for reelection in 2018 because he is pursuing a 2020 presidential bid.\n\nLegislators have been trying to exert more political pressure on tech addiction since around the time Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook in his dorm room — years before Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone. In 2005, former senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) first introduced the CAMRA Act to study the impact of electronic devices on children. But these efforts were not successful.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA perfect storm is brewing in 2019 that could result in a different outcome. Policymakers are planning to get tough on technology addiction as Wall Street investors and even prominent Silicon Valley technologists are using their influence to bring technology addiction to the public's attention.\n\nThe companies have introduced some new product features intended to get ahead of the backlash, such as timers that tell people how much time they've spent on their phone each week. But that doesn't seem to be enough for lawmakers, who are still promising to get tougher.\n\nWarner told me the technology companies have too often used behavioral psychology to the detriment of consumers.\n\nAD\n\nRather than using technology to empower consumers, too often we've seen large technology companies — particularly in the social media space — utilize technology, along with tricks gleaned from behavioral psychology, to disempower users — undermining their ability to make informed, deliberate choices in their use of tech products.\n\nAD\n\nBITS, NIBBLES AND BYTES\n\nBITS: Apple has hired Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee turned vocal critic of the social network, to serve as a product manager on the company's privacy team, the Financial Times's Hannah Kuchler and Tim Bradshaw reported. Parakilas will be tasked with collaborating with other Apple teams to uphold users' privacy in new products. His recruitment comes as Apple has increasingly sought to emphasize its commitment to privacy and distinguish itself from competitors including Facebook, Google and Amazon as tech giants face mounting scrutiny over their data collection practices. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nSandy Parakilas monitored software developers' privacy and policy compliance at Facebook for a year and a half before he left the social network in October 2012, Kuchler and Bradshaw wrote. At the time, he warned senior executives of the potentially damaging consequences of the company's data-sharing policies, but felt his concerns were played down. Parakilas has also advocated for encrypted messaging and increased protection of user data, according to the Financial Times.\n\nNIBBLES: As wireless carriers prepare for the rollout of 5G service, the very definition of what 5G actually is has become a point of contention between telecommunications companies, according to the Wall Street Journal's Drew FitzGerald. Verizon and T-Mobile scolded AT&T after the latter company added the label 5GE on the Android phones of some of its customers — with the E in 5GE meaning evolution. Yet such phones can only connect to 4G service.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVerizon won't take an old phone and just change the 4 in the status bar to a 5, Kyle Malady, Verizon's chief technology officer, wrote in an open letter that was published online and in newspapers as full-page ads, the Journal reported. T-Mobile has also teased AT&T over the move in a short video on Twitter.\n\nIt's hardly the first time telecom marketers have used engineering patter to muddy the waters, FitzGerald reported. T-Mobile caught flak in 2010 for putting 4G labels atop phone screens connected to its upgraded HSPA+ network, which critics argued was only enhanced 3G.\n\nBYTES: The recent interruptions of flights at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports following drone sightings illustrate how airports and public authorities have yet to come up with solutions to prevent such threats, CNBC's Lora Kolodny reported. Interdictions are allowed at military bases in the United States and some fixed sites that are owned by federal agencies, according to CNBC. But authority hasn't been determined at every commercial airport.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJoerg Lamprecht, chief executive of Dedrone, a San Francisco-based start-up that works to detect malicious drones, said air travel professionals are still working to determine who is responsible for what when it comes to drones. Airports have a lot of red tape, Lamprecht told Kolodny. This is a new issue. Who is in charge, who controls the airspace, who is the one that should be providing drone detection? Who has the authority to manage this and to intervene — is it federal police, local police, someone who owns the airspace?\n\nPRIVATE CLOUD\n\n— Virtual reality used to be the next big thing in tech, but the hype has largely subsided at the CES show in Las Vegas this year, the Associated Press's Mae Anderson reported. Although major tech companies including Facebook, Google and Microsoft have invested hefty amounts of money in VR, the technology has not met much success. These days, VR is mostly a niche product for gaming and business training, held back by expensive, clunky headsets, a paucity of interesting software and other technological shortcomings, the AP reported.\n\n— More technology news from the private sector:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPUBLIC CLOUD\n\n— An adviser to the European Union's Court of Justice largely backed Google in its legal battle against France's privacy regulator over a global right to be forgotten, the Wall Street Journal's Sam Schechner reported. The adviser said Google and other search engines should not be forced to apply this principle outside the EU. Maciej Szpunar, an advocate general for the court, argued in Thursday's nonbinding opinion that if the EU ordered removal of content from websites accessed outside the EU, there was a danger that other jurisdictions would use their laws to block information from being accessible within the EU, according to the Journal.\n\nThe court, which often follows the advice of the advocate general, usually rules within two to four months, Reuters reported. The fundamental right to be forgotten must be balanced against other fundamental rights, such as the right to data protection and the right to privacy, as well as the legitimate public interest in accessing the information sought, Szpunar said, according to Reuters.\n\n— More technology news from the public sector:\n\n#TRENDING\n\n— Researchers at Princeton University and New York University found that Americans older that 65 are more likely to share fake news on Facebook, the Verge's Casey Newton reported. Older users shared more fake news than younger ones regardless of education, sex, race, income, or how many links they shared, Newton wrote. In fact, age predicted their behavior better than any other characteristic — including party affiliation.\n\nThe study analyzed user behavior in the months that preceded and followed the past U.S. presidential election and found that sharing false articles was relatively rare overall. Users who identified as conservative were more likely than users who identified as liberal to share fake news: 18 percent of Republicans shared links to fake news sites, compared to less than 4 percent of Democrats, the Verge reported. The researchers attributed this finding largely to studies showing that in 2016, fake news overwhelmingly served to promote Trump's candidacy.\n\n— More tech news generating buzz around the Web:\n\n@MENTIONS\n\n— Samantha Segall, who was vice president of government affairs at Leidos, joined the identity management company CLEAR as senior director of government relations, according to a news release from the company.\n\n— Kyle Laughlin, who was a senior vice president at Disney, joined Amazon to lead the company's Alexa Gadgets division, TechCrunch reported.\n\n404 ERROR\n\n— News about tech incidents and blunders:\n\nBURN RATE\n\n— Today in funding news:\n\nCHECK-INS\n\nToday\n\nComing soon\n\nThe Brookings Institution hosts a discussion titled How China and the U.S. are advancing artificial intelligence on Jan. 14.\n\nWIRED IN\n\nJust a few weird tech products we saw at CES 2019:\n\nWelcome to the future.

— Husband Absent, Don't Care\n\nHusband Absent, Don't Care: That's some heavy contempt you're nursing there — a toxic emotion in a marriage. (Check out John Gottman's work, gottman.com.)\n\nAD\n\nYou can get counseling on your own to work through this and to find some ways to tell your husband how you feel that aren't hostile. You also can work on strategies for addressing the division of labor so that you can cross it off the list of reasons to resent the man who is supposed to be your partner (and whose relationship with you is the primary model you're providing your children).\n\nAD\n\nShort version: less bitterness, more work to make it work.\n\nEven if your differences are irreconcilable, finding a more respectful, cooperative, positive tone will bring dramatic improvement to the example you set, no matter what next step you and he decide to take.\n\nAD\n\nRe: Don't Care: Huge red flag.

I know that's not the solidarity you were looking for.\n\nBut some people really are able to accept constructive criticism gracefully, and it's a beautiful thing that we should thank people for whenever we have the chance.\n\nAnyway. The tailgating is bad news — it's driving either mindlessly or angry, and his refusing to stop when you point it out suggests he's on the angry side. I urge you to address the anger in a larger sense, at home; approaching it when you're both calm and not going 80 is your best bet.\n\nRe: Car trouble: What works for me in the car is to say, Heidi thinks you're tailgating, or, Heidi thinks you should slow down a bit.

When Buttigieg took the microphone, he was forced to yell, doing his best to deliver his message without showing frustration that no one in a room full of black dignitaries seemed to want to hear it. When former vice president Joe Biden took the same stage later that afternoon, the room was raucous at his arrival, then rapt for his remarks.\n\nAD\n\nThe episode captured the irony, and ultimately the downfall, of Buttigieg's meteoric campaign. In an age of identity and representation, Buttigieg, a married gay man, presented himself as a longtime outsider, one who understood what it meant to be shunned and who promised a politics of inclusion. But Buttigieg could never convince African Americans, a pillar of the Democratic coalition and a group for whom representation has moved to the center of public discussion, that he understood their experience or how to fight for their rights.\n\nHe had more broad appeal in those early, mostly white states than any of the other candidates, said Dan Pfeiffer, a former adviser to then-President Barack Obama. But ultimately, he was never able to make any gains with nonwhite parts of the electorate. And there's no path to the Democratic nomination and the presidency that doesn't include that.\n\nPerhaps the greatest legacy of Buttigieg's run is to broaden the nation's vision of the role of gay Americans in the nation's political life, as the most successful openly gay presidential candidate ever grew increasingly open about his marriage and his struggles with his sexuality as the months went by.\n\nYet he found himself Sunday in his hometown of South Bend, Ind., the city where his struggles with racial issues as mayor earned detractors and supporters, telling supporters that the path has narrowed to a close.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the end, Buttigieg appealed to enough voters to vault into serious contention but not enough to lift him higher. He built an improbably broad base that was not broad enough, and when the primary moved to more diverse states, he simply could not keep up.\n\nButtigieg launched his presidential exploratory committee on Jan. 23, 2019, with a video in which he wore a flannel shirt and sweater, his hair not yet as tightly cropped as it would be by the time he announced he would be leaving the race. The unmistakable flecks of gray hadn't bubbled up there yet. His face wasn't quite as gaunt.\n\nLater that day, curious reporters packed a conference room at the Holiday Inn in downtown Washington, peppering Buttigieg with questions about whether his candidacy implied he felt the older generation wasn't ready to handle the moment, about what being gay might mean to it all.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe same question seemed to underscore all of it: Are you serious?\n\nButtigieg was serious about trying — that much was clear. From the start, he pitched himself as a unique messenger for a new message: The rise of President Trump had exposed the old ways of operating as flawed and unsustainable. A young mayor from the Midwest might just be the person to handle what lies ahead — and in a field that included senators, former mayors and a former vice president, Buttigieg wanted a chance.\n\nHe got more than that, outlasting senators, governors and others far more seasoned.\n\nHe's a very talented messenger with a very sophisticated understanding of how you communicate in this environment, Pfeiffer said. His omnipresence in the media is something Democrats can learn a lot from. . . . He ensured he was always part of the conversation.\n\nThat strategy, built by communications director Lis Smith, allowed Buttigieg to rise to prominence in a field that didn't seem likely to have much room for someone like him. Along the way, it underlined a key point about politics in the Trump era: Even without experience, money or organization, if a candidate — even an un­or­tho­dox one — knows how to play the media, he can catapult to prominence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs early favorites such as Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) built multistate organizations, Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, along with Smith and another staffer, Max Harris, would pile into the car, drive west from South Bend, and try to find Iowans willing to listen to Buttigieg.\n\nThe whole thing seemed like a lark to seasoned political analysts; Buttigieg was 37, barely old enough to be president, and he had never even held statewide office. That changed on March 10, when Buttigieg took the stage for his first nationally televised town hall on CNN. Within the Buttigieg campaign, staffers later referred to it simply as the CNN Town Hall, although he had since conducted many others.\n\nSomething about his delivery, his profile and his demeanor sparked nationwide interest. Boyish and eloquent, Buttigieg seemed simultaneously to answer some Democrats' urgent desire for an anti-Trump and their long-standing hunger for candidates who are fresh-faced and rhetorically agile, like John F. Kennedy and Obama.\n\nThat night also provided a moment of trailblazing, when Buttigieg joked with CNN host Jake Tapper that he and his husband seemed to disagree on how to pronounce his last name. An openly gay presidential candidate had talked about his husband on national television as if it were nothing.\n\nThat husband, Chasten, would emerge as something of a cult hero for Buttigieg supporters, who often clamored for pictures with him. An active Twitter account and numerous personal appearances showcased Chasten's earnest, often humorous style.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChasten had sat through Buttigieg's speeches before. But after the CNN town hall, he and his husband were headed for something on a much different scale.\n\nPolitical analyst David Axelrod recalled hearing almost immediately from two donors asking how they could get in touch with Buttigieg. By the end of the month, Democratic megadonor Susie Tompkins Buell had agreed to host a fundraiser for Buttigieg.\n\nAt the time, his campaign staff was just trying to push Buttigieg within striking distance of the donor count needed to qualify for the debate stage. Within 24 hours, he had reached a third of the 65,000 donor threshold. Two days later, his campaign announced it had reached 55,000 individual donors.\n\nAD\n\nThis thrust Buttigieg into a whirlwind of attention and travel that spat him out in Los Angeles a week later, where he sat in the back of a black SUV headed through West Hollywood on his way to shake hands with stars such as Greg Louganis and Billy Eichner. Buttigieg said that day he didn't think the rigors of campaigning for the presidency would require much of an adjustment, but he admitted, I don't love repeating myself.\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg would spend most of the next few months repeating himself, in television interviews and magazine sit-downs, on CNN town halls and Sunday shows. From the earliest days of Buttigieg's bid, Mike Schmuhl, a longtime friend turned campaign manager, acknowledged it was a long shot.\n\nMost people do not equate mayor of a town in flyover country as presidential material, but Pete is special, Schmuhl said then. Once people get to know Pete, they are intrigued, interested, supportive right out of the gate.\n\nAD\n\nIf the idea was to get as many people as possible to know him, Buttigieg had a good person to help: Smith. As frenetic as Buttigieg was steady, as prone to expletives as Buttigieg was averse to them, and as intolerant of stillness as Buttigieg was dedicated to it, Smith always seemed like an unlikely partner.\n\nAD\n\nBut in the first months of his candidacy — and, as it happened, the last months, as well — Smith made sure Buttigieg was booked on every television show possible. He sneaked calls to broadcast stations on almost every drive, took reporters with him from one event to another, and talked to local cameras whenever they would have him.\n\nSo the man who started the campaign without the hefty email lists of his competitors, almost entirely unknown to nonpolitical junkies, raised nearly $25 million in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nAD\n\nWith money came staff and the need to scale his operation in less than half the time of some of his competitors. His Iowa state director hit the ground in the first days of May. By September, the campaign was opening 20 offices in the state in 20 days. The Buttigieg campaign had to find what talent was left in other early states, too.\n\nAD\n\nSoon, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada operations sprung up, as well. He hired senior adviser and key strategist Michael Halle — one of the architects behind Buttigieg's delegate strategy — in July. By August, he had a deputy campaign manager, Hari Sevugan.\n\nBut summer also brought tragedy — and with it, the kind of scrutiny Buttigieg had largely avoided. In South Bend, an unarmed black man named Eric Logan was shot and killed by a white police offer.\n\nButtigieg left the trail and headed home, where he was confronted by anguished South Bend natives arguing he hadn't taken the proper steps to console Logan's family, nor to eradicate the systemic racism and bias that provided the backdrop. Black residents of South Bend shouted at him during a contentious town hall.\n\nThe South Bend chapter of Black Lives Matter began protesting Buttigieg. National publications dug into his record on issues of race in South Bend, and they found he had struggled to diversify its police force. A national narrative coalesced: Black voters did not like Buttigieg.\n\nAD\n\nMore broadly, the shooting raised a crucial question: Was Buttigieg, a young, white, Harvard-educated man from Indiana, the right candidate to lead a diverse party? More to the point: Could he really empathize with the black experience?\n\nSome argued that Buttigieg was being unfairly painted as racially insensitive.\n\nI do know how it got started — the shooting and the town hall meeting, said Gladys Muhammad, a black South Bend native who stumped on Buttigieg's behalf. Those of us who were not involved and just in the community, we decided not to speak. We decided to let the grass-roots people voice their concerns because they needed to be heard. We wanted that to happen. As angry as they were, they needed to say what they needed to say. We stepped back and didn't say anything.\n\nYet Buttigieg continued to struggle to find answers to questions about race. When he said being gay helped him understand the importance of tolerance and acceptance, it provoked a backlash from those who argued he was equating two very different experiences.\n\nSo even as white voters in Iowa and New Hampshire took to Buttigieg, it became increasingly clear that he was winning almost no support among African Americans in more diverse states.\n\nHis aides crossed their fingers, hoping success in Iowa and New Hampshire might convince a wider range of voters that Buttigieg could win, could lead Democrats to their urgent goal of unseating Trump.\n\nBut Buttigieg's stunning win in Iowa got muddled in a way that some of his staffers think derailed the plan entirely. Buttigieg took to a Des Moines stage and declared victory, but because of a disastrous series of glitches, it took days for the results to be finalized and Buttigieg to be proved right.\n\nPrivately, his advisers point to that as a key pivot point in Buttigieg's campaign. Instead of delivering a triumphant victory speech on national television to a party eager for a savior, he was slammed for declaring victory prematurely. Instead of a week of coverage of his triumph, outlets focused on the reporting debacle.\n\nBy the time the focus shifted to New Hampshire, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was staging her brief but important rise: Buttigieg advisers felt her surprise third-place finish there cost Buttigieg a victory, as well as precious attention. He lost to Sen. Bernie Sanders by less than two percentage points, falling short of would have been a stunning victory in the backyard of the independent from Vermont.\n\nAlong the way, younger, more liberal Democrats progressives often saw him as a compromise. They felt he relied too much on high-dollar fundraisers to be trusted to change the system. They watched him struggle to amass minority support. And they felt his Medicare for all who want it plan, his sliding scale for college tuition relief, and his relatively less expensive plan to combat climate change didn't go far enough.\n\nHe finished third in Nevada, garnering just 2 percent support among black voters. Not long after voting ended in South Carolina, Buttigieg's aides checked their polling models and realized he probably would fare poorly.\n\nHis senior advisers told him what they saw, knowing Buttigieg wouldn't linger if the prognosis wasn't good. He didn't, and was out of the race less than 24 hours later, the upstart candidate so many Democrats said they were waiting for who couldn't quite transform into the unifying force they were hoping for.\n\nChasten Buttigieg was the first to take the stage Sunday in South Bend when Buttigieg dropped out. He fought back tears as he told the crowd about the day his husband came home from work and asked him what he thought about running for president.\n\nI laughed, Chasten said. Not at him. Just at life.\n\nSoon after, he turned things over to his husband, the first openly gay candidate to win delegates in a primary, a candidate who fared so well that he pushed out of mind notions of just how improbable his success was.\n\nSunday's announcement is hardly a conclusive end to his political career. If Buttigieg were to run for president in 2056, after all, he would be younger than Biden is now.
Bracing to miss his second paycheck this week, Salado realized there could be legal repercussions for failing to make two child-support payments. But that was far from his mind.\n\nAD\n\nThat's not my priority right now, he said on Thursday. How will I get through the week? . . . There might be consequences, but I'll justify it.\n\nAD\n\nLike Salado, scores of furloughed federal workers struggled to make child-support payments this month that would normally be withdrawn directly from their pay, leaving former spouses and children with gaping holes in their monthly budgets.\n\nOn Friday night, President Trump signed legislation to reopen the government for three weeks, giving federal workers and their dependents a temporary reprieve. However, the workers are unlikely to receive pay before late next week.\n\nFamily law experts said there could be ripple effects after the shutdown for non-custodial parents who already missed a child-support payment, making them vulnerable to administrative sanctions or even contempt of court.\n\nAD\n\nFurloughed parents obligated by the state to pay child support could face back payments and administrative sanctions for missing a child support payment during the shutdown. Depending on the state, parents could theoretically lose their driver's licenses or professional licenses. Eventually some of these cases could find their way to the court for failure to pay child support on a timely basis. But in many states, including Maryland, parents who prove an inability to pay child support cannot be sent to jail, said Harry Siegel, who practices family law in Maryland.\n\nSiegel says he has helped dozens of furloughed federal workers in recent weeks with filing modifications to court orders for child support. But even after filing a request, it generally takes weeks for a hearing to take place, at which point the modification is likely to be useless for the future payments because the government has reopened and incomes would have been restored.\n\nAD\n\nEven so, filing for a modification can save legal grief later. Stephanie Troyer, a supervising attorney with the Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia, said most people with child support obligations do not realize that they cannot legally request a modification to a court order for child support after a payment has been missed.\n\nAD\n\nKatherine Morris, a spokeswoman with the Maryland Department of Human Services, which oversees the Child Support Administration, said her office was handling support concerns on a case-by-case basis. State officials were instructing local offices to limit or suspend enforcement in cases in which people fall behind in payments because of the shutdown and urged federal workers to contact the local office to arrange payment plans as soon as they return to work after the shutdown.\n\nBenidia Rice, director of child support services in the D.C. attorney general's office, said officials had no intention of enforcing sanctions against parents who cannot pay child support because of the shutdown. But she encouraged federal workers to contact her office.\n\nAD\n\nOur goal is to work with parents so that none of those things occur, Rice said.\n\nAD\n\nThousands of federal employees across the country have child-support obligations. In Maryland alone, there are 5,000 federal workers whose wages are garnished for child-support payments, not including federal contractors and workers who make child-support payments outside of wage withholdings, according to the Maryland Department of Human Services.\n\nSingle custodial parents across the country described feelings of helplessness as they grappled with missed child-support payments from their former spouses. Many said they desperately needed the checks but would hesitate to make their former spouses pay, knowing that they were suffering as well.\n\nThe shutdown came at the worst possible time for a Tampa Bay, Fla., mother and former spouse of a furloughed Coast Guard employee. The mother, who asked not to be named out of concern for her ex-husband's job, was in the middle of moving homes. The little savings she had went into a security deposit and first and last month's rent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA quarter of her family's income comes from a monthly alimony and child-support payment from her ex-husband, who is based overseas and with whom she has little communication. When his payment did not come this month, she approached her bank, which she heard was offering government shutdown assistance. But because she was not a federal worker or spouse of a federal worker, she did not qualify for the aid, she said.\n\nI'm just trying to stretch every dollar that I can, she said.\n\nWhile most federal workers will receive back pay once the government reopens, federal contractors will not, making it particularly difficult for them to catch up on bills such as child-support payments.\n\nAD\n\nMike Babcock, a railroad conductor in the Austin area who works with a firm that contracts with the federal government, usually works 12-hour shifts six days a week. But for the past month, he has been able to work only two shifts a week and has received none of his pay yet. He expects to get back pay for the little time he has worked, but it will be about 75 percent less than his normal monthly income.\n\nAD\n\nWorried about making his $550 bimonthly child support payments for his 9-year-old son from a previous marriage, he appealed to the Texas attorney general's office for help. They were just like, 'Get another job,'  Babcock said. In the past month, he has submitted scores of job applications and interviewed for two positions, with no luck, he said.\n\nWhile he managed to make his child-support payments this month, he nearly drained his savings doing so.\n\nAD\n\nDo I pay for groceries or do I pay for child support? he said. One of these is going to end up with me in jail.\n\nFor federal workers who were already behind on child-support payments, the shutdown has further exacerbated financial strains on the families that depend on them.\n\nA single mother of two in Buffalo said her ex-husband is almost $7,000 in arrears for child support. Last month, the 40-year-old woman filed a request to garnish the child support from his government paycheck, hoping it would finally force him to pay. But then came the shutdown, and her former husband stopped getting paid. The Washington Post is not identifying the woman because her ex-husband could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe woman worried that her house would go into foreclosure if she failed to pay her mortgage at the end of the month.
The House gallery was packed beyond its 102-seat capacity, with Virginia first lady Pam Northam and her daughter, Aubrey Northam, making a rare appearance to bear witness. ERA supporters attended from around the country, many wearing sashes from long-ago marches for women's equality.\n\nAD\n\nWhat happens in Virginia impacts the entire country and will reverberate across the globe, said Betty Folliard, the founder of ERA Minnesota, who traveled to Richmond to watch the votes.\n\nAD\n\nNumerous legal hurdles still have to be cleared before the ERA, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, would become part of the Constitution. Critics say various deadlines for ratification have long since passed.\n\nBut supporters were jubilant that Virginia, after years of failure, is poised to become the 38th state to approve the amendment. They pledged to mount a massive national campaign to enact it.\n\nFor the women of Virginia and the women of America, the resolution has finally passed, Del. Eileen Filler-Corn (D-Fairfax), the first female House speaker in the 401-year history of Virginia's legislature, said in announcing the result of the House vote.\n\nAD\n\nShe set off cheers that could be heard across the Capitol in the Senate chamber, where debate on the ERA was still underway.\n\nDel. Jennifer Carroll Foy (D-Prince William), the resolution's chief House sponsor, introduced the measure with a litany of Virginia's civil rights failures, including slavery, massive resistance to school integration and the ban on interracial marriage.\n\nAD\n\nIt's Virginia again on the battleground of equality. I think it is right on time for Virginia to finally be on the right side of history, Carroll Foy said.\n\nCalling the balloting that was about to take place the vote of a lifetime, she asked lawmakers: Which side of history do you want to be on? . . . The world is watching — your mothers, your sisters, your daughters.\n\nAD\n\nDel. Vivian Watts (D-Fairfax) held up a photo of herself and her daughter demonstrating for the ERA in Washington 44 years ago, when her daughter was 14. Watts wore the same sash Wednesday that she wore in the photo.\n\nIt should be ancient history, Watts said. Forty-four years is a long time to wait.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, who bottled up the ERA in subcommittee during their 26 years in control of the House of Delegates, tried to postpone action with parliamentary challenges. Several also said the vote was merely symbolic, because it remains unclear whether the amendment can actually be ratified so long after its initial approval.\n\nAD\n\nFirst proposed in 1923, the ERA was reintroduced in every session of Congress until it passed in 1972. U.S. lawmakers set a deadline of March 22, 1979, for three-quarters of the states to ratify the amendment, a measure ERA supporters now say is unconstitutional because it was not included in the amendment text.\n\nAD\n\nAs that deadline approached, Congress extended it to June 30, 1982. Because only 35 of the needed 38 state legislatures ratified the ERA by that time, the amendment was declared a failure.\n\nSubsequently, legislatures in Idaho, Kentucky, Nebraska, Tennessee and South Dakota rescinded their ratifications. ERA supporters say there is no provision for rescissions in the Constitution, and therefore they do not count. No federal court has conclusively ruled on that question.\n\nSince 2017, Nevada and Illinois have ratified the ERA, which put Virginia in place as the final state needed for ratification, if the five withdrawals are not counted. But the U.S. Justice Department last week issued a finding that the amendment had expired and could no longer be ratified.\n\nThe finding was requested by three state attorneys general who sued the archivist of the United States late last year in an attempt to keep him from registering the amendment if Virginia passed it. Their lawsuit is being challenged by two Massachusetts organizations, who say only Congress — not the executive branch — can interfere in a constitutional amendment process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeparately, several efforts are underway on Capitol Hill to either extend or restart the ratification process.\n\nElizabeth Holtzman, a former member of Congress from New York who sponsored the resolution extending the original ratification deadline to 1982, said Wednesday that Virginia's vote is a very big step forward.\n\nIt's a recognition by three-quarters of the states that American women firmly belong in the United States Constitution, she said in a phone call from Paris. It's been a long time coming, far too long.\n\nWednesday's votes in Richmond were not for final passage of the amendment. Under parliamentary rules, each chamber still has to approve the other's version, even though they are identical. That process could take several days, but in this case is considered a formality.\n\nThe state Senate has passed the ERA with bipartisan support several times in past sessions. This year, both chambers designated the measure Joint Resolution 1, signifying its priority status.\n\nThe House vote was recorded as 59-41, though one Republican — Wendell Walker of Lynchburg — said he voted yes inadvertently and filed a vote change. The other three Republicans who sided with every Democratic lawmaker were Dels. Carrie Coyner (Chesterfield), Glenn Davis (Virginia Beach) and Jeff Campbell (Smyth County).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 28-12 Senate vote included seven Republicans in favor of the amendment. Two of them — Sens. Siobhan Dunnavant (Henrico) and Jennifer Kiggans (Virginia Beach) — made floor speeches. Kiggans, a former Navy helicopter pilot and the first female military veteran in the General Assembly, said that women have not needed the ERA to achieve great things, but that the measure's symbolism had value.\n\nConservative opponents say ratifying the ERA would make it harder to limit abortion and illegal to separate the sexes in bathrooms, college dormitories and school sports — assertions supporters dispute.\n\nThe so-called Equal Rights Amendment will not give women any more rights than they have today, Sen. Amanda Chase (R-Chesterfield) said on the floor Wednesday.\n\nSome ERA critics pointed to the presence of female legislators in Richmond as proof that women were able to achieve in society even without the amendment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut supporters say the amendment is a matter of guaranteeing women rights and protections.\n\nIt is our time, together, to embrace equal rights under the law for everyone, Del. Danica Roem (D-Prince William), the first openly transgender member of the Virginia legislature, said to cheers and applause before the House vote.\n\nIn the Senate, which scrapped its planned agenda to take up the matter as its first order of business, Sen. Mamie Locke (D-Hampton) said she was baffled by the controversy over timing.\n\nThere's no time limit on equal rights, she said.\n\nAbove, in the gallery, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb — a former Virginia first lady and the daughter of President Lyndon B. Johnson — sat front and center, decked out in a purple pantsuit, the trademark color of the ERA movement.\n\nAD\n\nShe also wore a purple sash displaying a half-dozen ERA pins she'd collected while supporting the cause. I wore this when I marched — I think it was 1980 or '79 — down Pennsylvania Avenue, she said.\n\nAD\n\nState Sen. Jennifer L. McClellan (D-Richmond) acknowledged the strides women have made in society and in the General Assembly, where women hold a record number of seats, committee chairmanships and other leadership posts.\n\nAnd yet, we still have a long way to go, McClellan said. I don't want to leave this fight unfinished for my daughter.\n\nAfter the Senate acted, ERA supporters celebrated in crowded Capitol hallways.\n\nThis was 100 years in the making, said Eileen Davis, a longtime Virginia ERA advocate and the mother of U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.). It's for all the women who didn't live to see this day, and all the women who barely lived to see this day.
Limbaugh took the bait. The next day on his show, he claimed that Buttigieg was mad about his comments, and said Trump had called to encourage him to never apologize for them. Now that Buttigieg had apparently lured Trump into the mix, he delivered the coup de grace at a town hall in Las Vegas on Tuesday: I mean, sorry, but one thing about my marriage is it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse with him or her.\n\nButtigieg's persona has inspired a thousand jibes and memes during his unlikely run, most of them unflattering: He's an emotionless technocrat for instance, or just plain Mayo Pete. And while he has turned himself from a small-city mayor into a serious contender for president, Buttigieg's super-composed exterior can be a disadvantage in a party primary race, where passion and relatability are appealing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut in a general election, one on one against an out-of-control bully like Trump, Buttigieg's calm and calculated approach would make him a very dangerous challenger. A contest between Buttigieg and Trump would present a clash between two distinct — and distinctly old-school — ways of projecting masculinity. It would be like a comically over-the-top WWE Hall of Famer entering the ring against a 21st-century Gary Cooper, whose secret weapon is his steely self-possession.\n\nTrump is a classic case study of what psychologists call masculine overcompensation. After future Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter called him a short-fingered vulgarian in 1988, Trump reportedly spent 25 years sending him pictures of his hands, digits circled in gold Sharpie, to prove otherwise. When Marco Rubio picked up on the theme in 2016, Trump turned the next Republican debate into a nationally televised member-measuring contest: He referred to my hands — 'If they're small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee.\n\nIt's not enough for Trump to be tall and bulky; when men get under his skin, he has to belittle them, literally, with labels like Liddle' Bob Corker, Liddle' Adam Schiff and now Mini Mike Bloomberg, who wants a box for the debates. It's not enough to control America's nuclear codes; he must boast to Kim Jong Un that his nuclear button is a much bigger & more powerful one. And when it comes to women, standard-issue misogyny is never enough. Stormy Daniels becomes a Horseface for threatening his manhood, while the hot ones, he boasts, always welcome even his crudest sexual advances.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut masculinity is always a performance; the more performative it is, the less healthy. And Buttigieg's act is just as consistent and firmly ingrained as Trump's routine, though it offers a starkly different presentation: even-keeled, carefully controlled and cerebral. Some attribute it to Midwestern stoicism, and his mother has called it a family trait. Others have chalked it up to his time poring over grocery-pricing spreadsheets for McKinsey and Co.\n\nButtigieg has told me and other reporters that he's just laid back, with a talent for compartmentalizing. But gay men like Buttigieg and me, who choose to stay in the closet well into adulthood, often develop the kind of strong, silent and non-demonstrative form of masculinity that we thought we had to adopt to survive, or to hide, or both. When you're in the closet, every moment of every day is a calculated performance — the way you walk, the way you talk, what you wear, the way you look at girls, the way you deal with boys, what you tell your parents about your day.\n\nYou can still see the effects of the closet in Buttigieg's formal bearing (not just a military trait), his difficulty really opening up into a smile (his mouth stretches into a toothy grimace, with his eyes squinted) and the invisible barrier that always seems to exist in each interaction, no matter how pleasant. It's what happens, as Michael Hobbes wrote for HuffPost, after years of constantly scanning social situations for ways we may not fit into them. And for Buttigieg, who didn't come out until age 33, that's a lot of years of unnatural self-constraint.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring my three interviews with him before he declared his presidential campaign, Buttigieg didn't care to talk much about any of that, though he joked at times about his rigid habits. His husband, Chasten, was more forthcoming. I can see how people think he has a lot of walls up, he said. Peter's still trying to come out of his shells.\n\nWhen he first gave a full accounting of his time in the closet — in a speech at a Human Rights Campaign event in Las Vegas last year — it was all about pain, until he became whole later in life. In his teens, he said of his sexuality, I would have cut it out with a knife. That chimed deeply with anyone who's been there: the welter of emotions stuffed down, through dint of constant effort and practice, because the cost of revealing them might be exposure. Coming out of the closet and finding — if you're as lucky as Buttigieg — the love of your life is massively freeing and courage-giving. But old habits of presenting yourself don't drop away overnight.\n\nNo presentation of masculinity — not Buttigieg's, and not Trump's — is a salubrious thing. It's all toxic. But there's a key difference. Trump's idea of manliness involves degrading women, threatening violence against racial and religious and sexual minorities, and using false and superficial displays of strength (Who's the loudest? Who's the meanest? Who's sleeping with the hottest women? Who's making other people look small?) to overcome self-doubt and feel big. By contrast, men who take the stoic approach, stifling their emotions and anything that smacks of stereotypical femininity, mostly harm themselves; acting like Gary Cooper can eat you up from the inside. But on a general-election stage, against Trump's primordial displays of dominance, the style that Buttigieg fashioned in the closet might serve him well, especially combined with the relative freedom he's found in the few years since. That's partly because his only real insecurity in life, it appears, has been about his queerness; intellectually, politically and morally, Buttigieg betrays almost too much self-confidence. He speaks in such perfect paragraphs that his critics think he is scripted, even when he improvises. It can sometimes come off as lofty or smarter-than-thou — but the message discipline is impressive. And Buttigieg has shown a sneaky flair for effective zingers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis past week, Buttigieg offered a taste of how he'd square off against Trump. Asked what he'd do if he became president and Trump refused to leave the White House, the ex-mayor deadpanned, I guess if he's willing to do chores, we can work something out. While Trump would have no trouble striking back at Joe Biden, with his schoolyard threats to beat the hell out of him, or Bloomberg, trying to out-billionaire him, how would his fragile manhood respond to such casual disdain from, of all things, a gay man?
Clearly, too, he has blue-chip credentials, not to say connections. One of his epithets is student of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, the German baritone whose name is synonymous with Lieder to many. He also has insouciant good looks, with a jaw so chiseled its points look sharp, and a capable voice that sounds good live and records even better. On his latest solo album, Bach, which Sony Classical brought out in the fall, that voice seemed so rich and creamy that it may have distracted some people from its many moments of carelessness — elided ornaments, unfocused pitches. In his generous program on Sunday afternoon — two full hours of music, including a set of six Schubert songs and Grieg's six German songs of Op. 48 — it was less rich but more wide-ranging, and while one might have accused him of being calculated, no one could have said he wasn't careful.\n\nFischer-Dieskau is remembered as a consummate master of control, and Appl has embraced that aspect of his art. Schubert's Erlkönig (Erl King), the Gothic ballad with which Appl opened, calls for three distinct voices as the singer characterizes a child, a father and the otherworldly specter of the title, and I was just thinking that Appl's characterizations were somewhat distant when he barked the word Gewalt (violence) with such force that listeners around me actually jumped. Still, I found that he tended to strike and hold a pose for each song, caressing the melancholy of Nachtstück (Nocturne) or slightly milking the pathos of Schumann's Wenn ich in deine Augen seh (When I Look Into Your Eyes). He was best when pulled out of himself in more dramatic moments, like Prometheus, a vivid monologue by Goethe. He was also exemplary at creating contrasts, leaping from that darkness to a spirited, crystalline reading of the lilting, rapid-fire Der Musensohn.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat won me over, though, was the second half. Muhly's cycle The Last Letter, written for Appl, four selections from a book of love letters from World War I, reinforced what a thoughtful composer Muhly can be. Rather than following expected tropes about missing a beloved, all of these letters illustrated the limits of language, or rather of people's ability to express themselves coherently in it. One, from a young wife, was a kind of breathless panting punctuated by frequent iterations of Jack — Jack — My Jack, which Muhly offered as an aggressive outpouring of pent-up feeling. Another letter requests a company commander to release the writer's husband for a night to satisfy her natural desires (Muhly emphasized the comedy with a peripatetic, flighty piano line that kept breaking off to let the voice through). The final one informs the recipient that the writer is going to marry another man and put the children in an orphanage, because POWs never get leave and she is sick of waiting for him. Muhly did not make sport of this, but depicted growing anxiety through repeated rising phrases in the piano, and then slowed down at her plaints about the rising cost of living to give respect to her own point of view. The piece concluded with a setting of Schiller from The Gods of Greece, pining for a fair, lost world; as a preamble, Appl offered Schubert's setting of the same text.\n\nThe recital would have felt complete at this point without Dichterliebe, a cycle of 16 songs that is itself one of the great classics of Lied literature. But Appl sang it with such fluidity that it seemed almost like a single piece, another testimony to frustrated and suppressed love, bursting out aggressively at unexpected moments like Im Rhein, im heiligen Strome, in which his voice grew dark as thunderclouds, or turning light and bitter for Das ist ein Flöten und Geigen, about the marriage of his beloved to someone else.
Thursday's elections will bring them head to head, but the government has unleashed a wave of intimidation and repression against the opposition party and its supporters, extinguishing any hope many had in a fair vote.\n\nKemigisha's husband, a close aide of Wine's, has spent the past two weeks locked up in a military barracks on what she says are preposterous charges of illegal possession of ammunition. Kemigisha, 28, is weeks from giving birth to their second child.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI just thank God he is alive, she said in an interview from the back seat of a car, where she felt safe talking to a journalist — another group that Uganda's military has cracked down on. She sleeps at different friends' houses most nights, fearing her own arrest. We've lost friends, colleagues. We've buried them.\n\nAt least 54 protesters were killed in November after Wine was arrested at a campaign rally, the second of three times he was arrested ahead of the election. Wine's prominence has likely protected his life, analysts said. Another opposition candidate, Patrick Oboi Amuriat, was arrested on Monday for the ninth time since declaring his candidacy — this time over a traffic law barring people from sticking their heads out of sunroofs.\n\nWine has said all 23 members of his campaign team had been arrested, and the majority were still in jail.\n\nFred Enanga, a police spokesman, declined to comment on the arrests of opposition figures, including Kemigisha's husband, but referred to a previous statement in which he justified the arrests as part of enforcement of social distancing protocols and blamed the deaths of protesters on Wine and others who seek to incite.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTaking to Twitter before the government ordered all social media to be blocked on Tuesday, Wine called the tactics the kicks of a dying horse.\n\nThe shutdown of social media came in apparent retaliation for Facebook's culling of around 100 profiles on Monday it said were fake accounts spreading pro-government misinformation ahead of the election.\n\nThis month, we removed a network of accounts and pages in Uganda that engaged in CIB (Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior) to target public debate ahead of the election, Facebook's head of communication for sub-Saharan Africa, Kezia Anim-Addo, said in an email.\n\nMuseveni's spokesman, Don Wanyama, whose Facebook and Instagram accounts were shut down, alleged a foreign plot to influence the election.\n\nAD\n\nShame on the foreign forces that think they can aid and plant a puppet leadership on Uganda by disabling online accounts of NRM supporters, he said on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nUgandan authorities say that public order and preventing the spread of the coronavirus are their utmost priorities, and they have imposed restrictions on campaigning in Kampala and almost all other Ugandan cities.\n\nBreaches of social distancing guidelines had previously been cited in Wine and Amuriat's arrests. Museveni has continued to campaign in ways that less obviously flout those rules, such as visiting the sites of development projects. His presence still attracts large crowds that are not dispersed.\n\nAD\n\nThe prospect of further violence looms over Thursday's vote, and the military was already out in a show of might on Tuesday evening.\n\nWine and other leading opposition candidates urged their supporters to stay within 100 meters of polling stations rather than return home as the electoral commission has advised. If the past weeks have been any indication, the military would likely meet such action with violent dispersal.\n\nThe terror, frankly, is unprecedented, said Kizza Besigye, a veteran opposition leader who took on Museveni in four previous elections, at a news conference. This election has witnessed untold violence. It gets worse and worse by the day.\n\nLast week, Wine filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court against Museveni and nine security officials, accusing them of incitement to murder unarmed protesters and authorizing the arrests and beatings of political figures and human rights lawyers. Wine also alleged that the Ugandan government has repeatedly tried to kill him since 2018.\n\nPast Ugandan polls have been discredited by widespread allegations of rigging. The country hasn't peacefully transferred power since independence from Britain in 1962.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMuseveni has had the constitution changed twice to legally remain in power — once to remove term limits on presidents, the other to remove age limits. His next term would be his sixth.\n\nWhile allegations of unfair tactics are already mounting, this election still feels different, opposition supporters said.\n\nYou would have to be naive to think this is a fair election. But what's different is the surge of support Bobi has from young people who've had a rough life — the people who make up the poverty and unemployment figures that we hear about our country, said Patience Akumu, a human rights lawyer. Bobi found deliverance in this life, rising to where he is. In him, they see the possibility of their own.\n\nAD\n\nKemigisha sees herself in Bobi Wine. Like him, she grew up in a slum and has spent her life scrapping by. She migrated to Oman for two years where she worked as a maid for poor pay, and when she came back, she was crushed that what little money she saved wasn't enough to change her station in life.\n\nAD\n\nThere is a chain of problems in that ghetto that girls face: underage marriage, domestic abuse and loss of self-esteem. You are constantly told that you are nothing. That is what our presidential candidate wants to change, and that is what I want to change, she said.\n\nWe respect the democratic process, but I don't expect my vote to be respected. If it is not, then we will wait for our candidate to give us a Plan B.
It's the season of short new operas at the Washington National Opera. For the seventh time, the annual American Opera Initiative this weekend presented a new one-hour work (on Friday and Sunday) and three 20-minute operas, twice each, on Saturday night. The program allows the company to commission new work without the punishing expense and risk of mounting a mainstage opera (the works were all presented in the Terrace Theater, in semi-stagings). It also lets it try out a number of different composers, such as Matt Boehler, himself a bass, who wrote 75 Miles with the librettist Laura Barati, in which a 16-year-old girl talks to her mother about her pregnancy (the nearest women's health center, where she could get an abortion, is 75 miles away).\n\nThe showcase is the one-hour opera, for which WNO invites more-experienced composers including, last year, Missy Mazzoli, whose Proving Up went quickly on to other productions, and who was named, a few months later, composer-in-residence of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. This year's offering, Taking Up Serpents, was written by Kamala Sankaram, another composer whose work has been seen around the country. Her intriguing, offbeat handling of the instruments in the pit, including whirly tubes creating a synthetic hum, was the strongest thing about her piece — and set the tone in a program in which all four works showed more assurance and interest in their orchestrations than in their vocal writing, which tended to be flaccid.\n\nTaking Up Serpents is about the daughter of a Pentecostal snake-handling preacher dying of a snakebite. Having tried to free herself from her unbalanced and strong-willed father, the girl returns home to see him on his deathbed and finally break free of his influence. I am whole! Just as I am! she cries, repeatedly, at the end, as her father dies, while her younger self, who had always been terrified of snakes, triumphantly thrusts her hand into one of their cages.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYes, it was confusing in the house, too; and yes, it demonstrates one risk of these short-format works: they become especially subject to cliche. Opera companies put huge emphasis on the libretto when developing new work these days, but Jerre Dye's text for this work, though supposedly reinforced by the fact that Dye actually grew up in a Pentecostal church, was generic and heavy-handed. The opera begins with a beautiful musical evocation of moths under a parking-lot light, drawn in little figures from the flute. But then the heroine, Kayla, bursts into an aria about circling moths drawn to the flame that tells us nothing specific about her as a character, nor offers any idea that hasn't been uttered many times before. (Her opening line, This parking lot's a graveyard, follows the cadence of Ain't it a pretty night from Carlisle Floyd's Susannah, a clear antecedent to this work in that it's another opera set in a religious community in rural America.)\n\nPart of the reason for cliche, I think, is the pervasive notion that opera singing is supposed to be, always, a cry from the heart. Figuring out how to integrate the singing into theater in the 21st century is admittedly a challenge. I've always held that opera is the ideal art form for adolescents, because you spend all your time yelling about love and anger at the top of your lungs, but somehow a ponderousness seems to creep in, all too often, to new work. The mezzo-soprano Eliza Bonet did a compelling job as Kayla's mother, frustrated in marriage and harrowed after days of watching her husband suffer from the snakebite, finally taking him to the hospital against his will, and then smothering him with a pillow to release him. Timothy J. Bruno was also strong as the father, a defiant and troubled rebel who has a conversion moment in a parking lot when Kayla is 10. And Alexandria Shiner did what she could with the somewhat generic role of Kayla, rebelling against her parents and trying to figure out who she is, singing in a high, light soprano. None of this is especially new ground. The most interesting parts were Sankaram's atmospheric orchestrations, brought out by Lidiya Yankovskaya in the pit.\n\nThe same generic quality afflicted some of the short works, notably Relapse, in which Molly Joyce's capable music couldn't turn the story of a young woman who's overdosed on drugs and wakes up in the hospital into much more than the plot summary indicates. Boehler, in 75 Miles, clearly drew on his own operatic past in sweeping tonal phrases that were pretty enough but didn't add anything specific, for all of the effort put in by the cast, including Joshua Conyers as a sympathetic, slightly clueless father with a warm voice.\n\nAD\n\nAD
But the partial government shutdown has deepened the lull.\n\nBusiness owners, taxi drivers and others who rely on foot traffic have watched revenue slump as parts of the government ground to a halt. Should the shutdown persist for months or even years, as President Trump said it could Friday, its effect on the District will only worsen.\n\nAD\n\nThis isn't the District's first go-round with a government shutdown, though it's already one of the longest.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2013, the federal government suspended operations for 16 days as Congress sparred over the Affordable Care Act. The longest shutdown was in 1995. It lasted three weeks.\n\nPrevious standoffs have taught business owners and tour guides how to adapt.\n\nSix years ago it was like, 'Oh my God, the city's shut down. We're going to have to cancel our trip.' But now, we've all been here before and people are realizing a lot of what D.C. has to offer has nothing to do with the federal government, said Elliott Ferguson, president of Destination DC, the city's tourism arm. They've realized a government shutdown doesn't mean we've put a padlock on New York Avenue.\n\nHotels are seeing fewer cancellations than in past shutdowns, Ferguson said, and fewer tour groups have called Destination DC in a panic. Two conventions scheduled this month are expected to bring about 27,000 people and $33 million to the city.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRight now, we're all hoping that this will end soon, Ferguson said. But in the meantime, we want everyone to know D.C. is open for business.\n\nGetting that message out has been a challenge for small businesses, especially those near closed attractions.\n\nYael Krigman, owner of Baked By Yael, a bakery across from the National Zoo, said she's leaned more heavily on catering and cake pop parties in lieu of the usual zoo-goer foot traffic.\n\nIt hasn't been easy.\n\nIt's not as though January was going to be our best season anyway, but that's why we really rely on the zoo even more than in other months, because people aren't sending gifts and throwing parties as much as they do in December or February, Krigman said. But people still go to the zoo — when it's open.\n\nAD\n\nPrivate museums have worked with tour guides to fill gaps in tourists' schedules left by shuttered public attractions. The Newseum and Madame Tussauds wax museum are offering free admission for furloughed federal workers.\n\nDuring shutdowns, we always see an increase — especially of tour groups who are trying to change their itineraries at the last minute, said Sonya Gavankar, director of public relations for the Newseum.\n\nThe National Geographic museum isn't fully operational, with two rotating exhibits closed for construction, but spokeswoman Lexie de los Santos said the museum also has seen a significant increase in the number of people visiting.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, museum officials and city leaders say no one wants to see the shutdown persist.\n\nDuring a shutdown, there are no winners and our nation's federal workers, including the 170,000 federal employees who work in Washington, DC, pay the highest price, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser wrote in a letter to Trump last week.\n\nDawit Kassa, 41, a full-time Lyft driver from Arlington who works primarily in downtown Washington, said his earnings have been halved since the shutdown began.\n\nDuring periods that would normally be busy, Kassa has sat idle up to 40 minutes between calls. Usually, he said, he has another ride lined up by the time he's dropping a customer off.\n\nAD\n\nIt's so slow, he said. And it's not just me. You know, drivers talk. We call each other. I have friends who drive taxis and Uber and we all call each other to ask, 'Hey, do you have a ride?' Everyone who works out here on the street is suffering.\n\nAD\n\nUnemployment claims in the District since the shutdown began exceeded 1,200 as of Friday, which marked a full pay period for unpaid federal workers.\n\nClaims typically spike during shutdowns because federal workers are not guaranteed back pay and government contractors lose their source of income.\n\nDuring the 16-day shutdown in 2013, the city processed about 5,000 unemployment claims. District officials expect to meet or exceed that number, depending on how long the present shutdown lasts. About 800,000 workers around the country are affected, with about a quarter of the federal government shuttered.\n\nAD\n\nAs the sun set Friday, a smattering of tourists posed for pictures on the Mall outside wrought iron fences.\n\nMinwa and Khafe Oshingbemi, a married couple from Nigeria, took turns taking photos that appeared to show each being pricked by the top of the Washington Monument. It was their first time in Washington.\n\nAD\n\nWhat are we going to do? Minwa Oshingbemi said with a shrug. We're here now.\n\nA few feet away, a tour guide on a Segway rolled past, trailed by a line of visitors.\n\nUsually, this is just overflowing with people, he said. Not today.
Peppering her impassioned arguments with saucy humor, she fashioned herself a grande dame of what is often dubbed the world's oldest profession and became an irresistible subject for the local, national and international media in her heyday.\n\nAD\n\nIt's a service which is demanded by society, she told Canada's Globe and Mail in 1980, referring to prostitution. We have to accept the viability of sexual service as a means of work — it's just like someone doing your nails, doing your hair, or giving you an enema in the hospital.\n\nMs. St. James, who once ran for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on the slogan The Lady Is a . . . Champ, died Jan. 11 at a nursing home in Bellingham, Wash. She was 83 and had complications from dementia, said her sister, Claudette Sterk.\n\nAD\n\nMs. St. James was known in San Francisco as the convener of the Hookers' Ball, a COYOTE fundraiser that for years was one of the city's most colorful political events. At its height, in 1978, it attracted 20,000 guests, including a sizable contingent of politicians.\n\nAD\n\nIn any other city in America, the photo opportunities alone would ruin a political career, a Washington Post reporter wrote in 1996, describing that year's attendees as clad in attire largely constructed of leather thongs and neoprene, with lots of cutouts.\n\nBut not in San Francisco, the dispatch continued, a city that revels in its tolerance of lifestyles and activities that would be scandalous elsewhere.\n\nMs. St. James had moved to the city in the late 1950s from Washington state, where she was born Margaret Jean St. James in Bellingham on Sept. 12, 1937. She grew up on her father's dairy farm and was married around the time of her high school graduation to an older classmate, Don Sobjack. Shortly thereafter, their son, Don Sobjack Jr., was born.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI knew that was a mistake, Ms. St. James told the Guardian in 1986, reflecting on her sudden entry into parenthood. I knew I would be a bad mother.\n\nNurturing ambitions to become an artist, she settled in San Francisco, leaving her husband and son behind. She said she did not engage in prostitution until after she was arrested on false accusations of having done so.\n\nPolice had become suspicious of the volume of people going to and from her home, and she conceded to the Windy City Times of Chicago in 2011 that a lot of friends came over to my house after work, and there was a lot of pot-smoking and sex.\n\nBut your Honor, she recalled telling the judge in her case, I've never turned a trick in my life. His reply, she said, was that anyone who knows the language is obviously a professional.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMs. St. James said she enrolled in law school in part to appeal her conviction, which was ultimately overturned. By her account, she began taking money for sex to pay her tuition. She did not complete law school and said that at various points she earned income by working as a process server, private detective, car parker, restaurant hostess and deckhand on a dinner-cruise boat.\n\nAlthough her tactics at times seemed high on entertainment value — she once made her entrance at the Hookers' Ball astride an elephant — her mission was deeply serious, part of a broader movement to gain greater health services, legal rights and financial security for sex workers.\n\nWe are trying to funnel sex workers into the mainstream, she told the Globe and Mail. We've got to demystify it. We've got to accept them as human beings.\n\nIn addition to founding COYOTE, Ms. St. James established the St. James Infirmary, a clinic that serves sex workers in San Francisco. In the 1980s, she moved to Europe with Gail Pheterson, a fellow activist and author of the volume A Vindication of the Rights of Whores. There Ms. St. James helped organize international conferences of sex workers in Amsterdam in 1985 and in Brussels the following year, producing a World Charter for Prostitutes' Rights.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMs. St. James later returned to the United States, making her bid for elective office in San Francisco in 1996. (She was said to have sought the Republican nomination for president in 1980, but the extent of her efforts were unclear.)\n\nClaiming to have the support of the bohemians, the old hippies, the gays, as well as the veterans and the longshoremen and the politicians, she promised to install a red light outside her office, to be turned on when she was present in City Hall.\n\nHer experience in politics, she argued, was greater than many voters realized.\n\nI'm perceived as an outsider, but I've really been on the inside all these years — sitting on their laps in the smoke-filled rooms, she said on CBS at the time. So now I want to come in the front door and I want a place at the table.\n\nAD\n\nMs. St. James won endorsements from Mayor Willie Brown and poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, among others, but in a race for one of six seats, she came in seventh place.\n\nAD\n\nIn the later years of her life, she returned to Washington state, where she lived with her second husband, Paul Avery, a California crime reporter who had covered cases including the serial murders of the Zodiac Killer and the kidnapping of heiress Patty Hearst by the Symbionese Liberation Army in 1974. He died in 2000.\n\nBesides her sister, Ms. St. James's survivors include her son, Don Sobjack of Custer, Wash.; a brother; a half brother; three grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.\n\nMs. St. James was a unionist to the core. Once, a newspaper reported that she had been a madam, and she agitated for a retraction, according to The Washington Post.\n\nI was never management, she declared.
Bezos has been an ardent defender of gay rights for years. He and his wife, MacKenzie, donated $2.5 million in support of same-sex marriage in Washington state in 2012, and he received a national equality award last year from the Human Rights Campaign, a prominent LGBT advocacy group.\n\nNow Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, is being asked to put the enormous economic power of his company behind the effort. Amazon plans to hire up to 50,000 people in another city and has narrowed the field to 20 locations. Eleven of the locations are in nine states — Florida, Georgia, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia — that have not passed comprehensive legal protections for people based on their sexuality or gender. Some additionally restrict adoption rights for gay couples, bar transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice or have banned cities from instituting equal rights protections of their own.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPlacing HQ2 in one of these states would not only be morally wrong, but also inconsistent with your stated values. We are asking you to only consider states that would protect your LGBTQ workers, their families, and your customers, the group writes in the letter, a draft of which was obtained by The Post.\n\nThe letter is part of a new campaign called No Gay No Way aimed at leveraging Amazon's high-profile search to press state and local officials for better protections. The group has already chartered a plane to fly a banner with its message over the technology giant's headquarters in Seattle, and it has taken out advertisements in the nine states.\n\nSupporters of many of the rules opposed by equal rights advocates say they are aimed not at discrimination but at protecting a Christian way of life. When the Georgia Senate last week passed a bill that would allow state-backed adoption agencies to refuse assistance to same-sex couples, its sponsor, state Sen. William Ligon (R), told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that just because you are a faith-based organization doesn't mean you have to check your faith at the door and cannot participate in government programs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe mayors of some of the targeted cities have spoken out, saying their communities are diverse, inclusive places that should not be punished for state-level actions. And some LGBT activists have argued that putting 50,000 Amazon workers in a politically red state might bring change there. Corporate heavyweights in North Carolina, Indiana and Georgia have had some success beating back legislation that LGBT advocates view as discriminatory.\n\nGiven their values on LGBTQ policies, it would be good to have them in the state, as a force for good, as part of that growing ally base, said Austin Mayor Steve Adler in a January interview after his city was named a finalist.\n\nBezos won the equality award for his long-standing personal commitment to building a more equal society and shining a spotlight on the challenges LGBTQ people face in their daily lives, Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a statement. Speaking at the group's Washington gala in October, Bezos expressed strong support for equality. I believe that the ideal of equality is ingrained deeply within all of us. It is inalienable, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose beliefs are palpable at the company's Seattle headquarters. Last June, the company flew a rainbow flag above its headquarters for LGBT Pride Month. It has more than 40 GLAmazon chapters for LGBT affinity around the world.\n\nBut whether that ethos extends to the decision about Amazon's second headquarters is unknown. In its search requirements, Amazon lists the presence and support of a diverse population. Company officials have declined to expand on the meaning of that, but Anthony Little, president of GLAmazon, issued a statement saying that diversity and equality are ingrained in the leadership principles of the company.\n\nI am very proud of the support Amazon has provided to the LGBTQ community, both with internal policies like the expansion of transition health benefits to fully cover transition surgeries for transgender employees and with external support of policies like our fight against the bathroom bill in Washington State that targeted transgender residents, he said. Ultimately, I think Amazon wants us to do what is right for LGBTQ employees.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdvocates behind the letter, among them actors Alan Cumming and Omar Sharif Jr., former Democratic Pennsylvania congressman Peter H. Kostmayer and former New York City mayoral candidate Christine Quinn, say that doing the best for its employees can't include putting 50,000 of them in any of 11 final locations: Atlanta; Austin; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas; Indianapolis; Miami; Nashville; Northern Virginia; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; or Raleigh, N.C.\n\nConor Gaughan, manager of the No Gay No Way campaign, said the search for a second headquarters — the biggest economic development prize in decades — is so consequential that it could become a model for other companies' choices.\n\nIt sends a bigger signal to states across the country that lack protections, that the biggest companies, the most innovative companies, aren't coming to your state unless you fix this, he said.
Sugar launched Steven Universe, the main series that spawned Future, in the fall of 2013. While making the coming-of-age fantasy/sci-fi show about gem-powered superheroes, she and her team sought to express themselves honestly, even as that came to mean challenging her network's history of not overtly depicting same-sex marriage.\n\nLong before Steven Universe's Emmy nominations and a Peabody Award, the animator didn't think her bisexual journey was relevant because I had been so isolated from anyone who would understand her experience. She says there wasn't fodder on kids' television to bond over, while growing up in her Silver Spring, Md., neighborhood before attending New York's School of Visual Arts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe animation connections she made at SVA led her to Hollywood, where she landed work as an artist and songwriter on the Cartoon Network hit Adventure Time. She became a creative standout on that series partly for her ukelele-strumming tunes that soundtracked a same-sex attraction between a vampire queen (Marceline) and a princess (Bubblegum).\n\nThose songs caught the attention of Rob Sorcher, chief content officer at Cartoon Network, who considers Sugar an animation genius. Steven Universe launched several years later, making her the first woman to be a solo show creator in the network's history.\n\nThe main series, which concluded last year, centered on three Earth-guarding superheroes — Amethyst, Garnet and Pearl — who guided the sweet and buoyant half-human boy Steven, who was gradually growing into his powers. The title character was based on the showrunner's own brother, Steven Sugar, an artist on the show, and the creator says the three heroic female-coded non-binary aliens were based on facets of herself as she sought to be a role model to him as his elder sibling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSteven Universe was set in fictitious Beach City, partly inspired by the Delaware shores that the Sugar siblings visited as kids. But it was real-life events that occurred in Rebecca Sugar's 20s that especially affected the trajectory of the series.\n\nTwo years into the show's run, Sugar pitched the idea of marrying two characters named Ruby and Sapphire — who fuse to form Garnet — but she encountered network resistance. In 2016, though, Sugar's significant other, Ian Jones-Quartey (creator of the Cartoon Network show OK K.O.! and a Steven Universe writer-supervising director), proposed, spurring her urgency to do a same-sex wedding episode. I refused to wait any longer. If we can get married, then these characters can get married, says Sugar, adding that she could not wait for things to get better or easier.\n\nOn Adventure Time years earlier, Sugar had been excited to write Marceline, who long pined for Princess Bubblegum. (They eventually got together.) Yet at that time, Sugar also understood how the industry operated: Most children's network animation had dealt with same-sex couplings only in coded ways, she says, so any allusion to a gay relationship had to fly under the radar.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSugar's sense of the business was partly formed by what she saw during her senior year in high school, when a cultural controversy erupted in 2005 over PBS's partly animated Arthur spinoff Postcards From Buster. An episode titled Sugartime! showed real-life Vermont families, including two lesbian couples. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings decried the episode as inappropriate for children's programming and a misuse of public funding — a denouncement that Sugar calls absurd.\n\nI was carrying that with me, Sugar says, as I was entering this field and trying to figure out how to navigate that.\n\nBy the time she was an experienced showrunner on Steven Universe, she had a front seat to the ideas that I had been fed indirectly as a child. It felt like I had all this radiation from a distance, and now I was right up close to the sun.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Cartoon Network would flag dialogue or moments for removal, it would often be the most down-to-earth simple interactions, she says. Not so much the fantasy aspects, but just Ruby and Sapphire saying a kind word to one other or wanting to be close to one another.\n\nSorcher says that when making content decisions, Cartoon Network had to factor in that Steven Universe was airing in nearly 200 countries, including some culturally conservative markets.\n\nOn a personal level, as a gay executive, I was taking extra pains to be sure that inside my company, I'm being completely neutral — really listening to all the business issues going on around the world, Sorcher says. And that there's not the optics of me coming in with an 'agenda' to drive through the content.\n\nAD\n\nSo when Sugar pitched the same-sex ceremony, she had to convince the network that it was organic to the show's evolution. The wedding arc, a double episode titled Reunited, aired in 2018, marking a shift in network policy that rippled across its other shows. After that, Sorcher says, It just became the policy for Cartoon Network to treat gay relationships like heterosexual couplings.\n\nAD\n\nThat episode reflects just one issue that Sorcher believes resonated with a devoted audience across Steven Universe, plus Steven Universe Future (in which Steve is a 16-year-old coping with ongoing changes in his powers) and last September's Steven Universe: The Movie, which drew more than 1.5 million viewers in its original telecast.\n\nSugar dealt with what were perceived to be very difficult themes around youth television: mental health, issues of gender orientation, sexual orientation, trauma, Sorcher says. And I think that she handled all of those issues with a grace and an elegance that made all the difference.\n\nAD\n\nSugar says that during the run of Steven Universe, she also began seeing a therapist who helped her understand the lasting emotional and physical effects of an assault she had endured in her early 20s — insights into her own anxiety that she says informed the latter half of the show.\n\nAD\n\nResponse to trauma became a recurring theme not because Sugar wanted Steven Universe to be a didactic cartoon, she says, but because I really wanted it to be an expression of us as artists.\n\nSuch expression kept young fans engaged, as they looked up to Sugar. To have people respond to these little details in the show and relate to it and find me and say: 'I've never seen that before,'  she says, it was so moving to realize that there are so many of us out there.\n\nI've been moved to tears at so many [fan] cons by kids who are there with parents, Sugar says of families who have bonded over her show's representation of marginalized groups. That's something that so many people have been denied for so, so long.
Gandini is the creator, the director and one of the performers of 4×4: Ephemeral Architectures, a mesmerizing clockwork of human bodies and juggling objects flying through space that lands at Strathmore on Sunday.\n\nCollisions during performances are rare, says Gandini, a world-\n\nrenowned juggler, but in the months of rehearsals that took place before the piece's London premiere in 2015, there were plenty of unintentional ballerina clubbings.\n\nAD\n\nThe juggling props are pretty light, so it doesn't really hurt if you get hit by them, especially when compared to the pain of wearing pointe shoes, says Emma Lister, the show's artistic coordinator and one of the dancers who will perform in D.C.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the touring group arrives at a new venue, the first thing the performers do is mark the stage with 60 pieces of colored tape. That's about twice as many marks as other performances Lister has worked on, and getting the measurements exactly right is crucial.\n\nThere's a precise geometry to this show, Lister says. Every finger and every foot has to be in the exact right spot. Even the spotlights have to hit their marks exactly.\n\nAD\n\nThere are no sets for the show. Instead, juggling props and dancers' limbs create a cathedral's worth of graceful arcs.\n\nI called the show 'Ephemeral Architectures' because it's what I think dancers and jugglers have in common — we are both creating traces in the air, traces that only last for an instant, and then they are gone, Gandini says. The '4×4' part is because there are four ballet dancers and four jugglers.\n\nAD\n\nThere are also five musicians playing Suspended opus 69, a modern classical piece composed for the performance by Nimrod Borenstein.\n\nDespite the challenges, the performers of 4×4 have dropped only a few balls in hundreds of performances, Lister says. Additionally, all of the dancers have picked up some juggling skills, and the jugglers have gotten into ballet.\n\nAD\n\nA lot of people can't tell the dancers and the jugglers apart, she says.\n\nThe marriage of juggling and ballet in 4×4: Ephemeral Architectures has been so successful, it resulted in one actual marriage. Six months ago, artistic coordinator Emma Lister tied the knot with juggler Sakari Mannisto. The two are now working on a new show together that combines their art forms.\n\nBeing married to a juggler has practical advantages as well as creative ones, Lister says.\n\nIf I'm on the other side of the room and I want to toss him the car keys, I can make any kind of wild throw and he'll catch it, she says. On a day-to-day basis, it can be quite handy.
Burnt Sugar is a work of extraordinary insight, courage and sophistication. It is also the world's worst Mother's Day present.\n\nI would be lying if I said my mother's misery has never given me pleasure, the narrator begins. The sympathy she elicits in others gives rise to something acrid in me. This is a family tragedy laced with equal parts wit and strychnine.\n\nIt's not that Doshi has written something no one has ever thought before; it's that she's written something no one has ever expressed so exquisitely — and so baldly.\n\nThe narrator is an Indian artist named Antara, whose mother is presenting symptoms of Alzheimer's. The doctors offer only a dose of vague hope; there is no concrete diagnosis and certainly no cure. Hovering in the dusk of competency, Antara's mother still manages to live alone, but increasingly she wanders, forgets where she is and what she's doing. As her only child, Antara embraces the responsibility of caring for her with a determination threaded with resentment and even bouts of suspicion.\n\nIt seems to me now that this forgetting is convenient, that she doesn't want to remember the things she has said and done, Antara tells us. It feels unfair that she can put away the past from her mind while I'm brimming with it all the time. I fill papers, drawers, entire rooms with records, notes, thoughts, while she grows foggier with each passing day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis situation, difficult under the best circumstances, is rendered excruciating by the tense nature of Antara's relationship with her parents. In the narrative that unfolds through gentle shifts between present to past, we learn of the early collapse of their respectable family. Ma always ran from anything that felt like oppression, Antara says. Marriage, diets, medical diagnoses. Antara was born in an ashram, where her mother served, for a time, as the leader's consort. That disorienting period of neglect and even more perilous ordeals later have left Antara craving her mother's attention while hating her. Such is the unbearable situation created in a culture quick to judge, to expel and especially to circumscribe the lives of women.\n\nThere's no doubt that Antara's mother can be unspeakably cruel. I always knew having you would ruin my life, she says one day, but Antara's willingness to accept those blows and remain devoted to her mother is motivated by an amalgam of adoration and rancor. I love her to death, she says ominously. I understood how deeply connected we were, and how her destruction would irrevocably lead to my own. That connection — beyond all reason and affection — leads Antara to imagine, Together, we will find redemption.\n\nDoshi, who was born in New Jersey and now lives in Dubai, pursues this psychological dependency to depths few writers would be brave enough to fathom. The artistic narrator she has imagined suffers — or benefits — from sensory sensitivity as acute as her emotional sensitivity. Antara's obsessive attention leads her to maintain a vast flowchart of her mother's bodily functions, which both repulse and fascinate her, which was my reaction, too. This is a novel stained with all manner of fluids, excretions and smells, and the narrator fights an almost constant sense of nausea. But if Burnt Sugar is often as unpleasant as a sinus infection, it's just as hard to shake off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBetween intimate confessions about her mother and their past, the story explores Antara's perfunctory marriage to a polite man who's basically starving her with pleasantness. He says, Antara notes, it must be tiring to be me. It is, but that weariness is exacerbated by her husband's sterile equilibrium. His interest in her troubles with her mother extends no further than offering irritatingly bland observations. Being around her is very stressful for you, he says. To be honest, I wonder if you'll make her worse or better. He's horrid, except that he's nice and willing to stay yoked to this woman bristling with anxieties, loathings and yearnings.\n\nAntara's effort to recover lost memories and squandered affections develops into a multilayered, wholly consuming act of reclamation. It's a struggle that runs parallel with her work as an artist. Antara's most significant production is an endless series of portraits of the same face sketched hastily, day after day, month after month, a record of emotional dedication and visual drift. It's yet another demonstration of Doshi's skill that this work of art functions so evocatively both as a symbol in the novel and a linchpin to its disturbing plot.\n\nThe new title is so much more effective than Girl in White Cotton. Burnt Sugar perfectly captures this story's complex flavor, the taste of something sweet transformed into something deep and melancholy. I don't mean to scare you away; only to make sure you know what you're getting into. This is, among other things, a challenging interrogation of the presumption that a book's protagonist should be likable. Where can our sympathies find purchase with this woman who is devoted to her mother and yet filled with rage toward her? Our simultaneous revulsion and attraction stems, I suspect, from the nagging suspicion that Antara is dragging us toward a species of candor that's terrifying.\n\nRon Charles writes about books for The Washington Post and hosts TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.\n\nBurnt Sugar\n\nBy Avni Doshi
You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free, he said at the time. And so it's just passe at this juncture.\n\nThat's not the case anymore, apparently.\n\nOn Monday, a year after publishing its first nudity-free issue, Playboy announced it would once again run pictures of naked women. Chief creative officer Cooper Hefner, the 25-year-old son of founder Hugh Hefner, said the magazine never should have banned nudity.\n\nAD\n\nThe March/April issue of the magazine will feature photos of Playmate Elizabeth Elam on a cover that says Naked is normal, an interview with Scarlett Johansson, a profile of CNN political commentator Van Jones and a piece on the hip-hop outfit Run the Jewels.\n\nAD\n\nI'll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated, but removing it entirely was a mistake, the younger Hefner wrote on Twitter. Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn't a problem. Today we're taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are.\n\nPlayboy's first issue without nude photos came out in February 2016, ending a more than six-decade run of glossy centerfolds featuring young women baring it all. The magazine still featured sexy, seductive pictorials of the world's most beautiful women, including its iconic Playmates, as Playboy put it at the time. Generally speaking, the goal was to attract a younger demographic of readers and more mainstream advertisers.\n\nAD\n\nThe move was met with a mix of ridicule and confusion.\n\nOld Playboy was a lifestyle bible, BuzzFeed culture writer Anne Helen Petersen jabbed. Current Playboy is a caricature of itself.\n\nAD\n\nBringing back nudity may not solve all the magazine's problems, Samir Husni, a journalism professor at the University of Mississippi, told the Associated Press on Monday.\n\nThe people who grew up with Playboy magazine are starting to fade away, Husni said, so they will have to figure out what the millennial generation wants in the 21st century if they are going to survive.\n\nIn a post on the Playboy website, Hefner outlined a new Playboy philosophy, in which he suggested that the decision to embrace nudity again was partly rooted in the country's political and cultural climate. He ticked off a list of collective accomplishments from the past few years: the election of the first mixed-race president (his term), a Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization in some places, the nomination of a woman by a major political party.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut after so much progress, Hefner wrote, our hard-won victories are in peril. Just as the social and political pendulum had swung in liberals' favor, as history has shown time after time, the pendulum swings back.\n\nThe current climate, Hefner said, is out of step with Playboy's tradition of tenaciously advocating for civil liberties and freedom of expression.\n\nOne thing is clear that both my dad and I understand at its simplest form, and that is what Playboy and the United States strive to represent in their greatest forms: freedom, Hefner wrote.\n\nPlayboy promoted the change on social media with the hashtag #NakedIsNormal.
And while the Internet has been teeming with My Corona, I Want to Wash My Hands, etc., the Loser Community still has a lot to work with out there.\n\nThis week: Write a song about Life in the Age of Corona, set to a familiar tune (or even one of your own, if you perform it on video). It can be about the virus itself, about living in isolation, about our leaders. The humor can be pointed but not so bitterly angry that its wit is crushed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you make a video, we might feature it in the online Invite, but it's the quality of the lyrics that matters most. If you do, send us a YouTube link that the Empress could share in the results.\n\nBut please: We are in the midst of a horrifying pandemic, overflowing with both tragedy and fear. And anger. And helplessness. And depression. I strongly believe, with evidence I see every day on social media and simply among friends, that humor helps us face our situation, helps bring a smile, if a wistful one. But for heaven's sake: It's emphatically not the time for sick humor, for anything making light of the power of this virus and the toll it has taken on our fellow human beings.\n\nWe're out to make you (and your fellow readers) smile, even if wistfully.

From what I've witnessed and heard at work, the husband is cheating again. I want to tell the wife, but it's not my place. I'm p----- as hell at the husband, especially since I championed his cause previously. I feel responsible to the wife for my previous encouragement to stay and work things out.\n\nI am not sure what if anything I can do.\n\nAD\n\n— Friend\n\nFriend: You can learn from hard experience.\n\nAD\n\nYou got too involved last time. You obviously meant well and care deeply for this couple — but you also took a firm position on what the wife needed based on your own experience, instead of listening to her and letting her needs and circumstances determine the best course of action for her. You had your thumb on the scale.\n\nYou recognize that now — which is good, and important.\n\nSo apply it. You have not been forced into the middle here — you don't have direct knowledge of the husband's actions and no one has asked your opinion — so stay right where you are: out of it.\n\nIf he's cheating, if the wife finds out, and if she asks what you know, then you tell the truth — that you had your suspicions but none founded enough to speak up, and would not risk her marriage or anyone's on a hunch.\n\nAD\n\nThings get acutely difficult if you ever do acquire that direct knowledge, because that puts two important realities — that withholding information from friends about their lives makes you a liar of omission, and that other people's marriages are none of your business — in direct conflict.\n\nAD\n\nWhen that happens, your only viable option is to try to anticipate what your friend would want. As I said — so difficult. One person's idea of friendship is to have friends who get involved, and another's is to have friends who know not to.\n\nBut if that happens, this is a riddle old enough to have an established set of line-walking steps: 1. Tell the husband what you know and why you're furious at him for it; 2. Tell him he has [a window of time] to fix this himself before you act for him; 3. If he fails, then tell the wife she needs to talk to her husband. Your goal is for him to be the messenger.\n\nAD\n\nMy favorite step: 4. Hope fiercely that your friends don't project their beefs with each other onto you, since you're so very conveniently placed for that. And much easier to resent than each other.\n\nRunner-up: 5. Give your friendship with the husband a hard look. We are all works in progress, but if he's doing what you think he's doing, then he's also opting not to progress.
Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) also announced she was introducing legislation to give the city authority to grant unemployment benefits to essential employees who must show up to work without pay, such as TSA airport screeners and special police. The U.S. Labor Department denied her request to authorize such benefits last week.\n\nAD\n\nThey are deemed essential, they are required to go to work, and they are not getting paid, she said at a news conference at a warehouse for the Capital Area Food Bank, one of the charities ramping up services during the shutdown. They provide some of the most vital services for us.\n\nBowser said she had no estimate for how much expanding unemployment would cost the city but said thousands could benefit. Separately, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) sought assurances from federal officials Tuesday that his state would not face consequences if it grants unemployment benefits to essential workers.\n\nAD\n\nThe shutdown has prompted Washington-area officials to throw lifelines to constituents in need. With hundreds of thousands of federal workers unpaid, many of them living in the District, Maryland or Virginia, local politicians are trying to ramp up pressure on the White House and Congress to end the impasse over immigration spending that has halted the operations of much of the federal government.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) on Tuesday joined Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and a raft of other Democratic politicians in volunteering for Washington celebrity chef José Andrés's free-meal event downtown. Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, both Democrats from Maryland, are scheduled to do the same Wednesday.\n\nKaine, in rolled-up shirt sleeves and latex gloves, doled out as many hugs and selfies as he did rosemary chicken sandwiches and braised lentil bowls when furloughed workers from NASA, the FBI, the National Park Service and other agencies showed up for the lunch rush. Volunteers wore black T-shirts with #ChefsForFeds on the back.\n\nAD\n\nIt boggles the mind, Kaine told reporters. It's a humanitarian disaster. It's different than a hurricane, it's different than a wildfire, it's different than a tsunami — because it's man-made and it's completely unnecessary.\n\nSen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) plans to visit Port City Brewing Co. in Alexandria on Wednesday to talk to the owner about how the shutdown is hurting craft brewers because new labels can't be approved.\n\nAD\n\nBowser will join mayors from across the country that day to demand an end to the shutdown as part of the opening news conference for the U.S. Conference of Mayors' Winter Meeting.\n\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the District's nonvoting U.S. representative, will host an emergency town hall Thursday night to hear stories of workers and business owners hurt by what she calls the Trump shutdown.\n\nAD\n\nA Tuesday report by the D.C. chief financial officer estimated the city is losing about $10 million a week in revenue as a result of the shutdown, not including increased spending on social services. City officials warned that the shutdown may require budget cuts if it does not end soon.\n\nAD\n\nIn the meantime, D.C. lawmakers are working to mitigate the impact of the government closure. The bill passed Tuesday would require judges to halt eviction or foreclosure proceedings if residents can prove that they have been furloughed or made to work without pay.\n\nA possible sudden onslaught of additional homeless District residents will create a severe hardship for the federal workers and will also greatly impact the District's homeless services system, said council member Anita Bonds (D-At Large), who wrote the bill.\n\nAD\n\nShe originally crafted the legislation to prohibit lenders and landlords from cracking down on tenants who miss payments during the shutdown, but she softened the language amid legal concerns.\n\nAD\n\nThe legislation would take effect immediately for 90 days if Bowser signs it. The mayor said she needs to review the bill but supports the idea in principle.\n\nIn Virginia, state Sen. Jeremy S. McPike (D-Prince William) has proposed legislation to place ­30-day stays on foreclosures and evictions on workers who miss payments because of the shutdown. His emergency bill would need to pass both chambers of the state legislature by two-thirds margins.\n\nOn Tuesday, Montgomery County Council President Nancy Navarro sent a letter to President Trump, Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on behalf of the all-Democratic nine-member body, saying that the shutdown is having a dramatically negative fiscal impact on Maryland and Montgomery County and urging them to end this stalemate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNavarro (D-District 4) said that local government resources were being used to help federal workers who aren't receiving paychecks and that the ripple effect has caused restaurants and other small businesses to suffer as affected workers curtail their spending.\n\nEven when the shutdown ends, the damage to our local economy is irreparable, Navarro wrote.
Once you hear, you can't forget, says Matt Crossett, who first discovered the sport a few years back. Adrenaline. Hoofs pounding. Cowboy screams.\n\nPerhaps the coolest and most curious winter sport takes place halfway around the world from PyeongChang, South Korea. It's called skijoring and is largely rooted in small communities around the Rocky Mountains. The sport involves a ski racer clinging to a rope as he's being towed by a racing horse. The rider in the saddle guides the team through an obstacle course, racing the clock as they weave around cones, grab rings and navigate the skier over jumps. It's a spectacle, an unlikely marriage of skiers and cowboys, and the skijoring events often feel like a winter carnival with drinking, family activities and the occasional side bet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile there's a Nordic version of the sport that involves being pulled by dogs, the Western version involves horses and organizers say it's growing in popularity. This year, Ski Joring America, a governing body for the sport, helped stage events in Montana, Colorado, Idaho, Utah and Wisconsin — and every year they're adding more participants and more events.\n\nIt's not just skiing, and it's not just horses, said Ebbie Hansen, one of the sport's top riders. It's being pulled by a horse at 35 mph and having to navigate the gates and jumps. It's a little different than just going down a hill.\n\nA horse towing a skier might seem like a far cry from the slate of snow and icy sports at this month's Winter Games, but skijoring does actually have some Olympic roots. It was a demonstration sport at the 1928 Olympics in St. Moritz, Switzerland — the second Winter Games ever staged — meaning the event was held, but no medals were formally awarded. It was a race with no obstacles back then and also was included in the Nordic Games, a forerunner of the Winter Olympics, in 1901, '05 and '09, according to Bill Mallon, an Olympic historian.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMallon says he has heard no recent chatter about revisiting the possible Olympic inclusion of skijoring, though nearly a century ago, Pierre de Coubertin, the Frenchman who's considered the founder of the modern Olympic Games, was in favor of the sport and liked it, Mallon said, but it was never again mentioned as a possible winter sport.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee wouldn't have to look hard to find skijoring disciples along the Rockies, where weekend competitions are staged in communities such as Ridgway, Colo., Saratoga, Wyo., and Wisdom, Mont. The sport also has seen events in the Dakotas, Idaho, Wisconsin and Canada.\n\nDifferent events try to display a different atmosphere, said Crossett, the president of Ski Joring America. But generally, it's a party. It's cabin fever-reliever.\n\nCrossett works in television production and discovered the sport while working in Durango, Colo. With a mix of great action and colorful characters, he thought he had the makings of a fun documentary, but he also saw a sport with a lot of potential. Skijoring, though, felt disorganized, so he pulled together Ski Joring America three years ago to help oversee the sport, establish consistent rules and safety regulations, while providing guidelines for event organizers in various cities. Crossett estimates there are about 300 competitors — not including horses — and many of them travel the circuit from January to March, bouncing between weekend competitions, where prize money ranges from a few thousand dollars to as much as $25,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt takes a certain type of personality to do skijoring, Crossett said. They're all adrenaline junkies. You have these extreme athletes from both these worlds.\n\nSlowly, the sport has graduated beyondthe recreational rider and casual skier. Aaron Griffen grew up with Olympic dreams. He's from upstate New York, the same area as Olympic ski racers Tommy Biesemeyer and Andrew Weibrecht. Griffen attended the now-defunct National Sports Academy, a private school for winter sport athletes, in Lake Placid, N.Y., and from 2006-10, he traveled around racing in International Ski Federation events, competing just a step below the elite World Cup level.\n\nDespite some encouraging results, when he was 19, the Olympics started to look improbable and Griffen enrolled at Montana State, where he dabbled in rodeo. Others in the horse community soon learned about his ski racing background and urged him to explore skijoring,. Griffen didn't know what to expect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI was little nervous that I wouldn't be able to perform to their expectations, he said.\n\nHe stepped into a pair of skis and instantly learned two things: skijoring was just as fun as ski racing, and the skill-set was surprisingly different.\n\nNow in his third season on the skijoring circuit, Griffen, 27, competes in the pro division, but every weekend he sees experienced skiers sign up, convinced that because they can handle a black diamond run at their local ski resort, they can easily navigate the skijoring course. Most are in for an instant shock. When the clock starts, the horse bolts, racing at nearly full speed and jerking the skier along with him. Using a rope instead of ski poles is another challenge, as is maintaining balance while being pulled in every which direction.\n\nAD\n\nThe biggest different is balance, Griffen said. It's not consistent balance. It could change at any time.\n\nAD\n\nGriffen is intimately familiar with both the tightknit horse community — ranchers, cowboys, rodeo riders — and the fun-loving ski world in which he was raised. He knows both well enough to understand their differences and similarities.\n\nSkijoring brings them both together, he said.\n\nLike many winter sports, there's risk involved. Skiers blow up their knees and crack ribs. Horses might tumble or fail to follow a rider's instructions.\n\nYes, things can happen. I'd say there are definitely a lot of skier crashes, he said, but the horse crashes are much, much more rare.\n\nAD\n\nSki Joring America is growing from year to year. Crossett produced his documentary, Ice Cowboys, and is shopping a television show. With more sponsors, more attention and more structure, he thinks the sport could soon grow well beyond the Rocky Mountain region.\n\nAD\n\nThink about where the rodeo started and where you see it today, he said. There's no reason skijoring couldn't get to that point.
The first thing I would do is restore what's been lost: the integrity and the compassion in this country, she said. I would bring people together to start getting things done.\n\nGillibrand, 52, is most well known for her efforts to combat sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, to repeal the military's policy of don't ask, don't tell and to make it easier for Capitol Hill staffers who have been sexually harassed or assaulted to report their experiences.\n\nPresident Trump brought national attention to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) after tweeting about her Dec. 12. Here's what else you need to know about Gillibr (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)\n\nThe senator has latched on to the burst of activism prompted by President Trump's election and his policies, a movement that's largely driven by women. She called the 2017 Women's March on Washington truly the most inspiring moment of my entire life and joined the protesters who challenged Brett M. Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court last fall. She also stood up to fellow Democrats as the #MeToo era dawned, criticizing then-Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota and former president Bill Clinton for their alleged inappropriate behavior toward women.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGillibrand is also a vocal critic of Trump, and she has voted against his political appointees and positions at a higher rate than most Democrats. The president responded in December 2017 by attacking her in a tweet that she called a sexist smear.\n\nWith the announcement made, Gillibrand plans to spend time with her husband and two sons on Wednesday in Troy, N.Y., where she lives and where her campaign will be headquartered. On Friday, she will start a three-day tour of Iowa. Gillibrand emphasized her family in Tuesday's announcement.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) joined the New York Freedom Riders to sing protest songs at the March for Our Lives on March 23. (Kayla Epstein/The Washington Post)\n\nI'm going to run for president of the United States because, as a young mom, I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own. Which is why I believe that health care should be a right and not a privilege, she said. It's why I believe we should have better public schools for our kids because it shouldn't matter what block you grow up on. And I believe that anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince Gillibrand was appointed to the Senate in January 2009 to fill the seat left open when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, she has undergone a rapid and dramatic political shift, abandoning many of the centrist positions she held during her time as a congresswoman from Upstate New York and becoming one of the Senate's most liberal members.Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale has seized on this transformation, pointing to Gillibrand as an example of Democratic political contortionism — even as Trump, too, has shifted in nearly all of his policy positions.\n\nGillibrand has said that she developed a passion for politics while growing up in Albany. Her maternal grandmother was an influential political organizer, and her mother worked as a lawyer, had a black belt in karate and shot the family's Thanksgiving turkey each year.\n\nGillibrand studied at Dartmouth College and the University of California at Los Angeles School of Law, then worked as a corporate attorney in Manhattan for more than a decade. She helped represent the tobacco company Philip Morris in the 1990s amid a federal investigation — controversial work, at least among Democrats, that she has struggled to defend. In the late 1990s, Gillibrand volunteered on Clinton's first Senate campaign and distinguished herself as an aggressive fundraiser, a skill that has been key to her political career.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn my adult life, politically, no one has inspired me to get off the sidelines and truly make a difference more than Hillary Clinton has, Gillibrand wrote in a January 2016 essay endorsing Clinton for president. Clinton wrote a foreword for Gillibrand's 2014 memoir.\n\nGillibrand first ran for office in 2006, beating a four-term Republican in a conservative congressional district that includes the Albany suburbs. In the House, Gillibrand joined the Blue Dog Democrats, a centrist group, and embraced many conservative positions. Her support of gun rights legislation earned her a 100 percent approval rating from the National Rifle Association. She opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants and voted to cut off some federal funding to New York City until the city cracked down on illegal immigration.She opposed legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nWhen Clinton resigned her Senate seat in January 2009, New York Gov. David Paterson (D) appointed Gillibrand, who was then barely known outside Upstate New York — angering many Democrats who considered Gillibrand too conservative.On the Hill, members of the New York delegation nicknamed Gillibrand Tracy Flick after the bubbly, blond and ambitious character played by Reese Witherspoon in the movie Election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of her policy positions rapidly changed. The night before her appointment was announced, she called a gay rights group to profess her full support for same-sex marriage. As she voted for gun-control measures, her NRA rating fell to an F.\n\nGillibrand said in a CBS News interview last year that as she expanded her views beyond the lens of Upstate New York, she realized that her gun rights and immigration positions were wrong.\n\nI just didn't take the time to understand why these issues mattered because it wasn't right in front of me. And that was my fault, Gillibrand said in the interview.It was something that I'm embarrassed about and I'm ashamed of.\n\nAD\n\nShe won a special election in 2010 with 63 percent of the vote and followed with 72 percent of the vote in 2012, when she earned her first full term, and 67 percent in November. Her last campaign came as Gillibrand navigated intraparty divisions over how to handle the #MeToo movement.\n\nAD\n\nIn November 2017, Gillibrand said that Bill Clinton should have resigned during his presidency following his affair with a White House intern. That angered some Clinton loyalists. Former adviser Philippe Reines, who tweeted: Over 20 yrs you took the Clintons' endorsements, money, and seat. Hypocrite. Interesting strategy for 2020 primaries. Best of luck.Three weeks later, Gillibrand called on her colleague Franken to resign following accusations of sexual misconduct from several women. She was the first prominent Democrat to do so, and many others followed, although she also faced criticism from members of her party and some major donors .\n\nEnough is enough, Gillibrand wrote in a Facebook post. The women who have come forward are brave and I believe them. While it's true that his behavior is not the same as the criminal conduct alleged against Roy Moore, or Harvey Weinstein, or President Trump, it is still unquestionably wrong, and should not be tolerated.A few days later, Gillibrand called on Trump to immediately resign because he had been accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women.\n\nAD\n\nTrump responded the next day in a tweet: Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. . . someone who would come to my office 'begging' for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.\n\nAD\n\nGillibrand said the tweet was a sexist smear intended to silence me.\n\nOne of the most prolific fundraisers in Congress, Gillibrand has raised more than $56 million during her political career, including $20 million between 2013 and 2018. But her prowess has led to criticism that she was too cozy with Wall Street.In 2013, the Daily Show's John Oliver confronted Gillibrand about campaign donations from Wall Street and said: What I deeply want to know is: What do you have to do for that? What is required of you for that money? Because it makes me uncomfortable.\n\nAD\n\nGillibrand responded that it was her job to represent New York and its people, which includes those employed on Wall Street.She noted that she has called for more regulation of the banking industry and voted against the government bailout of banks. Nearly a year ago, Gillibrand stopped taking money from corporate political action committees, following the example of Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\n\nAD\n\nDuring her reelection campaign last year, Gillibrand promised that she would serve my six-year term and not challenge Trump in 2020. Her Republican opponent replied: Honestly, I don't believe that.\n\nTwo days after she was reelected, Gillibrand said in a late-night television interview that she was considering a run.\n\nI believe it is a moral question for me, she said. I've seen the hatred and the division that President Trump has put out into our country, and it has called me to fight as hard as I possibly can to restore the moral compass of this country.
A dozen years later, Democratic candidates and potential ones now argue that more barricades are not what is needed at the border. Candidates who once dodged questions about same-sex marriage now support it and are calling for greater protection of transgender individuals. Medicare-for-all — or something like it — has become standard, along with promises to combat racism, sexism and global climate change.\n\nFor years, Democratic presidential candidates have been skittish about taking positions that were considered too liberal, for fear of scaring off moderates and independent voters. That caution seems to be gone, along with soul-searching about making explicit appeals to conservative voters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt has been replaced by confidence — whether real or mistaken — that a more liberal and populist Democratic Party can form a majority out of voters who either support the sweeping changes candidates have proposed or will vote for anyone other than President Trump.\n\nIt's not just Democratic candidates who have undergone a political transformation — the party's voters have also shifted to the left on many issues in recent years and have become much more partisan. Nine in 10 Democrats supported stricter laws covering the sale of firearms in a 2018 Gallup poll, up from about 2 in 3 a decade earlier. Forty percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents support increasing legal immigration, according to Pew Research Center data, up from 20 percent in 2006. And support for same-sex marriage has increased among Democrats and Republicans.\n\nA Pew Research poll in early 2018 found that 46 percent of Democrats identified themselves as liberal, up from 28 percent a decade earlier. The percentages calling themselves moderate or conservative each slumped by high single digits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe party is made up of the people. It's the people first. And I think as people, we are understanding issues more and more because the information, the access to the details is readily available to us every single day, said Deidre DeJear, a longtime voting rights advocate in Des Moines who was heartened to see voter suppression taken seriously during the midterm elections. And I think that's what's helping to shape the party is the people who are part of it — and I think that's how it's supposed to be.\n\nThe party's swift shift has left vulnerable several Democratic candidates or likely ones who have voting records and previous stances that are out-of-line with current Democratic thinking. Those who defend their earlier stances risk seeming stuck in time to party that's quickly transforming, while those who have changed their positions risk being labeled as flip-floppers and opportunists.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden, who is contemplating a run, has defended his leading role in the Senate passage of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which activists say accelerated the rate of mass incarceration and disproportionately affected minorities. He has apologized for his treatment of Anita Hill in the early 1990s when she accused Clarence Thomas, then a Supreme Court nominee, of sexual harassment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who announced her candidacy for president Monday, has faced questions about her actions as a prosecutor and attorney general of California, including her push to criminalize truancy and punish parents whose children miss school or arrive late.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), another presidential candidate, apologized in a three-minute video last week for wrong and hurtful things she said while working with the Alliance for Traditional Marriage, an anti-gay group that opposed same-sex marriage. Gabbard said her views have changed significantly since then.\n\nDuring a Friday night house party in Sioux City, Iowa, a likely caucus-goer asked Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York Democrat who announced her campaign days earlier, to explain how her rating from the National Rifle Association quickly fell from an A as a House member to an F as a senator.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGillibrand said that early in her political career, I only really looked at guns through the lens of hunting, but she changed her mind after meeting with two Brooklyn parents who had lost their daughter to gun violence.\n\nI just felt convicted that I had done the wrong thing, Gillibrand said.\n\nAs Gillibrand traveled across Iowa last weekend, she was greeted by longtime Democratic voters, some of whom said they've undergone similar evolutions in their political beliefs — and that it's healthy to do so. Even in the most conservative areas of the state, local party leaders shrugged off concerns that liberal platforms would scare off voters.\n\nIf she's put more thought and study in it, and sees it a different way, I have no problem with that, said Kris Begne, 55, who works in human resources at an insurance company and saw Gillibrand during her two-day visit to the state. That's what you should be doing, if you're human. If you're reading and learning and watching TV, if you're studying any issues, you should be open to changing your mind. Otherwise, why have a conversation with anybody?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTim Winter, the chairman of the Boone County Democratic Party, who introduced Gillibrand at a Saturday morning gathering, said that his own views on gun control have evolved over the years: As a young man who loved pheasant hunting with his friends, he didn't think any gun laws were needed. Now, as the father of two young children, he thinks lawmakers need to draw lines, especially when it comes to assault-style weapons.\n\nYou progress, he said. We always call ourselves progressives because you can kind of change your mind about some things if you want to learn more about what actually works.\n\nTeresa Wolff, a longtime Democratic organizer in the Sioux City area, said her two grown daughters are often enlightening me on things I have held firm on. Even though Wolff has long considered herself a feminist, she said her daughters will sometimes reprimand her for hesitating to speak out or privately saying that a female candidate needs to wait, learn her place before running for office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Wolff says she has always supported same-sex marriage, she remembers a time when it was just not an issue that was publicly discussed — and now her daughters are coaching her on LGBTQ issues and helping her understand gender matters.\n\nThey're bringing us along with them. They're dragging some of us out of our safe Democratic beliefs — and that's part of the growing process, Wolff said. Always having white people with the same opinion about everything gets us nowhere — clearly, it has gotten us nowhere in the past 25 years. We need to start looking like what we say we stand for and represent.\n\nMost prominent Democrats aren't publicly challenging this evolution, citing the party's successes during the midterm election, when Democrats won races in rural areas that had voted for both Obama and Trump. In some of those cases, however, the Democratic nominees beat out candidates with more liberal positions in the primaries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans are already painting the opposition as completely out of touch with most Americans and too liberal to win back the White House from a president who in 2016 demonstrated appeal in culturally conservative states that usually voted with Democrats.\n\nThe Republican National Committee has labeled Gillibrand a chameleon for her shifting positions and tried to paint all candidates as egotistical and caring more about their political careers than voters. The Catholic Association, which opposes abortion, reacted to Harris's campaign announcement in a statement that highlighted her support of abortion rights and said that this mentality did not serve Hillary Clinton well in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\nIowa, the earliest-voting state, is the sort of place where Republicans hope they can continue to win the votes of Democratic-leaning independents who are scared off by the party's shift to the left.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIowa saw a dramatic shift away from Democrats in 2016. Thirty-two of the state's 99 counties voted twice for Barack Obama, then for Donald Trump; rural Democratic legislators who had held office for years were swept out in the wave.\n\nAmong the flash points in the state's turn to the right has been immigration, an issue that alienated some Iowans, particularly white voters without college degrees, from the Democratic Party.\n\nTom Vilsack, the former agriculture secretary who was Iowa's governor from 1999 to 2007, remembered producing a 30-year plan for the state at the turn of the century, suggesting that it could become a hub for immigrants — and being blown back by the reaction.\n\nThe people putting that plan together were thinking of bringing physicists from Poland, but a lot of Iowans who saw the plan though we were talking about people from Central America, said Vilsack. You could give people data that new immigrants weren't taking their jobs, and they wouldn't be convinced.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2008 caucuses, most Democrats talked carefully about immigration, stopped short of endorsing same-sex marriage and assured gun owners that no one would challenge their Second Amendment rights. Tommy Vietor, who traveled with Obama as his Iowa press secretary, recalled that even at Democratic events, the candidate was asked about the specter of immigrants taking American jobs.\n\nHe would go to events with some of the most progressive people in the state, and someone would stand up and ask: 'What are you going to do about illegal immigration?'  Vietor said. He'd start with the whole litany of punitive proposals, from people 'going to the back of the line' to how they needed to learn English.\n\nTrump, whose campaign made animosity to immigrants a central theme, won the state in 2016 by almost 10 points.\n\nBy the end of Obama's presidency, most Democrats no longer talked about illegal immigration. This year, against the backdrop of the president refusing to fund the government without money for a border wall, Democratic candidates in Iowa have promised to oppose him.\n\nIn 2018, the party did not recover its strength in most rural areas and lost a race for governor that had been seen as winnable. But Democrats flipped two of the state's four House seats, electing Rep. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa) and Rep. Abby Finkenauer (D-Iowa) in races in which liberal solutions for health care and other issues were at the forefront.\n\nThere's so much more willingness now to go to a single-payer system, said Bret Nilles, the Democratic chairman in Linn County, a population center in Finkenauer's district. Ten years ago, I thought we'd never get to that point.
It would interfere with the enforcement of perfectly legitimate foreign orders, just because the foreign country uses trials before judges rather than jury trials. It would require Montana courts to ignore foreign divorces from certain countries, even when the divorces took place decades ago, before any of the affected parties came to Montana.\n\nI doubt that this is what the author of the bill (state senator Keith Regier) intends, but it's what the bill, as written, is likely to do.\n\nFirst, the relevant text:\n\nA court … decision violates the public policy of Montana and is void and unenforceable if … [based] on a law, legal code, or system that would not grant the parties affected by the ruling or decision the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the Montana constitution or the United States constitution, including but not limited to due process, equal protection, freedom of religion, speech, or press, the right to keep and bear arms, and any right of privacy or marriage…. Without prejudice to any legal right, this act does not apply to a person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business association, or other legal entity that contracts to subject itself to foreign law in a jurisdiction other than this state or the United States.\n\nNow, consider two scenarios:\n\nAD\n\n1. Say Mike Montanan sues Carl Canadian for some tort. Maybe Mike and Carl had a business dispute, and Mike gets a $1 million verdict against Carl for fraud. Mike gets that verdict in Canadian court, because that's where Carl lives, and where the dispute took place. So far, no problem; these sorts of transnational lawsuits are pretty common.\n\nAD\n\nNow the Canadian court sits without a jury, because Canadian courts, like the courts of many countries, often do that. That's not the way we generally do things, but Mike is suing a Canadian in Canada, so he gets a verdict under Canadian procedures. Again, so far no problem.\n\nBut now Carl moves to Montana, together with his assets. Mike thinks that's fine — he can just collect the assets in Montana. Yet if SB97 is enacted, that couldn't be done. After all, the right to civil trial by jury is a fundamental right under the Montana Constitution. The Canadian court decision in Mike Montanan's favor thus violates the public policy of Montana and is void and unenforceable, because it's based on a law, legal code, or system that would not grant the parties affected by the ruling or decision the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the Montana constitution (the right to trial by civil jury). Mike has to go back into Montana court and sue Carl again.\n\nAD\n\n2. Or say that Connie Canadian sues Mary Montanan in Canadian court; assume that the Canadian court has jurisdiction, because this stems from an incident that happened when Mary was doing business in Canada. But Mary wins, again in a trial before a judge, since a jury was unavailable in this proceeding in Canada. I'm done with all that trouble and expense, Mary thinks.\n\nAD\n\nBut Connie now sues Mary again in Montana. Wait, Mary says to the court, I have a verdict in my favor from the Canadian court; throw Connie's case out. But remember that Canadian courts don't allow parties a fundamental right provided by the Montana constitution — under SB97, then, the Canadian verdict would be void. Connie gets to relitigate the case against Mary in Montana, and Mary has to pay her lawyers again (and run the risk of losing again), even though before SB97 she'd have been done with the case once she won in Canada.\n\nNow all this might be fine if the foreign system allowed judgments that violate Americans' free speech rights; but a federal statute already largely precludes the enforcement of such judgments. Or it might be fine if the foreign system discriminated against litigants based on race or sex or religion, or if it was fundamentally corrupt. But this is Canada, a civilized country. Much as American law respects the right to trial by jury, does it really make sense to refuse to enforce Canadian judgments (or English or French or German judgments), just because we have a somewhat different system of civil procedure?\n\nAD\n\n3. Let's move from tort law to family law. Say that Wanda married Xavier in Elbonia, then divorced him in Elbonia. Then she married Harry in Elbonia, and 10 years later came to America.\n\nAD\n\nNow she gets involved in a legal dispute that requires the American legal system to decide whether Wanda is indeed properly married to Harry. Maybe this is relevant to deciding whether Wanda can refuse to testify against Harry, or can file a joint tax return with Harry, or inherits property when Harry dies. To figure out whether the marriage is valid, Montana courts would likely need to figure out if Wanda's earlier Elbonian divorce was valid (since, if it was invalid, Wanda's marriage with Harry is bigamous). And that can only be determined using Elbonian law.\n\nBut what if the Elbonian legal system doesn't take the same view of various rights, including equality rights, that the United States now takes? What if, for instance, Elbonian law provides husbands more rights than wives in initiating divorces?\n\nAD\n\nOr what if Elbonia — like Israel, Lebanon, India, and other places — provides that family law matters are to be resolved under the religious laws of the religious group to which the parties belong, which necessarily involves a form of religious discrimination that would violate First Amendment principles if done in the United States? Or what if Elbonian rules of evidence give more weight to men's testimony or to the testimony of people who belong to certain religions, and those rules had been applied in the divorce?\n\nAD\n\nThis might be bad, but it's the reality under which Elbonian law operates. Wanda has lived her life in Elbonia based on that reality. She may have remarried based on the effect of the divorce, however unfairly her divorce proceedings may have been conducted. She may have gotten certain property in the divorce, perhaps less than she should have gotten, but something that she now views as hers. That was life on the ground in Elbonia for her.\n\nBut if SB97 is enacted, the Elbonian divorce must be ignored, because it was entered under a legal system that denied the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the Montana constitution or the United States constitution, such as equal rights regardless of sex, or the First Amendment right not to be treated differently based on religion. The divorce decree would therefore be void, and thus couldn't be considered by American courts.\n\nAD\n\nAnd Wanda would thus be treated as still married to Xavier (whom she had divorced under Elbonian law many years ago), and not to Harry. At best, she would considered Harry's putative spouse, which means she'd be treated as Harry's wife for this dispute — but would lose that status the moment the court informs her that her Elbonian divorce is invalid. She would have to somehow redivorce Xavier under Montana law, though he's still back in Elbonia, and then remarry Harry.\n\nAD\n\nDoes that make sense? To be sure, in some circumstances, it might be proper for courts to ignore the effect of foreign divorces that are based on procedures that U.S. law views as improper. For instance, American courts might reject application of foreign law that they see as unfair when it affects the rights of people who were U.S. residents at the time of the divorce. Likewise, American courts may want to apply American norms to child custody rights when the children are living in the United States. But outside these special circumstances, courts shouldn't categorically ignore the effect of foreign divorces that involve departures from American equality norms.\n\nI agree that American courts should in some situations refuse to enforce foreign judgments that are inconsistent with American norms; the federal SPEECH Act, for instance, rightly bars the enforcement in the United States of foreign libel judgments that are based on libel rules that are inconsistent with U.S. free speech protections. Many courts have already incorporated such principles through their own decisions. And there is plenty of flexibility for courts to refuse to enforce judgments that are seen as against American public policy.
As a psychologist in the D.C. area, I've noticed a marked increase since last spring in how often my patients want to discuss relationship issues, as well as an uptick in the demand for couples counseling. In addition to changes in how households function, societal restrictions, economic troubles, isolation from extended family and friends, diminished opportunities for pleasurable and fun activities, and fears of exposure to the coronavirus have all pushed some relationships to the brink.\n\nOne in 5 married or partnered Americans surveyed in July reported fighting more than before the pandemic, and 30 percent said they were more annoyed with their partner. Almost 10 percent said they are likely to separate, at least in part because of issues related to the pandemic. Similarly, a German study found that about 40 percent of couples in their sample experienced negative changes in relationship satisfaction. (About 20 percent reported positive changes.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough external stress tends to increase discord, hostility and withdrawal within couples, there are proven ways you can weather this crisis successfully — and possibly even improve your relationship.\n\nAccept your differences\n\nWe often are attracted to people who differ from us in terms of personality, temperament, background and habits. But the contrasts we initially find exciting and enticing can cause frustration when our partner doesn't think, feel or behave as we do.\n\nEvery person's traits have pros and cons. If you find your spouse to be too rigid during the pandemic, it was probably their reliability and dependability that attracted you in the first place, said Erin Bell, a clinical psychologist in Alexandria, Va., who specializes in couples therapy and relationships. It's unrealistic to expect that you'll change their personality, so acceptance goes a long way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAcceptance is an active process; it is crucial for maintaining and improving relationship quality and, as such, is a key ingredient of several evidence-based couples therapy approaches. But it should not be confused with giving up. When you start letting go of specific expectations of your partner, you might be surprised to discover that they will be more likely to listen and change in a positive direction, said Miranda Morris, founder of True North Therapy and Training in Bethesda, Md.\n\nHow partners deal with stress, uncertainty and loss, or handle anxiety and sadness — all of which have increased during the pandemic — also can vary. One might want reassurance and emotional support when distressed, while the other might prefer to decompress and process feelings alone. The key is to respect each other's ways of coping (as long as they are not clearly destructive, such as excessive drinking) and, when possible, offer support that matches the other person's needs.\n\nWhen partners' needs conflict, finding an out-of-the-box compromise might do the trick. Sabrina Greene, a 26-year-old reservist, has worked 12-hour shifts in a military hospital emergency room in Norfolk during the pandemic. She and her husband, who works in an ICU, barely overlapped at home. When we did, our relationship was very strained, because we were so physically and emotionally exhausted, Greene said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth found different creative outlets. He converted our garage into a painting studio, Greene said. Sometimes I just sit and watch him paint and see all these emotions expressed on the canvas; even in silence, we feel connected. He, in turn, supports my creative outlet as I produce podcasts from my closet turned office.\n\nRein in your anger\n\nWhen stress becomes overwhelming and emotions are running high, it's easy to lash out toward the person who is nearest to you. Research shows that anxiety can quickly turn into anger, leading to some temporary relief. But by losing our heads, we end up damaging our relationship and worsening our anxiety in the long run.\n\nAD\n\nWhen you get upset with your partner and are about to criticize or complain, wait 10 minutes before saying something, and then give them the benefit of the doubt, Morris said. Maybe there's another explanation beyond them trying to hurt you or not caring about you.\n\nAD\n\nSome good news is that about 70 percent of problems between couples aren't issues that need to be solved; they just need to be talked about, according to Howard Markman, a professor at the University of Denver and author of the book Fighting for Your Marriage. He suggests couples pay attention to their emotional state, and when their conversation turns into a fight, take a timeout, which can be requested by either party, as in sports. It is crucial that they commit to returning to the discussion later, when both partners are calm and can talk without yelling or insulting each other.\n\nJonas and Rosalind Bordo of Los Altos, Calif., have learned that working on good communication each day is paramount during this stressful time. The co-founders of a home rental listing start-up had to adjust overnight to working together in a tight home office while raising three children. During a phone interview that included them both, Rosalind said the couple tries to be psychologically present and to talk it through, no matter how hard it gets. And they strive to adhere to the maxim to never go to bed angry.\n\nAD\n\nWhenever you have an urge to attack your partner, remind yourself that the two of you are a team and should be united against the problem, not against each other. Teamwork is our word of the year. My husband and I tag-teamed and supported each other throughout this, Nguyen said. I cook, and he does other household chores. When one of us needs to be on a work call, the other makes sure to be there for the kids.\n\nPraise your partner\n\nOne of the most powerful strategies for saving or improving your relationship is to not take your partner for granted. Although most of us intuitively know this is important, it's often difficult to remain grateful for all your partner is and does, especially during challenging times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter 25 years of successfully running her own business, Tracy Chamberlain Higginbotham, 56, a public relations professional in Syracuse, N.Y., lost 50 percent of her work and revenue during the pandemic, while her husband's job got busier. Chamberlain Higginbotham was accustomed to sharing household responsibilities equitably with her husband and found it difficult to renegotiate their roles at home. But I've taken over the yard, running errands and other duties. What helps a lot is that he's very appreciative, complimenting me and thanking me frequently.\n\nBeing grateful can have a positive ripple effect: Research shows that being appreciative of your partner makes them, in turn, more appreciative of you, more responsive to your needs and more committed to the relationship.\n\nHer husband's appreciation had this effect for Chamberlain Higginbotham. I've started asking my husband what he needs from me as he goes through his busy day, she said. I feel good that I'm able to contribute, and by taking on new chores, I've discovered I actually like doing yardwork.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo improve your observation and recollection of your partner's positive actions, Bell recommends noticing and writing down something nice about your partner each night to share it with them. You'd be surprised how far being seen and appreciated goes. It will also remind you how your life is different (and hopefully better!) with your partner in it.
At the Library of Congress, public affairs assistant Bryonna Head, left, and historian Barbara Bair listen as manuscript specialist Adrienne Cannon reads aloud a letter from Lewis Douglass to Helen Amelia Loguen. (Amanda Voisard/for the Washington Post)\n\nMy Own Dear Amelia: How can I express the pleasure it affords me to receive a letter written by hand of her I love. . . .\n\nMen and women talk of love, can anyone describe it? Can any one give the reason why one person loves another to the exclusion of every one else. . . . I know many ladies, who are amiable kind, talented and refined, all that a man can wish, and yet I cannot love them or do not love them as I love you, and they may be like you, but to me they are different. . . . So I say reason or no reason, some undefinable force attracts me to you, and I have no means of resisting it and would not if I had.\n\nAffectionately LEW.\n\nLEW was Lewis Douglass, the eldest son of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and he was writing to his beloved H. Amelia Loguen on June 16, 1862, from Rochester, N.Y.\n\nTry finding this kind of heartfelt affection on a Match.com profile.\n\nBut once upon a time, before the age of tweets and Tinder, lovers took ink to paper to express their devotion to one another. So for this Valentine's Day, The Washington Post asked curators at the Library of Congress to select some of their favorite love letters.\n\n[President Warren Harding's steamy love letters]\n\nAdrienne Cannon, African American history and culture specialist for the library's manuscript division, focused on letters written by Lewis Douglass to Helen Amelia Loguen.\n\nLibrary of Congress manuscript specialist Adrienne Cannon reads a letter aloud from Lewis Douglass to Helen Amelia Loguen. (Amanda Voisard/for The Washington Post)\n\nThe letters present a beautiful black love story, preserved for posterity, Cannon said. Lewis Douglass's singular love and devotion for Amelia Loguen inspired him to poetry, helped sustain him through war, and culminated in an enduring marriage.\n\nThey would marry after Douglass was honorably discharged from the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry following the Civil War. (His was the regiment depicted in the movie Glory.)\n\nCurator Sahr Conway-Lanz, a manuscript historian, chose letters written by President Woodrow Wilson to the widow Edith Bolling Galt. Wilson had fallen in love with Galt a year after the death of his wife, Ellen Axon Wilson, in 1914. Conway-Lanz said the two kept their romance a secret until they were ready to make their engagement public.\n\nThis was clearly tough on both of them, he said. That longing is clear in a July 18, 1915, letter.\n\nMy precious sweetheart: There are so many things I want to say first — but I can't decide where to begin — but as a preliminary I will ease my heart by saying that which is dearest in all the world — and it is — I love you — love you — love you.\n\nOne of Wilson's advisers, Conway-Lanz said, wrote: It seems the president is wholly absorbed in this love affair and is neglecting practically everything else.\n\nThe couple married Dec. 18, 1915.\n\nCurator Julie Miller, an early American history specialist, picked a now-famous letter by Thomas Jefferson to Maria Cosway, written Oct. 12, 1786, while Jefferson was U.S. ambassador to France. Jefferson was a widower; Cosway was married. But that did not halt the future president.\n\nHe clearly fell in love with her, Miller said.\n\nThe 12-page letter is structured as a dialogue between his head and his heart. It is the ambivalence in the correspondence that intrigued Miller.\n\nSeated by my fire side, solitary and sad, the following dialogue took place between my Head and my Heart.\n\nHead. Well, friend, you seem to be in a pretty trim.\n\nHeart. I am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings. Overwhelmed with grief, every fibre of my frame distended ­beyond its natural powers to bear, I would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no more to feel or to fear.\n\nCurator Michelle A. Krowl, a specialist in the Civil War and Reconstruction, selected a letter written by Ulysses S. Grant to Julia Dent. Grant met Dent when he traveled with his former West Point roommate Frederick Dent to St. Louis. He was quickly besotted with Dent's sister Julia, and they became engaged on May 22, 1844, Krowl said. But Grant's military career and her father's condition that they wait to marry until Grant's professional life was more stable postponed their marriage.\n\n\n\nLibrary of Congress Civil War and Reconstruction specialist Michelle Krowl looks at letters between Ulysses S. Grant and his wife, Julia Dent. (Amanda Voisard/for The Washington Post)\n\nLibrary of Congress Civil War and Reconstruction specialist Michelle Krowl reads correspondence between Ulysses S. Grant and his wife, Julia Dent. (Amanda Voisard/for The Washington Post)\n\nIn a letter dated Jan. 2, 1846, from Corpus Christi, Tex., Grant, who was growing impatient with their delayed wedding, begs Dent to speak with her father.\n\nYou know Julia what I think we would be justifiable in doing if his consent is still withheld and I hope you think nearly with me. . . . You alone Julia have it in your power to decide whether despite ev[e]rything we carry our engagement into effect. You have only to decide for me to act. If you will set a tim[e] when I must be in Missouri I will be there no matter if my Reg.t is still in Texas. The matter is one of importance enough to procure a leave of absence, and besides for the love I bear my dear Julia I would not value my commission to[o] highly to resign it. My happiness would be complete if a return mail should bring me a letter setting the time not — far distant — when I might 'clasp that little hand and call it mine.'\n\nYour Devoted Lover, Ulysses\n\nKrowl said Grant's letters clearly reveal the depth of his love for Julia and how central she had become to his life.\n\n['An offer of my heart': A story of black love after the Civil War]\n\nLove letters written by famed Hollywood director Rouben Mamoulian to his wife, Azadia, were written from the perspective of their pet cats.\n\nRouben and Azadia never had children, said senior archive specialist Laura J. Kells. Their cats were their children. . . . When he died there were 40 cats in his Beverly Hills home. He died flea-ridden.\n\nWe are all independent and free, With each other we never agree, But for once, on this day, all as one we can say: Will you pet us and feed us? Always love us and need us? Or, in short rain or shine, Be our sweet Valentine?!\n\nHe signed the Feb. 14, 1973, letter Little Pretty, Naba, Mata Hari, Tigress, Abigayil, Zorro and Chunky.\n\n\n\nLibrary of Congress historian Barbara Bair holds a letter from the poet Walt Whitman to his significant other, Peter Doyle. (Amanda Voisard/for The Washington Post)\n\nDuring the Civil War, Walt Whitman moved to Washington, where he met Peter Doyle, a former Confederate soldier. Whitman's letters, including those to Doyle, were recently put online by the Library of Congress.\n\nThey met one stormy night in 1865 when Whitman was the last passenger on Doyle's car, according to the Library Congress exhibit. To Pete, the poet looked 'like an old sea-captain.' We were familiar at once. I put my hand on his knee — we understood from that time on we were the biggest sort of friends.\n\nThey said it was love at first sight, said Barbara Bair, literature and cultural specialist.\n\nThey took long walks. Whitman read Shakespeare to him. Doyle read limericks. In love letters, Whitman referred to Doyle as comrade, son and darling.\n\nTheir relationship changed, Bair said, when Whitman suffered a nearly fatal stroke while working late in the Treasury building. He moved to Camden, N.J., to live with his brother and recuperate.\n\nIn a letter dated June 20, 1877, Whitman wrote:\n\nDear, dear boy Pete I'm stopping here now for a week or two in the house I believe I have mentioned to you before, and where I wanted you to come and see me and still want you if you have a chance. But I spend most of my time down at an old farm down in New Jersey where I have a fine secluded wood and Creek and springs, where I pass my time alone, and yet not lonesome at all (often think of you Pete and put my arm around you and hug you up close, and give you a good buss often.)\n\nYour Old Walt.\n\nThe profound portrayal of longing caused by the distance between the two lovers makes the letter compelling, Bair said.\n\nLucy Stone, an early women's rights advocate, is shown in this photograph around 1853. (G.W. Bartlett/Library of Congress)\n\nJanice E. Ruth, assistant chief in the manuscript division, chose love letters between abolitionist and women's rights advocate Lucy Stone and Henry Blackwell.\n\nStone initially had no intention of marrying Blackwell, Ruth said, but Blackwell was persistent.\n\nThey decided to use their wedding ceremony as a vehicle for focusing on laws discriminatory to women. Stone kept her maiden name, and they eliminated the marriage vow 'to obey,' and circulated a written protest against the 19th century marriage laws which denied women all legal standing, Ruth said.\n\nIn a letter dated Feb. 19, 1855, Stone wrote:\n\nI received your two letters dearest Harry — the one from Ann Arbor and the other from Battle Creek, on my return from Shalamazoo (where I wrote you last.) A fervent 'thank God,' escaped my lips as I read your deliverance from the railroad disaster. Never until then had I known how dear or how necessary you are to me. But when I reflected how barren life would be to me if you had been killed, how much of its sunshine, and its power of use, would have gone more than ever before, I felt how much I need you.
Obviously, they see us drink too much at times.\n\nThe oldest is going off to college. He is a top-notch kid, and he knows we love him.\n\nI've told him about the genetics of alcohol (it does run in our family), but should I tell him about the abuse?\n\nYou always talk about being honest, but this seems like it might be too much?\n\nAD\n\nI'm not sure if I'm trying to cover my own insecurities by telling him, or if honesty is the best policy here?\n\n— Loving Father\n\nLoving Father: Yes, honesty is the best policy. So, let's talk about your drinking.\n\nAD\n\nYou seem to gloss over your alcohol abuse by saying that it is genetic; I infer that your childhood abuse has also been a factor and that both are probably related to your drinking.\n\nIt is also possible that your childhood abuse was perpetrated by people who were — like you — abusing alcohol.\n\nMy point is that you need to start your conversations by getting real about your alcohol abuse. The most impactful statement you could make to your entire family would be to admit that you are abusing alcohol — and to seek recovery.\n\nAD\n\nThe worst message you can send is to tell your kids that alcoholism is genetic (this is partially correct), while you are drinking — and sometimes drunk — in front of them. Your children will sniff out the hypocrisy very quickly. They will also get the message that alcohol is more powerful than they are. (Look at my folks! Resistance is futile!)\n\nAD\n\nYour kids love you. But — here's a shock — all of that love will take a back seat to the vulnerable legacy imposed by your untreated addiction. Children of alcoholics are often high-functioning fixers, with a deep well of anxiety they hide from the world. (In short, you don't actually know how great they are doing.)\n\nYes, you should tell your children about your childhoods, but not right before your son heads off to college and not while you are still drinking.\n\nAD\n\nYou should start by admitting your alcoholism, telling your story to a qualified therapist and working toward recovery. Al-Anon's program for kids, Alateen, would be most useful for your kids. Check Al-Anon.org for information about local meetings.\n\nEven if you are not in recovery, this would be a gift for them.\n\nDear Amy: I've been with my boyfriend for 2½ years. He was married before and had children with his ex-wife (they are adults, now).\n\nAD\n\nThe marriage ended almost 10 years ago, when she told him she had been having an affair.\n\nMy issue is that his family continues to invite her to family functions — not just major holidays, but birthdays and such.\n\nAD\n\nI have nothing against her — it just feels wrong!\n\nAm I wrong if I tell them that as long as they continue to invite her to events, we will not attend?\n\nMy boyfriend is too nice to tell his family it bothers him, although in my opinion he shouldn't have to.\n\n— Savvy Girlfriend\n\nSavvy Girlfriend: Are you the boss of your boyfriend — and his family? Do you get to dictate the terms of their socializing?\n\nYou don't have anything against this woman; your boyfriend's family obviously don't have anything against her, and your boyfriend probably doesn't care one way or the other, because if he really did, he would give them the message that he didn't want to socialize with his ex.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you don't want to attend events where his ex is also invited, then you can stay home, but if you make your attendance conditional, you should be prepared for them to choose her.\n\nDear Amy: I thought your advice to Old Wounds was great. Yes, she should tell her parents that she was sexually assaulted in middle school.\n\nI'd like to add, however, that a great way to do this is to write a letter.\n\nFace-to-face communication can catch people very off guard.\n\n— Been There\n\nBeen There: I agree that putting thoughts down on paper is an ideal way to frame — and tell — a story. Thank you.
He's only making himself look bad trashing her like this, a source tells HollywoodLife.com exclusively.\n\nShe thinks he's mad because she stopped returning his calls and moved on to someone younger and hotter, the insider also shares with us (obviously referring to the extremely yummy Tristan Thompson, 25). James is a bitter ex-boyfriend, and he's in her past.\n\nAs for what Khloe will do if James ever wants to try to win her back? She's with Tristan now and he's an upgrade in every way, the source declares.
That image is at odds with the man Phoenix police and prosecutors have presented to the world: the Hacienda HealthCare nurse who sexually assaulted his incapacitated patient and, a few days after Christmas, became the father of her child.\n\nAD\n\nPolice arrested Sutherland on Tuesday and announced a day later the biggest development in the Hacienda HealthCare case since a female patient no one knew was pregnant gave birth Dec. 29.\n\nAD\n\nSutherland, a licensed practical nurse, was at least partly responsible for the care of the victim, who is 29 and has been a patient at Hacienda since a near-drowning at age 3. Others who worked for Hacienda, including the CEO and the doctors who treated the unnamed patient, have resigned or been suspended as the criminal investigation intensified.\n\nAfter the baby was born, police sought to collect DNA samples from all the male employees who had access to the patient. Sutherland gave his sample on Tuesday morning, officials said. Hours later, he was in handcuffs.\n\nAD\n\nBefore going to work at Hacienda in 2011, Sutherland led a quasi-public life. He and his sister formed Sleeplessouljaz, a Christian rap group. According to a biography, they were inspired by a scripture in the sixth chapter of Ephesians, which speaks of wearing spiritual armor to protect yourself against the faith-breaking difficulties of life.\n\nAD\n\nMy parents, actually, they split up in Haiti, and I remember my mom couldn't take care of us, Sutherland told an interviewer in 2011. She brought us to an orphanage, which, you know, one meal a day is a blessing if you have a cup of rice or something. Even though it's an orphanage, you'll be blessed if you have one cup or bowl of rice a day.\n\nHe directed inspirational words to youth, especially ones dealing with adult-size difficulties. His music group's Twitter profile quoted Martin Luther King Jr. Sutherland told people that his difficult childhood wasn't justification for walking the wrong path — and that teenagers shouldn't make excuses, either.\n\nAD\n\nJesus gave your own mind to you, he told the interviewer when asked what he would tell young people. You have instruction. It's up to you to decide which way you want to go and stuff. It's going to be hard. But try not to make excuses for the way you are behaving.\n\nIn the interview, Sutherland and his sister, who were ultimately adopted, said they had released one album and were working on another. But it's unclear if they ever had more than marginal success. Some of their concert fliers announced free entry and that, as an extra enticement, food would be served.\n\nAD\n\nAt one point, he also sought to help youth by founding a Christian-based group home.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the articles of incorporation for Life in You Inc., the nonprofit aimed to show Christ's unconditional love by responding to the spiritual and physical needs of youth who were homeless, developmentally disabled, behaviorally challenged or orphaned in Phoenix and Maricopa County.\n\nAccording to Fox 10, Sutherland passed an extensive background check when he was hired. His attorney told a judge that this week's criminal charges were Sutherland's first.\n\nEsella Burr told the Associated Press that she lived next to Sutherland, his wife and their four children for a half-decade. She often saw the couple headed to church on Sundays.\n\nI can't believe it, Burr said. He told me he was a nurse, and he liked his job.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe couple had been together since 2012 and owned a catering company that specialized in weddings and corporate functions, according to KPHO.\n\nBut privately, there was acrimony. His wife filed for divorce seven weeks ago, saying their marriage was broken beyond repair, the news station reported.\n\nIt is unclear what prompted Sutherland to go into nursing in the first place, but co-workers remembered a clean-shaven, consummate professional.\n\nA person at Hacienda gave KPHO Sutherland's most recent planning worksheet, a document that outlined his ambitious goals while at the facility.\n\nHe wanted to attend more AZ state board of nursing meetings and to continue leadership classes, he wrote. Overall, he wanted to continue to evolve in his profession.\n\nHe filled that document out in July. At the time, his alleged victim was roughly four months pregnant.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD
AD\n\nAD\n\nThe stereotype of lazy millennials usually isn't in reference to manual labor, but the white-collar workplace. However, in the warped workplace of The Bachelor, participation in group dates and rose ceremonies are analogous to group presentations and performance reviews. Sitting them out or sleeping through them plays right into the lazy stereotype.\n\nShe's entitled. That's right — Olympios has a nanny, Raquel, who does everything for me. This includes: making Olympios's bed; making her cucumber and vegetable slices for lunch; making her cheese pasta; doing her laundry. When the other women rightly called Olympios entitled in Monday night's episode, she insists otherwise. And yet, she doesn't even slice her own vegetables.\n\nUsually, when we hear about millennials being entitled, it's because they don't want to do the grunt work necessary to climb the career ladder. Or because they're used to having things handed to them, such as trophies for merely participating. On The Bachelor, this sense of entitlement comes out in Olympios interrupting one-on-one conversations — multiple times — between the Bachelor Nick Viall and other contestants. It's also in the way Olympios talks about how she expects things to get physical each time she's alone with Viall.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe refuses to grow up. In justifying the fact that she has a nanny but doesn't have children herself, Olympios says matter-of-factly: I'm a kid. And she seemed quite comfortable in that bouncy house with Viall in episode 3, further proving she doesn't wanna grow up. Viall can't stop talking about how much fun he has with Olympios, while the other contestants question whether she's mature enough to marry a 36-year-old man. Who knows whether Olympios is ready for marriage. She's 24; Viall is 36. The average age of this season's contestants is 26, and the average age of first marriage for women of her generation is 27 and 29 for men. For a millennial, taking a long time to grow up is just part of what it means to be an emerging adult, and Nick doesn't seem to be in a hurry to grow up, either.\n\nIf Olympios is a walking millennial stereotype, it's brilliant casting, since The Bachelor draws a lot of millennial viewers. The show knows its audience, and so does Olympios.
My future husband resents this idea, as he feels it is a way of letting outside drama infect our marriage. He definitely wants children but doesn't want to start worrying about it yet, since he thinks infertility has corroded my sisters' marriages.\n\nI don't know how to compromise with him on this, since it seems time is of the essence here. Any suggestions?\n\nAD\n\n— Compromising on a Timeline\n\nCompromising on a Timeline: He resents this idea? He thinks you're letting outside drama infect our marriage?\n\nAD\n\nHe doesn't want to start worrying about it yet?\n\nI'm just going to reprint your whole letter in scare quotes until I meet my word count.\n\nFor someone worried about marital corrosion, your guy seems strangely bent on doing the one thing with the highest percentage chance of corroding your new marriage.\n\nIf you feel strongly about bearing children, then you need to be clear with him that forcing an embargo on talking about and trying for pregnancy could have life-changing consequences. And if this time two years from now finds you pushing 36 and failing to conceive, then your marriage will be generating enough white-hot resentment to read by on a moonless night.\n\nAD\n\nHe can want what he wants, of course. People who have witnessed fertility struggles up close can be forgiven for wanting no part of that emotional slog.\n\nAD\n\nBut he doesn't get to live in a little reality-proof bubble of his own creation. You are in possession of medical information about two sisters that might be relevant to you. You are also almost 34. These three data points aren't about feelings or drama or marital corrosion, they're about biology — and even if yours isn't a problem right now, it's not getting better while you wait.\n\nOf course, there are other things in life than having children, and there are other ways of having children that don't involve your fertility, and there are other valid family planning strategies besides Mayday, mayday, commence conception maneuvers. If your fiance is a-okay with taking your lives together at an unhurried pace and either having or not having children, however it all works out, then he's entitled to that approach — as long has he's honest about that with you, of course, so you can decide whether to go through with the wedding on those terms.\n\nAD\n\nBut I get no sense of his having such a realistic, well-thought-out worldview here; what I see instead is someone who has witnessed things get messy for other couples and who has decided to put his fingers in his ears and go NAH NAH NAH NAH as if that will keep messes away.\n\nAD\n\nMaybe you already know this about him, and embrace it as part of the man you've chosen to go through life with. Maybe you're even okay with postponing children, possibly until your fertility window closes, assuming it's even still open. (In fact, if there's even the remotest chance that you can bring a little que-sera-sera to your life, then you'll probably be happier for it.)\n\nBut if children are at the center of what you hope your life to be, then, I agree with you that compromise isn't how this is going to go. You can't compromise between a reasonable concern and an insistence on being obtuse.\n\nAD\n\nSo make your case plainly, and with sympathy: I understand why you're spooked by this. I would be, too — but I know time is a luxury I don't have. Then explain to him that your body has deadlines whether you like them or not, and neither of you knows if you're missing them while you wait. Then ask him to join you at an appointment with an OB/GYN to discuss your options and replace drama with facts.\n\nAD\n\nIf he refuses to make even that accommodation, then please see this for what it is: a resistance to reasonable conversation about a difficult topic. An attitude like that — on more than the occasional sensitive subject — could bring more trouble to your marriage than even the heartbreak of infertility ever could. Life brings what it brings; you want a partnership that helps absorbs any impact, not one that amplifies it.
Roberta did not unravel the full story of her father's other family until she was an adult, and had become a genealogist. Over the past 20 years, commercial DNA testing with mail-in spit kits has helped genealogists make major breakthroughs more easily. But at first, Roberta had little more than word and paper — and her ultimate journey was revealing of how the work of amateur ancestry sleuths has evolved.\n\nRoberta wanted to find her half brother, the little boy she'd crossed paths with in 1956, when both of them were too young to know what was happening. She tried city directories, obits, marriage records and divorce records and eventually consulted a private investigator, who found a police record for Roberta's half brother and, through that, located the man's address. Roberta wrote him a letter.\n\nDavid Estes turned out to be a long-haired, tattooed long-haul truck driver, and Roberta was struck both by his rough-around-the-edges demeanor and by his loyalty to those he loved and those who needed his love. The first time they spoke by phone, his deep voice was everything to her, and at first, she could barely speak.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey became close. David was the kind of guy who rescued dogs that had been abandoned at truck stops, and once saved a Rottweiler puppy by slugging the guy who was abusing it (hence, that police record). He lived in Ohio, about three hours from where Roberta lives in a rural part of Michigan outside Ann Arbor, but he would take the worst trucking runs just because they took him near her house. Roberta loved it when David called her Sis. She was his only biological family aside from his children. He did not talk about feelings easily, which made it all the more meaningful when he told her he loved her.\n\nOver the years, Roberta gained a lot from genealogy. She learned she was descended from a white man who owned a slave named Harriett and fathered children with her, and she found descendants of Harriett, distant cousins with whom she grew close. She learned that, through her paternal side, she had ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa. And she learned a lot about her father that was difficult to reconcile: how he drank, how he squandered his intelligence, and how he deceived two families.\n\nAs a child, Roberta had idolized him, much to her mother's annoyance, and as an adult, she had to honestly look at the whole man. But genealogical research also allowed her to peel back the context for his life: The son of an impoverished bootlegger who was fed alcohol when he was hungry, he went into the hospital at least twice in an attempt to stop drinking. She wonders whether his pain may have driven him to take his own life in a second car accident, when Roberta was 7.\n\nBoth David and I unquestionably knew that man loved us, she said. I have really good memories with my father, and so did David. There is just no black and white; there's just a really big range of gray.\n\nFor Roberta, genealogy solved mysteries; it gave her empathy and understanding for life's grays. And most of all, genealogy gave Roberta her brother David.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, she couldn't know her family history hobby would give all that when she first got into it in the late 1970s, when she was pregnant with her first child. Back then, genealogy was as fast as polishing rocks.You asked family members for their stories. You wrote letters, actual letters sent through the mail. You traveled to small towns and chatted with clerks and went to libraries to scroll through microfilm until your eyes were red. Genealogy was for the few, the dedicated, the serious family historians.\n\nThe slowness of the process was part of it, Roberta said by phone from her home. She had long silver hair and was wearing a T-shirt that said, I'm a genealogy rebel — I research past my bedtime.\n\nSince the first genetic genealogy tests became available in 2000, DNA testing gradually has become much cheaper and much better at finding close relative matches. Now, for $99 (and less during flash sales), the idly curious can stumble into genealogy; within weeks of submitting saliva they'll have an ethnicity pie chart, as well as a list of perhaps thousands of relatives who match them in a company's database.\n\nThey can quickly find out more about those relatives through family trees, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and people-search websites. They can see billions of the world's genealogical records instantly via a subscription at Ancestry and through the free resources at FamilySearch.org, which is run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And they can join groups, mainly on Facebook, for all the different kinds of genetic genealogy seekers.\n\nWhich means that whereas at the dawn of the consumer genomics era, when Roberta was searching for David, a person had to work years to solve a mystery, while now, the answer can often be found within days.\n\nFor nearly eight years, Roberta had David in her life. Then David got sick.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany years before, when David had served as a Marine tail gunner in Vietnam, he'd been shot down and received a blood transfusion; almost three decades later, he developed hepatitis C from that transfusion, and then liver cancer.\n\nAs part of Roberta's research into the Estes line, over the years she'd asked David to take a Y-DNA test, which looks at the sex chromosome a man inherits from his father. But it wasn't till shortly before David died in 2012 that, after ordering tests to examine his autosomal DNA and her own, Roberta came to understand why David's Y chromosome didn't match those of other Estes men she'd studied.\n\nAutosomal DNA testing — which now dominates the market for at-home genetic ancestry tests but was then relatively new — looks at the 22 pairs of chromosomes (known as autosomes) that don't determine a person's genetic sex. Unlike Y-DNA testing, it considers the genetic material contributed by both parents and their parents before them, and it can reveal relatives along both the maternal and paternal sides.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter Roberta got back the results from the newest kind of DNA testing and saw that she and David didn't share genetic material, she realized that she and David were not, in fact, biologically related. It turned out, her father — the man who'd had two families — was not actually David's biological father, a fact her father probably never knew himself. David's mother had had a relationship with someone else.\n\nRoberta tried to talk to David about what she'd discovered, but he made it clear he didn't want to know the results from the DNA test, so Roberta never told him. The knowledge would have wounded him, and he was sick. And besides, David was her brother, in all the important ways.\n\nAt David's funeral, the room was filled with his trucker friends, who left their big rigs parked around the funeral home with engines running in a tribute to David. His wife was sobbing. The preacher didn't show. Roberta realized there was no one else to give the eulogy. So she did it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor years after that, Roberta searched for David's family, wanting to give David a kind of closure, wherever he was. She vowed to find his biological father. She was still administrator of David's 23andMe account, so she searched among his matches for close relatives.\n\nIn time, Roberta made some discoveries, and posted about them on her blog, in a series titled Dear Dave. Dave, meet the man we believe is your father, she wrote, below a grainy black-and-white image of a man with a narrow face and deep-set eyes, who looked exactly like his son. Dave, meet your half sister Helen, she wrote, posting pictures of herself with Helen, the two women smiling and hugging.\n\nFunny thing about Roberta and Helen. Because they were both David's sisters — though one woman never had the chance to meet him in life and the other loved him even though they weren't genetically related — it seemed to Roberta as if they were each other's sisters, too.\n\nWhen I spoke to Roberta, her depiction of David was so real, I felt like I knew him — his rough edges, his warm heart. She told me that once, when he came by her house for an impromptu visit along a trucking run, he saw some medical paperwork spread out on the table — Roberta thought she might have cancer, though she'd later turn out to be fine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe confronted her: Were you going to tell me? If she was sick, David said, he'd sell his house and come take care of her. She could tell he meant it.\n\nYou can't do that, she said.\n\nYou can't tell me what I can and can't do, he replied.\n\nRoberta cried when she told me this story. I don't know if I've ever had anybody in my life love me like that, she said.\n\nThe story of David was not an indictment of DNA testing, Roberta told me. Genealogy had given David to her; DNA could not take him away. The legacy of her father — his brilliance and his dysfunction — had taught her that genetics only goes so far. Your genes neither guarantee you nor condemn you to anything, she said. And genetics is not the only measure of family. DNA is just DNA — it could not account for her and David.\n\nIt's not love, she said.
I said nothing, but I found it puzzling, as well as offensive, since the woman discussed happens to be my cousin.\n\nWhy would anyone do such a thing? I was sitting six feet behind them. I said nothing. It still upsets me.\n\nPuzzled in North Carolina\n\nAD\n\nPuzzled in North Carolina: I support your idea to engage in some active listening, which can help to promote tolerance and understanding.\n\nThe shutting up part of your program makes no sense to me, however.\n\nAD\n\nYour scenario presupposes that remaining silent while overhearing people critically dissect a family member is somehow worse than passively listening while the same people express bigotry toward strangers.\n\nWhy didn't you speak up? Why didn't you ever speak up?\n\nUltraconservative and evangelical people are tasked with the same duties, burdens and privileges as you are: to love and respect fellow human beings. If your friends choose not to recognize, love and respect the basic humanity of people they disagree with, then they should be called out and challenged on their beliefs and behavior.\n\nAD\n\nPlus, gossiping about and armchair-critiquing others while lounging in comfort in someone else's vacation home is bad form. They don't sound like good or gracious guests but — because of your silence — they've been denied access to your point of view and a possible course correction.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: I'm having trouble figuring out how to proceed in my relationship with my uncle's widow, Barbara.\n\nI like Barbara and have found her to be an interesting and intelligent person.\n\nWe didn't see a lot of them because we all live quite a distance away, but in the past couple of years we visited them several times.\n\nBarbara always seemed to welcome our visits, and sometimes it was phone calls from her that led to our choice to travel to see them.\n\nAD\n\nYet at the same time, she often seemed to read ill intent where there was none and sometimes made rather cutting remarks aimed at me.\n\nThis happened again after my uncle's funeral. I know that she was under a great deal of stress and sadness at the time, but I'm wondering if she would rather discontinue our relationship now. She has a lot of family around her who seem very supportive, so I don't think she really needs us to visit, and it seems like quite possibly now that my uncle is gone, she really would rather we didn't.\n\nAD\n\nDo you have any suggestions?\n\nWondering\n\nWondering: I don't think it's wise, or helpful, to ask your uncle's widow outright if she would like to abruptly and completely discontinue this relationship with you and your family.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, you should behave as you always have, and watch and listen for cues from her. You should contact her and say, We'd like to visit, but we understand that you are going through a challenging transition. I hope you don't feel an obligation, but please understand that if you'd like a visit from us, just say the word and we'll jump into the car. Regardless, we want you to know that we care about you and would like to keep in touch.\n\nDear Amy: The note from Seen It All centered on how to respond to irate customers.\n\nMany years ago, while working for the nation's largest airline, all public contact managers and front-line customer agents were provided with several training sessions, which focused on the difference between sympathy and empathy when responding to difficult, mishandled or irate customers. This also applies to everyday staff interactions within a company ... or even at home.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor example, a sympathetic answer would be, I'm sorry you were asked to do that.\n\nOn the other hand, an empathetic response tends to calm things down before asking, What would you like me to do?\n\nHere's an example: I don't blame you for feeling that way. I'd probably feel the same. How can we resolve this to your satisfaction? Or, How can we handle this differently in the future?\n\nSteve in Tulsa\n\nSteve in Tulsa: I agree that these approaches would work well at home, too. Thank you!
The band was quick to follow the Fab Four as part of the British invasion of the United States, spearheaded by the Beatles when they first played to screaming fans at the Washington Coliseum on Feb. 11, 1964. Gerry and the Pacemakers reinforced the invasion in October the same year, performing at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles in a star-spangled bill including the Beach Boys, Bo Diddley, James Brown and some new kids on the block from London calling themselves the Rolling Stones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Marsden, 78, died Jan. 3 of heart problems in a hospital near Liverpool, according to his best friend, radio presenter Pete Price. The bandleader had had triple heart bypass surgery in 2003 and a second heart operation in 2016 when, he said, he'd been given a heart pacemaker but didn't find the irony at all funny.\n\nGerry and the Pacemakers outdid the Beatles in one aspect: Their first three singles reached No. 1 in the U.K. in the early '60s — How Do You Do It?, I Like It and what became Mr. Marsden's signature song, You'll Never Walk Alone. (The Beatles reached No. 1 with their third single, From Me to You.)\n\nThe next group to top the charts with its first three singles was Frankie Goes to Hollywood, also Liverpudlians, whose first big 1984 hit, Relax, had a Gerry Marsden song, Ferry Cross the Mersey, as its B-side.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter their first two jaunty pop hits, Mr. Marsden's bandmates were shocked when their leader chose as their third single You'll Never Walk Alone, a tear-jerking but inspirational ballad written by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II for the musical Carousel. The Pacemakers' rendition of the song became an anthem to many around the world, notably to fans of Liverpool Football Club and later Glasgow Celtic in Scotland.\n\nAt Liverpool's stadium, Anfield, loudspeakers would blast Mr. Marsden's version before matches, during halftime and after the final whistle. In between, the fans would belt it out themselves, drowning out opposition supporters. Even when their team was losing, they never stopped singing, Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart.\n\nThe original Gerry and the Pacemakers had only three years of hits during the 1960s, the last being a cover of Bobby Darin's I'll Be There in 1965. By then, the Beatles had raised the cultural bar, starting with their album Rubber Soul before moving on to psychedelic music, as in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and becoming spiritual acolytes of the bearded Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut as British music writer and author Spencer Leigh wrote in the Independent newspaper: The psychedelia of 1966 held no interest for Gerry, and he was far too down to earth to follow The Beatles to Bangor to see the Maharishi.\n\nInstead, Mr. Marsden continued to tour with new lineups of the band for another half-century until he retired in 2018. In 1973, a new formation of the Pacemakers played to 13,000 people in New York's Madison Square Garden, joining with fellow Brit groups the Searchers, Herman's Hermits, and Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders to open for Billy Joel.\n\nGerard Marsden was born Sept. 24, 1942, in the poor inner-city area of Toxteth, Liverpool, which, as a shipyard town, had been badly blitzed by Luftwaffe bombers over the previous two years. As a baby, he was rushed to underground shelters after air raid warnings. His father was a railway worker who taught Gerry to play ukulele.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe had switched from ukulele to guitar by 14, just as skiffle music — a mixture of folk, blues, jazz and American country — was sweeping the United Kingdom, led by the Scottish-born King of Skiffle Lonnie Donegan. Like future Beatles John Lennon, George Harrison and Paul McCartney, Mr. Marsden first formed a skiffle group, with a washboard serving as rhythm and his brother using a tin of Quality Street chocolates as percussion because he couldn't afford a drum kit.\n\nWhile working as a railway porter during the day, Mr. Marsden first formed the Red Mountain Boys with his brother Freddie on percussion (chocolate tin), Les Chadwick on guitar and Arthur Mack McMahon on piano. Strongly influenced by Elvis Presley, they moved from skiffle to rock, calling themselves the Mars Bars, but the chocolate-bar company legally ordered them to drop the name.\n\nThus began the Pacemakers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLike the Beatles, they moved from the Cavern Club in Liverpool in 1960 to do gigs in Hamburg, sometimes playing alongside the Beatles, who at that time were known as the Silver Beetles. In 1961, McMahon was replaced by Les Maguire, who would go on to perform on their hits on keyboard and saxophone.\n\nIt was during Hamburg gigs that Mr. Marsden, along with the Beatles, met and were influenced by a wild English but German-based rocker called Tony Sheridan.\n\nHe slayed me, Mr. Marsden recalled. I watched him as much as I could, and he influenced me in the way he could play rhythm guitar and drive the band like mad. In his 1993 autobiography, I'll Never Walk Alone, Mr. Marsden recalled roaming around Hamburg with Lennon looking for girls but finding themselves out of their depth when faced by local pimps.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1962, Martin, their producer, offered Gerry and the Pacemakers a chance to record How Do You Do It?, a song the Beatles had made in the studio but decided not to release as their first single, instead opting for Love Me Do. The Pacemakers' song vaulted to No. 1 in the U.K. and established them as a musical force.\n\nEpstein counseled Mr. Marsden against marriage — not good for the female fans — but he went ahead anyway, in 1965. Survivors include his wife, the former Pauline Behan, and two daughters.\n\nDuring the '60s, Gerry and the Pacemakers had a No. 4 song in the United States titled Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying. When Ray Charles's publishers pointed out that the American pianist-bandleader had a song with the same title (though a totally different song), Mr. Marsden had to pay part of the royalties to Charles. José Feliciano later covered the Englishman's song.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Marsden's daughter Yvette Marbeck told the U.K.'s Press Association: He died in hospital, which was devastating for us because we were not allowed in due to the current [covid] regulations. She added that he was proud that a cover version of You'll Never Walk Alone, by charity fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore, became a hit last year amid the pandemic.\n\nThe words of it are still so very pertinent, she said.  'At the end of a storm, there's a golden sky.' 
Adapted from an online discussion.\n\nHi, Carolyn: My husband easily makes four times my salary (I'm in health care and he's in banking) and works 60-80 hours per week. I do shift-based work, so I often have consecutive days off after pulling several long shifts. Obviously this gives me a lot more time to deal with household tasks than he does, but I'm starting to get fed up with doing all the housework.\n\nSince he makes so much more than I do, is it fair that he doesn't do a lot of housework? We can't afford to hire outside help yet, because we still have a ton of student loans to pay off. My husband is also financing his younger sister's education.\n\nHe works in a fairly intense and high-stress environment, so as a spouse, I feel inclined to do whatever it takes to make his life a little easier. However, I get annoyed every time I think about how he'll probably also be okay leaving me with the bulk of child-care/household duties in the future. What do you think?\n\nClarifying\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nClarifying: I think money earned has nothing to do with these calculations.\n\nI think time, though, does. He works 60 to 80 hours per week for your family's benefit, so arguably you can do your 40 hours plus an hour a day of housework.\n\nI don't mean to imply that every bean needs to be counted like this. To the contrary. But, when there's a sense of injustice brewing between you, some counting is inevitable, and so my advice is to count using as broad a scope as possible. It's not just hours worked or chores done, either, and it's not even just about the household — it's a system of Whole Marriage Thinking. It's about hours worked, chores done, goals supported, emotional needs met, everything.\n\nPaying loans is part of that, supporting the sister is part of that, delegating housework is part of that, your career choices are part of that. What it all takes out of you, what it all gives back. It all factors in.\n\nSo look at your marriage and ask yourself:\n\n1. Are you really putting in more than you're getting out, and/or is he putting in less than he takes?\n\n2. If yes, then is this a temporary condition in service of a mutual goal, like paying off debt? Or is there a power imbalance between you? Or are you taking more upon yourself than you need to?\n\n3. Are there things you agreed to initially that you're questioning now? Say, does it bug you that the sister goes to Mexico on spring break while you're too broke to hire a housekeeper? Or is it all still okay for now, and you're more fearful of something that hasn't happened yet? Or are you okay with it but need to be reassured it's only temporary?\n\nOnce you've identified your ducks, rounded them up and got them in a formation you can live with, then you have the conversation with your husband accordingly.\n\nOr not, of course, if you realize it's all okay with you, and you just needed to look at it all again with fresh eyes — and maybe an open mind, too, to things you too quickly ruled out.
In the film categories, big winners of the evening included the surprise choice of the Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody (for best drama); Green Book (best musical or comedy); lead acting (drama) awards for Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody) and an utterly surprised Glenn Close (The Wife); and Roma which won best foreign language film and best director (Alfonso Cuarón).\n\nIn the television categories, Golden Globes went to FX's The Americans (best drama, at long last); Netflix's The Kominsky Method (best comedy, a very Golden Globes-kind of choice); and FX's The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story (best limited series).\n\nTV stars Sandra Oh (from BBC America's Killing Eve) and Andy Samberg (NBC's Brooklyn Nine-Nine) delivered capably — if not brilliantly — as co-hosts. Oh gave a gratifyingly rousing speech as the first person of Asian descent to host a big awards show, in a year filled with diverse nominees on the roster.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI'm not fooling myself, next year could be different, it probably will be, Oh said. But right now, in this moment, it's real. She looked out at the audience, pointing at some of its members. Because I see you, and I see you. . . . And so will everyone else.\n\nOh went on to deservedly win one of the night's bigger awards — best actress in a TV drama series, for her terrific performance in the international crime thriller Killing Eve.\n\nThe best actor in a TV drama award went to Richard Madden, star of Netflix's action-packed counterterrorism thriller, Bodyguard. For TV comedies, Rachel Brosnahan won best actress for Amazon's The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and Michael Douglas won best actor for Netflix's The Kominsky Method. (A decent and enjoyable show, but really — the first award of the evening, after Oh's elegant note of diversity, went to Douglas, a specimen of old Hollywood in a show about the particular suffering of aging men who work in Hollywood? That's awards-show timing for you.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOh and Samberg made light of the current tone of play-it-safe awards shows, with instantly forgettable jokes that were deliberately as dull as the butter knives on the tables in the Beverly Hilton ballroom where the annual film and TV awards gala kicks off a slew of such fetes in the next several weeks, culminating in the Academy Awards on Feb. 24.\n\nHere's a gripe, because there was little else to grouse about in Sunday's show and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's choice of winners: How much earlier is awards season going to creep up the calendar, anyhow? For some, Sunday marked the Feast of the Epiphany, still technically part of the Christmas holidays. Raise your hands if you've had time to undeck the halls. With Globes getting earlier and the Academy Awards planning a move to early February in 2020, we're going to have to drop the New Year's Eve ball onto a red carpet.\n\nBack to the show's humor, which remained thin all evening, save for one Les Moonves joke, a faux marriage proposal from presenter Maya Rudolph to her co-presenter Amy Poehler (let that be a lesson to stunt-proposal makers everywhere) and the announcement from Samberg that everyone in the audience would be getting a free flu shot from a phalanx of nurses that swarmed the auditorium. (If you're an anti-vaxxer, just put a napkin over your head and we'll skip you, Samberg said.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs for any stirring speeches, the winners were mostly only gracious and grateful. In addition to that, Regina King, who won best supporting actress (film) for If Beale Street Could Talk was able to convince the walk-off music to stop playing while she promised — in the spirit of the speech Frances McDormand gave at last year's Golden Globes — that her future projects would hire 50 percent women in production and directing roles that usually go to men.\n\nI just challenge anyone out there who is in a position of power, not just in our industry but in all industries, I challenge you to challenge yourself, King said, to great applause. (Hollywood is getting quite good at complete agreement, via applause.)\n\nSteve Carell gave a funny and warm introduction to the HFPA's inaugural winner of a new Carol Burnett Award for lifetime achievement in television — that would be Carol Burnett herself. Before she came out to accept, NBC's censors once again bleeped out what I guess was a funny joke from Carell (judging from audience laughter). This, after censoring some choice words during the acceptance speech from Patricia Arquette, who won the best actress award for a limited TV series (the superb Escape at Dannemora) and, later, Christian Bale, who won best actor (musical/comedy) for playing Vice President Richard B. Cheney in the film Vice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat's the problem here, NBC? Have we not proved as a society that we're more than accustomed to some off-color language in 2019? Haven't you ­noticed that there's a big government shutdown going on? The watchdogs are furloughed — take the risk!\n\nBurnett, radiant and sharp at 85, gave a lovely acceptance speech. Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming about being young again and doing [her beloved variety show] all over, and then I bring myself up short, when I realize how in­cred­ibly fortunate I was to be there at the right time, she said. Sad to say, today's audiences might never know what they're missing. Here's to reruns and YouTube.\n\nJeff Bridges gave an epic, long, winding acceptance speech after receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award at the 2019 Golden Globes. (Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\n\nLater in the evening: I'm wearing your cuff links, Jeff Bridges shouted to the ceiling, addressing his late father, the actor Lloyd Bridges, in a casual and rambling acceptance speech for this year's Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement in film. His speech managed to convey the scope of his career in movies, a Big Lebowski feel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe're all alive, right here, right now! Bridges effused. You know what I'm saying? (Yeah, man! Sorta!)\n\nIn addition to the lifetime achievement awards, HFPA President Meher Tatna took a moment to affirm the organization's commitment to freedom of the press internationally with the announcement of two $1 million grants to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and InsideClimate News. It's an interesting (and depressing) world we live in, when even Hollywood has realized that the world needs hard-working, courageous journalists right now, more than it ever has.\n\nEven the TV critics?\n\nWell, let's not get too excited . . .
A principal adviser to five U.N. secretaries general, Mr. Urquhart (pronounced Er-Kut) played a central role in translating the United Nations' founding principles into action. He said his work at the U.N. was motivated by idealism of a very practical kind following his traumatic experiences in World War II.\n\nAD\n\nServing in the British military and intelligence, he had witnessed firsthand the slaughter perpetrated by the Nazi regime as well as the vanity of Allied military leaders whose failure to heed obvious cautions led to thousands of preventable casualties.\n\nAD\n\nIn the mid-1950s, as the lone official in Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold's inner circle with military experience, Mr. Urquhart helped invent the practice of U.N. peacekeeping through the establishment of the U.N. Emergency Force, which in 1956 was sent to supervise the cessation of hostilities in the Suez Canal area between Egypt and Israel.\n\nMr. Urquhart's greatest legacy was in U.N. peacekeeping, a practice that was not mentioned in the U.N. charter, but that initially involved the deployment of impartial, unarmed or lightly armed soldiers between warring parties to help monitor truces or implement peace agreements. Their blue helmets became a familiar sight in crisis zones around the world.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Mr. Urquhart spent much of his working life at the U.N. Secretariat in New York, he served as a leading mediator and diplomatic troubleshooter in some of the world's most truculent conflict zones, including Congo, Cyprus, Kashmir, Namibia and the Middle East.\n\nAD\n\nSir Brian Urquhart showed that principles and politics can be blended in practical operations to help prevent and end wars, said Bruce Jones, a former director of the New York University Center on International Cooperation. That's been the core of the U.N. ever since.\n\nMr. Urquhart's U.N. career coincided with the soaring optimism of the immediate post-World War II years, through the growing pains of decolonization that tripled the U.N.'s membership, to the paralyzing years of Cold War ideological confrontation and gridlock.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1957, Mr. Urquhart played a pivotal role in setting up the International Atomic Energy Agency, which he called the first big break in the Cold War fight over the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n\nBeyond his official duties, Mr. Urquhart performed as the U.N.'s unofficial house historian, defining the public's understanding of the U.N. through his acclaimed memoir, A Life in Peace and War, and extensive essays in the New York Review of Books, where he continued to write into his 90s. In 1986, he retired his self-appointed title as the U.N.'s oldest inhabitant.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition, Mr. Urquhart wrote biographies of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ralph Bunche, whom he succeeded as U.N. undersecretary general for special political affairs, and Hammarskjold, whom he considered a personal hero and a model for all secretaries general.\n\nAD\n\nBlunt, urbane and irreverent, Mr. Urquhart possessed an understated sense of humor that showed through even in the face of his multiple brushes with death during peacekeeping efforts. Better beaten than eaten, the bloodied U.N. official quipped to a group of reporters in 1961, just moments after surviving a beating by Congolese secessionists in Elisabethville.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Urquhart advocated a view that U.N. peacemakers should negotiate with any influential parties, no matter how unsavory. We don't have these moralistic hang-ups about whom we can deal with, Mr. Urquhart told the New York Times in 1981 after having negotiated with the Palestine Liberation Organization to stop firing missiles into Israel from Lebanon.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Urquhart was one of the only U.N. officials who was accepted by both Israel and the Palestinians as a mediator. In February 1982, a few months before Israel's invasion of Lebanon, Mr. Urquhart was dispatched to the region on shuttle diplomacy with Prime Minister Menachem Begin — who considered Mr. Urquhart a man of valor — and PLO leader Yasser Arafat.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Mr. Urquhart worked around-the-clock to reach an agreement, he secured a temporary truce, but he eventually realized negotiations were fruitless. We delivered the PLO as usual, he told the New York Times, but Israel took advantage of the cease-fire to occupy the heights around Beirut.\n\nAs a public face of the U.N., Mr. Urquhart drew withering criticism at times. He said he grew to expect hostility from conservative ideologues with ramrod support for Israel in Middle East conflicts. When the United States gets into Middle East bargaining, Mr. Urquhart once wrote, the price of all the rugs tends to go up, and the prospect of a deal becomes more distant.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Urquhart also became a target for having worked under Kurt Waldheim, the secretary general from 1972 to 1981 who served in the German army during World War II and was accused of participating in Nazi atrocities.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1988, Shirley Hazzard, an Australian-born author and former U.N. official, wrote in the New York Times that Mr. Urquhart had played an essential role in presenting Mr. Waldheim as a figure of distinction throughout years when verified objections were raised around the world and within the U.N. itself about his war record.\n\nIn his memoir, Mr. Urquhart called Waldheim a living lie. By covering up his wartime service, Waldheim did immense damage not only to his own country but to the United Nations and to those who have devoted, and in some cases sacrificed, their lives for it, Mr. Urquhart wrote.\n\nAD\n\nBrian Edward Urquhart was born in Bridport, England, on Feb. 28, 1919. He was a boy when his father, whom he called the century's least successful painter, abandoned the family. He soon enrolled in an all-girls school where his mother worked as a teacher.\n\nAD\n\nHe showed early academic promise, mastering Latin verse at 10 and earning a scholarship to study at the elite Westminster School in London, which prepared him for his later studies at the University of Oxford's Christ Church college. At the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Urquhart cut short his education in 1939 and enlisted in the British army.\n\nHe survived various near-fatal disasters. A minesweeper he was serving in hit a mine in the Thames River. In the summer of 1942, he fell 1,200 feet into a plowed field when his parachute failed to open completely during a training exercise. He spent six months recuperating in a hospital before rejoining his unit. He later saw combat in North Africa and Sicily.\n\nAD\n\nAs a 25-year-old chief intelligence officer, Mr. Urquhart warned, to little avail, against Operation Market Garden: the calamitous September 1944 Allied military assault behind German lines in the Netherlands. The event was dramatized in Cornelius Ryan's 1974 nonfiction book, A Bridge Too Far, and the subsequent film version.\n\nAD\n\nPlanned by British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, Operation Market Garden aimed to seize control of several strategic bridges along the Rhine, paving the way for an Allied advance into Germany.\n\nMr. Urquhart worried that the British command had grossly underestimated the Germans' strength and ordered an air reconnaissance mission that revealed the presence of two Panzer divisions near the Allies' drop-off point.\n\nMr. Urquhart's warnings were dismissed by his British superiors. Two days before the planned attack, a medical officer recommended Mr. Urquhart be sent off on medical leave to recover from nervous exhaustion. More than 17,000 Allied forces were killed or wounded in Operation Market Garden.\n\nAD\n\nReflecting on the operation, Mr. Urquhart told the Times in 1982: The worst way to make an argument is by reason and good information. You must appeal to people's emotions and to their fears of being made to look ridiculous. I also learned that if you happen, by some chance, to get something right, you become extremely unpopular.\n\nThat experience and his later participation in the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp inspired Mr. Urquhart to pursue a career of peacemaking at the United Nations.\n\nAfter the war, the historian Arnold Toynbee, a family friend, wrote a recommendation for Mr. Urquhart that helped him land a job as an assistant to Gladwyn Jebb, the executive secretary for a committee charged with setting up the United Nations. He later was an adviser for Trygve Lie, the Norwegian who became the U.N.'s first secretary general.\n\nMr. Urquhart's first marriage, to Alfreda Huntington, ended in divorce. In 1963, he married Sidney Damrosch Howard Canfield, a daughter of the playwright Sidney Howard and a granddaughter of composer and conductor Walter Damrosch.\n\nIn addition to his wife, survivors include three children from his first marriage, Thomas Urquhart of Falmouth, Maine, Katharine Ohno of Brighton, England, and Robert Urquhart of Denver; two children from his second marriage, Rachel Urquhart of Tyringham and Charles Urquhart of Leverett, Mass.; a stepson, Thomas Canfield of Washington; 14 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.\n\nAt the U.N., Mr. Urquhart walked a finely calibrated balance in an organization without sovereign power but that derived strength from accord between its two strongest patrons, the United States and Russia. For the duration of the Cold War, those nations were nuclear antagonists, making progress seem futile.\n\nThree-fourths of the time, you achieve nothing, but every once in a while, it works just enough to make it worthwhile going on with it, he said in 1972 in describing the political effectiveness of the U.N. From day to day, one thinks it hopeless, but cumulatively, it does work.
While representing an actress in a child-custody battle, he found out that her soon-to-be-ex-husband had once posed for a nude poster in their early years of financial struggle. He had an aide track the poster down to a dingy bookstore in Hollywood and fly it back to the East Coast courtroom in time for closing arguments. Showing the image to the jury and elderly judge, Mr. Sandground feigned shock and dismay — and won his case.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPeople come to me because they have confidence in my judgment, Mr. Sandground once told The Washington Post. I'll do anything to win for a client. If an opposing lawyer gets up off the ground after I finish with them, he told another interviewer, I haven't done my job.\n\nMr. Sandground, a Washington-area divorce lawyer who drew media attention for his Machiavellian embrace of winning at all costs, died Dec. 30 at a hospital in the District. He was 88.\n\nHe had been hospitalized for cancer treatment for two weeks before his death and continued to work on divorce cases from his hospital bed, said his son Mark B. Chipp Sandground Jr.\n\nFour times married and three times divorced, the elder Mr. Sandground was for more than 60 years the widely known — and often unorthodox — advocate for hundreds of women and men seeking maximum settlements and minimum costs to get out of their collapsing marriages.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese ranged from multimillion-dollar demands for alimony and support payments to fights over who should get the silverware and art collections to joint custody agreements for the household dog, including the details of doggy visitation rights on alternate weekends and Wednesday nights.\n\nLike a Machiavellian character might have advised, fear was always an effective weapon.\n\nPeople choose him like they choose a sawed-off shotgun, a woman whose ex-husband had been represented by Mr. Sandground told The Post in 1984. Washingtonian magazine called Mr. Sandground the bad boy of the divorce bar, noting such office decor as the oil painting of a rat and photo of an angry Doberman pinscher. The National Law Journal profiled him under the headline The Nastiest Lawyer in Town. Mr. Sandground once referred to himself as the Prince of Darkness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1988, a committee of the D.C. Bar's Board on Professional Responsibility found he had actively and knowingly helped a client conceal assets from an opposing lawyer in a divorce case. In addition to a public reprimand noting his otherwise unblemished record, he was suspended from practice for three months.\n\nMr. Sandground insisted he had done nothing wrong, and Washingtonian reported that he wore the censure of others like a badge of honor.\n\nPredictably, most of Mr. Sandground's clients were moneyed enough to pay his several hundred dollar hourly fees. A few were top government officials or media celebrities, including congressional spouse Rita Jenrette (who caused a stir with the claim to Playboy that she had carnal relations with her husband John on the Capitol steps a few years before his bribery conviction.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Sandground's other boldface-name clients included John Heckler, whose messy divorce in the mid-1980s from Margaret Heckler, then-secretary of health and human services, generated headlines.\n\nHe also represented Paula Parkinson, an insurance lobbyist who claimed to have had affairs with members of Congress, amid a Justice Department inquiry in the early 1980s examining whether her alleged paramours had exchanged votes for sexual favors. No charges were brought.\n\nMark Bernard Sandground was born in Brookline, Mass., on June 6, 1932. His father was a parasitologist on the faculty at Harvard Medical School. He grew up in Indianapolis, and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1952 and from the University of Virginia law school in 1955.\n\nAD\n\nThe next year, he helped Richard M. Nixon during his successful campaign for reelection as vice president under Dwight D. Eisenhower. He then entered private practice and, over the years, worked on his own and in firms with partners and associates. One such arrangement ended badly. In the middle of the night in 1981, four lawyers with whom he had practiced moved out of their Connecticut Avenue office without notice or explanation.\n\nAD\n\nHe worked seven days a week, including holidays, and took a one-upmanship approach with legal opponents by scheduling nighttime meetings on Christmas Eve or the Fourth of July.\n\nHis marriages to Judith Hollenberg, Marcia Gurevich and Evelyn Jaeger ended in divorce and, he admitted, were largely his own fault because he was working long hours and never home. He once said he was an absentee father to his two sons, both from his second marriage, but those relationships improved when the children reached adulthood.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to his son Mark, of Washington, survivors include his wife of 26 years, Judith Pugliese Sandground, of the homes in Falls Church, Va., St. Michaels, Md., and Key West, Fla.; another son, Bruce Sandground, of Phoenix; and four grandchildren.\n\nIn a death announcement, Mr. Sandground was described by his family as an omnivore at the bar. Divorce cases were his primary work, but he also represented foreign governments and businesses with dealings in the United States. He was a Francophile who once postponed a deposition in one of his legal cases for a class on French cooking.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Sandground also had a start-up interest in two Washington restaurants, the Palm and the since-shuttered La Niçoise. One of his wives once said he wore a coat and tie to Sunday breakfast. To fix the morning coffee, he usually put on a sports coat before going to the kitchen. In less formal attire, he enjoyed deep-sea fishing.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Sandground liked to tell stories that slyly doubled as publicity. One was about a female client — the second wife of a Washington lawyer — who gave her former husband's next wife a wedding gift with Mr. Sandground's business card enclosed and a note that said, You may need this some day.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incompletely described the consequences to Mr. Sandground after a D.C. Bar committee found that he had helped a client conceal assets from an opposing lawyer in a divorce case. In addition to a public reprimand, he also was suspended from practice for three months. The story has been revised.

From afar, things seemed to be going well. Last October, the couple opened Yummy Pop, a gourmet popcorn store, in Paris. My hope is for Yummy Pop to become a Parisian snacking staple and a symbol of friendship between my two most beloved cities, Paris and New York, she told USA Today at the time.\n\nBut appearances can be deceiving. For as it turned out, Johansson and Dauriac were separated months before the store's opening. In January, People reported that they had been separated since the summer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, Johansson filed for divorce in New York, where the two primarily reside, saying the marriage was irretrievably broken. She seeks joint custody of Rose but wants the child to live with her.\n\nDauriac's lawyer, Hal Mayerson, told the Associated Press that Dauriac was shocked by the filing, and views it as a pre-emptive strike in a potential custody battle. Furthermore, Mayerson said Dauriac has been the primary parent for Rose while Johansson worked on her career.\n\nMr. Dauriac is tired of having to run his life and his child's life based on Ms. Johansson's shooting schedule, Mayerson said.\n\nJohansson was less forthcoming, offering the following statement to news outlets:\n\nAD\n\nAs a devoted mother and private person and with complete awareness that my daughter will one day be old enough to read the news about herself, I would only like to say that I will never, ever be commenting on the dissolution of my marriage. Out of respect for my desires as a parent and out of respect for all working moms, it is with kindness that I ask other parties involved and the media to do the same.\n\nWe never had any intention of filing papers, we did not want to make it a public spectacle, Mayerson told USA Today. Now she or her lawyers or her handlers have made it a public spectacle. … She filed, so for her to ask for privacy now seems somewhat oxymoronic to me — it makes no sense.\n\nAD\n\nAdded Mayerson, It's not in her daughter's interest to file in the public court system.\n\nJohansson hasn't spoken much about her child over the years. Though, when asked by Playboy in February if she was based in New York or Paris, she responded, We still mix it up. My job takes me all over the place, so I don't even know where I live, but I guess now we're kind of committed to living here because with our daughter we have to commit to someplace. She'll be in school in a hot minute. The time passes like crazy.\n\nAD\n\nJohansson has been outspoken on her views on marriage and monogamy.\n\nI don't think human beings are monogamous creatures by nature, she said while promoting Woody Allen's Match Point in 2006.\n\nIn an interview with Playboy in February, called the idea of marriage very romantic and a beautiful idea. But, she continued:\n\nAD\n\nI don't think it's natural to be a monogamous person. I might be skewered for that, but I think it's work. It's a lot of work. And the fact that it is such work for so many people — for everyone — the fact of that proves that it is not a natural thing. It's something I have a lot of respect for and have participated in, but I think it definitely goes against some instinct to look beyond.\n\nStill, Johansson has given it a couple of tries.\n\nBefore Dauriac, from 2008 to 2011, she was married to fellow actor Ryan Reynolds.
The new vetting is likely to screen thousands of recruits per year who have what the Pentagon considers foreign nexus risks, including some Americans who marry a foreign spouse or who have family members with dual citizenship, the memos said. Anyone identified for the screening would not be allowed to attend recruit training until they are cleared, a process that could take days for some but drag on much longer for others.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne draft document, labeled predecisional, has circulated in recent weeks among senior officials and others who oversee recruiting. It is attributed to Joseph D. Kernan, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and James N. Stewart, who performs the duties of undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, a post President Trump has left without a permanent political appointee since Robert Wilkie left it to run the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nOne primary concern associated with qualifying for these positions relates to the potential counterintelligence or terrorism risks, the memo says.  . . . The Department must implement expanded foreign vetting and screening protocols to identify and mitigate the foreign nexus risks.\n\nDefense officials declined to comment on the memos, saying the new policy is undergoing legal reviews and that some changes could be made.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe documents show the Pentagon to be grappling with the dual challenge of thoroughly screening prospective recruits for potential security threats and finding enough men and women willing to join the military. The armed forces have long sought green-card holders as recruits, marketing such jobs as a chance to attain U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe initiative comes as the Trump administration continues to take unprecedented steps to curb immigration to the United States. Many of its efforts have been halted by federal courts, including the president's efforts to bar Central Americans from seeking asylum in the United States, end a deferred-action program for young, undocumented immigrants and withhold funds from sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with certain immigration enforcement efforts.\n\nAmong the people who could be targets of the foreign-nexus screening are people who have foreign contacts, foreign citizenship, dual citizenship, a birthplace outside the United States if born to foreign parents, family members who are not U.S. citizens, and immediate family members who have dual citizenship, according to one of the memos.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther factors that could require such screening include possessing a non-U.S. passport, having financial interests abroad, residing outside the United States for more than three of the previous 10 years and living in the country for less than the last five consecutive years unless the circumstances involved work related to the U.S. government.\n\nA Dec. 21 memo prepared by Stephanie P. Miller, who oversees recruitment policy for the Pentagon, says the Defense Department recognized gaps associated with its screening of individuals with foreign ties since the receipt of specific reporting beginning of 2016, though the memo does not specify what that information covers. But the concern stretches to some American citizens, too, she argued.\n\nDoD recognizes that some U.S. citizens pose a similar risk by virtue of their foreign associations, foreign travel, marriage to a foreign spouse, or dual citizenship, she wrote. It is imperative to treat the risk related to a foreign nexus in a similar fashion for any recruit or Service member, regardless of citizenship.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Pentagon is preparing the new policy after Kernan's office and the Army combined in the summer of 2018 to screen green-card holders already in the military through a new process that relies on dozens of existing intelligence databases, one Defense Department memo said. The screening detected more derogatory information about the service members in less time than traditional background checks managed by the Office of Personnel Management, the memo said.\n\nThe memo promised that the new process — called foreign nexus screening and vetting, or FNSV — can be completed in a matter of days or, depending on the analysis required for detected anomalies, in a few weeks, as compared to the months and years required under traditional background checks. The new screening process, the memo said, can process up to 1,600 cases per day.\n\nHistorically, about 70 percent of all recruits with green cards are processed quickly, defense officials said in the memo. Under the new policy, the other 30 percent would still be withheld from recruit training until their screening has been completed, but the process would in theory be faster.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe new screening process still faces a major hurdle: another court injunction.\n\nIn November, Judge Jon S. Tigar of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that it was unreasonable for the Pentagon to require all green-card holders to undergo a full background check and receive a favorable determination in a security review. He issued a preliminary injunction, forcing the Pentagon to begin shipping a backlog of thousands of green-card holders to recruit training.\n\nThe Defense Department has continued to fight the case in court. Miller argued in a Dec. 14 declaration that if the court does not stay its order, the harm to the military and national security could be significant and irreparable.\n\nAD\n\nForeign nationals, including those with [green-card] status, raise unique counterintelligence and counterterrorism concerns because of the heightened susceptibility to influence by foreign governments and organizations and because of the difficulty in verifying information about them that is maintained overseas, Miller's declaration said.\n\nAD\n\nThe injunction has not been lifted, but the Defense Department memo from Kernan and Stewart said the Pentagon is preparing to put in place its new policy within 30 days of the court's approving it. It is unclear whether the court will do so.\n\nSeparately, the Pentagon faces litigation after ending in 2017 another program known as Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest, or MAVNI. It promised expedited citizenship to immigrants the Army recruited to take hard-to-fill language and medical jobs, but was ended as defense officials cited security concerns.
Some of these statements are made within my son's earshot. This has an impact on attending parent/teacher meetings and school functions.\n\nThis embarrasses both of us. He is a sensitive lad.\n\nHe has even said that he hates his parents being so old. (His mother is 47, but she looks much younger).\n\nOn one occasion a very heavy-set woman told me that I must be Michael's grandfather. My response was to congratulate her on her pregnancy. As she assumed, so did I.\n\nAD\n\nI would appreciate some help in addressing this issue, as it is a constant source of emotional distress.\n\nAD\n\nK in Colorado\n\nK in Colorado: The way to address this is to acknowledge your son's perspective and feelings, without giving in to them.\n\nYour embarrassment reinforces his. Your rudeness to an overweight woman teaches your son that it is acceptable to be mortified for the privilege of your age, and that rudeness is an acceptable reaction when someone makes an incorrect assumption.\n\nAcross North America, millions of grandparents are currently raising grandchildren; of course some people assume that a 68-year-old man is an adolescent's grandfather!\n\nAD\n\nYour age makes parent/teacher conferences challenging? Why? You are there to discuss your son's schoolwork. If a teacher brings up your age, or your child's sensitivities surrounding it, you should ask for the teacher's advice about how to handle it, and be open to a course correction.\n\nAD\n\nTell your son, Hey, I understand that this can be hard on you sometimes. But you know what? It is what it is. I feel proud and lucky, and I don't care what other people think.\n\nYou cannot change your age. Many families carry burdens. Families cope with poverty, disabilities and dislocation. Reassure your son that you're healthy and happy, and that you plan to be around to bug and embarrass him for a very long time.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: I am a 75-year-old widow of three years. I got married at 17, and my late husband was my first, and only, love.\n\nThe guy friend I'm currently seeing is 78, and has been widowed for five years. He and his late wife were our best friends for 60 years.\n\nWe have been through the good times, very good times, bad times, and very bad times. The two of us went through losing our spouses. So I guess it's only karma that our friendship has blossomed into a romance.\n\nAD\n\nHe will be moving in with me soon. He really wants to get married. He's not really pressuring me, but I do know that marriage is not what I want at my age.\n\nI want us to live together for a few months to make sure this is good for both of us.\n\nAD\n\nI'm thinking more along the lines of a commitment service, but I don't know much about it, or who to contact.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and feelings on my thoughts and feelings?\n\nWondering Widow\n\nWondering Widow: My thoughts and feelings are mainly celebratory. Karma, indeed!\n\nI will also offer my casual, non-scientific observation that older men tend to embrace remarriage, while older women don't seem to be quite so keen.\n\nYou and your guy should explore all of the legal ramifications of being together, both with and without marriage. You should see your attorney regarding practical matters like insurance, household finances, and estate planning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA commitment ceremony might be a fun and appropriate way to celebrate your togetherness. There is no one way to do this — but basically it is like a wedding ceremony without the legal attachment.\n\nA friend or clergy member could perform the ceremony and you could write your own vows and publicly declare your commitment to one another in front of friends and family. You might want to plan this event for six months from now, after you've both adjusted to your togetherness.\n\nDear Amy: The question from Love-in-Law, where a man said he was in love with his wife's sister, made my blood boil.\n\nThank you for stating: You feel guilty because you are guilty.\n\nGrateful Reader\n\nGrateful Reader: When someone confesses to infidelity and then wonders why he feels guilty — the answer writes itself.
The president-elect has said little publicly about his plans for criminal justice reform, but the expectations are high. Americans are looking to him to heal a deeply divided nation split along lines of race, politics and class.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has said his priority upon taking office as the 46th president will be to heal and unify the nation. He has said little about how he plans to go about the task, beyond committing to creating a national police oversight commission within the first 100 days of his administration. Still, many say that the credibility Biden earned among civil rights leaders as vice president to Barack Obama, combined with his long-standing ties with law enforcement, including his work on the 1994 crime bill, make him well-positioned to bridge divides among law enforcement officials and civilians pushing for change.\n\narrow-right\n\nOverview Iyanna Cooke hugs a friend at the site of Daniel Prude's killing by police after a vigil at First Church of God in Rochester, N.Y., on Sept. 3.

Helping the country heal will be among President-elect Joe Biden's top priorities. But as Biden prepares to take office on Jan. 20, his administration must confront just how deep the country's wounds are as he attempts to finalize his agenda on policing, racial and social justice, and equity within the criminal justice system.

With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it, Biden said. And at that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime.

A woman protesting the racist demonstrators had been killed in the mayhem, but rather than condemning the white nationalists, Trump said there were very fine people on both sides.

The only thing he's modernizing, Minhaj says in the episode, is Saudi dictatorship.\n\nNow, the Financial Times first reported, that episode is no longer available to view on Netflix in Saudi Arabia. The streaming service pulled it after the country's Communications and Information Technology Commission said that the episode violated a law there banning production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe episode had been available in Saudi Arabia for several weeks before the request.\n\nArticle 6 of the country's anti-cybercrime law is punishable by up to five years in prison, and it has been used in the past to charge activists for organizing or sharing photos of protests online, and to crack down on satire. Netflix said in a statement to The Washington Post that it has a policy of complying with local laws, like many tech companies. We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request, Netflix said.\n\nThe episode is still available domestically on Netflix, and to everyone on YouTube.\n\nAD\n\nMinhaj spoke out about the incident Wednesday. Clearly, the best way to stop people from watching something is to ban it, make it trend online, and then leave it up on YouTube, he tweeted. Let's not forget that the world's largest humanitarian crisis is happening in Yemen right now.\n\nIt took the killing of a Washington Post journalist for everyone to go, 'Oh, I guess he's really not a reformer,'  Minhaj said of Mohammed on the episode in question. Khashoggi was a contributing columnist for The Post's opinion section. Meanwhile, every Muslim person you know was like, 'Yeah.'  Minhaj added, using an expletive for emphasis. The majority of the monologue, first released in late 2018, argues that it's time to reassess the U.S.-Saudi relationship — one Minhaj likens to a marriage of convenience.\n\nAD\n\nMinhaj also looks at Saudi funding of major tech companies. Saudi Arabia, through a huge donation to SoftBank and other funds, has invested billions of dollars in Silicon Valley companies.\n\nThis isn't the first time this particular episode of Patriot Act has created news. A segment that highlighted a U.S. Central Command training manual that says Saudi people have Negro blood prompted an apology from Centcom in November and a promise to revise the manual.\n\nThis post has been updated.
The best moment\n\nFinally, an episode without near-constant reminders that Colton is a virgin! Those jokes (we counted dozens in the premiere alone) got old real quickly. Instead, references to what Colton hasn't done have been replaced by shots of what his bare chest can do: See Colton flex as the women ogle. See Colton get oiled up at a pool party while the women ogle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, the first and only notable reference to Colton's virginity was a comment one of the women made as he was helping Sydney stretch during the workout date. He's not a stretching virgin anymore, which, as far as virginity references go, was a stretch. We're pretty sure that a former professional football player is acquainted with stretching.\n\nNow that the virgin references have let up a bit, will the cougar comments be next to get the boot? This show has always been weird about age, alternatingly questioning whether a 22-year-old is old enough to get married and casting a 32-year-old as if she's missed her chance entirely. Predictably the 20-something contestants treat Elyse and Tracy, both 31, as if they are preying on a much younger man. (Colton is 26, not 16! Elyse and Tracy are decades too young to be branded as cougars.) Thankfully Colton isn't playing into the age-shaming. Instead he says things like: You have this confidence and this independence — and I want to know why. But that snippet at the end of the episode, when the literal children kept cutting in on Colton's time with Elyse? These girls are 5! It was one of The Bachelor's creepier moments.\n\nThe worst moment\n\nIf we come to The Bachelor for drama, then it is drama of the most pedestrian kind. Watching, we bop along to flat rhythms of a story we've heard again and again. This episode's worst moment emerges out of one those familiar beats: One of the contestants convinces another to speak ill of a third, thereby beginning the process of her own exit. Here, it is Heather who persuades erstwhile pageant queen Hannah B. to tell Colton that she doesn't care for her fellow pageanteer (and former friend) Caelynn. Within the arc of the episode, the initial goading isn't surprising, but neither is it unwelcome: One of our colleagues referred to it as the series' Death Star, by which he meant that it shows up in virtually every episode — and, presumably, always ends in a satisfying explosion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat follows, however, is a study in tedium, less fully operational battle station than lifeless moon. When Hannah first comes to Colton with her concerns, she has, we soon learn, little to offer. They were amicable, and now they're not, but Hannah is hard-pressed to explain why, or, for that matter, why anyone who wasn't involved should care. Confronted with these feckless facts, Colton leans his whole body back, as if shocked. But it's difficult to escape the feeling that he's really just tired, possibly even taking this opportunity to get in a quick nap before chatting with the next contestant.\n\nBefore long, we find Caelynn playing along, though she, too, is hard-pressed to explain why, exactly, her antagonist is so untrustworthy. Befuddled (is he ever otherwise?), Colton escapes to some backstage Purgatorio where host Chris Harrison hovers like a thirsty shadow. Confusing this shade for wise Virgil, Colton seeks counsel, and for once he is blameless. He has been told that these things matter, but neither women has told him why. This is imported drama, brought in from an event that The Bachelor cannot show us, and that the participants themselves are incapable of articulating. Here, Colton's confusion is almost relatable, offering us a picture of an observer who looks a great deal like the show's own viewer. For all his putative power, he is reduced to the role of passive watcher uncertain what he's supposed to think or whether he should even care.\n\nUltimately, he keeps them both, of course, though he gives Hannah the last rose — manufactured and predictable drama, yes, but at least drama in the show's wheelhouse. Even in this, he seems hapless and used, since we know that the producers are salivating to send the pair of pageant queens on a two-on-one date in an episode soon. It's difficult to say why, though, since their story is unlikely to get any more interesting. She kept trying to stab at our relationship, one of the women says of the other near the episode's end. Together, they will keep stabbing at our willingness to keep paying attention.\n\nThe weirdest moment\n\nIt's episode three, which means it's time for a Bachelor staple: The Fitness Date. Mostly, it's just an excuse for Colton to take his shirt off. The ladies of this group date are met by Terry Crews and his wife, who give a genuinely sweet opening speech about how it is hard work to make a marriage last decades like theirs. Everyone pretend to be very into it, even though working out, as a date concept, is basically a nightmare.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut then there's Nicole. She looks to be in very good shape, but the social media manager from Miami is not able to do a pullup, which forces the others to give her a boost. They heave and wheeze at the effort of lifting her probably-102-pound body which is about as cruel as calling the 31-year-olds old.\n\nNicole is all of us. Nicole for Bachelorette! She gets a rose later on.\n\nAnyway, this all culminates in a CrossFit-like competition where the women have to flip tires, push heavy carts, and — here is the worst part — end up chained to the dang limo, which they must pull with their own body weight. These women weigh like, 100 pounds. It's hard to know exactly how much that particular limo weighs, but they seem to be about 4,000 pounds on average. Which is heavier than all the women on this date plus Colton put together. It seems like a really good way to slip a disc? Somehow, no one seems to be sweating.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTayshia attempts it and fails. But then Caitlin steps up to the pitch and — after everyone has just expressed their doubts that she will make that limo budge — she moves it in a display of athleticism never before seen on this terrible show. It is an amazing feat of Bachelor strength, making her truly the strong woman Colton deserv– wait, hold up, we need an instant replay. Are those a producer's hands on the steering wheel?\n\nQuite frankly, it's a perfect metaphor for The Bachelor itself: The women might think they're pulling the drama along, but a producer is not-so-secretly driving the whole thing. And while Caitlin is the only woman who can pull the limo, that proves to be the most interesting thing about her. She's unceremoniously dumped for not being interesting enough — a.k.a. not having any childhood traumas to milk for the camera — later that evening.

The assailants belonged to the Front de Libération du Québec, or FLQ, a militant group that called for the independence of their Francophone province in eastern Canada. Mr. Cross's kidnapping — followed shortly thereafter by the capture and then death of Pierre Laporte, Quebec's minister of labor — precipitated what Canadians call the October Crisis and made headlines around the world.\n\nMr. Cross, who endured 59 days of captivity before his release was secured through high-wire negotiations with the separatists, died Jan. 6 at his home in Seaford, in East Sussex, England. He was 99 and had covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, said his son-in-law, John Stringer.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe October Crisis, when soldiers policed the streets of Montreal and hundreds were arrested after Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked Canada's War Measures Act, represented a grim milestone in the long history of tensions surrounding the political status of Quebec.\n\nQuebec nationalists, many of whom at the time harbored economic grievances against the English-speaking majority of Canada, argued that the province was culturally distinct from the rest of the country and therefore should be politically independent as well.\n\nMr. Cross, who was born in Ireland and thus was well-acquainted with violent political passions, arrived in Montreal as trade commissioner in 1968. The FLQ, which had carried out a string of bombings, executed its most notorious attack the next year, detonating a bomb at the Montreal Stock Exchange that injured dozens.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen members of the FLQ kidnapped Mr. Cross, they demanded $500,000 in gold, the publication of a manifesto and the release of compatriots they described as political prisoners. They initially set a deadline of 48 hours, prompting Mr. Cross, he later said in an oral history with the University of Cambridge, to conclude that I must compose myself for death.\n\nAfter the manifesto aired on the radio, the militants agreed to extend the deadline, according to an obituary of Mr. Cross published by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nDuring his captivity, Mr. Cross was handcuffed and fed a quantity of food so insufficient, he said, that he lost 22 pounds. He was permitted to watch television and read — in addition to political tracts, his captors furnished him with French translations of the novels of Agatha Christie — and to pass time with single-player card games.\n\nA photo released weeks into his ordeal, showing Mr. Cross playing cards while seated on what appeared to be a container of explosives, became, in the description of the CBC, one of the most iconic photos in Canadian history, representative of the moment when Quebec appeared to be teetering on the brink of insurrection.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Cross also recalled keeping himself company by trying to excavate distant memories.\n\nYou have an awful lot of time to reflect, as you're sitting there hour after hour, day after day, he told the Montreal Gazette in 2004. One of the techniques I had was to try to relive a walk to school I did across fields when I was about 6 or 7.\n\nIn the beginning, he continued, I could recollect a few trees and things. By the end, I could probably recollect every blade of grass. I did the same things with holidays we took, books I'd read, films I'd seen — anything to occupy one's mind.\n\nMr. Cross's captors ultimately released him on the condition that they be permitted to flee to Cuba. (They later returned to Canada and served prison sentences.)\n\nAD\n\nSeeing daylight again, Mr. Cross told the Gazette, was the most beautiful sensation, to see sunlight which I had not seen for eight weeks.\n\nAD\n\nJames Richard Cross was born Sept. 29, 1921, in Nenagh, a town in County Tipperary. His mother, whose older child suffered from intellectual disabilities and was institutionalized, died in childbirth. Mr. Cross grew up on his father's farm and later with relatives.\n\nHe studied economics at Trinity College in Dublin, then joined the British army and was stationed in what was then the British Mandate of Palestine. According to the Gazette, he survived a Zionist attack on the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in 1946 that killed more than 90 people.\n\nAD\n\nHe subsequently joined the British civil service — later joking that he thought it would be a nice quiet occupation — and served in India and Malaysia before he was posted in Canada. After his kidnapping, he returned to England and spent the rest of his diplomatic career in London.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1995, Quebecois voters rejected a referendum proposing separation from Canada, but only by a margin of approximately 1 percentage point.\n\nMr. Cross's wife, the former Barbara Dagg, died in 2018 after 73 years of marriage, and their only child, Susan Cross, died in 2015. Mr. Cross had no immediate survivors.\n\nMr. Cross never condoned the kidnappers, his son-in-law said, but neither did he allow what they did to embitter him or eat into his enjoyment of life thereafter.\n\nHe never forgave them, Stringer observed, but never dwelled on the matter.
So why have they agreed to resume the government after having refused to cooperate for three years? And what comes next for Northern Ireland?\n\nUnhappy voters and the changing politics of Brexit changed politicians' incentives\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWithout anyone to make the necessary decisions since 2017, bread and butter issue areas such as health and education have fallen into crisis. In December, for example, almost 20,000 health service workers went on strike over low pay, inadequate staffing levels, dangerous conditions and a declining quality of care. Citizens have put intense pressure on politicians to do the jobs for which they continued to be paid despite the suspension.\n\nFurthermore, the politics of Brexit changed the political parties' calculations. From 2017 until the U.K. Parliament's December elections, the DUP enjoyed power as junior partner to the Conservative Party. However, the DUP was less influential than it had hoped; it was unable to prevent the British Parliament from extending same-sex marriage and abortion rights to people in Northern Ireland, despite its strong opposition. Perhaps more important, the DUP also failed to prevent Boris Johnson's government from approving a Brexit withdrawal deal that will leave Northern Ireland tied to the Republic of Ireland's economy and that of the European market — while creating trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe new U.K. government no longer depends on the DUP, as the Conservative Party won an outright majority. It declared that it would call new elections in Northern Ireland if the parties did not find common ground by Jan. 13. In the December U.K. elections, both Sinn Fein and the DUP lost votes to more centrist parties, so they had no appetite to face the voters again without making progress on issues that matter to them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe British House of Commons also passed Johnson's withdrawal deal Jan. 9 — suggesting that the U.K. is now very likely to exit the European Union on Jan. 31. Northern Ireland now needs locally accountable politicians to represent its interests throughout the transition, making the significant decisions about implementation that remain.\n\nNow the governing parties will have to deal with ordinary politics\n\nFor the past three years, government ministries have been running on autopilot. But now the DUP, Sinn Fein and the three other, smaller parties in the executive will have to deal with the backlog of neglected issues. They face pressure to reform the health care, education and welfare systems; invest in infrastructure and public services; address policing issues leftover from the Troubles; and devise new funding schemes to pay for all of this, possibly by taxing water. These mundane politics of governing are all complicated by the fact that the parties have multiple, competing agendas and little experience of trust or cooperation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe parties will also have to deal with the politically vexed question of language politics — specifically, the status of Irish (a Gaelic language) and Ulster Scots (a Scots dialect that is related to English) as official languages. Although Lithuanian and Polish are, after English, the most common first languages spoken in primary schools, the Irish and Ulster Scots languages are important symbols of culture and identity for nationalist/Catholic and unionist/Protestant identities respectively. Indeed, the DUP's refusal to back the Irish Language Act, which would have recognized the Irish language as an official language in Northern Ireland, was almost as central as the public works scandal was to the 2017 collapse of government.\n\nAs part of the agreement to go back into government, both parties agreed to support legislation that would create an Office of Identity and Cultural Expression and appoint commissioners to enhance the development of both languages, although in slightly different contexts: the use of Irish by public authorities and the use of Ulster Scots in arts and literature. Given that the two sides have been wrestling over the language issue since 1998, if not before, working through the details and implementing the legislation will be challenging.\n\nFurther, the multi-party government will have to decide what Boris Johnson's Brexit deal will mean for trade within and from Northern Ireland. For now, Northern Ireland will remain in the E.U.'s regulatory framework\n\n— while goods coming from Northern Ireland into the rest of Great Britain will have to go through customs checks. That sign of separation from the U.K. troubles the DUP. The Northern Ireland parties will have to agree whether to make that permanent or find some other solution to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, which would antagonize Sinn Fein and threaten to reignite the Troubles. They will also have to work with the British and Irish governments on the details of hundreds of separate and related matters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAll of this comes amid fundamental changes to Northern Ireland itself. Changing demographics are making Irish unification more plausible in the near term, as nationalists, who wish to have Northern Ireland leave the U.K. and unite with the Republic of Ireland, become more dominant. Nationalists make up a majority of legislators in Northern Ireland for the first time. If the government were to hold a referendum on unification, as the Good Friday Agreement provides for, polls suggest that unification would pass with a slight majority. There is no guarantee that such a referendum will take place, or would pass, but even the possibility could reignite tensions or even lead to violent conflict between the communities.\n\nKimberly Cowell-Meyers is assistant professor in the School of Public Affairs at American University.
These emails are extremely detailed accounts of prepping bodies (they don't complain), transporting bodies, preparing for funerals, placing the heavy casket over the grave on slings and straps, and then waiting for the family to leave so they can lower the casket down (sometimes it seems like forever).\n\nAmy, I am struggling with these emails, thinking that if I were the one fighting for my life, I would not want to read or hear about this.\n\nAD\n\nThese details upset me, but I am more concerned about my older brother and how this affects him.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, I don't want to open up a can of worms.\n\nMy husband says to stay out of it.\n\nI am not sure what to do.\n\nDo you have any thoughts or suggestions about what I might say?\n\n— Grieving\n\nGrieving: First off, making fun of the important and sacred work of preparing a body for burial (they don't complain) is extremely unprofessional and insensitive.\n\nEvery body passing through this funeral home was a loved one, friend or family member of someone who has paid the funeral home for this important service. The deceased and their family members should be respected, in the moment of preparing for burial and afterward.\n\nAD\n\nYour twin brother desperately requires sensitivity training.\n\nWhen your husband advises you to stay out of it, what is he saying? These emails are addressed to you, and so I'd say that you are already in it.\n\nAD\n\nThese notifications upset you, and so you have the right (and responsibility) to tell your brother the truth about how they affect you.\n\nI suggest that you send him an email: I can tell by your detailed descriptions that your work is engrossing. I am truly happy for you that you seem to love your job. However, being totally honest, I find the detailed discussions of what happens behind the scenes at the funeral home very unsettling — in no small part because our older brother is fighting for his own life. I don't know how he feels about these descriptions, but in my sisterly opinion, I wish you would be more sensitive.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: My mother passed away in 1996. She gave me her wedding ring.\n\nMy youngest nephew, who is also my mom's youngest grandson, was getting married a second time to a girl I actually thought would be the one. (His first marriage ended in divorce.)\n\nAD\n\nAnyway, I gave my nephew my mother's ring for this wedding. He was so moved that he cried. I knew he loved the idea.\n\nWell, the second marriage lasted only five years.\n\nMy nephew has three daughters from his first marriage, and I would prefer the ring stay in the family.\n\nDo I have the right to ask for the ring back?\n\n— Hoping\n\nHoping: You have the right to ask for anything, as long as your expectations are reasonable.\n\nAD\n\nI'm assuming that your nephew gave this ring to his second wife. State laws seem to vary concerning whether wedding rings are marital property (belonging to both and subject to division upon divorce) or separate property (individually owned). Family heirlooms are often considered a separate category, and (according to my research) a judge might ask that the ring be returned to your family.\n\nAD\n\nIf the two of them did not divorce through a court, but have a cordial relationship, your nephew could certainly ask his ex if she would return the ring to keep it in your family.\n\nYes, you have the right to ask if he would be willing to try.\n\nDear Amy: Hurt in Ohio was very upset because one sibling received all of the family photo albums after their mother's death.\n\nAD\n\nThank you for pointing out that parents should divide photos with the goal to pass them along to all family members.\n\nMy mother prepared albums or each of her children and left other photos with the direction that we should share and swap them.\n\n— Grateful\n\nGrateful: Family photos are of little monetary value, but their emotional value is impossible to measure.
It seems so surreal, you're so used to it not being this way, said Joe Darger, a Utah polygamist who has three wives.\n\nUtah Gov. Gary R. Herbert (R) has indicated he will probably sign the proposal that makes polygamy between consenting adults an infraction, like a traffic offense, that carries no jail time.\n\nAD\n\nThis one has overwhelming support, though it's not without some controversy, Herbert said during his monthly news conference at PBS Utah on Thursday. Eliminating it from being a felony to a lesser offense is probably warranted.\n\nAD\n\nSome former members of polygamous groups have said that essentially decriminalizing the practice could embolden abusers.\n\nThe legislature is jumping off a ledge without looking at the landing, said Ryan Fisher, a spokesman for the anti-polygamy group Sound Choices Coalition. The bill got approval from the full legislature after a final procedural vote in the Senate on Friday.\n\nThe belief that plural marriage brings exaltation in heaven is a legacy of the early Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The mainstream faith abandoned the practice in 1890 under pressure from the U.S. government and now strictly forbids it, but it has persisted.\n\nAD\n\nThose who practice it have one legal marriage and multiple spiritual wives. The TV show Sister Wives chronicles the lives of one man and his four wives.\n\nAD\n\nThe Utah attorney general has publicly declined to prosecute otherwise law-abiding polygamists for years, but the Sister Wives family left the state shortly after going public, saying they were afraid of prosecution. They later lost an attempt to overturn the polygamy law in court.\n\nThe Republican sponsoring the proposed change, Sen. Deidre Henderson, has argued that notorious polygamous leaders such as Warren Jeffs have weaponized state law to keep followers from interacting with the outside world or going to police. Henderson's proposal still includes harsher punishments for crimes linked to polygamy, such as coerced marriage and sexual abuse.\n\nAD\n\nJeffs is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting girls he considered plural wives.\n\nFears of the outside world were real for Alina Darger, one of Joe Darger's wives. As a teenager, she was afraid to tell police about a stranger who exposed himself to her and a friend.\n\nAD\n\nI was afraid if I did they'd come to the house and see my dad had two wives and take us away, she said. Now the head of a nonprofit outreach group called Cherish Families, Alina Darger said the legal change will help her connect polygamous communities to services ranging from child welfare to student loans.\n\nI deserve to be able to call on law enforcement, she said. I deserve the same rights as other people.
Like most parents these days, Cardi had indeed heard Baby Shark, never mind that her daughter, Kulture, isn't nearly old enough yet to demand control of the stereo. Just two days before Chance's inquiry, she tweeted lyrics from the track, inspiring knowing replies from a range of celebrity parents. Several weeks later, she referred to herself and rapper Offset, Kulture's father, as MOMMY SHARK & DADDY SHARK in an Instagram caption.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhether this strikes you as heartwarming or lame, you're not wrong. Embracing such inanity is part and parcel of parenthood; loving your children often means subjecting yourself to that which they love, sometimes at the apparent cost of your dignity. And if you're the parent of a young child, you've probably been subjected to Baby Shark repeatedly and relentlessly. I speak from experience, but also, the data speaks for itself.\n\nThe version of Baby Shark by South Korean educational brand Pinkfong went viral in America this year, following a three-year buildup overseas. As of August, it had already surpassed its fellow Korean export Gangnam Style in YouTube views, and the phenomenon has continued to build since then. Besides the official video, featuring two children doing hand motions against a cheap animated backdrop, there is, of course, a #BabySharkChallenge, featuring all kinds of people doing the same. James Corden got Sophie Turner and Josh Groban to perform a dramatic rendition, noting, As a father of three young children, I've heard it many … many … many times.\n\nIf you have any interaction with toddlers or their parents, you've probably heard Baby Shark. Maybe you've even experienced it in the wild — the Mississippi State marching band recently trolled archrival Ole Miss by playing the song. But did you know there's a remix EP with Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day, lullaby, and pirate versions of Baby Shark, plus one at 1.5x the original bpm? Did you know Baby Shark is the opening track on a 20-song album called Pinkfong Animal Songs that includes such modern classics as The Penguin Dance, Jungle Boogie (not a Kool and the Gang cover), and one in which a bunch of animals propose marriage to each other? And did you know that the same company has a bunch of other releases such as Pinkfong Best Kid Songs, a 48-track behemoth comprising classic nursery rhymes like The Muffin Man, Hickory Dickory Dock, and The Farmer In the Dell?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMuch to my dismay, I know these things. As the father of daughters ages 3 and 1, I've spent an inordinate amount of time with Pinkfong music this year: in the car, in the living room, in my head even when I'm not with the kids. I have been known to start singing Baby Shark and other Pinkfong recordings spontaneously. The only escape from the company's music is the Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood discography, a vast and growing library of Disney titles, or my progeny's latest fixation, the YouTube phenomenon called Mother Goose Club.\n\nYou might say I have children's music coming out of my head, shoulders, knees, and toes.\n\nThis was not the plan back in 2015 when my first daughter was born. Immediately I began singing her cutesy, baby-friendly variations on Can't Feel My Face and Fetty Wap's My Way and subjecting her to my record collection. On my wife's phone there is a video of me dancing awkwardly to King Kunta — seated on the floor by the coffee table, hands in the air like I just don't care — while my daughter looks on, mystified.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy hope was to foist my own version of dad rock on my kids within reason, somehow raising children with impeccable taste while avoiding consigning them to social alienation. The idea was simply to share some of my enthusiasms with the people who matter to me most.\n\nInstead, my girls ended up forcing their music on me. Children's songs now make up a significant chunk of my daily listening. There is a protective aspect to it — funny how the avant-garde need not be moral goes out the window when screening content for a young child — but also simultaneously a dropping of my own guard, lowering the barriers I've erected to prevent myself from associating with music I deem beneath me. Suddenly family dance parties to Baby Shark are the norm, and the handful of current pop hits that work their way into the playlist are invariably the radio edits.\n\nAs a professional critic and lifelong music fanatic, to call this transition a blow to my pride feels inadequate. It's more like the slow, steady murder of my ego. Not only do I suddenly have to worry about whether the clean version of Tha Carter V is sufficiently kid-safe to blast on the way to the zoo, I mostly don't get the chance to pick the tunes at all. Armed with formidable cuteness and the ability to launch into catastrophic meltdowns on a whim, preschoolers are extremely persuasive.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLiving life under these circumstances, you learn to appreciate the little things, like the back-to-back tracks on the Jake And The Never Land Pirates album that resemble '70s Eno and the Clash respectively, or the song on the Doc McStuffins album that sounds exactly like the New Pornographers. Sometimes this means smiling to myself upon realizing They Might Be Giants wrote and performed the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse theme song (and Hot Dog!).\n\nMaybe it's Stockholm syndrome, but I've even come to like some of these songs on their own merits. Some of those Daniel Tiger jams are practically Beatles-esque. And I certainly don't mind my kids imbibing lyrics like, In some ways we are different, but in so many ways we are the same and Sometimes you feel two feelings at the same time, and that's okay. Yes, I am that dad now, the one who delights in exposing my kids to positive messages. I am extremely wholesome and deeply uncool.\n\nLike so much about parenting, my gradual submission to children's music has challenged my self-image and caused me to become much lamer than I ever thought I'd allow — or more likely, it's peeled away layers of pretense to reveal the herb who was there all along. My wife and I used to blast the Frozen soundtrack before we had kids. I was raised on Christian rock. I started cracking dad jokes as soon as I was old enough to bask in the chorus of groans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI should have seen this coming.\n\nSo, too, should have Chance, Cardi, and Corden, all of whom were irrepressibly corny long before they reproduced. A rapper who rode a drama-club tribute to his grandma to fame, another who came up via VH1 reality shows, the ebullient Briton who invented Carpool Karaoke — of course they're all-in on Baby Shark.\n\nIn that case, maybe there's still hope for the childless among you to maintain your street cred even after when raising kids. Maybe parenthood will whittle away your exterior posturing to reveal the real you is unimpeachably hip. Maybe your kids will get way into Deafheaven before kindergarten. As for me, I have fully surrendered to my fate of hearing Little Bunny Foo Foo 15 times in a row tomorrow — and no, not the Moldy Peaches version.\n\nAD\n\nChris DeVille is senior news editor at the music site Stereogum.

Rewilding\n\nHow does someone move through — or beyond — a devastating loss? For January Gill O'Neil, part of the answer lies in the title of her third book, Rewilding (CavanKerry Press). These finely wrought poems, many of which focus on the breakup of her marriage, weave together poignant details and a palpable desire to revert to a wilder, previous state. O'Neil nimbly captures the impact and import of seemingly small moments, as in Hoodie, where she fears for the safety of her adolescent son, the darkest child/ on our street and wonders who could mistake him/ for anything but good. As the speaker navigates her changing life, the pieces gracefully move from domestic scenes to a larger sense of community and the world. In the gorgeous poem How a Star Dies, she notes that Sometimes gravity wins. Sometimes stars burn bright/ and hot but cool off quickly and beyond our reach.\n\nHow the End First Showed\n\nHow the End First Showed (University of Wisconsin), by D.M. Aderibigbe, is a powerful testament to the women in his family — especially his grandmother and mother — who were abused for years by the men they loved. Aderibigbe, who grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, won the Brittengham Prize for this striking collection. The book quietly challenges his native country's entrenched ideas about male supremacy and shows how the strength and resilience of women help repair what has been broken. As he examines a painful legacy and questions the present, he creates remarkably memorable poems and posits haunting questions. In Colors of My Childhood, he wonders, Could there ever be a boy's childhood/ built outside his father's/ shadow? My mother/ could not outlive this question./ If my son requests to see/ my distant past, Father,/ do you ever wonder/ what color it would appear?\n\nAlso of Note:\n\nCraig Morgan Teicher explores how poets progress and learn from one another in We Begin in Gladness(Graywolf). This fantastic collection of essays begins with insightful descriptions of poetry as an art of listening and the poet's task as hearing clearly, as much as possible, the voice of the mind, the voice that gathers, packs with meaning, and unpacks the language the poet knows. Teicher, an acclaimed poet and critic, then delves into a rich analysis of how several major writers — including Sylvia Plath, John Berryman and W.S. Merwin — moved from apprentice pieces to genius writing, or continued to produce virtuosic work over time. Every section will deepen your understanding of the creative arc and will make you rethink what's possible when one continues to forge ahead.\n\nNatasha Trethewey's Monument (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) is a glorious example of what results when one listens — and writes — brilliantly. Throughout this retrospective, which draws from four books and a chapbook, and includes 11 new poems, Trethewey blends a distinctive voice with striking images and perspectives. Those who are new to her work will marvel at her ability to address difficult subjects — slavery, the challenges of mixed-race families and the murder of her mother — with precision and compassion. These pages clearly demonstrate why Trethewey, whose honors include the Pulitzer Prize and two terms as poet laureate of the United States, is one of our preeminent poets. They also remind us that her work is loved because she refuses to forget those who've been lost and the struggles of those who remain.\n\nbookworld@washpost.com\n\nElizabeth Lund writes about poetry every month for The Washington Post.
My husband and I attended both weddings. Now the woman is angry and not speaking to me because we attended her ex's wedding. She says he has a win because now he will say we are better friends with him than with her.\n\nWe flew across the country to attend her beautiful wedding, but barely crossed the street for his — it was in our home town. His children invited us to his wedding and really, we are planning to continue to be friendly with him, even though I am closer to her.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDid I do wrong by attending his wedding? I have tried to talk with her and she keeps claiming hurt feelings. Now I am just angry and thinking I am being used as a weapon against her ex-husband.\n\n— Feeling Used\n\nFeeling Used: It's possible you're being used, but I don't think you're a weapon against the ex. At least, that's not at the root.\n\nA grown woman angry to the point of ending a friendship because her ex got a 'win'  is not playing with a full emotional deck. When you're faced with anger that doesn't make sense — when the stated reasons for it just don't add up — it helps to think of the anger as useful in some way to the person feeling it. Presumably she wouldn't manufacture and maintain such a grudge otherwise.\n\nAD\n\nSo maybe this anger . . . helps your friend feel vindicated in the divorce? Keeps her connected to her ex where she's not ready to let go? Keeps alive her hope of getting the apology or restitution or revenge she thinks she deserves? Satisfies a need to blame?\n\nAD\n\nOr does it serve as a simple alternative to a more complicated anger she hasn't reckoned with yet? Getting angry at you, after all — and through you getting angry all over again at her ex, nice bonus — is a lot easier than getting angry at herself.\n\nThat's not to say she should (or shouldn't) be angry at herself; her current tantrum notwithstanding, she may long since have reckoned with her part in the marital failure and served her emotional time. I'm saying only that anger turned outward is a lot less complicated than turning it inward, and as such comes in handy for people who aren't ready to face themselves. It's both a convenient distraction from uncomfortable things and a form of self-soothing, where she gets to be right and righteous. And it's common, therefore always worth considering whenever the feelings don't fit the crime.\n\nAD\n\nThis is all to help you understand your friend's reaction better; it doesn't really affect what you do about it, because her not speaking to you (right?) takes care of that. You have two friends who divorced; you chose to stay friends with both; if you regretted that, then you'd need to apologize for it, but since you don't, you don't. You apparently see your choice as fair, so stand by it. I hope for both of your sakes she cools off and retracts her complaint.\n\nAD\n\nHi, Carolyn: We are a recently married couple, taking a vacation to New York City with my parents, brother and his wife. My husband happens to have quite a bit of extended family in the city, so he asked me if we could join his family for lunch. This includes aunts, uncles, cousins, and his mom and sister, who happen to be in town.\n\nI am certainly happy to spend time with them, but I feel awkward telling my parents we will be going to have a meal with my in-laws and they are not invited to join.\n\nAD\n\nIn fact, I find it a little rude because I know my family would absolutely invite his family over without a second thought. I know my parents will find it a little rude and unusual as well. It is simply a matter of courtesy and hospitality.\n\nWhen I mentioned to my husband that it was an awkward situation, he said my family was welcome to join us all at church. So clearly he does not think there is anything wrong with this.\n\nAD\n\nAm I making a mountain out of a molehill, or should I press for my family to be included?\n\n— Uncomfortable\n\nUncomfortable: Neither, actually. It is important and it isn't just about this lunch.\n\nThe circumstances of your trip have exposed a cultural divide between you and your husband, where his norm is your rude. For the health of your marriage, please point it out to your husband nonjudgmentally, explain how you feel about it and say you'd like to talk about ways to reconcile it that both of you can embrace.
Mr. Mehta wrote for the New Yorker magazine for more than three decades, reporting on Oxford philosophers, Christian theologians, Noam Chomsky's polarizing linguistic theories and the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi, whose disciples he spent years interviewing in the 1970s, long after the Indian independence leader was assassinated.\n\nAD\n\nBut his chief subject was loss — including the loss of his sight, which disappeared after he was diagnosed with meningitis at age 3; the loss of his home in Lahore, which he and his family were forced to flee after the partition of India; the loss of his language, Punjabi, which he traded for English; and the loss of his country, which he left as a teenager to study in Arkansas, beginning a Western education that included stops at Oxford and Harvard.\n\nAD\n\nI don't belong to any single tradition, he told the New York Times in 1984. I am an amalgam of five cultures — Indian, British, American, blind and the New Yorker.\n\nMr. Mehta discussed his blindness in his first book, the autobiography Face to Face (1957), which he wrote in his early 20s partly as a romantic ploy, an unsuccessful attempt to woo a Pomona College classmate whom he hired to take dictation eight hours a day, six days a week. But for many years he avoided the subject, refusing to let publishers reference his blindness on dust jackets.\n\nAD\n\nHe wanted to compete on equal terms, his wife said in a phone interview, explaining that Mr. Mehta wanted to be viewed as a writer, not a blind writer.\n\nTraveling without a guide dog or white cane, Mr. Mehta used what he called facial vision, learning to distinguish the roar of a Chevrolet from a Ford and to identify visitors by the sound of their footsteps. In his book Fly and the Fly-Bottle (1963), about British intellectuals, he described historian Herbert Butterfield as puffing every so often at his Player's, which had a permanent place on his lower lip.\n\nAD\n\nPeople would think that was a visual description, said Mr. Mehta, but it was purely an auditory impression, the result of a cigarette that made his subject talk like Humphrey Bogart. Similarly, he explained that he was able to describe landscapes — including a field with the yellow of mustard flowers outlined by the feathery green of sugarcane — partly through smell. If I'm in the Punjab in the spring and I smell mustard flowers, I know what color they are, he said.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Mehta placed himself in the lineage of blind writers such as Homer and Milton, although some critics accused him of playing tricks on readers by failing to disclose his sightlessness. He used a Braille typewriter early in his career but spent decades working with amanuenses, dictating to them pages that he wrote in his head and revised out loud — millions of words in all, spanning 27 books.\n\nNearly half of those works made up his autobiographical project, known as Continents of Exile. The series began with two biographies of his parents, Daddyji (1972) and Mamaji (1979), who put him on a train to Bombay when he was 5, sending him to a school for the blind more than 1,000 miles from home. To this day I can't hear the sound of a train without shedding tears in my head, Mr. Mehta once said.\n\nAD\n\nThose early volumes won critical acclaim, and Mr. Mehta received a financial boost in 1982 by winning a $236,000 MacArthur Fellowship, commonly known as a genius grant. He drew further praise with books including The Ledge Between the Streams (1984), which examined his childhood as well as the violence of the 1947 partition, in which British India was divided into two independent states.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Mehta was 13 at the time, and he later wrote that his Hindu family applied a coat of fireproof paint to their home and slept in their clothes, ready to flee from rioting neighbors who wanted them out of Lahore, a predominantly Muslim city in present-day Pakistan.\n\nIn a very quiet way, Ved Mehta is breaking the Western stereotypes and getting America to look at India as something other than a grandiose stage setting, Robin Lewis, an Indian literature professor at Columbia University, told the Times after the book's release. He's taking the raw material of his personal experience and combining it with some of the pains, crises and historical dislocations that India has gone through.\n\nAD\n\nThe fifth of seven children, Ved Parkash Mehta was born in Lahore on March 21, 1934. His father was a British-educated doctor and public health official who diagnosed his meningitis; his mother, a homemaker, sought to restore his vision through folk cures that included applying raw eggs to his eyes.\n\nAD\n\nI felt that blindness was a terrible impediment, and that if only I exerted myself, and did everything my big sisters and big brother did, I could somehow become exactly like them, he wrote in The Ledge Between the Streams. To that end, he joined his siblings in neighborhood kite battles, clambering over rooftops while flying kites with strings covered in powdered glass.\n\nWithout knowing it, during the kite chases I was learning how to get around — by sensing the currents of air and by listening to the patter of feet on a roof, to the scrapes of shoes along a wall, he wrote. He became more independent after studying in Bombay, now Mumbai, where he learned Braille, bicycling, roller skating, horseback riding and rudimentary English.\n\nAD\n\nWhile the blind in India historically became beggars or made cane chairs, Mr. Mehta initially pursued a career in academia. After studying at the Arkansas School for the Blind, which he said was the only place that would have me, he graduated from Pomona in 1956 and received a scholarship to study history at the University of Oxford.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Mehta received a second bachelor's degree in 1959, followed by a master's degree in history from Harvard in 1961. By then he had started writing for magazines, contributing to the Atlantic and Saturday Review before submitting to the New Yorker at the suggestion of British newspaper editor David Astor, to whom he had pitched a 14,000-word travel piece about a recent trip to India.\n\nSomething that long and boring only the New Yorker would publish, Astor said. Mr. Mehta called the New Yorker's editor, William Shawn, who invited him to the office for tea and published the article in January 1960, later praising Mr. Mehta's airy, elegant, marvelously clear style.\n\nAD\n\nHis kindness and generosity, Mr. Mehta wrote of Shawn, made me believe that I was not losing myself to him but, rather, discovering my true self — that, for once, I was, as it were, speaking not in an Indian-American voice or an English voice but in my own.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Mehta remained at the New Yorker until 1994, two years after the arrival of editor Tina Brown, whom he described as cold and unresponsive. He later wrote a memoir, Remembering Mr. Shawn's New Yorker (1998), describing the magazine as a haven for writers as well as a cauldron of neurosis and frustration under Shawn, who was soft-spoken but despotic.\n\nMr. Mehta was himself accused of highhandedness at times, notably in a 1989 article in the satirical magazine Spy, in which former assistants described him as patronizing and domineering. By all accounts, he could be contemptuous of bores and dullards.\n\nAD\n\nHe would tell you point-blank, 'You bore me. I never want to see you again,'  Columbia University historian Stephen E. Koss told the Times. Friends said he softened after his marriage in 1983 to Linn Cary, the niece of New Yorker writer Henry S.F. Cooper.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to his wife, survivors include two daughters, Natasha Mehta and Sage Mehta Robinson, all of Manhattan; two sisters; and two granddaughters.\n\nMr. Mehta became a naturalized American citizen in 1975, renouncing his Indian citizenship in protest of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's autocratic rule. He later taught writing at schools including Yale and Columbia, and completed his autobiographical odyssey with The Red Letters (2004), which returned to the subject of his father.\n\nWhen I started to write, I wanted to see how I could exploit my other senses, Mr. Mehta told the Times in 1972, after publishing the series's first volume. I reached the point where I wanted to experiment. To really plumb the depths of the experiment, I wanted to explore my own life. I think of autobiographical writing as a letter to myself.
This has caused me to have a number of affairs. I'm not proud of that.\n\nWhen I was single, I had never cheated on any of my girlfriends, but began cheating on my wife after two years of marriage.\n\nThe biggest reason I never left my wife was that I could not bear the thought of not seeing my young kids daily (who are now adults), and also the financial struggles divorce would bring.\n\nAD\n\nI now struggle with a different heartache and ask myself — is this the way I want to spend my remaining years?\n\nAD\n\n— Unhappy Husband\n\nUnhappy Husband: It is hard to feel sorry for you — the heartsore man who deliberately chose to marry a very nice woman you've never loved, because you were so afraid of being hurt.\n\nAnd yet, I do feel compassion for you. I can imagine that at this point in your life, you might look back and recognize how very cowardly some of your choices have been.\n\nI think, too, of your wife. You don't have much to say about her, which reveals how sidelined she is.\n\nYou are sidelined, too. You seem to have lost track of your emotional core. Your early heartbreak may have traumatized you and stunted your emotional maturing. It's as if you closed and locked a door.\n\nAD\n\nI assume that as much as you obviously love your children, you also remain somewhat hidden from them. I hope that over the years you have encouraged them to be more emotionally present and brave than you have been.\n\nAD\n\nNo, I don't think this is the way you want to spend your remaining years.\n\nYou would definitely benefit from therapy. I'm talking about deep, emotional work with a therapist who specializes in working with men in midlife.\n\nUnlocking that long-locked door will bring you in closer touch with the authentic man who has been hiding behind his heartache and using infidelity as a remedy and excuse.\n\nBravely diving into your capacity for intimacy might even unleash genuine feelings for your wife that you have been suppressing.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: As I think about the new year unfolding, my thoughts of a past friendship arise.\n\nI am not sure what I did, or what I said, but back in 2016 a dear friend stopped talking to me.\n\nI tried on several occasions to reconnect, and included apologies, as I was certain that I must have done something to warrant this unexpected rejection.\n\nAD\n\nWe became friends back in 1997, but here I am five years after our last contact and still on the outs with this friend.\n\nI am heartbroken over it. I hope and pray that we may connect again one day.\n\nMy thinking is that maybe I should write a letter (not email or phone call). Is this a futile step?\n\nI am just wondering if you have any wise words to provide, since you have insight into relationships.\n\nAD\n\nI am not even sure how to start the letter, and I'm afraid of rejection again.\n\n— Still Hoping in Friendship\n\nStill Hoping in Friendship: The worst thing about being ghosted, very suddenly, is that you are left assuming that you have said or done something deeply offensive.\n\nAccording to you, you have tried several times to get to the bottom of this break. You have issued presumably vague apologies for something you might have done.\n\nAD\n\nBut maybe it's not you. Maybe it's your friend. People who are depressed, overwhelmed or who feel ashamed sometimes pull away suddenly.\n\nSend your friend an email or letter. Don't dwell on this silence. Send a newsy missive catching them up on what you've been up to. Say, I think of you often and would love to hear how you are doing. I hope you'll be in touch.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: One of your readers wondered if consuming three drinks a night made him an alcoholic.\n\nI can answer firsthand: It does not — until it does.\n\nDrinking with regularity is like gambling — the house always wins.\n\n— Recovering in Annapolis\n\nRecovering in Annapolis: What a brilliant response. Congratulations on your own recovery, and thank you for this wisdom.
At issue was a vacancy on the State Corporation Commission, a three-judge panel that regulates public utilities, banking, insurance and other commerce. Chartered in the early 1900s to oversee the railroad monopolies, the SCC is an independent body sometimes called the fourth branch of the state government.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn recent years, though, its power has been diminished by the General Assembly, culminating last year when legislators passed an overhaul of utility regulation that set strict limits on the SCC's oversight of Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power.\n\nOne of the three SCC judges stepped down more than a year ago, and lawmakers had been unable to agree on a replacement. The Senate, in particular, has slowed the process as Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City) feuded with a handful of Republicans who jumped ship last year to join Democrats in voting to expand Medicaid.\n\nWhen the issue of judicial appointments came up Tuesday in the House of Delegates, Toscano asked Republican leaders whether they expected action on the SCC vacancy. House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) basically shrugged and said he hadn't heard anything from the Senate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt is much more likely that anything involving the State Corporation Commission will be at a much later date, Gilbert said.\n\nAround 5 o'clock Tuesday evening, though, word spread that the Senate had a name.\n\nAfter the House floor session began at noon Wednesday, Speaker Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights) called a recess so the Commerce and Labor Committee could hold an unusual, 30-minute meeting to interview the SCC candidate who had emerged with full approval of the Senate Republican caucus.\n\nAnd when Democrats learned the name, they were unhappy: It was Patricia West, a former circuit court judge from Virginia Beach who was chief deputy to former Republican state attorney general Ken Cuccinelli II. West joined Cuccinelli in a number of controversial actions, including challenges to federal environmental protections and the Affordable Care Act and defending Virginia's ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe currently serves on the faculty at Regent University in Virginia Beach.\n\nWhat information we have been able to find on social media and in her writings gives us great pause, said Del. Alfonso H. Lopez (D-Arlington), who complained that the last-minute nomination gave lawmakers no time to fully vet her. West has an active Twitter account and regularly retweets posts from Franklin Graham, Ann Coulter and other conservative icons.\n\nRepublicans countered that West is a well-known figure in Richmond and Hampton Roads. And they pointed out another factor: Because the chairman of the SCC is also a woman, West's appointment would give the agency its first female majority.\n\nAD\n\nFor those on the other side preaching equality, here's your chance, folks, to practice what you preach, said Del. Kathy J. Byron (R-Bedford).\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats countered that, politics aside, a candidate for the SCC needed more than 30 minutes of review before being appointed. All we're asking for is fairness and vetting, said House Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn (D-Fairfax).\n\nDuring the brief committee meeting, West presented herself to lawmakers and answered questions. She told the lawmakers that if elected to the SCC, she would carry out the will of the General Assembly as opposed to setting policy of her own.\n\nI really do believe with all my heart that a statutory agency is one that can be — I mean, we defer to what you want. That's the job of a judge. The General Assembly tells us what the priorities are, what the policies are, and then we apply the facts that are presented to us, West said.\n\nAD\n\nThat position riled some Democrats, who say that the point of the SCC is to be independent of the General Assembly. This is not a statutory agency; this is a constitutional agency, said Del. Mark L. Keam (D-Fairfax). It's not subservient to the General Assembly.\n\nAD\n\nEvery attempt to slow West's nomination, though, was defeated by the slim Republican majority. She won the appointment on a party-line vote, with support from all 51 Republicans. None of the 49 Democrats voted, a show of protest because, by tradition, legislators do not cast no votes against judges.\n\nGilbert, the majority leader, didn't deny that West's election was a matter of brute political force but said Virginians will appreciate having a highly qualified, strong female judge on the SCC.
At its core, Mansfield Park is a love story between Fanny and Edmund Bertram, and I promised my editor that the main characters in my novel would live happily ever after.\n\nEvery night for two months, I worked on the story. Twenty-thousand words into the manuscript, my characters were on their way to romance, sharing long glances and uninhibited smiles. I was pulling for them, writing F + E = 4 Evah in marginalia. I knew that, by 50,000 words they would be ready for their first kiss; at 100,000 words they'd be walking down the aisle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExcept that first kiss didn't happen. My ability to write the story of a budding romance died before I even reached 25,000 words. EdAnny stalled. At the same time, so did my marriage.\n\nOn Nov. 15, I left my husband.\n\nI couldn't separate what was happening in my personal life from my writing. I couldn't make love happen on the page when I couldn't make it happen in reality. I couldn't do much of anything but wake up, go to work, come home and crawl into bed. On nights I had the kids, I'd go through the bare minimum motions of suburban motherhood. I was mourning my previous life, and there wasn't room for writing in my grief.\n\nThe end of my 15-year marriage was relatively amicable (no possessions tossed out on the lawn, no restraining orders). But as the year came to a close, I growled every time I walked by my laptop. In that machine was a vile love story. There were hopeful characters in there, and I had nothing hopeful to offer them. Let them languish in their almost-love, their hearts never risking breaking.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWeeks passed and, eventually, I stopped growling. At this point, the guilt set in. My deadline was close, and my manuscript was far from finished. In January, I finally mustered the courage to call my literary agent for advice.\n\nIt happens, she said, shrugging off the fact that I wouldn't make my deadline. I'll make some calls.\n\nA couple hours later I got a text letting me know my spring deadline had been moved to the fall. I had a reprieve. Apparently I wasn't the first romance author to go through a breakup or divorce while composing a novel, and, unfortunately, I wouldn't be the last.\n\nI spent the remainder of January living as if I weren't a writer. I was still grieving the end of my marriage, but I was finding ways to live again. My evenings were filled with dinners with friends, longer gym workouts, and hiking in the Shenandoah on the weekends. I promised myself that I'd get back to writing in February.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI didn't.\n\nBut I did get back to dating.\n\nI had convinced myself I was done with relationships for good. But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't stop thinking about one of my friends: his dimples, his kindness, his passion for adventure. He offered to give me a hug on a particularly foul day, and I told him I hated hugs (a lie!) out of fear that touching him would push me over some imaginary ledge.\n\nBecause I was so set on not falling for him, one night I texted him, confessed my feelings, and begged him to talk me out of them. Give me the friend-zone speech. Or the bad idea speech. Or the bad timing speech. Bring it. I need a formal rejection. I need zero hope.\n\nAD\n\nInstead of persuasion, he admitted to having a crush on me, too.\n\nSo now there's a guy, a guy with whom I've been sharing long glances and uninhibited smiles. Who is slowly restoring my belief in romance.\n\nAD\n\nI think that belief would have come back on its own, but it's easier with him there to remind me.\n\nI've tried to sit down a few times and add some words to Fanny's story. Both times ended with a slammed laptop cover and fleeting promises to try again the next day. The sting of my failed marriage is still too close to the surface. My characters are young, and they don't understand the risks they'll take by giving part of their hearts to another.\n\nI don't yet know when the words will come back. I'm confident, though, that they will.
I was embarrassed, she said of her decision not to tell. I didn't know how to explain it. I was so humiliated. And I'm a private person, when it comes to those things.\n\nAD\n\nOnly 1 in 4 sexual assaults are reported to the police, according to the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN). And 20 percent of female students report assaults to the police, RAINN says.\n\nAD\n\nThe senator, who was elected in 2014 after running on a staunchly conservative platform, adds a Republican voice to the national conversation about sexual assault, also known as #MeToo. Ernst's office declined an interview request from The Washington Post.\n\nI didn't want to share it with anybody, and in the era of hashtag-MeToo survivors, I always believed that every person is different and they will confront their demons when they're ready. And I was not ready, Ernst said.\n\nAD\n\nBut this week, court documents from her divorce became public, alleging physical and emotional abuse by her ex-husband, Gail Ernst, putting her private life in the spotlight. The documents were quickly sealed after initially being made public. The Post requested them Tuesday, but another order was filed that prevented access.\n\nAD\n\nThe Post attempted to contact Gail Ernst's lawyer, Ivan Miller, but his law office declined the request.\n\nWhile the documents' revelation that she had turned down a chance at being Donald Trump's running mate in 2016 made headlines, they also paint a portrait of a long-troubled marriage. They had married in 1992.\n\nHe hated any successes I had and would belittle me and get angry any time I achieved a goal, Ernst, 48, who is vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference and the only woman in Senate Republican leadership, said in an affidavit obtained by the Guardian.\n\nAD\n\nGail Ernst, writing in his own affidavit, insisted, I gave up all my aspirations and goals to be a good dad and husband so Joni could pursue her dreams.\n\nHe began hanging out at the babysitter's house, even when [their daughter] wasn't there, Ernst wrote in the affidavit, as reported by CityView. I confronted him about the situation, and we went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage. I very nearly filed for divorce after a night that we argued, and it became physical. I fled the house [with their daughter] and went to my mother's house in the middle of the night.\n\nAD\n\nShe alleged other affairs, while Gail Ernst claimed that she'd dated other men while in D.C., something the senator denies.\n\nAD\n\nWhat I want people to understand is that I was the same person I was last week, Ernst told the Des Moines Register after her divorce papers were made public. She continued, You just know more about what's inside of me now.\n\nWomen across the political spectrum voiced their support for Ernst. It makes me want to cry, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) told CNN on Thursday. Dingell has said she experienced sexual harassment in Washington, and vowed, I will be with Joni Ernst wherever she is trying to stick up for sexual assault survivors and domestic violence survivors. Because you do survive. You can go on. It doesn't define you but it never stops hurting.\n\nCongress has dealt with sexual misconduct allegations and investigations since the #MeToo movement began in 2017. Several male legislators resigned as a result of accusations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn late 2017, two high-profile controversies hit the Senate, and Ernst spoke out about both. After The Post revealed that Roy Moore, a Republican Senate candidate from Alabama, had allegedly dated underage girls, per her staff, Ernst said, If the allegations are true, he needs to step aside.\n\nThere is no place for sexual assault or harassment in our society, Ernst said in 2017, when Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) was accused of misconduct by multiple women. He later resigned because of pressure within his party.\n\nAt the same time, Ernst has been a staunch supporter of President Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by several women.\n\nShe also voted to confirm Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court after he had been accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford. Ford alleged that Kavanaugh and a friend had assaulted her at a party when they were in high school, and the two gave emotional testimony during the Senate confirmation process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nErnst told Bloomberg that her political positions did not contradict her status as a survivor. I do believe [Ford] experienced trauma, but the evidence and witnesses presented by her contradicted her story, she said.\n\nErnst is not the first Republican senator to share that she had been sexually abused. During her Senate campaign last year, Martha McSally (Ariz.) told the Wall Street Journal that she had been sexually abused by a high school coach. The adversity strengthened me so that I could be in a position to make a difference today, she later told The Post, referring to her decision to speak up.\n\nMcSally lost her Senate race but was later appointed to fill the seat of the late John McCain (R), and she now serves alongside Ernst.\n\nAlice Li contributed to this report.
It stopped when we were around 13 years old.\n\nI would be left with bruises for days, making it painful to sit down at school.\n\nI know that my older stepbrother only got the leather a few times and that my little brother only got a spanking from a wooden spoon.\n\nAD\n\nI am 30 years old now. My stepfather is a changed man. He is no longer the man that abused me, but is kind and loving.\n\nMy issue lies with my mother. Throughout all this, she never once told my stepfather to stop, or that we didn't deserve such an abusive form of punishment.\n\nAD\n\nWhenever I made my way out of the bedroom after a lashing, tears streaming down my face, I remember seeing only my mother's back. She never looked me in the eye. She never stood up for me, and I carry around hatred and bitterness toward her for that.\n\nNow my mother desperately wants to have a relationship with my sister and me. I see that she is heartbroken and confused as to why we struggle to have one with her. We desperately want one with her too, but we both can't drop our guard. I guess we both still believe that our mother hasn't changed — unlike our stepfather.\n\nAD\n\nMy mother is a soft and emotional woman. I don't know if having a conversation with her will just break her heart. Can I resolve this myself without demanding to know why she didn't stand up for me as a child?\n\nE\n\nE: If you could have resolved this by yourself, you probably would have done so already. It is significant that you have been able to forgive your abusive stepfather, and yet you hold onto bitterness and resentment toward your mother.\n\nAD\n\nYou might assume that the fearsome man that beat you with a leather belt also frightened your mother into submission. She couldn't make eye contact with you because she was afraid and ashamed.\n\nPhysical abuse threatens and intimidates the entire family. This is why cruel punishers often want others to witness what they do.\n\nAD\n\nIt is better for you to risk cracking open your mother's heart a little, allowing everyone to express their truth, versus extending an estrangement. You and your sister will get further with her if you don't gang up on her or overwhelm her. If all of you are desperate to have a relationship, commence the process with a determination to listen, try to understand, lean into forgiveness and love each other through it.\n\nDear Amy: Is it just me, or does everyone interrupt?\n\nI can be talking to anyone — even family members — and they'll interrupt me or talk over me.\n\nAD\n\nEven cable news panels talk over each other and interrupt.\n\nIs this new? Where are everyone's manners?\n\nAD\n\nWhy doesn't anyone care about what I say?\n\nAm I just too long-winded?\n\nIgnored\n\nIgnored: Great question. I do believe that we are all interrupting one another more often. I've read through two recent university studies demonstrating that men interrupt more frequently than women.\n\nAccording to a 2014 study from George Washington University, men interrupt 33 percent more frequently when they are talking to women, versus talking to other men.\n\nThis dynamic has extended to the Supreme Court. A separate study from Northwestern shows that male justices talk over female justices far more frequently than fellow male justices. With three female justices on the court, 65 percent of interruptions were directed at them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInterrupting is about establishing a power position.\n\nWhen you are being interrupted, lock eyes and say, I have a couple of other points I want to make. Then I'd love to hear what you think. Can you let me finish?\n\nDear Amy: Upset Girlfriend described her boyfriend's desire to have a drunken one-night stand in Vegas.\n\nWhile I agreed with your response regarding her need to be honest with him and also not control him, you neglected to point out that STDs are a real risk.\n\nSexually Safe\n\nSexually Safe: Absolutely. Thank you.
I understand that they were trying to prevent their father from rushing into marriage. On the other hand, we didn't really think we needed his children's permission to marry. Our romance was a bit of a whirlwind, but we have known each other for six years.\n\nMeeting his daughter upon our return from our honeymoon would have been my priority (she lives locally), but now I'm wondering if that will ever happen.\n\nAD\n\nNow that we are back home her father has been to see her, but he can't get her to acknowledge me or our marriage.\n\nAD\n\nI am very sad about all of this. Should I reach out to his children? If so, how should I begin?\n\nBaffled Bride\n\nBaffled Bride: Well, you're off to a bad start, and the person who could fix this — possibly quite quickly — is your husband.\n\nHe did not need his daughter's permission to GET married, and now he should stop trying to get her permission to BE married.\n\nHis marriage to you should be presented as a very happy occurrence, and his adult children should be encouraged in a friendly, firm and no-nonsense way, to accept it.\n\nYou don't say when your husband's late wife died, but you should all understand with compassion that his children might have difficulties with his new relationship. But they are adults. Giving them the option NOT to cope will not help them.\n\nAD\n\nIf your husband's daughter wants to have a happy and loving relationship with her father, she should be willing to meet you and accept the fact that you exist and that you are married to her father. She doesn't have to embrace you as a mother-figure, but yes, she does have to face reality.\n\nAD\n\nThe more often her father visits her without you, the more he is demonstrating through his actions that she has the option of rejecting you.\n\nYes, I think you should reach out. Write a friendly email inviting both of them to dinner on a specific night (if his son is in town). Expect that they will possibly ignore or reject the invitation. Choose not to take this personally — because how can you? You've never met!\n\nAD\n\nStrongly encourage your husband to handle this, quickly — otherwise you could face a divided household, and that is no way to run a family.\n\nDear Amy: Don't laugh at this, because it is getting serious.\n\nMy wife and I are retired and winter in the Southwest. We faithfully watch the popular game show Wheel of Fortune every night after supper.\n\nI found out about a month ago that the show was on an hour earlier back home in the Midwest, so I decided to have a friend of mine text me the answers before us watching it.\n\nAD\n\nMy wife and I are very competitive regarding who can come up with correct answers first.\n\nOf course, I get them all right, quite quickly!\n\nAt first, she was kind of amazed. Now it's getting serious.\n\nAD\n\nSome of my friends back home know what I'm doing, and I'm sure someone will tell her.\n\nHow can I get out of this situation before she finds out from someone else? She will be upset\n\nHooked on the Wheel\n\nHooked on the Wheel: Here's your clue: Two Words, 12 letters.\n\n(Stop cheating!)\n\nYou might want to taper down slowly, and gradually decline from savant status to mere mortal.\n\nAnd come clean with your wife. Do so over a nice dinner, present your confession in clue form and attach a prize for her correct guess.\n\nDear Amy: Regarding healing from emotional affairs, my husband and I both had them. We confessed our indiscretions and started marriage counseling. I secretly kept in contact with my affair partner for one more year. By doing this, I was wasting all we were investing in the counseling and our marriage.\n\nIt wasn't until I became honest with myself and completely ended my friendship and affair that my marriage could begin to heal.\n\nWe are about to celebrate 23 years of marriage and although it was painful and a hard lesson to learn, it brought us closer together in the long run.\n\nHappy Now\n\nHappy Now: Congratulations!
Our father is, of course, not perfect, and we know there are things in a marriage that only the marital partners see. However, it has always seemed to us that our father tries to make our mother happy. He has also never spoken an unkind word about her in our presence and has always insisted that we treat her with respect, no matter what she says or does.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSomehow, Mom and Dad are approaching their 50th anniversary and are still together. My sisters and I think we should have a special (albeit low-key) dinner in a private room at a nice, but not super-fancy, restaurant to recognize the occasion. We think it is the least we can do, because 50 years of marriage — even if the marriage has been troubled — is still an accomplishment.\n\nMy mother, of course, bristles at any acknowledgment of the occasion. My father realizes they don't have a perfect marriage, but seems to want to recognize the anniversary. In other words, we can't make them both happy. What is the proper thing to do in this situation?\n\nFrom your description, your mother's reaction to the proposed celebration is unpleasant and unsympathetic — but, given her past behavior, unsurprising.\n\nAD\n\nWhat, if anything, can be done? Miss Manners fears that you cannot force someone to be a guest of honor. But you can, privately, remind her that hers are not the only feelings to be considered. You can say that you know how unassuming she is, but that you and your sisters and the grandchildren would enjoy the celebration, and you know it would mean a lot to your father.\n\nAD\n\nIf she still refuses, you will have to find alternatives that do not require her consent, such as calling with chatty good wishes on the day, and sending flowers.\n\nDear Miss Manners: I've been notified of a friend's engagement. Others have stated that a gift is in order, some having already sent one. Is this something new?\n\nAD\n\nI thought that simply offering congratulations was sufficient for an engagement. As it is, I intend to send a present to the bridal shower and then another for the wedding. She'll also be having a baby shower before she walks down the aisle, and I will be shopping for that event, too.\n\nHow many gifts do I need to be giving here?\n\nTechnically, none: Presents are not actually required. But Miss Manners raises no objection if you have already steeled yourself for three presents.\n\nThat the necessity for a fourth gift was expressed not by the friend, but by unnamed (and incorrect) others, should make it easy enough to ignore.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

I recently discovered that the reason some ginkgo trees failed to produce their nauseating fruit in 2016 was the same reason apple production was way down: Two nights of successive frost in early April damaged the flowers at a critical moment.\n\nIn Washington, as winters became generally milder in the past two decades, we grew used to the last frost date occurring in early March, so the return to damaging April frosts seemed like a throwback for longtime gardeners. But the rest of the growing season was so bizarre you were hard-pressed to find a precedent for it.\n\nMay was cold and exceedingly wet. June was about on par rain-wise, but then a pattern of heat set in that didn't really abate until December. The average temperature every month from July until November was significantly above normal.\n\n[Washington had second warmest year on record in 2016]\n\nJuly and August turned and remained extremely hot, and the stubborn heat persisted into the autumn months (the warmest fall on record nationwide). The heat coincided with a precipitous drop, so to speak, in precipitation. As gardeners in the Mid-Atlantic know too well, it started getting dry in July and stayed that way until a couple of storms in December (before turning abnormally cold).\n\nWinter squash grows on the author's tomato cages. (Adrian Higgins/The Washington Post)\n\nWe cannot predict one growing season by the previous one, but it would be equally foolish not to recognize that the weather is generally hotter and more volatile than it used to be. For me, that means rethinking what to plant and when, and January seems the time to devise a broad plan for the season ahead.\n\nI am coming to reject the primacy of the tomato in the summer vegetable garden. Unless you spray against early blight, keeping a plant clean and healthy becomes a constant battle of grooming, root-watering and bed-mulching. I can cope with that, in part by planting blight-resistant varieties such as that winning mini-Roma, Juliet.\n\nBut one thing the home tomato grower can't get around is the weather. A tomato (and many other garden veggies, herbs and flowers) can take the odd spike in temperature, but when the heat is unrelenting, your plants go into a survival mode in which the blooms and fruit take a hit.\n\nResearchers have discovered that when temperatures climb above 90 degrees, tomato pollen loses its viability and the blossoms drop. What may be more surprising, however, is that blooms are similarly affected when nighttime temperatures don't cool to below 70 degrees.\n\nIf you look at National Weather Service data for July and August, the prime flowering and fruit-developing period, you will see just how lousy the weather has become for tomato cultivation.\n\nIn that 62-day period, only 16 days experienced a high temperature below 90 degrees. Just two days in July had nighttime lows below 70 degrees. In August, only five nights were below 70.\n\nBecause I was away for much of August (yes, in a cooler clime), I pulled almost all the tomato vines before I left, straw-mulched the empty beds to keep the weeds in check and decided to plant for the fall in late August. This worked out pretty well, with some success from September to late November with salad greens, lettuce, turnips and spinach.\n\nI've decided that henceforth, tomato season will end by mid-August, whether again I do my dog-day decamp to Ireland or not. As I did in 2016, I will keep a handful of vines going through the season, but most will be gone. Cherokee Purple has always been a vigorous and fruitful heirloom variety for me, and worth its keep.\n\nBut abruptly closing the tomato season in its supposed prime means bringing the growing cycle forward a bit. Because tomatoes also loathe the cold — night temperatures below 50 degrees will set them back — you can't advance the season too much. Gardeners I know north of the Mason-Dixon line who must run the gantlet of early May will place plastic barriers around tomato plants, containing walls of water. These radiate stored solar heat at night and protect against the chill.\n\nThis might be the year to get tomato plants in a bit early and choose fast-maturing, early-season hybrids and cherry tomatoes, which start to ripen quickly. You can't miss with Black Cherry, Sun Gold or Supersweet 100. This approach leaves out the long-season, lumbering beefsteak tomatoes.\n\nThe new seed catalogues are full of such varieties. Southern Exposure Seed Exchange offers Abraham Lincoln among its blight-resistant red indeterminate tomatoes, a selection that matures in a rapid 70 days. Another one that may fit the bill is Atkinson, said to be vigorous, prolific, heat-tolerant and medium-size. That sounds perfect, though the proof of the pudding is in the eating.\n\nI am intrigued by Territorial Seed's Perfect Flame, one of a series named Heirloom Marriage. It blooms early with small, red, four-ounce fruit. Another, larger hybrid is Carmello.\n\nWith the tomato beds cleared, you can make way for autumn fare, which might include sowings of kale and mustard greens, and transplants of broccoli.\n\nTo keep the cauldron of August interesting, you might grow such heat lovers as sweet potatoes, okra, lima beans, amaranth and Malabar spinach. I think winter squash vines are always a great summer-long crop, especially with a bit of care to ward off the squash vine borer; aluminum foil wrapped around the base seems to work well. I might go a bit mad with these vines in 2017. In January, when the gardener's cabin is carpeted with catalogues, anything and everything seems possible.\n\n@adrian_higgins on Twitter
Dear Amy: Six years ago, I saw my sister's husband holding hands with another woman.\n\nThe way I remember it, he walked out of the bar with her and his friend (male) following behind. I was absolutely shocked at what I saw.\n\nA few days later, I mentioned to him that I was at the same bar where he had been.\n\nHe flinched. It's as if his body language said, Damn, I hope he didn't see me.\n\nA few weeks later, I confronted him and asked him about it.\n\nHis response was that I was reading too much into it, and that it was a moment of madness. He said that the woman was drunk and after dancing with her, his friend put her in a taxi and sent her home. He said he didn't have sex with her.\n\nI didn't tell my sister about this because she would've been devastated. They have been married for 25 years and have two children. They seem happy. Six years later, I still feel angry toward him. We're civil when we're together, but I have a lot of repressed anger.\n\nShould I have told my sister? Should I tell my sister now? How do I know he hasn't been with other women? Can I trust him?\n\nOr should I forgive him and move on? It's not the first time he has raised my eyebrows. At his 30th birthday, I was introduced to an attractive woman who was interested in me. Because he also thought she was attractive, he jokingly said, Can I leave your sister?\n\nPlease offer any advice you have.\n\nStill Upset\n\nStill Upset: You obviously don't like your brother-in-law. You definitely don't trust him. But guess what — you don't have to like or trust him. His wife does.\n\nYou do not know if your brother-in-law has been with other women. You only know what you saw, and in the absence of any other evidence pointing toward infidelity, you should definitely put this behind you and move on.\n\nUnfortunately, you can't seem to do that, so you should try to uncover what lies behind your anger. The key to your anger might lie in your own family history. Was your father in the picture? Was your parents' marriage strong? Have you been cheated on?\n\nIf you are able to unwrap your own feelings and understand them, you will feel better. Then, if you must, you can say to your brother-in-law, Dude, I really don't trust you. I never have and I don't now. I hope you treat my sister well.\n\nDear Amy: I am very much an introvert. Hosting houseguests is quite stressful for me.\n\nI realize that hosting people is a fact of life, however, since we live far away from many of our friends and relatives. We also happen to live in a warm, sunny place.\n\nNow that I am getting ready to retire, I am wondering if there is a tactful way to ask people, up front, to limit stays to three or four days?\n\nHouse Proud\n\nHouse Proud: You do not need to host anyone, ever, if you don't want to. I understand that you can feel pressured by family members and friends, but you are not obligated to provide sunshine and scones for others. If people contact you wanting to visit, say, I won't be able to host you here at the house, but I'd love to see you. Have a list of reasonably priced bed-and-breakfasts or motels on hand, if people are interested.\n\nIf you can tolerate a short visit, then you will have to tell people what your limits are, in advance. You say, We're happy to host you, but our maximum for overnight guests is three nights. I hope this works for you.\n\nOnce you establish your solid boundaries, the people in your life should respect them. You don't need to apologize, only to be clear.\n\nDear Amy: Forty-eight years ago when I married, we had many problems with my husband's mother. She just had to have all the attention.\n\nAt that time my own mother gave me some advice that came to me many times over the years. That advice was this: Don't ever forget that your husband loves and feels the same way about his mother that you feel about your mother.\n\nWhat a huge impact that had on our relationship.\n\nGrateful Daughter-In-Law\n\nGrateful Daughter-In-Law: Profound wisdom regarding a perennially challenging relationship. Thank you.
In light of Roman Reigns taking time off to receive treatment for leukemia, Rollins has stepped into the role of WWE's top good guy in recent months. The Rumble win officially christens him a main eventer and sets up a likely WrestleMania match with WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar.\n\nNia Jax becomes fourth woman in history to enter men's Royal Rumble: After coming in third place in the women's Royal Rumble, Nia Jax unleashed a surprise attack on R-Truth, the final entrant into tonight's contest. Jax proceeded to enter the ring and eliminate fan favorite Mustafa Ali.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJax is the fourth woman to compete in the men's Rumble match, following in the foosteps of the late Chyna, Beth Phoenix and Kharma.\n\nJax then had a staredown with Randy Orton, eventually falling victim to an RKO.\n\nBobby Lashley slams Seth Rollins through announce table: WWE Intercontinental champion Bobby Lashley was eliminated moments after entering the Royal Rumble, and he took his frustration out on Seth Rollins. Lashley pulled Rollins out of the ring from underneath the ropes and slammed him through an announce table, leaving Rollins knocked out. Expect Rollins to make a heroic comeback late in the match.\n\nKofi Kingston narrowly avoids elimination, but the victory is short-lived: Kofi Kingston has been a mainstay in the Royal Rumble for the past decade, each year displaying a new, creative way to avoid elimination. Entering as this year's 12th participant, Kingston was thrown over the top rope by Dean Ambrose, but refrained from letting both of his feet touch the floor. He pinned his feet to the side apron, twisting his body until he reached the stairs.\n\nHis tenure was short-lived, though, as he was soon eliminated by Drew McIntyre.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nElias duets with WWE Hall of Famer Jeff Jarrett, then eliminates him: Elias was the first entrant in the Royal Rumble and intended to take the opportunity to serenade the crowd with a song — until he was interrupted by the No. 2 entrant, WWE Hall of Famer Jeff Jarrett. The veteran, known for his musical talents in his prime, proposed a duet with Elias. The Chase Field crowd ate it up, until Elias spoiled the fun by punching Jarrett in the face before eliminating him.\n\nBrock Lesnar overcomes valiant effort from challenger Finn Balor to retain WWE Universal Championship: In a match that was billed as a modern day David vs. Goliath the diminutive Finn Balor put up a fight against the 6-foot-3, 286-pound Brock Lesnar. Balor, who held the Universal Title for one day in 2016 but relinquished it because of a real-life injury, hit Lesnar with his Coup de Grace finisher from the top rope. Before the referee could count to three, Lesnar flipped the pin into a kimura and made Balor tap out.\n\nDaniel Bryan retains WWE Championship over AJ Styles thanks to interference from Rowan: It's hard to follow a Royal Rumble match, given the energy live crowds expend during it. AJ Styles and Daniel Bryan, two of the most respected wrestlers in the world, did their best, producing a fun bout full of chain wrestling, submissions and high-flying. In the end, Bryan retained after surprise interference from Rowan, who had not been seen on television for months.\n\nBecky Lynch eliminates rival Charlotte Flair to win Royal Rumble, punches ticket to WrestleMania: Fittingly, the final two came down to Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair, former best friends turned enemies. The basis of the duo's feud in late 2018 was that Charlotte had always stuck her nose in Lynch's business, stealing opportunities from her.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLynch, after getting beat up on the outside by Nia Jax, hobbled back into the ring Sunday on one knee and shouted at Flair: You're not taking this from me! Indeed, Lynch sent Flair over the top rope, punching her to the ground and basking in the moment of her Rumble victory.\n\nWith the win, Lynch can choose to challenge Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey or Smackdown Women's Champion Asuka at WrestleMania. Lynch vs. Rousey has been the rumored match for months, and the build for the bout should begin on WWE TV this week.\n\nBecky Lynch replaces Lana in Royal Rumble: With Lana unable to compete due to the injury she suffered during her husband Rusev's match during the pre-show, Becky Lynch stormed the entrance and convinced a WWE official to let her enter the match as the last competitor. Chase Field serenaded her with chants of Becky! Becky! Becky!\n\nWith all 30 entrants having entered the match, the contest is down to its final five competitors — Carmella, Nia Jax, Bayley, Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlexa Bliss enters Royal Rumble, makes first in-ring appearance since September: The multi-time champion hadn't competed since September after suffering a concussion. The injury forced her to miss October's Evolution, WWE's first all-women's pay-per view event. When her music hit Sunday, the Chase Field crowd exploded.\n\nMandy Rose spoils rival Naomi's jaw-dropping feat of athleticism: Naomi eliminated Mandy Rose soon after entering the women's Royal Rumble match. Rose, who in story line attempted to break up Naomi's marriage with husband Jimmy Uso, attempted to powerbomb Naomi to the ground from the outside. But Naomi placed her feet on the barricade to remain alive in the Rumble. (Competitors are only eliminated once thrown over the top rope and both of their feet touch the floor.) Naomi toed the barricade, keeping her balance, before leaping onto the steps, avoiding elimination. But then Rose pulled Naomi to the floor to the dismay of the crowd.\n\nRonda Rousey outlasts Sasha Banks: In an entertaining match that might've been the best of Ronda Rousey's young career, the RAW Women's Champion pinned Sasha Banks after hitting her opponent with her Piper's Pit finisher and retained her title. Banks was one of the women's division's biggest stars before Rousey's arrival but had been written out of the spotlight over the past year. She proved an apt foe for Rousey on Sunday, nearly tapping Rousey out on several occasions. But Rousey, now WWE's biggest name, is destined to enter WrestleMania with the championship around her waist.\n\nAfter the match, Banks shook Rousey's hand, seemingly burying the hatchet, but then threw up the Four Horsewomen symbol, a nod to her longtime friendship with Becky Lynch, Charlotte Flair and Bailey. Rousey's a member of her own Four Horsewomen group that includes fellow former MMA fighters turned WWE performers Shayna Baszler, Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir. Rumors of the eight women squaring off have percolated for some time.\n\nThe Miz and Shane McMahon knock off The Bar to capture the WWE Smackdown Tag Team Championships: The odd couple team of The Miz and Shane McMahon came together to dethrone The Bar, with Shane hitting a shooting star press on Cesaro for the win. In the story line, The Miz convinced Shane to team with him after bringing up how he never lived up to his father's expectations. The message resonated with the son of Vince McMahon.\n\nThis seems likely to lead to a breakup and blood feud, given Miz's reputation for chicanery, but for now, the unlikely pairing got their moment to shine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAsuka taps out The Man Becky Lynch: No one quite resonates with WWE fans like Becky Lynch, who opened Sunday's event with a Smackdown Women's Championship match against Asuka. Lynch, in a rare moment of fallibility, came up short, tapping out to a modification of the champion's eponymously named Asuka Lock, capping what had been an exciting start to the show.\n\nFans of Lynch mustn't worry. The loss to Asuka sets her up to enter the women's Royal Rumble match later in the show, and a Rumble win could set up the WrestleMania bout against Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey that has been rumored for months.\n\nWWE takes advantage of NFL's bad press, announces match for halftime of Super Bowl: WWE Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon's revived professional football league, the XFL, isn't set to kick off until 2020, but McMahon is already aiming to pull viewers from the NFL.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring the Royal Rumble pre-show, WWE legend Shawn Michaels announced that stars from NXT, WWE's development league, would compete in a match during halftime of next Sunday's Super Bowl. The halftime show has been a point of contention, with several musicians bowing out in support of former San Francisco 49ers Colin Kaepernick's protest of police brutality. (Maroon 5 ultimately agreed to take the stage.)\n\nIn a shrewd move that speaks to the company's confidence in their stars of the future, WWE scheduled a six-man tag match pitting Velveteen Dream, Aleister Black and King Ricochet against Tommasso Ciampa, Johnny Gargano and Adam Cole to be streamed on the WWE Network.\n\nBuddy Murphy fends off Kalisto, Akira Tozawa and Hideo Itami to retain WWE Cruiserweight Championship: In the pre-show's final match, Murphy fended off the highflying, aerial offense of his three competitors, capturing the win after knocking Itami with a series of stiff knees and his Murphy's Law finishing move. Murphy, the real-life fiance of popular WWE performer Alexa Bliss, has now held the title since Oct. 6, when he beat former champion Cedric Alexander in his native Australia.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShinsuke Nakamura reclaims United States championship from Rusev: Rusev's championship victory over Nakamura on the Dec. 25 episode of Smackdown Live was a feel good moment for fans of the Bulgarian Brute. Rusev has built a dedicated following thanks in part to his humorous social media persona, and his win was seen as a long overdue vote of confidence from WWE. His reign was short-lived, however, with Nakamura gaining the win after Rusev accidentally knocked his wife, Lana, off the apron (the portion of the mat outside of the ropes). Distracted by Lana's condition, Rusev was kneed in the back of the neck by Nakamura, who won last year's men's Royal Rumble match.\n\nRaw Tag Team champions Bobby Roode and Chad Gable claim victory over makeshift team: Curmudgeonly wrestling fans say Roode and Gable are underutilized and underappreciated by WWE's writing staff, but the team stood tall in the first match of the pre-show. Rood and Gable beat the makeshift team of Rezar (of tag team Authors of Pain) and Scott Dawson (of the Revival). The stipulation was that, if Rezar and Dawson won, each of their teams would earn championship opportunities. It wasn't to be, as Gable pinned Dawson after executing a moonsault. The Raw tag team division is in desperate need of excitement, but this match did little in the way of moving toward that goal.\n\nPreview\n\nPopular culture normally thumbs its nose at professional wrestling, only paying mind to moments featuring recognizable faces, like former UFC star Ronda Rousey's in-ring debut at WrestleMania 34, or the goofiest of stunts, like Vince McMahon's strut.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe cartoonish gait of WWE's CEO has found a place in today's meme-obsessed culture, and for good reason: McMahon's flailing arms, swaggering legs and evil smile suggest a caricature of an ornery, know-it-all tycoon. It's at once humorous, ironic and familiar.\n\nNearly six weeks before Sunday's Royal Rumble at Chase Field in Phoenix, McMahon walked toward the ring on Monday Night Raw for the first time in nearly a year, his normally exaggerated mannerisms noticeably toned down. McMahon, 73, is rarely seen on television these days. But Raw had recorded all-time lows in viewership two weeks in a row, and rumors of the first threat to his family's wrestling monopoly in two decades were starting to gain steam. (In early January, Tony and Shad Khan, co-owners of the Jacksonville Jaguars, announced the formation of the upstart All Elite Wrestling promotion.)\n\nMcMahon on that December night was joined in the ring by his son, Shane; his daughter, Stephanie; and her husband, Paul Levesque. In a speech that blurred the lines between story line and reality, the first family of WWE acknowledged that they hadn't been doing a very good job and promised things were going to change, immediately.\n\nContrived as it was, the message behind the speech was well-received by hardcore wrestling fans long frustrated by stale writing. And the timing was right, with Royal Rumble around the corner. That event annually serves as the first stop on the road to April's WrestleMania — WWE's biggest event of the year.\n\nThe weeks since the McMahons' announcement produced more compelling television, and not just because of the specter of the women's and men's Rumble matches, which each pit 30 wrestlers in a battle royal, vying for the opportunity to challenge the champion of their choosing at WrestleMania.\n\nRaw, and its sister program, Smackdown Live, popped with more inspired writing and fresh faces. It didn't hurt that the McMahons were inserted into story lines: Levesque, also known as Triple H, dared Seth Rollins, his former on-screen protege and a popular men's Rumble winner pick, to show his more ruthless side. McMahon did the same with AJ Styles, prodding him to unleash his inner bulldog.\n\nStyles will challenge Daniel Bryan, the former fan favorite turned righteous villain, for the WWE championship at Sunday's event. WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar, another former UFC star, will defend his title against the diminutive Finn Balor in a bout billed in the vein of David vs. Goliath. But it's on the women's side where most of the intrigue lies.\n\nFor months, Rousey has been mired in dueling conflicts with Charlotte Flair and the ascendant Becky Lynch, who emerged as the company's biggest star toward the end of 2018. The three have been rumored to be competing in a triple-threat match at WrestleMania, and the requisite pieces of the puzzle should come into place at Rumble.\n\nRousey is expected to retain her Raw Women's Championship over Sasha Banks, while Flair will compete in the women's Rumble match. Lynch will challenge Asuka, the women's champion on the Smackdown brand, on Sunday, but she's likely to find her way over to the Raw brand soon, where she could continue her spats with Rousey and Flair in earnest.\n\nTo be sure, WWE's grip on the professional wrestling world will not loosen anytime soon. McMahon has built a global company whose stock price hovers around $82 per share. The advent of AEW is exciting for wrestling fans, but that the McMahons have dominated the industry for so long is no accident. Not surprisingly, ratings have stabilized since the family's return to television.\n\nBut for the first time since 2001, when McMahon purchased Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling promotion, competition is imminent. WrestleMania season, starting with the Royal Rumble, is WWE's chance to flex its muscles, to spotlight its most inspiring performers in front of more eyeballs than usual. It's more important the promotion gets it right this year than it has been in a long, long time.\n\nRoyal Rumble basics\n\nWhen: Sunday, 7 p.m. Eastern.\n\nLocation: Chase Field, Phoenix.\n\nKey fights:
But my research with Japanese people who have survived radioactive exposure — first from the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, and then from Fukushima — suggests that they bear the burden of discrimination and shame. In Japan, these survivors are known as the hibakusha. Although pronounced the same way, depending on the characters used, the term can either refer to atomic bomb survivors (被爆者) or victims of radiation after a nuclear power plant accident (被曝者). Both face continuing difficulties in Japanese society.\n\nAccording to Shuntaro Hida, a Hiroshima eyewitness who later became the director of the Hibakusha Counseling Center, about 80 percent of atomic bomb survivors chose to hide their status as survivors — from anyone, including spouses — for fear of being discriminated against.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeing a hibakusha is a heavy burden that can undermine opportunities to find a spouse. Lee Jong Keun, a Korean-Japanese hibakusha from Hiroshima, married but did not reveal to his wife and three daughters that he was a survivor until 2012. That is because, he said, being a victim of the bomb was so shameful.\n\nIn a letter to her sister published by the Asahi Shimbun in 2010, Kazue Inoue wrote that she was turned down by many potential marriage partners explicitly because she was a Nagasaki hibakusha. Finally, she chose not to disclose her status to the matchmaker — and wed in the 1960s. But when her mother-in-law found out that Inoue was a hibakusha, she would not accept the idea of her bearing children: What if you give birth to a freak of nature? Inoue's marriage did not last long after that. In her letter, she wrote, How could anyone blame my former mother-in-law? I understand her feelings.\n\nThe hibakusha often have to hide their arms even in the summer, because keloid scars are considered contagious. Although there is no official ban against them, the hibakusha, as Hiroshima survivor Masaya Kutsunai now recalls, still shy away from going to sentō (public baths) for fear of being treated with suspicion and disgust.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs all this suggests, the World War II hibakusha have become more and more vocal about their ordeals in Japanese society.\n\nFast forward, and the Fukushima hibakusha are now facing the same stress and discomfort. According to a 2017 survey by Akira Imai, a professor at Fukushima University, and the Asahi Shimbun, 62 percent of the 348 Fukushima evacuees interviewed have experienced or witnessed bullying and discrimination for having been exposed.\n\nThe Fukushima Kodomo Kenkō Project also reports that the accident has significantly destabilized the lifestyle of the inhabitants of the area. Their anxiety over information, fear of discrimination, as well as other changes in their everyday lives are often intertwined. As Masae Yuasa, a professor at Hiroshima City University, explains, the evacuees at home (i.e. those who chose to stay in contaminated areas while paying constant attention to radiation exposure) buy bottled water and vegetables from other parts of Japan, and spend significant sums to take their children away from contaminated areas during weekends or holidays. To minimize the risk of radiation, these inhabitants must constantly trade off between the financial burden against anxiety over radiation's health consequences.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose who fled from Fukushima to start a new life elsewhere grapple with incomprehension and discrimination. Teachers, scientists and university professors often say hateful things. Consider tweets by a geology professor at Gunma University Yukio Hayakawa, who said, among other things:\n\nI could not care less about farmers from Fukushima. I don't care if they all die. It's literally not my problem. All I care about is me and my family: I could not stand the idea that these people are poisoning us with their products.\n\nIn November 2016, the Asahi Shimbun reported that a 13-year-old boy who moved from Fukushima to Yokohama in 2011 was severely bullied at school. The bullies called him kin (bacteria) and extorted money from him because people from Fukushima receive compensation. The child explained to the police that he kept quiet because people from Fukushima are bound to be bullied.\n\nWhy are these costs of nuclear weapons and power so invisible?\n\nAD\n\nIt is difficult to determine how many were affected by the Fukushima spill — and there is no clear definition of who counts as affected. The loosely used term evacuee supposes a temporary status. When official counts of evacuees are released, they are tallying only people receiving aid.\n\nFirst, the government distinguishes between two affected groups. One group is those whom the government required to evacuate officially designated disaster areas, called forced evacuees (kyōsei hinansha), who are eligible for government financial aid and compensation from Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), the company that operated the nuclear plant. The other group comprises people from outside those government-specified areas who nevertheless had to evacuate because of the dramatic changes in their lifestyles and consequences on their psychological health. They are called voluntary evacuees (jishu hinansha), who do not qualify for government aid and for whom the prefecture covers costs only in part.\n\nAD\n\nThis distinction renders one portion of the Fukushima survivors invisible. Although there is a list of conditions under which someone can obtain the hibakusha kenkō techō (certification as an atomic bomb survivor, making one eligible for government health support), many of the actual survivors never applied for one. One reason: fear of lifelong discrimination.\n\nAD\n\nFurther, the government's definition of atomic bomb-related illnesses is very limited. Although the list was expanded in 2009, many radiation-related illnesses are not recognized. As a result, many ongoing legal battles, such as the black rain lawsuit (kuroi ame soshō), reflect attempts to have these medical consequences recognized.\n\nFor a long time after the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, Japanese citizens had no clear and reliable information on the health effects of the bomb. That opacity continues in the secretive and contradictory way information is coming out about the Fukushima nuclear accident.\n\nAD\n\nFinally, as Imai explained, because the question of the responsibility of the nuclear accident is still very blurry, there is no shared understanding among the Japanese that the Fukushima evacuees are in fact the victims of the accident. The lack of transparency over responsibility is in fact the main obstacle that hinders feelings of sympathy and empathy toward the Fukushima survivors.\n\nAD\n\nPeople often regard Hiroshima and Nagasaki as infamous tragedies that killed and scarred thousands and thousands of people, while seeing Fukushima as a shocking event that, like the Chernobyl accident, reminded the world of nuclear risks.\n\nBut within Japan, at least, the survivors' struggles are neglected, thereby hiding some of the costs of a nuclear world.
Our kids are now adults and doing well.\n\nMara and I recently reunited. We are deeply in love and quite compatible, but I am having an unusual problem.\n\nShe has periods where she is barking (as she puts it). She is disagreeable and argumentative to the point where communication shuts down.\n\nThe thing is, she seems to be operating from a place of anger. I am not. She becomes defensive and illogical when I ask if something is bothering her.\n\nAD\n\nAfter our timeout, she often apologizes, but offers no explanation. I don't really press the matter.\n\nAD\n\nBecause of the pandemic, we are still largely on top of each other 24/7.\n\nA few solo car rides help, but given the increasing frequency of the barking and subsequent recovery period for her (uncomfortable time for me), I am starting to get concerned.\n\nThough not the only trigger, when I have a drink after work or on the weekend, she tends to bark.\n\nHowever, she is a social drinker herself.\n\nI don't know anything in her history related to substance abuse, and I have asked her about this specific point, but I get nothing in return. It is confusing. Do you have any theories?\n\nAD\n\n— Barked At, Not Bitten\n\nBarked At, Not Bitten: Running away is a natural response to loud barking. You are choosing flight over fight, and while that might be the wisest choice in the moment, you and Mara aren't dealing with her behavior — or what might be causing it.\n\nAD\n\nBecause you mention your drinking as one trigger, you could start there. Do you behave differently after you've had a drink? Do you become loud, sarcastic or sleepy? Did she have another partner (or a parent) who had a drinking problem? Might her own alcohol use be triggering her anger? You two should talk about your mutual alcohol use.\n\nIs she going through menopause? This monumental hormonal shift can cause extreme behavioral changes. She should see her doctor. Does she signal her stress before an eruption? If so, perhaps she — and not you — could go for a solo drive to cool down.\n\nAD\n\nI highly recommend the book 10 Lessons to Transform Your Marriage, by marriage researchers John Gottman and Julie Schwartz Gottman (2007, Harmony). Read it together. Quick lessons from this important book: Treat your partner as a friend. (Gently!) Don't push your problems aside. Talk about your feelings.\n\nAD\n\nTry to look beyond her anger (for now) and key into her longing. What does she want? What do you want?\n\nDear Amy: I hate my husband of 21 years. I don't want to be married to him anymore, but I am fearful of what the future holds if I leave.\n\nI am 56 years old, I do not make a lot of money, nor do I have much in retirement savings. My three children are all older than 18 (two still live at home).\n\nAD\n\nI am also afraid that if I don't leave, I will never be able to be my true self and live in peace.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I stay for financial security, or leave with the hope of being happy?\n\n— Unhappy\n\nUnhappy: If you hate your husband, with no hopes of reconciling the relationship, then you should leave.\n\nYou don't seem to have done any research regarding how divorce would affect your financial situation. You should research the laws in your state and speak with a lawyer. Dividing your marital assets might provide you with a small nest egg.\n\nAD\n\nYou should also consider the impact divorce would have on your other relationships to prepare yourself for some emotional instability.\n\nAD\n\nYou have at least 10 years of earning power left before retirement. Your financial planning should include a realistic budget for living a pared-down life.\n\nDear Amy: Thank you so much for promoting the concept of radical acceptance in response to the question from Secret Mean Girl, who had moved home during the pandemic and was extremely judgmental about her family members' obesity and unhealthy choices.\n\n— Radically Accepted\n\nRadically Accepted: I gave Secret Mean Girl a lot of credit for admitting to her own unhealthy thought patterns.
Best moment\n\nIt should go without saying that the best moment of The Bachelor this week belongs, unequivocally, to Megan Mullally's pantsuit. A standout sartorial moment in what was otherwise a sea of Day 2 Coachella brunch attire.\n\nJust behind her pantsuit, Mullally, Nick Offerman and Billy Eichner came in a close three-way tie for the second-best moment of tonight's episode.\n\nAD\n\nMullally and Offerman, an incredibly hilarious couple who have been married since 2003 and recently co-authored The Greatest Love Story Ever Told: An Oral History, led the women through a storytelling exercise during which they told stories about their own first experiences. We saw Hannah G., the content creator, struggling to create content. But for the most part, this was actually one of the better challenges we've seen in recent seasons — what should be the women's most scripted moments turn out more authentically natural than expected.\n\nEichner's best moments came from his own quippy one-liners, peppered over scenes of the women competing in summer camp style contests. Fine, you get an award! Eichner yelled in what can only be described a Billy Eichner-esque yell, after Colton said, for the millionth (I'm rounding here) time that he plans on giving his virginity to a woman he loves.\n\nA few other Eichner-shouted honorable mentions:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe last time I was around this many virgins, well, I was on 'The View!' \n\nI'm gay . . . and that I think you should look into. (This left Colton truly speechless, although that doesn't seem like too great a feat.)\n\nIt's like Colton trying to find a vagina. . . . It hasn't happened yet!\n\nI'm sorry, I wanted to guest star on 'The Goldbergs,' and I got this.\n\nAnd we got one more Mullally-Offerman scene before the episode ended: It's nice to be here at the beginning before you're a complete basket case, Mullally deadpanned to Colton.\n\nBut it'll all be worth it, he replied.\n\nMullally stopped just short of rolling her eyes and laughing. Totally, of course. (We're right there with you, Megan.)\n\nWorst moment\n\nThings started innocently when Colton chose 23-year-old Hannah B. (also known as Miss Alabama 2018) for the season's first one-on-one date, which included Bachelor staples: A drive in an absurd-looking car, a horseback ride, and a sit-down on a couch (followed by a dip in a hot tub) in the middle of the desert.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt first, it looked like it would be a complete disaster when the date was filled with painfully awkward silences. And nothing compared with the cringeworthy moment when Colton gave a champagne toast, and then encouraged Hannah to give a toast of her own, because it was her birthday. We'll just transcribe the moment, which rang oddly similar to Miss Teen South Carolina's infamous pageant answer about the Iraq.\n\nColton: (Raises glass) To being open, to being honest, to being true to who we are, and to challenging each other throughout this journey.\n\nHannah: That was good. But I feel like you took mine. . . . Dang it. I really feel like you took my words. I wish you would have let me go first. Um. (Really long pause, then laughter) I can't do this! Okay. Like, how do I start it? What do you say?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nColton: You say, Let's make a toast to . . .'\n\nHannah: Let's make a toast to. . . .' Okay! And I'll put a bunch of words that sound good, that are real, that are real, real words. Okay. (More laughter) Okay. Let's make a toast to — first, it's my birthday, so to this amazing day. And, um . . . yeah. Roll tide.\n\nYikes! I feel like, so far, this date hasn't gone like I was expecting it to be, Colton later acknowledged.\n\nLuckily, that was the low point. During their romantic dinner, after hearing once again about why Colton decided to remain a virgin, Hannah shared her own story about a previous relationship: She wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, but that didn't work out, and now she feels a tremendous amount of guilt.\n\nAD\n\nColton urged her not to feel the pressure to feel perfect because of choices she made — plus, he loved that she was able to express her feelings. This is the Hannah that I want to see every single day, he declared. He offered her the date rose. She accepted. And then they made out.\n\nWeirdest moment\n\nThe early episodes of The Bachelor are always rife with infighting as the season works out who will be its sweethearts and who will be its villains. Because women who have watched the show before know that the latter is an easy ticket to Bachelor in Paradise, they're eager to take on the role at any cost.\n\nAD\n\nNevertheless, this episode brought us some pretty bizarre and petty arguments. The main rift was between Demi and Tracy, which was first hinted at during the group date challenge where contestants talked about their firsts. Tracy, 31, told a rambling tale about her first time dating a virgin — not Colton! — and how it ended with a sorority sister punching her in the face.\n\nAD\n\nI think that it is a cautionary tale for the other ladies in the house, said Offerman, spoken like a true Bachelor fan.\n\nDemi used her speech to aggressively kiss Colton in front of everyone — which, had the gender roles been reversed, would have raised many, many eyebrows. Then Demi went on to commit a cardinal sin during the group date: She touched the rose.\n\nLike the sorority girl who once fought her for a virgin, Tracy found her role reversed: She was older, wiser, and a Protector of the Rose. Perhaps she had confused the show with another rose-themed romance, Beauty and the Beast, where the object is enchanted and forbidden to the beautiful woman who would one day become a bride (the Beast was probably a virgin, too).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnyway. To even touch it is rude to everyone, Tracy said. I feel like she's here to date a guy and the majority of the rest of us are here to fall in love with someone. Probably! She confronted Demi, and a feud was born, and then amplified when Tracy was later interrupted by a bathrobe-wearing Demi, who led Colton upstairs telling him she wanted to show him her fantasy closet. Which, incidentally, was another thing from Beauty and the Beast.\n\nDoes she not have parents? one girl remarked, and, well, you might remember from last week that Demi's mother is in prison.\n\nAs the night went on, desperate ploys for attention moved on to air horns, and literally banging a pot in someone's face, and numerous inappropriate uses of the word cougar used to describe women who are younger than 32. Demi pretended to make up with a crying Tracy in what appeared to be a utility closet, telling her, You are one of the most amazing women I've ever met . . . you're an amazing storyteller and he's going to love your story. They both got a rose, setting them up for an inevitable two-on-one elimination date in a future episode.
Barton was a London journalist before she turned to fiction, and her central character, Kate Waters, is a star reporter for a London paper. Kate and her husband, Steve, are the parents of Jake, who dropped out of law school for a soul-searching trip to Thailand. He has been gone two years, and agonizing months pass between his occasional calls home.\n\nAD\n\nSoon we meet two other young Londoners who are headed for Thailand. In the summer of 2014, 18-year-old Alexandra O'Connor sets out, with her parents' reluctant approval, for a vacation in Thailand before returning to school. Alex invites her best friend to join her, but the friend drops out at the last moment. Alex then asks a teen she barely knows, Rosie Shaw, to come along. Rosie proves to be trouble.\n\nIn Bangkok, the teens stumble onto Mama's Paradise Bar and Guesthouse, where Mama (An astonishing figure in a flowing caftan and platinum blond wig) offers them a small, smelly room for a low price. Mama, they learn, is tolerant of drugs and not above stealing from her guests.\n\nAD\n\nAlex soon tires of Bangkok and wants to escape to a beach, but Rosie is busy with booze, drugs and sex in the rooming house. Kate's son Jake turns up and is hired as Mama's bartender. Both teens are drawn to him — He was a bit of a lost soul — and Alex couldn't resist a lost soul — creating new tensions between them.\n\nAD\n\nTragedy strikes. There's a fire in the rooming house and both teens are found dead. It's no spoiler to relate this; because of the way Barton tells her story, moving back and forth in time, the deaths are known early in the novel. The question is how they died.\n\nThe heartbroken parents fly to Bangkok hoping to find that the dead teens are not their daughters. But they are. The parents want answers, but the Bangkok police have run a shoddy investigation and are no help. Kate goes to Bangkok to cover the story for her paper and is horrified to find that her son Jake is a suspect. Soon after the fire, he vanished.\n\nAD\n\nIn London, an autopsy reveals that the teens did not die because of the rooming house fire. Indeed, the fire may have been started to cover up the real causes of death. Murder is possible, and London police begin a serious investigation.\n\nDetective Inspector Bob Sparkes is a model of dedicated police work, despite the fact that his wife, Eileen, is dying: Her cancer had come back two months ago, blowing new holes in her, murdering her slowly. Eileen is a minor character, but her courage makes her memorable. When Sparkes is agonizing over whether to fly to Bangkok, she tells him, Shut up. I'm fine. Me and my mate morphine are doing a great job. Now do yours.\n\nAD\n\nBarton's characterizations are exceptional. She understands how teenagers Alex and Rosie flirt with boys and feud with one another, and she knows how their parents grieve when they are gone. At one point, after Alex's death, her father tells her mother, I can't bear to keep going over and over what happened. I feel so terrible that I couldn't stop it. Then, He sat down and cried silently, his shoulders heaving with the effort. His wife leaves him to his grief. She couldn't take his on as well. Not today.\n\nBy the end of The Suspect, police think they've identified the killer of the teens and he's about to go on trial. Readers may question his guilt but, for this reader, this ambiguity only makes Barton's novel more fascinating.\n\nPatrick Anderson reviews thrillers and mysteries regularly for The Washington Post.\n\nTHE SUSPECT\n\nBy Fiona Barton
Dear Miss Manners: While it's important not to waste resources, what is the proper thing to do when one flush doesn't remove all of the waste?\n\nIt seems to be wasteful to continue flushing just to be sure all is gone before the next user needs to use the facilities, but also not nice to leave anything behind.\n\nWhile Miss Manners does not advocate being unnecessarily wasteful — she has her limits. And that is to do whatever it takes to make a public facility reasonably hygienic after use. After all, throwing up in the toilet after seeing its previous contents will also cost an additional flush. So let us call this one even.\n\nDear Miss Manners: What should I wear to a black tie optional'' wedding when the ceremony begins at 2 p.m. and the reception begins at 5 p.m.?\n\nShould I wear my reception dress to the ceremony, or something more casual and change during the gap between the ceremony and reception? I've purchased a floor-length chiffon gown to wear to the reception but don't want to be overdressed!\n\nYour instinct is correct. Long dresses and black tie should not be worn before dusk.\n\nYour hosts must think that the more important event is the party, rather than the marriage ceremony. So while Miss Manners considers the phrase black tie optional'' silly — hosts cannot make their dress codes compulsory — she suggest taking the option and choosing a dressy short dress or suit proper for a formal daytime occasion.\n\nDear Miss Manners: My wife and I live in a very sociable neighborhood. The neighbors are not just casual acquaintances but good friends whose company we enjoy.\n\nOur frustration lies with one friend in particular who lives in the house facing ours. The lady in question promptly accepts invitations to dinners or cocktail parties, and when she attends is a welcome and enjoyable guest.\n\nHowever, she regularly texts my wife and me 15 minutes before the event and announces that she has settled in for the evening in her pajamas and is going to watch TV. This happens even though cocktails are early, around 6 p.m. most times.\n\nPerhaps you could suggest a response to this friend for these texts, which make us feel that our event is of so little importance she cannot walk 100 feet to our door for an hour and then politely excuse herself before settling in to watch TV.\n\nWhile there may be no response that will get her to change, not inviting her at all surely will. If she is bold enough to question why, say, Oh, we felt so bad asking you to part with your valuable time at home. You are, of course, always welcome here if you see that we are entertaining. Just let us know when you are free.''\n\nMiss Manners feels confident that this woman will soon come running.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Sunday, November 29, 1998\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch online\n\nmerchants\n\nfor this book.\n\nH istorians are notably wary of the word revolution. They are even grudging in applying it to political events (was the English Revolution of 1688 a revolution or merely a restoration?), still more so to social or cultural events. And still more to social or cultural events in their own time. Surely a longer perspective (the famous long view that historians are supposed to cultivate) will dissipate the effect of ephemeral experiences and reveal the continuity behind ostensibly dramatic changes. Yet occasionally, very occasionally, historians are privileged (or doomed) to live through real revolutions, even social and cultural ones. Arthur Marwick, a professor of history at the Open University in England, maintains that the 1960s witnessed one such revolution. And a revolution, moreover, that transcended political and national boundaries. Marwick confines himself to four countries, Britain, France, Italy and the United States (with passing references to Germany, Eastern Europe and Japan). As a good historian, he apologizes for focusing on so artificial a period as a decade, and then, with further apologies, for prolonging the sixties to encompass the long decade of 1958 to 1974. The apologies are unnecessary. There was a revolution in these (and other) countries, and decades are sometimes significant units of time, even though they spill over into the adjacent years. The 800-odd page book (with another hundred pages of bibliography, footnotes and index) is one to be read in rather than read through. Divided into three periods, 1958-63, 1964-69 and 1969-74, it ranges over a variety of subjects: sex, censorship and morality; art, literature and movies; race, class and youth; poverty, affluence and commerce; education, welfare and crime; feminism, consumerism and environmentalism; Beatles, hippies and yippies. In addition there are accounts of the dramatic events in each period and each country: the civil rights movement, student strikes, urban riots, political crises. In a work of this scope there are inevitable omissions and peculiar emphases. Why so much emphasis on the popular culture (on movies especially) and so little on the high culture, which was complicitous in creating, sustaining and, more important, legitimizing the cultural revolution? (It would have been useful to be introduced to Lionel Trilling's concept of the adversary culture, which originated with the literati earlier in the century and was democratized and popularized in the course of the '60s.) Why half-a-dozen pages on Gore Vidal and Toni Morrison and no mention of Saul Bellow? Why, in a long discussion of race, is there no account of the Moynihan report on the black family in 1965, which was so prescient in pointing out a crucial aspect of the racial problem in the United States: the breakdown of the black family (signified by the then-startling illegitimacy rate of 25 percent)? And why, in a multi-national study such as this, is so much attention paid to Memphis, Tenn., which is hardly typical of the United States let alone of Western Europe (but which happens to be the location of Rhodes College, where the author was a visiting professor and availed himself of the city's research facilities)? But these are incidental details compared with the main issue: the nature of the revolution itself. And here Marwick has made a genuine contribution, first in affirming the reality of the cultural revolution as it manifested itself in so many spheres of life; then in showing how that revolution permeated and transformed mainstream society; and finally in putting it all in an international perspective, exposing the differences and yet basic similarities provided by the perspective. For Americans especially, it is useful to be reminded that the American experience was not unique -- certainly not the product, as is sometimes suggested, of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. And the insistence upon the interaction between the dominant culture and the counter-culture (the term itself was coined in 1968) is also fruitful, obliging us to recall another aspect of the revolution that is too often forgotten, the fact that so many of the revolutionaries proved to be imaginative, ambitious and eminently successful commercial entrepreneurs, creating whole industries out of the counter-culture itself -- boutiques, experimental theatres, art galleries, discotheques, nightclubs, 'light shows', 'head shops', photographic and model agencies, underground films, pornographic magazines. In his methodological observations, Marwick is very much the cautious professional historian. He firmly rejects the Great Marxisant fallacy, according to which any revolution worthy of the name can be conducted only by a class intent upon overthrowing the whole of bourgeois society and culture; it was this fallacy that inspired Herbert Marcuse to create a new revolutionary class, composed of students, blacks and other marginalized and disaffected groups. Marwick's own methodological explanation is more complex and sophisticated (so complex and sophisticated, perhaps, as to offer little practical guidance): Cultural and social change, while influenced by human agency, by contingency and convergence, takes place within the opportunities offered, and the constraints imposed, by structural, ideological, and institutional circumstances. Like a good disinterested historian, he also professes to reject the familiar ideological interpretations of the '60s: the radical view that sees it as a movement of social and sexual liberation, a boon to blacks, women, gays and other oppressed minorities; and the conservative view that harps on such disagreeable matters as the increase of crime and violence and an assault upon the universities and rational inquiry. Marwick does not, to be sure, refrain from judgment. Instead he couches his judgments in the familiar If . . . but, on the one hand . . . on the other hand mode. Thus, if a relaxed censorship brought an explosion of porn and exploitation, it was also accompanied by a remarkable continuity in the revival in serious American film-making. If drug abuse got out of control, it can, however, be seriously questioned whether the recreational use of drugs, and certainly cannabis, is any more reprehensible than the recreational use of alcohol. If brutal things did happen in the sixties, yet there was a remarkable balance between this humanism [tolerance and rationality] and the extremes of innovation. If ever there was justification for violence, the appalling, utterly inhumane story of 'Soledad Brother' George Jackson [of Black Panthers fame] provided it. Some rioters were vandals, but practically every violent episode could be traced back to some stupid or brutal (often both) action by the police. Many of those caught up in violent situations were intensely peace-loving . . . The student uprisings demonstrated on the one hand, the dedication, the idealism, the bravery of those who participated in them; on the other, the folly of their obedience to the great Marxisant fallacy, the absurd faith that there was a promised land ready -- given sufficient protest, sufficient violence, sufficient unconventionality, sufficient vulgarity -- for the taking. Lest Marwick's own view of these students be in doubt, he adds: I do not mock the protesters; I salute them, recognizing that they never had a hope of success in their revolutionary aspirations. I do mock commentators since, who, looking for the revolution decreed in the Marxist scriptures, have gone on and on picking over their failure, missing the real cultural revolution. The real cultural revolution -- by the end of the book that revolution has taken on dimensions and attributes that even its most ardent supporters rarely claim for it. The essence of the cultural revolution, Marwick writes, was its involvement of vast numbers of ordinary people, from peasant families in rural Italy getting the basics of civilized living to black children in the ghettos of the American South being admitted for the first time to properly equipped schools; from paraplegics whose needs as integrated members of the community were for the first time being recognized, to women everywhere freed from the confinements of the feminine mystique; from Italian, French, British and American workers with freshly negotiated wages and conditions of employment to young people in once-dreary provincial cities, now provided with boutiques and discos. And so on, with a medley of other tributes, large and small: the end of segregated housing, the increase of social welfare, the liberalization of marriage and divorce, the abandonment of fictions about the nature of beauty and the arrival of body-hugging clothing (or no clothing for sun-bathers), the inauguration of the new universal language of rock [that] was genuinely liberating, and not just for the young . . . There even emerged a new measured judgment on the part of authorities, so that Tom Hayden, the leader of the radical SDS, and the many others who suffered grievously at the hands of the most reactionary elements in the 'justice' system were all finally acquitted. By the last page of this very long book, in his opinion, the ifs and buts, on the one hand and on the other, are resolved, as Marwick happily looks back to a period that, in his opinion, was so much better than those that preceded or followed it: Gone was the stuffy conservatism of previous decades, while the radical, divisive, philistine conservatism of Reagan and Thatcher was yet to come. One has come a long way from the opening page, where Marwick deplored the political polemic, nostalgic mythologizing, and downright misrepresentation of both sides in this debate. Although there is much valuable material in his own voluminous work, it too is a notable contribution to that polemical genre.
That left couples scrambling to come up with backup plans for making their marriages official in the eyes of the government, such as holding a second wedding in Maryland or Virginia. The Marriage Bureau registers officiants and issues marriage licenses, which the officiants are supposed to sign and return to the court after the nuptials.\n\nAD\n\nBut the Let Our Vows Endure Act — or LOVE Act — introduced by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) allows her to issue marriage licenses while the courthouse is partially closed. D.C. government agencies falling under the executive branch are not affected by the shutdown.\n\nAD\n\nThey can shut down the United States government, but they cannot shut down love in the District of Columbia, Council member Brandon T. Todd (D-Ward 4) said before the vote.\n\nThe mayor plans to sign the bill Thursday when she returns from the CES electronics show in Las Vegas, where she is to participate on a panel about innovation in cities.\n\nThe law would take effect immediately for 90 days, bypassing the typical congressional review period.\n\nAD\n\nLawmakers are also considering passing a permanent version of the bill.\n\nAides to Bowser say the secretary of the District of Columbia would handle marriage license applications, but city officials are still figuring out the process and how applicants will obtain licenses.\n\nThe District government also has been picking up trash from the Mall and ramping up staffing at the Department of Employment Services to process unemployment claims as a result of the shutdown.\n\nOther court functions suspended during the federal government's partial shutdown include bar admissions, the law library, the day care at D.C. Superior Court and expungement services.
This time, however, Bachelor Matt James is new to everyone. He was to appear on Clare's season, but as we'll explain below, he was plucked to be a star before ever serving as a supporting character. Here's everything you need to know about Matt James and his premiere as the show's first Black lead.\n\nWho is Matt James?\n\nAccording to his official ABC bio, he's a real estate broker living in New York City. He was 28 when his season was filmed and is now 29. As he said during Monday night's premiere, he's never been in love. And as his contestants and Chris Harrison continually remark, he's very hot and VERY TALL. According to Instagram, he's also pals with Tyler Cameron and former Bachelorette Hannah Brown. He studied economics at Wake Forest University, where he also played wide receiver on the football team. Matt is biracial; he was raised by a single White mother who split from his Black father when he was young. In a touching conversation with his mother, Matt talked about how 2020 taught him that nothing goes according to plan, making him realize there's no perfect person out there for him. He said he's looking for someone who's weathered storms, who's resilient, strong.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore his contestants arrived, Matt sat down with Harrison and addressed the pressure he feels as the first Black Bachelor. People want you to end up with a certain type of person, Matt said, adding that he's a product of interracial marriage and knows that whomever he picks, viewers will have strong feelings. After noting he doesn't want to upset Black or White viewers, Matt said, But I'm both of those! How do I please everybody?\n\nHe'll learn soon enough that pleasing everyone is not possible on this show. However, Matt hopes that being in this position normalizes this for other people of color, he told USA Today.\n\nChristianity is clearly very important to Matt, which he showcased in his first few moments with his contestants, leading them in a group prayer. He thanked God for bringing us all together, healthy and asked God to bless this time we have together.\n\nWhy is this season historic?\n\nThe Bachelor franchise, which started in 2002, has been criticized for years for its lack of diversity — in 2012, two African American men who auditioned for the series filed a racial discrimination class-action lawsuit. Then in May, as the country faced a reckoning over racial injustice and police brutality, ABC announced James as the show's new lead.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe don't want this, in any way, to seem like a cure-all and seem like, 'Hey! Look what we did here!' We know this is a few grains of sand in a very big hourglass, ABC programming executive Robert Mills told Variety. It's taken a while to get where we are and we will continue to go further, and I acknowledge it may not be enough.\n\nRachel Lindsay, who was the first Black lead of The Bachelorette in 2017 and is an outspoken critic of the show's embarrassing lack of diversity, said on a podcast that it was great to see James's casting — but it was also the bare minimum the producers could do, and still didn't address the internal, embedded, deep-rooted issues in this franchise where it needs to change structurally.\n\nWhere are they filming?\n\nThough watching the two-hour episode without a mask in sight might fool you into thinking The Bachelor was filmed on some planet far away from the coronavirus pandemic, Matt's season was made similar to Clare Crawley's. Only instead of being shot at the blistering La Quinta resort in Palm Springs, Calif., in the heat of summer, the cast and crew are at Nemacolin, a resort in Farmington, Pa. (They quarantined and were tested ahead of time.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf this wooded setting looks familiar, Bachelor fans might remember it from JoJo Fletcher's 2016 season of The Bachelorette. It appears there's a lot more to do here than at the La Quinta. There's wildlife on the grounds, paintball, a zip-line, slot machines and a spa. And if you reallllyyy miss the Bachelor mansion in Malibu, it's available for rent via Airbnb. Just $6,000 a night!\n\nWho had the most outrageous introduction?\n\nContestants know that if you don't want the humiliation of going home the first night, you better have a memorable introduction when you meet the star of the show. Kaili, a 26-year-old hostess from Chicago, tried her best: She arrived wearing only lingerie, and coyly asked a rather startled Matt if he could help her decide which dress to wear. Unfortunately for Kaili, she was instantly upstaged by Katie, a 29-year-old bank marketing manager from Washington state, who launched into a monologue about how she brought something special from home … and then revealed her vibrator.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMatt burst out laughing, while the other contestants gasped while watching the interaction from the window: What?! No, she did not! one exclaimed. Producers loved this scene so much that they also played it at the beginning of the episode — but they were also scandalized enough that they placed a black bar over the device on screen, as to not offend viewers' delicate sensibilities (or maybe network television regulations).\n\nWho got the first-impression rose?\n\nMatt isn't the only cast member making history this season. Abigail, a 25-year-old client financial manager from Beaverton, Ore., is the show's first deaf contestant. Matt instructed the women to be vulnerable with him, as the show's leads often do. After she told him about the challenges she has been through, Matt recognizes that she's a fighter and gave her the first-impression rose. They kissed. It was one of the purest first impressions we've ever seen.\n\nWho is likely to be this season's villain?\n\nKit, the 21-year-old fashion entrepreneur from New York, seems ripe for the role. She's the youngest contestant, appears exceptionally smug, and is already the most famous, as she's the daughter of designer Cynthia Rowley and launched her own clothing line as a teenager. However, Victoria, a 27-year-old from Los Angeles whose only job description is queen, was so obviously thirsty for the title (and, obviously, a spot on Bachelor in Paradise) that it would be almost cruel to deny her the designation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVictoria was carried in on a throne by four men, wore a tiara and introduced herself as Victoria, like the queen. Everyone obviously immediately despised her, and no doubt were ecstatic that she immediately tripped and fell after her royal arrival. However, in a preview of the season, viewers saw those wily producers invite even more women to join the show in future weeks — so Victoria may face some evil competition.
Well, that's no longer the case. After a competitive national search, Amazon chose the sites for its second headquarters, a coronation that will release up to 25,000 subjects into the cities' boutique coffee shops, craft cocktail bars and dog parks. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Visit both destinations and you will probably overhear conversations debating the pros and cons of Amazon, such as increased traffic and rent costs and a surge in development projects and millennials. Without question, the neighborhoods will change, which is why we spent a few days before the holidays exploring the cities. Read on for a tale of two cities that you can't buy on Amazon or watch on Amazon Prime.\n\nCrystal City\n\nFast facts: Arlington's Crystal City, Pentagon City and Potomac Yard were originally part of Abingdon Plantation, and agriculture predominated until the railway arrived on the scene. In the latter half of the 19th century, the area dabbled in gambling but later turned respectable with office buildings, residential developments and hotels. In the early 2000s, the Naval Air Systems Command and the Patent and Trademark Office relocated, causing the work-and-play population to drop. Amazon will occupy three buildings on 18th Street near the Crystal City Metro station, plus two new sites in Pentagon City that will bookend a Whole Foods, another Bezos company.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe vibe: The city resembles an active ant colony, with bodies disappearing inside the malls and Metro station or marching home. People do gather for a midday coffee or happy hour before returning to their respective corners. Despite the transient nature, longtime residents still exist, including Freddie Lutz, owner of Freddie's Beach Bar, who will happily take you on a nostalgic ride of Crystal City involving a drugstore soda fountain and a drive-in movie theater.\n\nThe view: Look past the tangle of highways at the sweeping panorama of Washington monuments and landmarks. For a 360-degree view, sit and spin in the rotating Skydome Restaurant, on the 15th floor of the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel.\n\nFoodstuff: Several A-list and TV-minted chefs have opened restaurants here, including Spike Mendelsohn (We, the Pizza and Good Stuff Eatery), José Andrés (Jaleo) and Morou Ouattara (Kora). Most of the chains are represented, but for a homier experience, stroll 23rd Street. The dining spots act locally but cook globally: Indian, Italian, Ethiopian, Japanese, Thai and Greek. Late night, feed your insomnia at the 24-hour Kabob Palace or Bob and Edith's Diner.\n\nCaffeine and cocktails: In past summers, Commonwealth Joe has mobilized its kegs-on-wheels army, serving nitro cold-brew coffee to the undercaffeinated people of Arlington. For four-seasons coffee drinkers, it brought its nitro taps, pour-overs and specialty drinks (one holiday offering smacks of oatmeal cookie) indoors at its Pentagon City shop, which holds free cupping (or tasting) sessions on Sundays. Highline RxR has more beers than days of the month, and we're not talking about February.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCurrently flowing: Pick Up Your %@$# Brownies, No Veto and She Made Me, a pumpkin and yam ale from a Dulles brewery. Freddy's Beach Bar, a straight-friendly gay bar going on 18 years, is no shrinking merman. The decor is overkill-chic, and the drinks taste like a Tahitian vacation in a glass. While waiting for your, say, Green Monkey or Flashing Flamingo, scan the shelves for the Ken-like doll in the closet.\n\nSleepy time: Crystal City has about 5,400 rooms in 15 hotels, and all are chains with the exception of the Americana Hotel. On average, rates are about 25 percent less than those in the District.\n\nCulture fix: You will have to cross the Potomac for museums, but stay put for experimental theater. Synetic Theater, a neighborhood presence since 2010, leads the classics (Cyrano, Richard III) down an alternative path with dance, music, technology and the visual arts. A few galleries focusing on local painters, potters, jewelry makers and more appear in the underground arcade of the Crystal City Shops. Aboveground, a sprinkling of public art and murals add a touch of whimsy to the otherwise wan landscape of high-rises. For a walking tour, download a map. The Grounds, a repurposed parking lot in Pentagon City, hosts public events and art installations, including a recent assemblage of seesaws that radiated light and sound when see-ed and saw-ed.\n\nShop hop: Malls, malls, malls. The one surprise: Vintage Dress Company, which relocated from Del Ray in Alexandria to 23rd Street a few months ago. Owner Darlene Bakke scours estate sales, charity shops and thrift stores for threads and accessories from the 1950s through the 1990s. Some of her timeless finds include a pair of Jordache jeans, a Rudolph-red snowsuit and a Donna Reed-era yellow cardigan with pearls. She plans to add a wedding dress salon for brides who want to give gowns a second chance at love and marriage.\n\nLong Island City\n\nFast facts: Long Island City was a real Long Island city with its own mayor and police force until 1898, when the five boroughs consolidated and LIC became a member of the Queens court. In the early years, the area was farmland, and Manhattan was accessible only by ferry. In the mid-20th century, the city experienced an industrial boom with 1,400 factories, including many — oil refineries, glass works, ship building, iron foundries — that left a dark smudge on the riverside landscape. Several kinder commodities, such as bread, spaghetti, shoes and film studios, also flourished, and a few survived the mass closings in 1970s and early '80s. Over the years, LIC has staged a comeback, as more businesses and residents flee the rising costs of Brooklyn and Manhattan. Amazon will reside in Anable Basin, a 19th-century man-made inlet on the East River that once supported Old (cough, cough) Industry.\n\nThe vibe: LIC still has grit under its fingernails. The subway rumbles overhead, and warehouses sit abandoned on forlorn streets. On a misty night, I half expected Humphrey Bogart to appear out of the shadows. During the day, the city is frenetic, but you can always find a quiet place along the river or under an idled crane. Unlike other boroughs, you don't need to squeeze into a pair of skinny jeans and cultivate a beard to fit in. Wear what you want and, if you say hello to an LICer, you might receive an even grander salutation in return: During a Big Apple Greeter tour, a resident in the Hunters Point Historic District invited us into his home to ogle his property and play with his one-eyed dog.\n\nThe view: If Long Island City had the pitching arm of Mariano Rivera, it could play catch with Midtown, which sits directly across the East River. (The landmass between the two shores is Roosevelt Island, which is accessible by tramway from Manhattan and ferry from LIC.) For a river-level view, grab an Adirondacks chair in the 12-acre Gantry Plaza State Park and shout out the names of the buildings across the way: United Nations Headquarters, Empire State Building, Chrysler. Nearby, Long Island City Community Boathouse at Anable Basin leads free paddles during the summer. Higher up, on the Z Hotel's 12th-floor rooftop, watch the Manhattan skyline twinkle against the night sky like a not-so-distant planet.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFoodstuff: Queens is a center of diversity, and LIC reflects the immigrant story with a culinary map covered in pins. Diners can dig into Japanese noodles (Mu Ramen, Takumen), Indian (Adda Indian Canteen), Peruvian (Jora), Kansas City-style barbecue (John Brown Smokehouse) and Mexican at Casa Enrique, the only Queens eatery to earn a Michelin star. There is no shortage of Italian restaurants, but only one — Manducatis — comes with Tony Bennett's seal of approval. (Hmmm. Does the fountain of youth run on pasta and broccoli rabe?) M. Wells Steakhouse is unapologetic: Order the bone marrow escargot and pig's head tonight and atone with avocado toast the next day at M. Wells Dinette, inside the MoMA PS1 museum. If you crave an all-American burger and craft beer, with a side of female muse, the Baroness names all of its patties after women. To wit: the Marilyn, which is filled with mac n' cheese and wrapped in bacon. Nearby, a sister restaurant called the Huntress specializes in wings and whiskey.\n\nCaffeine and Cocktails: Sweetleaf, which was founded by a Queens native, has two LIC locations: the original site in a 19th-century building with a vinyl records room in the back and a waterfront store that transforms into a bar (with alcoholic coffee beverages) after 5 p.m. If you've grown immune to multiple espresso shots, Etto Espresso Bar amps up the jolt with the bulletproof latte, an espresso drink mixed with Kerrygold butter and high-octane brain oil. For coffee with a cause, order a cup of COFFEED, which donates a percentage of sales to a local charity. At LIC Landing, which serves the locally roasted beans, the money goes to Hunters Point Parks Conservancy. You won't be the first — or last — person to walk past Dutch Kills, a speakeasy with discreet signage. Hint: Look for the blinking BAR sign above. Inside the former warehouse, the bar is replete with dark wood and brownout lighting. Order a drink from the menu, which looks as if it were banged out by a frustrated novelist, or drop a few key words like ginger and don't like the taste of alcohol and the bartender will whip up a drink that fits your low (or high) tolerance for booze. The Long Island City Brewery Tour features four stops, including Big ALICE Brewing, which occupies a former Bible storage facility. The brewery has more than a dozen beers on tap and emphasizes local ingredients, such as the cold brew blend from a Queens roaster that appears in Date Night, Bro? (The donuts-and-coffee-flavored beer was inspired by a friendly interaction with a policeman outside a launderette.)\n\nSleepy time: Choose among 3,200 rooms in 33 hotels, with several dozen more properties on the way. Rates are significantly cheaper than Manhattan properties, and room size is generous. Example A: the Paper Factory, a quirky boutique hotel that honors its 100-year-old industrial history. A superior queen starts at $129 and measures 181 to 298 square feet. Example B: the Boro, where a 250-square-foot king or queen room starts at $122. Visitors with tighter budgets and no stranger danger can book a shared dorm at the Local or Q4 hostels for less than $40 a night.\n\nCulture fix: Enjoy a modern art moment at MoMA PS1, an affiliate of the larger institution in Manhattan. The museum, which occupies Long Island City's first school, showcases several long-term art installations plus exhibits with a shorter shelf life. The museum also holds free live performances (music, lectures, etc.) through its VW Sunday Sessions series. SculptureCenter goes large — in magnitude and concepts — with experimental artworks that fit comfortably inside a former trolley repair shop. Each year, it introduces one or two shows by midcareer artists and several exhibits by solo and group artists. Japanese-American artist Isamu Noguchi didn't have to travel far to check up on his Noguchi Museum, which opened three years before his death in 1988; his studio sat across the street from the Zen repository of stone works and Akari light sculptures. More than 60 artists from 14 countries lent a hand — or spray can — to the Top to Bottom mural project, which covers all four sides of a three-story warehouse.\n\nShop hop: Long Island City is thin on retail. MoMA PS1 and the Noguchi Museum have well-curated gift shops, of course. More than a year ago, Book Culture, an independent bookseller with three Manhattan outposts, expanded into Queens. The two-level store sells more than just reading material: Pick up a Frida Kahlo paper doll, backpack by Sweden's Fjallraven Kanken or dachshund-print notecards. Freed of London, the dance shoemaker, dresses the feet of Washington Ballet performers and appeared on the big screen with Natalie Portman in Black Swan. The English company's sole U.S. store resides in Long Island City and stocks items by Japan's Chacott, too. The attire is suitable for anyone who frequently bends their knees, even if it's just to pick up a dropped M&M. Slovak-Czech Varieties specializes in toys (homemade wooden animals and trucks), edibles (three kinds of flour, chocolate galore) and glassware made in the homeland. Matted blurs the line between high and low art by combining a gallery (the current show features photos developed from vintage negatives) with anti-Kondo baubles, such as sequined stuffed animals and duct tape art kits.
I recently opened up to the eldest child and, while remaining respectful of their father and cognizant that our marriage will continue, gave her a tiny bit of insight into her father's less-than-stellar behaviors throughout our marriage. I told her I still loved him, but felt she needed to understand his happy-go-lucky approach came at a price . . . my fear.\n\nAD\n\nShe seemed content, she and I agreed it was a conversation she needed to hear, and this will end all talk of our marital life. Have I really crossed a huge line?\n\nAD\n\n— Stunned\n\nStunned: Without knowing what you actually said, I can't say whether you crossed a line. And I can't know whether you will honor your pledge not to put her in the middle again — a huge factor.\n\nWhat interests me more here is why, why, why you want to stay married to this man. By your own description, if I read you correctly, you live in fear. Whose company is worth that?\n\nRe: Stunned: I was stunned . . . he had informed my daughters of his desires before he spoke to me: What's stunning here is his total lack of respect for you. As Carolyn said, why do you love someone who has no respect for you?\n\nAD\n\n— Anonymous\n\nDear Carolyn: Silly question: I have a neighbor I run into a few times a week as we walk our respective dogs, and for the past six months she has made a variation of the same joke EVERY SINGLE TIME. It's based on an aspect of my appearance that changed around then, and is not mean or insulting, but I'm over it from sheer repetition. I think it started as a legit wow! reaction, and that I replied jokingly as if I was unaware of the change made it seem like our shtick.\n\nAD\n\nI've tried to change up my responses, from a flat, Yep, still there, to a non sequitur about a different topic, but she keeps doing it. To flat-out say, Stop commenting on this aspect of my appearance seems rude, though I have a feeling this straightforward approach will be your suggestion? She has taken even the hint of criticism poorly in the past and that we are just friendly acquaintances having short chats makes me hesitant to be as direct as I would with a friend. I just really want this joke to die.\n\n— Yep, Still There\n\nYep, I'm officially out of responses. Can we start a new joke? Direct but light. If even that fails, yes, just direct: Please stop commenting on this aspect of my appearance. Thank you.
Raised in a privileged business family, Mr. Wofford attracted national media attention as a teenager during World War II. He helped launch the Student Federalists group, an organization that sought to unite the world's democracies in a battle against fascism and to keep the postwar peace.\n\nMr. Wofford became one of the first white students to graduate from the historically black Howard University Law School in Washington. He was an early supporter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and marched alongside him in the civil and voting rights flash point of Selma, Ala. Robert F. Kennedy, the president's brother who served as U.S. attorney general, once referred to Mr. Wofford as a slight madman in his zeal for advancing civil rights.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Wofford went on to a wide-ranging career, serving as President Kennedy's special assistant for civil rights, helping Kennedy in-law R. Sargent Shriver launch the Peace Corps and heading two colleges, including Bryn Mawr in Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1991, he defeated a giant of Pennsylvania politics — former Republican governor and U.S. attorney general Richard Thornburgh — in a special election to become the state's first Democratic senator in more than 20 years. In Philadelphia in 2008, he introduced then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) before the stirring A More Perfect Union speech on race relations during the presidential race that would propel Obama to the White House.\n\nIn 2016, Mr. Wofford described the merging of his personal and political ideals in an essay published in the New York Times, Finding love again, this time with a man.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Wofford, by then a widower, described how he met Matthew Charlton, an interior designer 50 years his junior, and the two became a couple. The essay ended with Mr. Wofford's announcement that he and Charlton would soon exchange marriage vows. They wed that year.\n\nThe courtly, professorial nonagenarian said he did not consider himself gay. Too often, our society seeks to label people by pinning them on the wall — straight, gay or in between, he wrote. I don't categorize myself based on the gender of those I love.\n\nHe admitted that he had once viewed same-sex marriage, which was legalized in a landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, as a political impossibility. But, as he reflected in the essay, the dramatic social and political change he had witnessed decades earlier should have banished such pessimism.\n\nThe 'blue bomb'\n\nIn 1960, student sit-ins at segregated lunch counters and restaurants were exploding across the South. That October, at one such protest in Atlanta, King was arrested and jailed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis predicament worsened after the judge in the case learned of a prior conviction: Several months earlier, King and his wife had been driving a white friend to the hospital in a neighboring county and were pulled over by a police officer suspicious of the interracial group of travelers. The civil rights leader, who had been found guilty of driving with an out-of-state-license, a misdemeanor, was sentenced to four months of hard labor.\n\nHis wife, Coretta Scott King, then pregnant with their third child, feared her husband would be killed in jail. Her fear turned to terror after he was yanked from his cell in the middle of the night and taken to a maximum-security prison in Reidsville, Ga. By the time she reached Mr. Wofford, a friend since the 1955-1956 Montgomery bus boycott, she was hysterical.\n\nMr. Wofford, who had been a lawyer for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights before joining the Kennedy presidential campaign, wanted to help but understood the political risks. Knowing that any overt sympathizing with the jailed leader might alienate Southern white voters, Kennedy's top strategists ruled out any action. His opponent, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, also was staying out of the fray.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Wofford helped hatch a plan.\n\nThe idea came to me. . . . Why shouldn't he just call Mrs. King? Mr. Wofford recounted in the oral history Voices of Freedom by Henry Hampton and Steve Fayer. She was very anxious. . . . Why can't Kennedy at least just call her and say, 'We're working at it; we're going to get him out. You have my sympathy.' A personal, direct act.\n\nWith encouragement from Shriver, Kennedy placed the call during a campaign stop in Chicago.\n\nKing was released the next day after Robert Kennedy, his brother's campaign manager, made another call — this time to the judge. He drove home the political importance of freeing King and assured the jurist that his help would make him a welcome visitor in a future Kennedy White House, biographer Larry Tye wrote in his 2016 book Bobby Kennedy: The Making of a Liberal Icon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn black communities across the country, the grapevine telegraph lit up with jubilation over the Kennedys' efforts, Tye wrote.\n\nMr. Wofford led the charge to tout the phone calls in a pamphlet distributed at black ­churches across the country the Sunday before the election. Dubbed the blue bomb because of the color of the paper on which it was printed, it contrasted No-\n\nComment Nixon with the Candidate With a Heart. It also featured a powerful endorsement from King's influential Baptist preacher father.\n\nThe pamphlet circulated below the registry of the news and white culture. It had enormous influence among black voters, King biographer Taylor Branch said in an interview. Executed behind the backs of the campaign's leaders, it shows Harris Wofford's real shrewdness and possibly his decisive role in history.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKennedy won the election by 84 electoral votes and a popular margin of 112,000 votes. Seventy percent of black voters cast their ballots for him. In The Making of the President, 1960, historian Theodore H. White credited Kennedy's success to the master stroke of intervention in the Martin Luther King arrest.\n\nA precocious start\n\nHarris Llewellyn Wofford Jr., whose father was an insurance executive, was born in New York City on April 9, 1926. He grew up mostly in suburban Scarsdale, N.Y., and was the oldest of three children.\n\nHe was 11 when his maternal grandmother took him on a life-altering six-month world tour.\n\nIn Rome, he said, he saw dictator Benito Mussolini thundering from a balcony against the League of Nations. In Shanghai, he and his grandmother walked through the rubble from the Japanese attack and occupation. In the streets of Mumbai, he said, he saw Mohandas Gandhi.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe later told the Philadelphia Inquirer that he returned to seventh grade as a know-it-all foreign policy expert. His fascination with activism was ignited. Within a few years, he had organized the first chapter of the Student Federalists, which later merged with other groups to form what is now Citizens for Global Solutions.\n\nMr. Wofford served stateside in the Army Air Forces, then graduated from the University of Chicago in 1948. That year, he married fellow student Clare Lindgren and traveled with her throughout India and Pakistan on a fellowship to study the work of Gandhi, who had just been assassinated.\n\nStudying civil disobedience in India spurred Mr. Wofford to enroll at Howard, which he described in his 1980 memoir, Of Kennedys and Kings, as the center of the civil rights law I intended to practice. He earned law degrees from Howard and Yale University, both in 1954.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFive years later, Mr. Wofford helped arrange and underwrite a month-long tour of India for Martin and Coretta King to meet many of Gandhi's disciples. The trip widened King's vision and gave him a more sophisticated view of how social injustice and evil could be combated by the method of nonviolence, historian David J. Garrow wrote in his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of King, Bearing the Cross.\n\nMr. Wofford was arrested for protesting police brutality during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago and spent a night in jail. He later told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he became disillusioned with the radical youths leading the protests.\n\nOne of the common threads all my life, he said, has been a disagreement with those who see politics as primarily focused on their own psychic or ideological satisfaction, those people that want to vote or to protest or be witnesses [without being interested] in the art of persuasion or what the results will be. The protest movement of the late 1960s ended by appalling me.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, Mr. Wofford served as president of an experimental branch of the State University of New York at Old Westbury on Long Island. He spent the next eight years leading Bryn Mawr as the second male president since the women's college was founded in 1885.\n\nIn 1991, he was Pennsylvania's secretary of labor and industry when Gov. Robert P. Casey Sr. (D), an early political mentor, appointed him to fill the vacancy created by the death of Sen. John Heinz (R) in a plane crash. Promising balm for the frustrations of the middle class — including a proposal for national health-care reform — Mr. Wofford then defeated Thornburgh with 55 percent of the vote.\n\nThree years later, the discursive former college president lost his seat to Rep. Rick Santorum, the hard-charging conservative who helped the GOP take control of the Senate. After leaving office, Mr. Wofford served six years as chief executive of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the agency that administers the AmeriCorps program and was one of his chief legislative achievements as senator.\n\nClare Wofford died in 1996. In addition to Mr. Wofford's husband, of Washington, survivors include three children, Susanne Wofford of Manhattan, Daniel Wofford of Bryn Mawr, Pa., and David Wofford of Washington; a brother; a sister; and six grandchildren.\n\nMr. Wofford met Charlton on a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\n\nQuoting a Robert Frost poem about love at first sight, he wrote in his New York Times essay: Twice in my life, I've felt the pull of such passionate preference. At age 90, I am lucky to be in an era where the Supreme Court has strengthened what President Obama calls 'the dignity of marriage' by recognizing that matrimony is not based on anyone's sexual nature, choices or dreams. It is based on love.
I feel it's just as likely that we'll decide this stability is more valuable than whatever's missing, or that we'll end up in a painful, lonely breakup and truly miss how nice, calm and steady we had it.\n\n— Stable\n\nStable: I think your courage died of boredom. Not to knock nice, calm steadiness. But those words should describe your emotional state, not your conversational one.\n\nAD\n\nHow gentle are you going to feel as the hours, days, years of finding nothing to say pile up? Any of us at any point can end up alone. Don't fear it so much that you check the I guess it's the best I can do box.\n\nAD\n\nDear Carolyn: I recently received a handmade wedding invitation from a friend who is somewhat of an ascetic. I like to give gifts for special occasions, and I think people deserve a nice present for a marriage. My friend has asked that instead of receiving gifts, she and her fiance would prefer a contribution to one of three charities they selected.\n\nI would not have a problem matching the gift value with a contribution, but I really do not like the idea of not giving them a gift for themselves. Am I being selfish by needing to give them a gift? Are they being selfish to themselves (they are not rich) by not having a registry? What is the proper thing to do in this instance?\n\nAD\n\n— Stuck on Tradition\n\nStuck on Tradition: I know when I receive a wedding invitation, it takes every ounce of strength I have not to go out and buy a toaster.\n\nAD\n\nBut find the strength on this one, please.\n\nFor one thing, the landfills will thank you for not burdening them with old, working toasters that no one wants just because they aren't new, conjugal toasters.\n\nFor another thing, they don't want you to buy them a toaster.\n\nSince you asked about propriety: Couples who do request charitable contributions need to take care to save this request for when they're expressly asked for their registry or gift preferences. Even compassion comes across as a shakedown when it's annexed to the invitation.\n\nAD\n\nBut your proper role as guest is clear regardless: Respect the couple's wishes (to the extent your values allow). If a couple prefers donations to a charity, then guests can give to charity, give nothing or give checks made out to the couple — which they can then donate, spend on themselves or fold into cranes.\n\nAD\n\nI hesitate to add this, because I reject the whole premise, but: If your value system forces you to give objects, then choose something they can consume (wine, candles, stationery) — or store in an album (card, photo, poem about toasters).\n\nOff to research what selfish to themselves means.
It was September in New York City. The inevitable summer heat wave finally subsided, and the weather was perfect. We met in Harlem for our first date and rode bikes to the Met Cloisters. We both loved the outdoors, so after exploring the museum and swinging by a few gardens we found a patch of grass overlooking the Hudson River in Fort Tryon Park in Manhattan, laid our blanket down and talked until sunset. It was the beginning of what felt like a perfect relationship.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy December we'd said, I love you, met each other's parents and traveled internationally as a couple. We talked about moving in together when our leases ended, then about marriage, kids and all the fixings of a happily-ever-after.\n\nBut as the honeymoon phase faded, it became glaringly clear that we weren't truly compatible. We bumped heads constantly and, at pivotal times of need, we'd read each other wrong and fail to find respite from the outside world in each other. A younger version of myself may have stuck it out for a few more months, afraid of abandoning the dream of a future I'd become so attached to. But I knew it wasn't what I wanted, so I walked away.\n\nAD\n\nI woke up the next morning ready for regret to set in. It never did. Despite my desire to have a family, I decided that I want to wait until I find the right person and keep growing until I do. Of course, I had no idea how long the wait might be, but I was already vaguely familiar with one way to buy myself more time: egg-freezing.\n\nAD\n\nLike most millennials, social media is an everyday part of my life. I'm also a journalist. So I've come across plenty of stories about egg-freezing, with headlines like This Female CEO Froze Her Eggs to Put Her Career First, usually followed by questions like: Is it worth it? Is it a scam? I pored over many of these articles, curious about the process, wondering whether it was a realistic option for someone like me and totally unsure of where to start. Truth is, I'd only recently activated the make your own doctor's appointments muscle of adulting, and I didn't even know what type of doctor I'd need to go to.\n\nSo I left it alone as an action item.\n\nAD\n\nThen came my break up with Jordan. I realized that there are probably lots of other women who don't have enough information to make an informed decision either. So, I decided to woman up and report on it. In my video series as a filmmaker for The Post, I'm taking you along on my journey. By the time I finish, I should know exactly what it takes, and you will, too.\n\nAD\n\nI knew the basics — for example that women experience a decline in fertility in their 30s. But why does that happen? Is it the same for every woman? And why are conversations about our fertility couched in comparisons to a man's seemingly never-ending supply of sperm? I soon discovered that it might have something to do with the origins of the now-infamous term biological clock.\n\nAD\n\nAfter conducting an office straw poll in the 1970s, Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen penned a piece in the Metro section about the whispers of anxiety he'd been hearing around the newsroom. Female colleagues would come to his office and talk to him about dating, relationships and the stresses of being career women, so he wrote about it.\n\nAs others have noted, his article didn't age well. With remarks like There was something about their situation that showed, more or less, that this is where liberation ends, Cohen positioned the biological clock as a moment of reckoning for women that makes us irrevocably unequal.\n\nAD\n\nThe term has withstood time, as has the notion that careers and anatomical differences are co-conspirators against women in our fight for equal everything, including our ability to find the right partner in our own time and still have a family.\n\nAD\n\nBut in 2018, the idea that having a job interferes at all with my ability to find a partner I want to procreate with makes no sense to me. Yes, accepting a job offer in a different city can put a wrench in a long-term relationship, but if I'm dating someone where I live, he probably works too, so our availability will probably be about the same.\n\nMy mother gave birth to me at 28, divorced when I was 2, and raised me as a single mother while working and going to medical school. Her journey, while not the norm, is indicative of how self-sufficient and independently upwardly mobile women have become. The idea that women — especially women with full-time partners — can't balance having children and a career is hard for me to believe. And the truth is that in an era when wages haven't been keeping pace with the cost of living — including the cost of college tuition — my future partner may well rely on me to help provide for our family financially.\n\nAD\n\nI am single and babyless not because my career is standing in the way, but because I haven't met the person I want to make one with yet.\n\nAD\n\nMy biological clock does present a unique challenge, though: time. I don't envy men for having more time to have children, but I am aware of the limits it presents for me. Even if I met the right person tomorrow, between dating and, ideally, childless married bliss for a couple years, I'll be in my mid-30s by the time I even start trying to conceive.\n\nIn a world where my uterus is pitted against me, freezing my eggs could level the playing field by giving me more control over my reproductive life span. Yet I need a concrete understanding of how my body works and how egg-freezing works in order to take the helm of my reproductive health.\n\nUnderstanding our bodies enables us to make informed choices with the cards (and the limited number of eggs) we're dealt.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI don't want to persuade you to freeze your eggs. That is a personal decision, and I also realize it's an option many women can't afford. I don't even know if I will do it. But I hope to demystify a pivotal moment for women when amorphous outside pressures begin to weigh on our love lives. I'll tackle everything from assessing your own fertility and the woes of hormone injections and ultrasounds to sharing your decision with family and, most importantly, the costs — all on camera.\n\nWhile you're watching my personal journey, I want to hear from you. Have you ever thought about freezing your eggs? What are you most curious about when it comes to women's fertility? How do you view the pros and cons?

While jumping on one, authorities say, Jesse fell through. He plunged 25 feet into a four-foot-wide drainage pipe, then was swept away.\n\nHis cousins called out to him, the Los Angeles Times reported, but all they heard were the echoes of their voices.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 100 rescuers worked through the night to try to find the 13-year-old — a task made more difficult because, they say, it was too dangerous to send a searcher into the mazelike network of pipes beneath the city.\n\nAD\n\nFor 12 hours, they found nothing.\n\nThen a sanitation crew put a camera into a maintenance hatch a mile from the park.\n\nThe camera showed crews a feed of Jesse, alive and talking, according to Los Angeles CW affiliate KTLA. Rescuers managed to pull him out, and one of them gave him a cellphone to call his family. They notified city authorities a little later.\n\nIt's with happy hearts that all Los Angeles City agencies are able to state that we have found Jesse Hernandez, Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott said at a news conference early Monday. As you can imagine, we are overwhelmed with joy.\n\nAD\n\nHe was found in a pipe about four feet wide along the 134 Freeway. Searchers had analyzed a map of drainage pipes to identify the most probable area that Jesse would be, Scott said. So part of that search was to open up these maintenance hatches or these holes.\n\nAD\n\nJesse was taken to a hospital, although authorities didn't specify his injuries. Scott said the boy also had to be decontaminated.\n\nFor hours, authorities had been talking about how difficult it was to navigate the network of pipes. At some points, the water is two feet deep and moves at a 15-mph clip, ABC News reported.\n\nThat place is a maze, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Bruno La Hoz told the L.A. Times on Sunday. We don't know where the drain pipe goes to.\n\nAD\n\nTo find Jesse, rescuers turned to technology, hoping sophisticated waterproof cameras used to inspect the city's drainage system would provide a glimpse of the missing boy.\n\nOne camera crawled along the bottom of pipes and transmitted images to crews nearby. Another was attached to a boogie-board-like flotation device, the L.A. Times reported. It went 300 feet down one pipe.\n\nAD\n\nBut neither caught sight of the boy. Rescuers fanned out to sites where the sewage system drains and searched chambers where Jesse may have gotten trapped.\n\nAll possible City resources are being utilized in the search for Jesse, the fire department said in a statement.\n\nTelevision news footage showed dozens of firefighters in climbing gear and helmets standing over a hole in the ground, the whole area brightened by floodlights. Others could be seen peering into the nearby Los Angeles River.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, Jesse's family members and friends were keeping a vigil at the park. More than 20 remained late Sunday and were being comforted by city officials.\n\nHe's too young. It's just crazy. I still can't believe it, Dominique Barraza, 16, a family friend, said Sunday. We called, sent text messages — it rings, but it goes to voice mail.\n\nThen, on Monday morning, Jesse called them.
A solemn, all-Republican delegation led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.) then marched across the Capitol to formally deliver the articles of impeachment to the secretary of the Senate, triggering what promises to be a trial like no other to determine whether the 42nd president will be removed from office. At the same time, scores of restive House Democrats piled into buses to drive up Pennsylvania Avenue and rally around their embattled leader at the White House.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEmerging from the Oval Office with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on his arm and Vice President Gore at his side, the president stood with his Democratic defenders and decried the partisan vote against him. Brushing aside calls for resignation, Clinton vowed to serve until the last hour of the last day of my term.\n\nThe historic votes in the grand chamber at the Capitol came just hours after the newly anointed House speaker, Bob Livingston (R-La.), called on Clinton to resign and then, abruptly and unexpectedly, took his own advice. I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston said, announcing he will step down because of the extramarital affairs he had reluctantly revealed on the eve of the impeachment debate.\n\nRarely has the capital been so whipsawed by events, as the nation's top leadership was left in disarray at the same time U.S. military forces mounted a fourth and final day of bombing runs against Iraq. Perhaps the last time a single day combined twin moments of history like this was Jan. 20, 1981, when Ronald Reagan was sworn in as president just minutes before 52 American hostages held in Iran flew to freedom.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet unlike that dramatic day, few in Washington found much to celebrate on Dec. 19, 1998. What started out as an indiscreet dalliance with Monica S. Lewinsky, an 18-month series of casual sexual encounters and racy telephone calls, had unleashed the full force of a constitutional crisis. Now, the impeachment and pending trial of a president who remains popular with the public may redefine the relationship between executive and legislative branches for decades to come. And shellshocked lawmakers found themselves struggling to make sense of a new politics of turmoil that, to different degrees and for different reasons, has claimed Clinton, Livingston and retiring Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.).\n\nThis is all so overwhelming, said Rep. Michael N. Castle (R-Del.), one of the moderates who tried unsuccessfully to find a bipartisan compromise to impeachment but ultimately supported one of the articles calling for Clinton's removal. There have been so many bombshells you can barely turn your back.\n\nIn his six-minute address on the South Lawn, outside a White House bedecked for Christmas in just six days, Clinton blamed a toxic Washington for his plight. We must stop the politics of personal destruction, he said. We must get rid of the poisonous venom of excessive partisanship, obsessive animosity and uncontrolled anger. That is not what America deserves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans, queasy themselves about the quickly shifting personal code of conduct for politicians, echoed the general sentiments, although they were quick to add that the president had only himself to blame for turning private foibles into public misconduct. If he truly cared about the nation's well-being, they said, Clinton would put the larger good ahead of his own needs and follow Livingston's lead.\n\nHe understood what this debate was all about, Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) said of the would-be speaker, his voice quavering and his eyes teary as he took the floor shortly after Livingston's speech. It was about honor and decency and integrity and truth.\n\nIn contrast to Livingston's private acts, Hyde called Clinton a serial violator of the oath to tell the truth. Equal justice under the law, that's what we're fighting for, he said. And when the chief law enforcement officer trivializes, ignores, shreds, minimizes the sanctity of the oath, then justice is wounded, and you're wounded, and your children are wounded.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe votes that followed made Clinton the only chief executive other than Andrew Johnson to be impeached by the House and forced to defend his presidency in a trial where Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist will serve as presiding officer and all 100 senators will sit as silent jurors. Under the Constitution, conviction and removal from office requires a two-thirds vote, meaning 67 senators would have to support his ouster.\n\nLike Johnson, who escaped the ultimate political punishment by a single vote in 1868, Clinton could hang on to power. With Republicans controlling the Senate 55 to 45, few in either party anticipate that enough Democrats would cross party lines to convict Clinton. Yet a trial heralded the prospect of months more of the unseemly political crisis that has polarized and paralyzed Washington since the Lewinsky scandal broke on Jan. 21.\n\nEven if he is acquitted or forestalls a trial through some sort of plea bargain-style deal, the House action ensured that Clinton will go down in history not as the transformational leader he once hoped to be, but as a scandal-tarred president whose administration was hobbled either by his own fatal flaws or by an all-out partisan assault, depending on who does the writing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) yesterday began preparing for a trial. Senators will be prepared to fulfill their constitutional obligations, he said. But he did not outline any schedule, noting that Clinton could file motions or other pleadings before a trial commences. The timing will depend greatly on the president and his lawyers, Lott said.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) called the impeachment vote a sad day for all Americans and rejected calls for Clinton's resignation. While the behavior of the president in this matter was deplorable and merits punishment, Daschle said, we cannot allow any president – Republican or Democrat – to be forced from office by a party-line vote in the House of Representatives.\n\nClinton and his allies still hope to avert a Senate showdown through some sort of agreement in which Congress would censure him for his admitted transgressions while allowing him to serve out his term through Jan. 20, 2001. Such an alternative was blocked in the House yesterday by Republican leaders who called it unconstitutional. Democrats tried to force a floor vote through a parliamentary maneuver, but were rejected on a 230 to 204 vote. To protest, Democrats staged a brief walkout as voting began on Article I of the impeachment resolution.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans derided censure as illegitimate, with Hyde calling it impeachment lite. Impeachment was the remedy envisioned by the Constitution for Clinton's misdeeds, GOP leaders insisted.\n\nIf our country looks the other way, our country will lose its way, said Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.).\n\nThe country has tried to look the other way throughout an extraordinary year that made Monica Lewinsky a household name and left an indelible mark on American politics.\n\nThen a 22-year-old White House intern from Beverly Hills, Lewinsky came to be the president's on-and-off mistress in November 1995. A year ago, she became a witness in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton when attorneys for the former Arkansas state clerk were seeking evidence of a pattern of sexual misbehavior by the president. Onetime friend Linda R. Tripp taped Lewinsky talking about conspiring with Clinton to lie in the case and turned the recordings over to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe result 11 months later was a pair of impeachment articles charging that Clinton has betrayed his trust as president and has acted in a manner subversive of the rule of law and justice in trying to impede Jones's suit and Starr's resulting criminal investigation.\n\nArticle I alleged that Clinton committed perjury when he testified before Starr's grand jury via closed-circuit television hookup from the White House on Aug. 17. While he acknowledged the Lewinsky affair he had denied in his Jones deposition, he insisted they never engaged in sexual relations because they did not have intercourse. Implicitly conceding that Lewinsky performed oral sex on him, Clinton denied that he ever touched her in intimate ways that would have been covered by the definition of sex used by Jones's lawyers.\n\nArticle III alleged that Clinton obstructed justice both in the Jones case and the Starr investigation by encouraging Lewinsky to file a false affidavit denying their affair, arranging a job for her with the help of friend Vernon E. Jordan Jr. at a time she could be a damaging witness against him and coaching Oval Office secretary Betty Currie to agree that he and Lewinsky never had sex and never were alone.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe article of impeachment is adopted, Rep. Ray LaHood (R-Ill.), serving as presiding officer of the proceedings, intoned after each passed.\n\nBut the House decided to split the difference, opting not to pass Article II, which alleged that Clinton committed perjury in his Jan. 17 Jones deposition, or Article IV, which charged that he abused the power of his office by lying under oath in response to 81 questions posited by the Judiciary Committee during its impeachment inquiry.\n\nWhile members proclaimed they cast votes of conscience, unfettered by pressure from party leaders, they displayed remarkable party solidarity. Only four Republicans opposed all four articles, while five Democrats voted for at least one of them.\n\nArticle I passed 228 to 206, with five Republicans, including Maryland's Constance A. Morella, crossing party lines to vote no and five Democrats, including Virginia's Virgil H. Goode Jr., offsetting them by voting yes.\n\nArticle II was rejected at 1:42 p.m. on a 229 to 205 vote, with 28 Republicans bucking the party line. Article III was adopted 17 minutes later, 221 to 212, without help from eight Republicans who supported Article I but picking up one who did not. And Article IV failed at 2:15 p.m. as a third of the Republican caucus joined Democrats in voting it down 285 to 148.\n\nRep. Paul McHale, (D-Pa.), who supported all but the final article, said afterward that he would have preferred to vote to censure the president, but with that option blocked, I came to the conclusion a president for whom I voted twice had broken the law.\n\nRep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), who said a few days ago he was rethinking his opposition to impeachment, voted no after all, following a Friday meeting with Clinton. I believe that the impeachable offenses have not been proven and that the proven offenses are not impeachable, Shays said. But they are close.\n\nIn addition to Shays and Morella, the Republicans who voted against Article I were Amo Houghton (N.Y.), Peter T. King (N.Y.) and Mark Edward Souder (Ind.). In addition to McHale and Goode, the Democrats supporting it were Ralph M. Hall (Tex.), Charles W. Stenholm (Tex.), and Gene Taylor (Miss.).\n\nThose same Democrats also voted for Article III, as did Souder. But this time, Republicans Sherwood L. Boehlert (N.Y.), Phil English (Pa.), Nancy L. Johnson (Conn.), Jay Kim (Calif.), Jim Leach (Iowa), John M. McHugh (N.Y.), Ralph Regula (Ohio) and Castle switched to no votes.\n\nThe split decision could shape the future meaning of high crimes and misdemeanors set forth as the standard for impeachment in the Constitution. With so little precedent, future presidents and lawmakers may look back and conclude that perjury in a civil lawsuit does not rise to an impeachable offense and lying to Congress does not amount to abuse of power. On the other hand, perjury or other misconduct in a criminal investigation has been defined as an offense serious enough to contemplate eviction from the White House.\n\nThe House schism also could affect the impeachment case against Clinton as it goes to trial. In eliminating the president's testimony in the Jones case as a basis for impeachment, the House essentially knocked out the underlying offense on which the charges stemming from his grand jury testimony were based.\n\nRep. Barney Frank (Mass.), a senior Judiciary Democrat, argued that weakens the case because the issues in the grand jury testimony were so narrow. No other lies are now relevant, Frank said. By losing that perjury, they have lost most of what they had talked about. In the grand jury, he basically told the truth. Now the argument is over the details.\n\nFrank added that the obstruction case is weak, because Lewinsky specifically told the grand jury no one instructed her to lie or offered her a job to keep quiet.\n\nBut Republicans viewed the obstruction of justice charge as a linchpin of their case and predicted the passage of the two articles would provide them with enough evidence to make a compelling argument to the Senate.\n\nAt the end of the day, the president of the United States is impeached, said Rep. Charles T. Canady (R-Fla.), who with Hyde will serve as one of 13 managers or prosecutors in the Senate trial. I don't think it's going to have a big impact on the way the case is presented.\n\nWhile it became evident days before that at least one article would pass as moderate Republicans one by one came out in favor of impeachment, yesterday's floor debate had a raw quality as members, shocked by Livingston's self-immolation, dispensed with the programmatic speeches of Friday's session and spoke extemporaneously.\n\nLivingston acknowledged Thursday night that he had on occasion strayed from my marriage, while contrasting his indiscretions from Clinton's by noting that he never engaged in an affair with a subordinate on his staff or testified about his personal relationships under oath. Democrats did not buy the distinction and deemed the revelation to be an example of Republican hypocrisy in the Clinton case.\n\nSo a hush fell over the chamber when Livingston took the floor in the morning for his first public comments since his admission, which was forced by inquiries from Hustler magazine. Livingston made the case for impeachment, saying, We're not ruled by kings or emperors and there is no divine right of president. And he said if Clinton truly believed a Senate trial would distract the nation for months, as he has said, then the president should resign your post.\n\nThat triggered an angry wave of catcalls on the Democratic side of the chamber, where members began calling out, No! No! Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) banged her open palm on the table in front of her and, along with several others, began shouting, You resign! You resign!\n\nThen, to their surprise, he did just that. I'm willing to heed my own words, Livingston said. Not only will he not stand for election as speaker when the next House is sworn in come January, he said, he will give up his seat in six months.\n\nI was prepared to lead our narrow majority as speaker and I believe I had it in me to do a fine job, he said, but I cannot do that job or be the kind of leader I would like to be under these circumstances. So I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow.\n\nThe announcement was that rare moment in modern politics that involved no polls and no advance warnings. And it instantly transformed the day's deliberations, casting a pall over the House and adding emotional gravity to the subsequent speeches by both Republicans and Democrats. But as Republicans tried to shame Clinton with Livingston's decision, Democrats pivoted within minutes and tried to turn the speaker-to-be's resignation into a rallying cry against the intrusion of personal frailties into politics. One after another, Democrats took the microphone and implored Livingston to reverse himself, lest he give in to what one called sexual McCarthyism.\n\nMinority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) tore up the speech he had written and, in a powerful address that drew members from both sides of the aisle to their feet, praised Livingston as a worthy and good and honorable man, calling his move a terrible capitulation to the negative forces that are tearing at the body politic. I pray with all my heart that he will reconsider this decision, Gephardt said.\n\nA silent Livingston nodded acknowledgment of the applause.\n\nLivingston's abdication may have chastened some lawmakers into restraining their rhetoric on the floor, but it also robbed much of import from the House vote.\n\nWhat's happened has just squeezed the life out of what will be the most important vote anyone here will ever cast. There's no drama, said Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.). It's like another nerve gas, a pathogen in this medicine chest of toxic politics. . . . It continues a pattern here that this is all smaller than life. War, impeachment, the second speaker biting the dust, but I don't think you see the grand moment.
I don't want that to happen with the mother of this baby, but how do I approach this?\n\nOn one hand, I say something to the poor girl, and I break my brother's trust.\n\nOn the other, if I don't say anything, I break her trust.\n\nEither way, it seems I'm stuck in a tidal wave of drama. Is there a way I can at least lessen the storm?\n\nAD\n\n— A Morally Confused Sister\n\nMorally Confused Sister: You see this as a matter of trust-breaking — or perhaps the other principals involved gaslight you into believing that you have a duty to either keep or disclose secrets. You are not in charge of policing your adult brother. You don't owe it to either party to tell — or lie.\n\nAD\n\nYou have to imagine that the women your brother chooses must have some awareness of his womanizing, because — presumably — he is cheating on someone else when he takes up with them.\n\nBecause there is a baby in the picture, the stakes are different now, and you might give your wonderful brother a heads up by telling him, I just want you to know that the next time I find out you're cheating, I'm not going to keep your secret for you. You could also say to the woman, My brother has a history of cheating on his partners. I hope he behaves differently with you.\n\nAD\n\nUnfortunately, this does not keep you out of the tidal wave of drama — it means you would be surfing on the first wave. And — I assure you — if you tell a woman your brother is cheating on her, she could find a way to blame you (or hate you), anyway.\n\nAD\n\nPlant your family flag with this baby and assume that at some point your brother will cheat. If you want (or feel forced) to declare your loyalty to maintain a close relationship with the child and its mother, you might say to him, Um ... this time, I choose her.\n\nDear Amy: A few months ago, I offered to my 45-year-old niece our home for her wedding. This will be her third wedding and his second.\n\nAD\n\nWhat I thought was going to be an afternoon ceremony with 50 attendees has turned into an evening ceremony with 90, followed by an outdoor party with a DJ and loud music into the wee hours.\n\nWhile we would be issued an event permit, we will not be permitted to have a DJ play past 9 p.m. That hasn't phased my niece, who asked, What would the police do, arrest me? I told her at the very least they would cite my husband and me for noise violation.\n\nAD\n\nWe also have limited parking on our road. We can accommodate eight to 10 vehicles, but if 70 people show up, there will probably be 35 cars to find parking for.\n\nI discussed this all with our town's police chief (who issues the permits), and he said he would be happy to do a walk-through with us next week.\n\nAD\n\nThen there is the issue of portable-toilet rental, the use of our small kitchen by the catering staff, etc.\n\nThe obvious answer here is to tell my niece and her fianc that they will have to make other plans. Can you suggest how to do that?\n\n— Anxious Aunt\n\nAnxious Aunt: Double-check your insurance policy. And then say, I blame myself for not communicating this more emphatically earlier, but your wedding has outgrown our ability to host it. I think you'll have to find a professional event space.\n\nAD\n\nDo not delay. Do this now.\n\nDear Amy: Caring Friend reported that her dear friend was about to enter into a green card same-sex marriage. I disagree with your response. These marriages are wrong, and illegal.

I agree that there were many red flags here, but blaming and shaming wouldn't serve the greater good.

(I am now 84 and in pretty good health).\n\nWe all got along very well until about six months ago, but I don't know why. Nothing was ever said openly. They purchased a lake house recently and spend weekends at that home. I am not invited (nor do I want to be). There are no children involved — just the three of us. I do have a little dog that he seems to hate — but I cannot give the dog away.\n\nAD\n\nLately I get the feeling that my son-in-law is not happy with our situation. He barely speaks to me and mumbles good morning or good night.\n\nI contribute to the household, pay rent, clean house, wash their clothes, take care of their dog, etc. I have spent thousands of dollars on this house and paid a third of the purchase price.\n\nShould I speak to my daughter about this? She and I get along very well. I feel she knows there is friction here but has not said anything to me about it. Should I look for another place to live? I don't really want to live alone, but I will if I have to.\n\nAD\n\n— Challenged\n\nChallenged: First this: Your arrangement seems to have worked well for everyone for nine successful and peaceful years.\n\nAD\n\nUnfortunately, each person in the household seems extremely averse to bringing up a topic — or even asking a question — that might result in an uncomfortable moment or two, and so you have spent the last six months engaged in an extremely uncomfortable silent standoff. It is human nature to avoid discomfort, but you all have taken it to a new level.\n\nYou are a full partner in this household — you helped pay for the house and pay rent and expenses.\n\nSit down with them (if you can't manage to face him, speak with your daughter). Say, I feel a lot of tension lately; can you tell me what is bothering you? It would be good to clear the air. I miss the way we all used to get along. This might have started over a very trivial household matter. Or it might not have anything to do with you — but with work, marriage or health difficulties of theirs.

AD\n\nWe are not going to stop until Republicans don't even want to run candidates here, said McAdams, 54, a molecular geneticist turned singer-songwriter with a fondness for alliterative phrases. We are going to make this place too blue to bother.\n\nIn this affluent outpost of the state capital, local Democrats are done playing Iowa nice. They are mounting aggressive recruitment campaigns, mocking opponents and organizing to try to push Republicans out of elected seats, including offices that are traditionally nonpartisan.\n\nTheir strategy has upended the live-and-let-live atmosphere that often permeates the suburbs, where some Democrats said they used to be content to focus on their families and leave local politics to the other party. Republicans have gained more power in rural areas and manufacturing towns, turning a state that twice voted for Barack Obama into a place where Republicans have total control of the Capitol and President Trump won easily.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven as Iowa Democrats focus on their first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest on Monday, with many still undecided and anguishing over their choice, activists are trying not to lose sight of a longer-term political goal: staging a political takeover.\n\nIt's a sprint to the finish for the Democratic presidential candidates in Iowa, where caucusgoers will cast the first votes of the 2020 campaign. (The Washington Post)\n\nToday's suburbs aren't like the ones that existed 30, 20 or even four years ago. Between rapid population growth, shifting demographics and anti-Trump sentiments, they have become key to Democratic hopes of compensating for the defection of many working-class white voters to the GOP.\n\nState data shows that the great voter-registration advantage that Republicans once had in the Des Moines suburbs continues to narrow. In 2018, four state House seats and one congressional seat went from red to blue. In 2019, Democrats in Polk County won 13 seats on city councils and school boards that had been held previously by Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Democratic Party's biggest successes in those years came in a part of the state that was overwhelmingly white, well educated and affluent — home to some of the fastest-growing cities in the United States.\n\nWhen McAdams and her family moved to Ankeny in 1999, this place was a reliably red bedroom community of 27,000. By 2018, the number was 66,000 and growing.\n\nWidened roads and state highways connect Ankeny to cities that were once surrounded by fields and farms, like Johnston, Urbandale and Waukee, which boasts of students speaking 62 languages in the schools.\n\nPlaces where soybeans were planted and pigs once roamed are sprouting $750,000 houses, townhouses for young professionals, strip malls with barre studios and restaurants with chicken tandoori and quinoa bowls.\n\nOn this night, McAdams's Ankeny Army was composed of those relative newcomers. Here was Kelsie Goodman, a 35-year-old high school assistant principal who had returned home because there were so many more options in this area than there had been before. She was proud to be from a state that was the first in the Midwest to legalize same-sex marriage, a place that helped to springboard the candidacy of the first black president. But as her state was slowly diversifying, she had become concerned that Trump was empowering voters who resented those very distinctions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNext to her was Amy Tagliareni, a 49-year-old administrator of a small nonprofit and a mother of a middle-schooler. She had moved to the state in 2008 but had never voted in a primary until 2018. She voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election but felt she needed to become more active because so many middle-class white women like her had voted Republican or chosen not to vote at all. The president won the majority in all but one precinct of Ankeny districts in Polk County.\n\nI feel so embarrassed, she said.\n\nThe two women were representative of the people who were fueling the activism in Ankeny: young professionals and mothers with older children. They were horrified most by what they saw as the Trump administration's poor treatment of the vulnerable — separating immigrant families, restricting food stamps, banning refugees — and were desperate to post some wins. So they decided to play hard.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe change was evident when the Polk County Democrats invited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to a fundraiser. Some officials from other parts of the state warned against bringing such a polarizing figure to a politically fractured state, but more than 350 people attended.\n\nThe fundraiser also attracted protesters who supported the president but misspelled his name: T-R-M-U-P.\n\nIn past years, nicer Democratic parties would let that go, said Sean Bagniewski, chairman of the Polk County Democrats. We took a picture, paid for a Facebook ad and showed it to 500 hundred dollars' worth of people.\n\nConventional practice used to be that local elections were strictly nonpartisan affairs. No more. In 2018 and 2019, the Polk County group dispatched fliers to registered Democrats that showed the name and picture of every person in their party running for office, from the Congress to the school board.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOur message was simple, Bag­niewski said. These are the Democrats. This is the fight of our lives. Get rid of Donald Trump.\n\nNow, it is Republican politicians who are fighting for their political preservation. In Urbandale, the Republican mayor switched parties. State House Majority Leader Chris Hagenow, seeking reelection, switched neighborhoods.\n\nAnd last week, state Sen. Zach Nunn filed legislation that would ban county parties from pouring money into nonpartisan races and printing fliers like the ones distributed by Bagniewski.\n\nA local school board trying to figure out how to fund a teacher program or a city council working to fix a street should not be a partisan issue, Nunn said. What they are doing is, in a word, frightening.\n\nAD\n\nNunn also said he didn't think it was very wise. While the Democrats were experiencing more success in Ankeny, he was able to sail through his election in Altoona — one of those blue-collar Democratic districts that swung for Trump. Their attitude, he said, only solidified the idea that the party was catering to the elite.\n\nAD\n\nThey might win these suburbs, but they are going to lose every other part of the state, and all the gains they make will be mitigated, Nunn said. But as a Republican in the suburbs, he readily admitted he felt a bit endangered.\n\nI'm one of the last ones left, he said.\n\nOn a snowy Saturday, about a week before the caucuses, the new activists were targeting another one of the last remaining Republicans, a square-jawed state senator named Brad Zaun. Zaun was attending a legislative forum held in a no-frills community room at a local park, on a panel that included the Urbandale mayor and state Rep. Karin Derry, a political newcomer who had won her seat during the Democratic wave of 2018.\n\nAD\n\nThere's a lot of publicity around the Democrats, but we live in a great community, and it hasn't changed that much, Zaun said in an interview. I'm up for reelection this year, and I'm not too worried.\n\nAD\n\nThe Democratic activists saw it differently. When the forum started, they took their seats. There was nothing particularly coordinated about them; they weren't wearing special uniforms or reciting catchy slogans. They didn't even sit next to one another.\n\nThey took turns asking Zaun questions about issues that concerned them. When one asked him to fight for more money to go toward education, another held up her cellphone to record Zaun responding that he would rather try to find ways to cut administrative costs. This was potential fodder to argue that Zaun was weak on school funding.\n\nWhen one asked Zaun about a bill that would make it illegal for institutions to ban guns from their parking lots, another recorded footage of Zaun saying he was a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. This was potential footage to show he didn't want gun control.\n\nDerry, the state representative, knew most of the activists at the forum. After all, she had hosted them at a late-in-the-season holiday party the night before. The activists, all women, ate cookies and cheesecake and sat around her Christmas tree, speckled with blue ornaments — a tradition that started in 2016 as a symbolic protest of Trump. They discussed the pop star Lizzo and their husbands and how to come up with a strategy to get another friend elected to Zaun's seat.\n\nAD\n\nThe plan didn't seem like that much of a coup. They had done the same for Derry, knocking on doors and making phone calls to get her elected in a district where the Republican registration advantage had shrunk from 14 percentage points in 2016 to about 7 today.\n\nThe arguments against Zaun would largely be the same. They would tell residents that the 2016 election — which also gave Republicans all three branches of Iowa government — had deep consequences.\n\nRepublicans had weakened collective bargaining, passed voter restrictions and curbed abortion rights. Derry found that even her conservative neighbors were willing to listen to their points.\n\nLifelong Republicans such as Mark Toebben, a 62-year-old retired business executive, voted for her for reasons that went beyond Trump. He had grown increasingly frustrated that lawmakers wouldn't boost the education budget past the rate of inflation. It felt as if his party was attacking the very thing that made his community great: the school system.\n\nI've really just lost faith in the Republicans, said Toebben, who planned on caucusing with Democrats for the first time. I understand the realities of politics, but I also understand that you have got to see the bigger picture in life. I think they've lost track of the big picture.\n\nIn Ankeny, McAdams was still trying to understand the big picture. She saw her community as a blank political canvas, its future still unwritten.\n\nI can't do anything about Wisconsin — that's their problem, McAdams said. Pennsylvania, Michigan — I can't do anything about that. But I can do some damage in Ankeny, and I can deliver Ankeny to the Democrats on election night.\n\nHer crusade started with a desire to remove Trump, but it was also about herself. After the great unsettling of 2016, she realized she hadn't taken stock of her neighborhood, which had grown so much that she could hardly recognize it.\n\nShe hadn't taken much stock of her country, either. Republicans were sweeping state houses and blocking Obama's agenda in Washington. Young African Americans had grown so exhausted with police violence that they were taking to the streets to assert that their lives, too, had value.\n\nStill, McAdams remained in a state of suburban bliss. She raised children, put on open-mic nights. She figured things couldn't be that bad; after all, the country had elected a black president.\n\nI think a lot of us felt like we had racism under control, that white supremacy was gone, that we'd solved a lot of problems, McAdams said. I think we grew complacent. I know we did. I did.\n\nShe pledged to do something to get more involved — or at least find more like-minded people. She rebuilt the Democratic club's website and updated its social media pages. More residents were visiting the Facebook page, and more started attending meetings. Before 2016, the group averaged a monthly attendance of eight. Now, the attendance averages around 50.\n\nWhen the Democratic candidates began to file in 2018 and 2019, she urged her group members to do everything they could to elect them.\n\nShe asked volunteers to knock on doors. If they did not want to knock on doors, she asked them to make phone calls. If they did not feel comfortable making phone calls, they could write postcards. If not postcards, she'd ask volunteers to drive so others could knock on doors.\n\nAs they set out to find registered Democrats, McAdams saw an Ankeny beyond its stereotype. There were trailer parks, and residents there said they couldn't afford rising rents. Middle-class-looking homes had sunken ceilings and no hot water inside.\n\nThey drove through neighborhoods of Bosnian refugees and met black and South Asian families who had moved for better jobs. Even as the city's median income continued to rise, the suburbs had become more diverse and more stratified.\n\nWe just never noticed it because we were too damn busy, McAdams said.\n\nPolitics was the impetus, but the thing McAdams and others felt they were missing most was community. The old institutions for gathering neighbors — churches, union halls, country clubs — were all playing less of a role in American life. Politics, and the discussion of it, was the suburbs' new social club.\n\nThey started reading clubs, drinking clubs, women's groups. Deshara Bohanna, who would become the first black woman on Ankeny's school board, started a meetup group to discuss racism and diversity.\n\nWe are a family now, McAdams said. And I've got more best friends and sisters and brothers than I did three years ago. I'd be damned if I lost contact with them after 2018. Nothing is stopping us now because we are a family, and Donald Trump is still president.\n\nSo that night at the caucus training, McAdams tried to give the volunteers every tool they would need to make their events run smoothly. She went over complex equations to properly calculate delegate counts. She suggested displaying tallies in publicly visible spaces so everyone could clearly see the results. To prevent perceptions of bias, she asked the volunteers not to wear clothing or buttons endorsing a political candidate.\n\nInstead, she had another suggestion.

(Tom Walsh for The Washington Post)\n\nAcknowledge what the electorate is telling you. Four years ago, voters sent a message by electing a disruptive outsider, in effect telling D.C. that people are sick of business-as-usual. An extremist was elected in the hopes of changing the status quo. That didn't work out to the satisfaction of the majority and change was chosen again. This time the message was mixed. The electorate said: Remove him, but neither do we endorse a blue wave. We don't want an extremist right, but neither do we want an extremist left. You need to confirm that you've heard this, because otherwise you risk alienating half the nation, again.\n\nLet our two major parties learn not to pander to the outlandish fringe voices because those are the very ones that sow the seeds of division. History is littered with failed dictators and their cronies who would divide the masses by pitting one side against the other. Waving a flag in one hand, a testament in the other, only to be amplified by a histrionic media disseminating more falsehood than fact. Let us reject extremist views and return to sanity.\n\nLet's heed the call for an American reunion and recognize that the best path forward is the one in the middle, where we find concession and conciliation through good faith negotiation. Together, we need to reembrace a common purpose and employ common sense, taking responsibility when we decide what is truth and what is fiction.\n\nComing together in times of crisis has always been the hallmark of American strength. Right now, our adversaries are at the gate while we face global crises on multiple fronts. We have the threats of current and future pandemics before us. Polluting the world has consequences and we're seeing the very real ramifications of that happening all around us. Understand that this is about the preservation of our species, the rest of the planet, and the livelihood of future generations. We can be better than this. We have to be better than this.\n\n— Tom Walsh, 63, Penngrove, Calif.
However, this show has one significant difference: It's from executive producer Adam DiVello, creator of the MTV reality empire of Laguna Beach, The Hills and The City. So CMT is hopeful that fans who yearn for the days when Lauren Conrad didn't go to Paris will tune in for a similar viewing experience, except with a Southern twist.\n\nDiVello has a production deal with Lionsgate, the studio behind the scripted drama Nashville — he pitched a reality TV version of the show years ago, which didn't seem feasible until the series moved from ABC to CMT. Even then, Morgan Selzer, CMT's vice president of program development, wasn't convinced a Nashville reality show was a good idea.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe said it had been tried before, and she didn't think it would work, DiVello said during a recent interview. Then she said, 'Maybe if you give it your treatment, [other executives] will go for it.' And they did.\n\nDiVello's treatment is what helped make Laguna Beach and The Hills such a success: Sleekly produced glamour shots of the city. A group of beautiful young people with lots of drama who tend to hook up with each other. And the inexplicable sense for viewers that, despite everything they know about reality TV manipulation, they can actually relate to these cast members.\n\nFocusing on the interpersonal stories, DiVello said, is what will make Music City stand out from the other failed Nashville shows.\n\nAD\n\nI think in our world, it's all about story. … We don't go out for just straight drama — it's not just table-flipping and wine throwing, DiVello said. People come here to chase a dream, but they're putting themselves in their music, and that's the part I wanted to show. I thought if you can capture that connection between chasing a dream and creating a piece of art that talks about that, it's ideal.\n\nThis cast stars Rachyl (who takes on the role as series narrator), an aspiring law student who is married to Kerry, a model with dreams of being a country star. They moved from Los Angeles to Nashville four years ago with their young son, and Rachyl's first voiceover dramatically tells the viewer, I know we moved here for Kerry's dream, but sometimes I feel like I lost my own along the way.\n\nRounding out the group is Jessica, a singer who informs the audience that she's waiting until marriage to have sex; Jackson, who is trying to date Jessica and may or may not have an issue with the aforementioned pledge; Alisa, another singer who is also determined to meet a nice guy; and Alexandra, a Miss Tennessee USA contestant who says things like, That's just what Nashville needs, one more dreamer coming to the city and trying to be a musician.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLocals might roll their eyes at the portrayal of the city, along with the fact that none of the cast members seem to be well-known in the music community. But after years of The Hills stars talking about how producers manipulated scenes, no one is under any illusions that this is actually trying to capture how real Nashville works. It's all about what makes the best TV.\n\nWe always say, it's not a documentary, DiVello said. We're not with them 24 hours a day, so everything has to be planned in advance, locations and whatnot — but the stories are all theirs.\n\nUltimately, he said, I think people know it is what it is.
Here's more about the man, whose election, along with that of Democrat Jon Ossoff, who leads Republican David Perdue with 99 percent of the Georgia votes counted, would tilt the balance of power in the U.S. Senate toward Democrats. Warnock's win would narrow the Republican majority to just one vote.\n\nA minister in the mold of MLK\n\nWith votes still to be counted in the Georgia runoff elections, Democrat Raphael Warnock declared victory over Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) on Jan. 6. (Reverend Raphael Warnock YouTube)\n\nWarnock, a 51-year-old native of Savannah, Ga., was raised in public housing as one of 11 siblings before earning graduate degrees. The connection between his work in ministry and policymaking was a clear one, he said in his campaign announcement video.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome might ask why a pastor thinks he should serve in the Senate, he said. Well, I've committed my whole life to service and helping people realize their highest potential. I've always thought that my impact doesn't stop at the church door. That's actually where it starts.\n\nAt 35, Warnock became the youngest pastor of Ebenezer after holding leadership positions at churches in Birmingham, Ala., Baltimore and New York.\n\nWarnock has always held King, a fellow Georgia native, in high regard. One of his mentors at St. John Baptist Church was quoted as recalling that the civil rights icon was Warnock's ideal — which is in part why he went to Morehouse College, the historically Black men's college King also attended.\n\nAD\n\nRaphael has always been beyond his time, the Rev. Matthew Southall Brown previously told the Savannah Morning News. What I remember most about him was that Martin Luther King was his ideal. When he told me he got the position as pastor at King's church, I said 'Raphael, that is just the place for you.' \n\nAD\n\nIn Birmingham, Warnock was ordained by the Rev. John T. Porter, a pulpit assistant of King's at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Ala. In Harlem, N.Y., Warnock was assistant pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church, where King once spoke to an interracial clergy group.\n\nPolitical activism and ministry are intertwined in the Black church, and that was the case throughout Warnock's career: Over the years, Warnock has advocated for expanding Medicaid, the federal and state program that helps cover medical costs for those with limited incomes; expanding the Affordable Care Act; protecting the voting rights of marginalized Americans; opposing the death penalty; supporting abortion rights; and same-sex marriage.\n\nAD\n\nThe Washington Post's Cleve Wootson wrote in November of Warnock:\n\nHe idolized King, sometimes mimicking the cadence and timbre of the civil rights leader's voice, said people who knew Warnock as a child. Like King, he attended Morehouse College, a historically Black school in Atlanta. In 2005, at age 35, Warnock became the youngest senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, the spiritual home of King, which has for decades been at the symbolic center of activism in Atlanta. Under Warnock, the church has continued to exist at the intersection of piety and racial justice. Lewis's funeral was held there in July. And from the same pulpit, Warnock eulogized Rayshard Brooks — a Black man shot by police who encountered him sleeping in the drive-through lane of an Atlanta Wendy's. Atlanta's police chief resigned the next day as protests engulfed the city.\n\nThe biggest attacks on Warnock's candidacy from his opponent and national Republicans were also tied to his activism and rhetoric as a pastor. An attack ad focused on a clip of Warnock preaching that it is not possible to serve God and the military at the same time. That's a popular passage among liberal Christians who find many conservatives' fervent support for the military to be in conflict with some Christian teaching.\n\nAD\n\nLoeffler also accused Warnock of inviting Communist leader Fidel Castro to a church where he served in the 1990s, an allegation fact-checkers dismissed. Loeffler's campaign also sought to tie Warnock to Jeremiah Wright through attack ads, in ways that PolitiFact described as mostly false. Such attacks prompted backlash from other Black church leaders.\n\nA historic win in Georgia and the South\n\nWarnock's candidacy flew somewhat under the radar in the lead-up to the 2020 election, and his political profile was lower going into that race than that of Ossoff, who had competed in big races before this one.\n\nAD\n\nWarnock received less than 33 percent of the vote in the November special election featuring 20 candidates. The two leading GOP candidates — Loeffler and Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R.-Ga.) — earned nearly 46 percent of the vote combined. No one reaching 50 percent meant that, under Georgia law, that race and the race between Ossoff and Perdue would go to runoffs.\n\nAD\n\nBut Warnock's race began to attract far more headlines given how contentious it became and how much was at stake. Democrats failed to overtake Republicans for the majority in the Senate despite high expectations in the November elections, and a majority-GOP Senate stood to block a significant amount of President-elect Joe Biden's agenda.\n\nThat a Black Democrat will represent Georgia is proof of changing demographics and intense organizing in that state, said Keneshia Grant, a political science professor at Howard University, speaking on the day of the runoff.\n\nAD\n\nWhat this should be understood as is a signal of what is coming — that the Georgia of my mother's youth is not the Georgia of today, she said.\n\nThe Warnock/Loeffler race also appeared to be a microcosm of many of the larger culture and political wars being fought in politics across the country. Warnock sought to replace a lawmaker who has closely aligned herself to President Trump, who lost the state.\n\nAD\n\nTrump's unpopularity with many Georgia voters — many of whom remain upset about the 2018 defeat of Stacey Abrams, who hoped to become America's first Black female governor — helped drive support to Warnock, who was endorsed by Abrams.\n\nWhat to expect from Warnock in the Senate\n\nWarnock ran on a liberal platform, especially supporting criminal justice reform, expanding health-care access and improving the economy and job market for groups that are often left out of economic booms. And the minister's views on these issues are deeply shaped by his religious faith, he has said.
Saudi Arabia pushed hard for the cuts, and at its meeting in Vienna Thursday the cartel decided to reduce oil output by 1 million barrels a day, contingent on nonmembers similarly making a cut of 500,000 barrels a day. In practice, the burden for the latter would fall on Russia.\n\nAD\n\nBut Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that his country can deal with oil prices in the $50 range, down from nearly $60 in the past two weeks. The Russian representative to OPEC, Alexander Novak, walked out of a preliminary meeting in Vienna on Wednesday, when the cuts were being discussed. According to Russian press reports, he is expected to return with Moscow's answer on Friday.\n\nAD\n\nIt was a pretty big power move from the OPEC leadership to announce such a sizable production cut without getting pre-approval from Moscow, Helima Croft, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in an email. It sort of backs Russia into a corner. Say no and the whole OPEC+ marriage could crumble.\n\nKazakhstan, a smaller oil producer in the OPEC+ group, was also resistant to making cuts.\n\nAD\n\nNo one questions that demand is falling.\n\nChina's independent refineries cut imports for crude oil by nearly 20 percent in February, S & P Global Platts, an energy analysis firm, reported Thursday. With the virus now spreading outward from China, the company said that European jet fuel values have dropped to their lowest level since November 2015.\n\nThe research company IHS Markit cited the unprecedented stoppage of Chinese economic activity in February and the current global spread of the covid-19 virus as it forecast a sharp drop in oil consumption.\n\nAD\n\nIt predicted that oil demand for the first quarter of this year would be 3.8 million barrels a day lower than during the first quarter of 2019. Before the coronavirus emerged, analysts were predicting an increase of 700,000 barrels a day over the rate a year ago.\n\nAD\n\nNever before, the firm said in a note, has such a quarterly drop been recorded.\n\nYuri Barsukov, an oil and gas analyst at the Kommersant newspaper in Moscow, noted that the covid-19 epidemic was widespread in the Middle East but not so in Russia, suggesting that as a result the Middle Eastern nations are almost certain to cut production in any case as public health restrictions on travel and work take effect. That could persuade the Kremlin to sit back and watch without reducing its own production.\n\nBut Croft noted that Russia benefits significantly from its association with OPEC, not least in the prestige that goes with it, and would be unlikely to risk that. At the same time, she pointed out that Saudi Arabia will almost certainly not back down in the face of a Russian refusal, because it can't allow Moscow to be seen as calling the shots from outside OPEC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the Saudis, said Greg Priddy, an analyst with Stratfor, which calls itself a geointelligence platform. this issue is much more acute than it is for the Russians.\n\nA few dollars lower from where we are now for a few months isn't going to hurt Russia, he said. Putin, he said, has a clear-eyed view that he is willing to get a lower price if Russia can maintain or expand its market share.\n\nBut in the three years of the OPEC+ arrangement, he said, there is a growing feeling among OPEC countries that Russia has enjoyed a considerable advantage.\n\nThis tension has been building for some time, he said. The core members of OPEC are looking back at Russia and saying, 'You need to do something.'\n\nAD\n\nHe predicted that Russia will likely agree to a smaller cut than it would have been required to make under the Thursday agreement.\n\nAD\n\nThe new tentative cuts would not apply to Iran or Venezuela, both under U.S. sanctions.\n\nBrent crude was trading at just under $50 a barrel Thursday, down from nearly $59 on Feb. 20. OPEC produces about 40 percent of the world's 100 million-barrel-a-day consumption. Russia produces about 11.4 million barrels a day.\n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has had a major adverse impact on global economic and oil demand forecasts for 2020, OPEC said in a statement, particularly for the first and second quarters.\n\nIt said the expected growth in oil consumption this year has been cut by more than half since the previous forecast was made in December.
While President Trump and Democratic leaders have been locked in a stalemate over funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border — with both sides blaming the other for what has become the longest shutdown in U.S. history — workers are making sacrifices that will sting even after the chaos subsides. These are the stories of things they sold to stay afloat.\n\nBaby bomber jacket\n\nAD\n\nFor his first birthday party, Andrea Cavallaro put a pair of orange babyaitor sunglasses on her son, Maverick, and zipped him into a tiny bomber jacket that she had found on a website that sells gear for pilots. It was an impressive match for the one Tom Cruise wore when he played a fighter pilot of the same name in Top Gun, with a fuzzy collar and a handful of patriotic patches. The zipper pull was a tiny metal airplane. After a birthday photo shoot, the jacket hung over Maverick's high chair as he shoved a fistful of cake into his mouth, red icing smearing his cheeks. Now Cavallaro is selling the jacket for $5 on Facebook.\n\nIt's a sentimental item for me, but I know it has to go because I have to feed my kids, Cavallaro said, as her son squealed in the background.\n\nCavallaro's husband is in the Coast Guard. He has worked every day of the shutdown. Last week, the Coast Guard issued a tip sheet of advice for how members should manage their finances while on furlough, suggesting that they babysit or hold a garage sale to bring in extra cash. Cavallaro, 36, joked about the absurdity of being told to have a garage sale in the heart of a Michigan winter, but she still spent days going through things in the basement, posting photos of baby clothes and toys from her three children on Facebook for $5 or $10 apiece.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou never think that if you're working you're going to have to go without a paycheck, Cavallaro said. Until you're in this situation, you don't understand what it does to you. It's made us rethink our finances and rethink what we hold on to.\n\nCrystal toasting flutes\n\nShe didn't think it would bother her, giving up a relic from a life she left behind. But Wendy Bates felt tears welling in her eyes when she sold the Waterford crystal toasting flutes she had raised at her first wedding nearly two decades ago. The marriage may not have lasted, but the glasses were a piece of her history. They sold for $60.\n\nStill gotta eat and pay mortgage, she had written in the ad.\n\nAD\n\nBates has been divorced for a few years and is engaged to a fellow NASA engineer who is furloughed. Bates does engineering work for NASA as a contractor, and her company has allowed employees to keep working full hours to retain their benefits, but they're being paid for only 24 hours. If the shutdown extends until February, they'll have to close the doors.\n\nAD\n\nBates, who lives in Cleveland, is trying to compensate for the lost income by selling whatever she can: living room furniture, artificial plants, patterns from elaborate cross-stitch pieces that now hang on her wall, paraphernalia from three years of Mardi Gras parades and diamond earrings.\n\nAll along I've been thinking, 'Why should I have to sell everything I worked so hard for?'  Bates said. Just because some person sitting up in the White House says that everyone affected by the shutdown supports his decision?\n\nAD\n\nMother-of-the-bride dresses\n\nAs Laurie Slemmons was eagerly awaiting her daughter's wedding, she took a gamble on some dresses she saw online to wear on the big day — one gossamer pink sheath with a lace shawl, another bright purple with petal-like draping. But when they arrived, they weren't what she had envisioned. She felt foolish for buying something from overseas without getting to try it on first, and the website didn't let her return them. But after years of hanging in her closet unworn, they may still be worth something.\n\nAD\n\nI desperately need to sell these dresses due to government shutdown, Slemmons, 53, wrote in a Facebook post. Asking $100 per dress.\n\nAD\n\nSlemmons's husband, the family's main breadwinner, is furloughed from his job with the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Georgia. The couple has drained their savings to get by, straining under credit card debt they accrued to pay for a funeral last year for her father, who had Alzheimer's disease. They're running out of options, on the brink of borrowing against Slemmons's 401(k) or cashing in a life insurance policy. Still, Slemmons is hoping she won't have to sell the cherrywood grandfather clock they found at an estate sale two years ago. A repairman told them it was worth $1,500.\n\nMy husband always wanted a grandfather clock, Slemmons said. But if this goes on, it'll probably have to go.\n\nAD\n\nIn a few days, she will have knee surgery she desperately needs, but because her office job is now the family's only source of income, she'll have to go back to work just days later. If the dresses sell, they'll help pay her medical bills.\n\nAD\n\n1979 Jeep CJ7\n\nWhen Marcia Kendall first saw the Jeep in her local newspaper in 1995, it was already almost 20 years old, in need of work. She brought it back to life, applying the four-wheel wisdom she had gained while working on muscle cars with her older brother when she was growing up. It has been with her through college, through trauma, through divorce and through a tornado. In 2002, she had to sell it to finance a difficult move. She cried for weeks afterward.\n\nFate returned it to her: She saw it in an auto shop five years later and persuaded the owner to sell it to her. She even won a AAA contest for best car story with it. She calls it her baby. But after weeks of furlough from her contract job as a supervisor with the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture in Connecticut, she has little else to give. Kendall, 50, applied for unemployment benefits but hasn't heard back. She's looking for other jobs, but with no means to make her car and credit card payments, she's selling the Jeep on Facebook for $12,000.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis car has been in and out of my life for 24 years, Kendall said. But sometimes you've just got to do what you've got to do.\n\nKendall wrote a long Facebook post about the Jeep, detailing all the work she has done to it over the years and stressing that she wanted it to go to a good home.
The men, accused of conspiring to urge people to violate draft laws, earned so much notoriety that they even had a nickname: The Boston Five. But most people cared only about the fate of Spock, whose seminal work, The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care, first published in 1946, had become the foundation of American parenthood.\n\nAD\n\nListen to this story on Retropod:\n\nAD\n\nDon't be afraid to kiss your baby when you feel like it, Spock urged mothers and fathers, who had been warned for decades to withhold physical affection from their children.\n\nWas the federal government really going to imprison the 64-year-old baby doctor because he'd allegedly encouraged young men to resist the Vietnam draft? And what about Spock's four alleged co-conspirators? Would the Johnson administration lock up a Yale chaplain (who was a former CIA operative), a Harvard graduate student, a former aide to President Kennedy and a New York writer?\n\nAD\n\nThe answer was yes. The government was cracking down. Spock and his cohorts were accused of violating a section of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, which dated to World War I, and declared a person guilty if he knowingly counsels, aids or abets another to refuse or evade registration or service in the armed forces, according to press coverage of the indictment.\n\nSpock, who'd embraced nuclear disarmament as a cause in 1962, was an early critic of the Vietnam War. He believed the U.S. was illegally waging war in Southeast Asia and that it was his patriotic obligation to oppose it, even if it meant risking his iconic status.\n\nAD\n\nMy own belief is that this was a totally outrageous and abominable thing that the United States had been carrying on, he would testify at his trial. I felt strongly that the United States had lost its leadership of the free world and that the United States was now despised by hundreds of millions of people who used to believe in the United States around the world.\n\nAD\n\nThe Johnson administration — empowered by the 1964 Tonkin Gulf Resolution that gave the President authority to take all necessary measures against attacks on U.S. forces — was gradually escalating American involvement in Vietnam. In 1965, Johnson eliminated the draft exemption for married men.\n\nIn 1966, 1967 and 1968, the Selective Service drafted 300,000 men a year, according to Michael Foley's book, Confronting the War Machine: Draft Resistance During the Vietnam War. By 1968, the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam was estimated to be about 500,000. The government felt compelled to quash any threat to its military imperatives, even if it meant making the bespectacled Spock the face of treachery.\n\nAD\n\nBut the draft resistance movement was also surging.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the resistance movement's key moments — later seized upon by The Boston Five's prosecutors — came at an Oct. 16, 1967, rally at Flagstaff Hill in Boston and a march to the nearby Arlington Street Church for a service. More than 5,000 people showed up, many of them college students. People held signs that read, Suppose They Gave a War and Nobody Came? and The Resistance: Don't Dodge the Draft, Oppose it.\n\nThe demonstrators walked to the church, which filled rapidly, with nearly 3,000 participants stuck outside listening to the service on loudspeakers. One lecturer was Michael Ferber, the Harvard graduate student who would shortly become a member of the Boston Five. Ferber told the audience, Each of our acts of returning our draft cards is our personal 'No.' When we put them in a single container or set fire to them from a single candle we express the simple basis of our unity.\n\nThen came the keynote speaker, William Sloan Coffin Jr., a former CIA officer who was serving as a Yale chaplain. In about two months, he, too, would join Ferber and Spock among the Boston Five. But that day he called for churches and synagogues to provide sanctuary for draft resisters. When the sermons were over, men in the pews deposited their draft cards in offering plates carried by the clergy. Members of the press perched in the balcony began snapping photos, Foley wrote, their sounds masking the whispers and tears of the people below relinquishing their draft cards or, in some cases, burning them with candles.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was against the law to destroy draft cards. Failure to carry one's draft card could also result in an arrest, Foley wrote.\n\nFour days later, on Oct. 20, Ferber gathered all the cards collected at the church, including his own, put them in an envelope and took them to Washington. The goal was to give the cards to then-U. S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark in dramatic fashion.\n\nFerber and hundreds of others marched to the U.S. Department of Justice. There, Ferber was joined by three others from the Boston Five: Spock, Coffin and Mitchell Goodman, a writer from New York.\n\nOn the steps of the building, Goodman asked people to turn in their draft cards. Then, Foley wrote, Dr. Spock, wearing his trademark three-piece suit, smiled as the men took turns dropping the returned Selective Service documents into the satchel that he held in his hands.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSpock, Coffin, and former Kennedy aide Marcus Raskin — the fifth member of The Boston Five — went into the Justice Department and presented a briefcase full of draft cards to an assistant deputy attorney general.\n\nMoments later, two FBI agents burst into the conference room and scooped up the briefcase, Foley wrote.\n\nWhen the indictment came down against Spock, 65, Goodman, 44, Coffin, 43, Raskin, 33, and Ferber, 23, it was not only a shock to America, but a shock to the indictees. In an interview with The Washington Post, Ferber said he learned about the charges when he got a call from a United Press International journalist.\n\nThe reporter said, 'Mr. Ferber, do you have any comments?' and I said, 'About what?' recalled Ferber, now 73, the last surviving member of the Boston Five who teaches English and humanities at the University of New Hampshire. Dr. Spock was on the subway and he noticed someone reading one of the tabloids, which had a headline that said, 'Spock Indicted.' He told me he was dying of curiosity to read it over the man's shoulders.\n\nBy then, Spock had become a target of conservatives, who blamed what they considered his permissive child-rearing advice for the sex, drugs and rock-and-roll culture of the '60s. He was denounced by Vice President Spiro Agnew, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and minister Norman Vincent Peale for encouraging the country's moral decline. And now Spock is out in the mobs, leading the permissive babies raised on his undisciplined teaching, Peale said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Boston Five faced a maximum sentence of five years in prison, plus $10,000 in fines. The indictment accused the men of participating in a scheme to interfere with the Selective Service System, which oversaw the draft. Prosecutors relied chiefly on two events to build their case: the Oct. 16 rally at the Boston church and the Oct. 20 draft card turn-in at the Justice Department in Washington.\n\nSpock, along with Coffin, embraced the limelight. In late January, the doctor and the chaplain appeared on NBC's Meet the Press. They said they would use the case to put the Vietnam War on trial and attack the conflict's legality. Around the same time, Spock and Ferber appeared at a rally in New York with thousands of people giving them a standing ovation, according to the New York Times. The political left was raring for the legal fight. According to the Foley book, Ramparts magazine, a bible of liberal intellectuals, declared: [The] Spock case will undoubtedly be one of the most important political trials in American history.\n\nWhen the trial finally got underway in May 1968, the judge, Francis J.W. Ford, a former federal prosecutor, barred Spock and his co-defendants from contesting the war's legality, ruling that such questions were irrelevant.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the packed courtroom, the defendants argued they barely knew each other, and didn't covertly orchestrate their plans — and thus were innocent of the conspiracy charge, which they contended was more fitting for gang cases.\n\nWhen Spock took the stand, the six-foot-four retired pediatrician, a former member of the Yale crew team, seemed to exert superiority over the prosecutor with his mannered style, according to the New Yorker's Daniel Lang. Every day, Spock wore a dark blue suit and a light blue shirt with a high white collar. Spock was unflappable under cross-examination:\n\nWhen [Spock] was asked whether there was any connection between his beliefs about the war and the field of pediatrics, he replied, 'What is the use of physicians like myself trying to help parents to bring up children, healthy and happy, to have them killed in such numbers for a cause that is ignoble?'\n\nSpock also made it clear from the witness stand that he rejected certain antiwar measures. He denounced draft dodgers fleeing to Canada, which he said might help certain individuals but wouldn't help end the war. He also didn't approve of destroying Selective Service files and said he was motivated by a love of country.\n\nAD\n\nDuring his closing arguments, the prosecutor, John Wall, a former paratrooper during the Korean War, gave Spock a backhanded compliment to the jury, according to the New Yorker. I submit to you, you'd be warranted in finding that if he goes down in this case, he goes down like a man, with dignity, worthy of respect, Wall said.\n\nOn June 14, Spock did go down, along with Coffin, Goodman and Ferber, each of whom was convicted of conspiring to counsel young men into evading the draft. Raskin, who just died Dec. 24 at the age of 83, was acquitted.\n\nThe next month, Judge Ford sentenced the four men to two years in federal prison.\n\nWhere law and order stops, obviously anarchy begins, the judge said, before imposing the punishment.\n\nBy July 1969, though, an appeals court overturned their convictions. Spock and Ferber were acquitted and new trials were ordered for Coffin and Goodman.\n\nThe next month, the Justice Department announced that it was dropping the case against Spock and Ferber and would not ask the Supreme Court to reverse their acquittals. And by April, 1970, the government abandoned its pursuit of Coffin and Goodman.\n\nSpock continued protesting long after the troops returned from Vietnam. He turned again to nuclear disarmament and ran for president in 1972 on the People's Party ticket. He got just 75,000 votes. But when he died in 1998 at the age of 94, Baby and Child Care had sold more than 50 million copies.
That was when the reality of being adults set in.\n\nWhile I like to focus on the happiness and love that I brought into my partner's life, I also brought something else — $100,000 in student loan debt, on top of his $20,000.\n\nAs an unmarried, cohabiting couple, we've spent hours discussing the best plan for our finances. Both of our salaries fall significantly under the average salary of $50,651 for those who graduated from college in 2015, so we've had to be careful with money from the start of our post-grad lives. My $1,000 student loan payment each month is my priority. This means my partner has taken on many of our larger living expenses, such as the electric bill and mortgage, and I handle smaller ones, like the Internet and cellphone bill.\n\nIt's easy to feel guilty about this situation, as if I brought a burden into my partner's life. I can't help but think that his financial situation might be easier if he'd ended up with someone who did not have a crushing amount of debt. If that were the case, he may not be living paycheck to paycheck. He may not be having to contribute more than his fair share to household expenses. He may have been able to apply for a home loan with that person, rather than being forced to apply on his own because of my debt-to-income ratio.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut he has decided to create a life with me, debt and all — and we're not the only couples learning to navigate this terrain. According to the Institute for College Access and Success, 68 percent of students who graduated from public and nonprofit colleges in 2015 averaged $30,100 in student loans, up 4 percent from 2014. Take that times two, and the average couple is already over $60,000 in debt — without factoring in credit cards, medical bills, personal loans and more.\n\nAs average student loan amounts increase, unmarried couples have to decide how to face the accruing debt. This may mean having a serious talk about money, something that a Country Financial report found is happening sooner for millennials than for other generations. Financial planners also say they're seeing this conversation play out earlier.\n\nI do see couples willing to discuss their financial situations earlier in the relationship and more candidly with each other, which is great, said Pamela Capalad, a certified financial planner based in Brooklyn. With the amount of debt that a lot of people are carrying, I believe the conversation feels more urgent to have once a relationship starts to get serious.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStudent loan debt can also take a toll on couples when it comes to planning their future. This may mean holding off on buying a home or a car, even planning a wedding. For example, 24-year-old Reed Osell of Minneapolis and his fiancee, Caitlin Krieg, 25, together have over $80,000 in student loan debt.\n\nFor Krieg, the thought of financing a wedding on top of paying student loans is anxiety-inducing. The thought that I could pay off half or more of my student loans with the cost of a wedding keeps me up at night, she said. The only thing keeping us from just going to a courthouse is expectation from family.\n\nAs student loans affect more couples, the strategy taken to attack debt is shifting. Rather than paying off student loans together, many couples, such as Krieg and her fiance, are each handling their own. Krieg attended the College of Saint Benedict, a private school in St. Joseph, Minn., and got degrees in English and education. She teaches seventh grade, and recognizes that a private school education holds a high price tag in relation to a teaching salary. Because she knowingly made this decision, she feels the debt is her responsibility to pay off.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI chose to go to an expensive school, I chose to study abroad, I chose to go into a profession that pays you for about half the work you do, Krieg said. I think I feel that my debt, for the most part, stems from my choices and I don't feel like that should carry over to my fiance.\n\nOnce married, Krieg and Osell plan to jointly file their taxes. According to Capalad, this is an important conversation to have, as how couples file can affect loan payment amounts.\n\nOne conversation to make sure you have with your accountant before you file your taxes as a married couple is to see how it will affect your student loan payment if you file jointly versus separately, Capalad said. Certain income-driven repayment programs will adjust your payment amount if you file jointly but not if you file separately.\n\nFor other couples, the decision to treat loans separately stems less from guilt and more from necessity. Allison Youngers is part of one such couple. The 28-year-old from Sheldon, Iowa, had $85,000 worth of student loans after graduating from college, while her boyfriend had no student debt. The couple, now with two children, has put marriage aside so that Younger's debt does not hinder their ability to make other big life choices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf we were married and had combined debt, we would have never been able to get a house loan because of our debt-to-income ratio, Youngers said. Matt's finances and credit score look better without mine added to it, and he is able to qualify for loans. Because of my debt burden, I can't even get a relatively small car loan without a co-signer.\n\nBrian Hanks, a financial planner in Boise, Idaho, says he often sees this type of mind-set in couples with a large amount of student loan debt. The main impact I see is couples with lots of student loans are scared away from doing what they want in life, he said. The career option that's a little riskier, but with huge upside? They pass. The opportunity to work in a country or city helping others? They can't afford to do it. The real tragedy of student loans is the value of the opportunities not taken.\n\nThat's certainly something I've seen in my relationship. It's tough to decide if one of us should accept a job that we are passionate about but might not have the highest paycheck. We debate over attending certain events for friends and family that include travel expenses. We would have liked to be engaged by now, but that has been delayed because of our financial situation. I'm sure the same will be true of having children.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOur student loans are always at the front of our minds. But at the same time, we know it's important to not completely put our lives on hold or allow our debt to dictate every move we make. Being young and in debt is a balancing act, but it's also an opportunity to learn how to navigate a challenge together, which is a benefit for any relationship.
Age difference is another factor that causes my husband to doubt me. I am 28, and he is 43.\n\nI love this guy with all my heart and want this relationship to work, but I can't stand him being offensive toward me anymore. It gets to a point where he has pushed me to the floor or slapped me because he remembered that I was with other guys before him.\n\nAD\n\nI have never offended him in any way. I'm faithful and loving to him, but it seems he can't get past the idea that I had a past.\n\nAD\n\nI have stayed because they say the first year of marriage is always the hardest one, but a year has passed, and nothing changes.\n\nShould I leave, or keep fighting for my marriage?\n\nHurting\n\nHurting: You should leave, and you should leave as quickly as you can. Your children are young; your husband is violent. You need to protect yourself and your children. It's that simple.\n\nUnderstand that nothing you do will change your husband's violent behavior. No amount of placating, explaining or apologizing on your part will change how he reacts to you.\n\nAD\n\nAnd not to put too fine a point on it, but he is not a good person. Good people don't abuse and assault their partners. And the passage of time will not make this better but will probably make it worse for all of you.\n\nAll of your efforts should go into protecting yourself and your children, and leaving safely.\n\nAD\n\nPlease contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline today (Thehotline.org or 800-799-7233).

As a music critic, here's my piece. I was freelancing for The Washington Post in 2007 when I pitched a review of Kelly's album, Double Up, an extravagantly lewd assortment of R&B songs that could have easily been titled Double Down. Kelly was still basking in the left-turn success of Trapped in the Closet, a serialized slow-jam about sexual transgression that somehow felt like high comedy. If American soul music was about truth-telling, here was a singer willing to tell us something extraordinary about the absurdity of sex — so, in the thrall of Kelly's hyperbolic music, I had written a hyperbolic review.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen I filed the piece to Marcia Davis — an assignment editor who championed young writers and gave me my first real byline at The Post a few years earlier — she came back with a bigger question that I hadn't anticipated: Should we be doing this?\n\nControversies were swirling around Kelly at the time, but my review had only mentioned them in passing. Marcia wasn't ready to greenlight my excessive praise for a superstar who had allegedly hurt so many. Shouldn't we mention the charges of child pornography Kelly was facing? Or the infamous videotape of Kelly allegedly having sex with a minor? Or his 1994 marriage to the singer Aaliyah? (And how, at the time, Kelly was 27 and Aaliyah was only 15?)\n\nI was relatively new to music criticism, confident in my tastes but insecure in my abilities, and I remember not wanting to muddle my fragile copy with all of that ugly information. So I defended my position with a weak line of logic I had heard others use: Whatever this guy may or may not have done, it doesn't change the quality of his music.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMarcia wasn't satisfied with that, but she graciously met me halfway. We would mention the charges against Kelly early in the review. She also suggested that I change the word genius to uniqueness — and after I warily consented to the swap, that was that. The review was published the next day, and I remember feeling zero qualms about praising an alleged pedophile for his strange and beautiful music in the newspaper I had grown up reading.\n\nIn the years that followed, Marcia appeared on my shoulder every time I wrote about R. Kelly, even when she wasn't editing me. She was in my head during a concert review I wrote in 2009 — but unfortunately, I was only half-listening to her. Kelly had since been acquitted of those child pornography charges, and that was good enough for me to call the concert a wonderful showing from the man behind one of the greatest songbooks in the history of R&B.\n\nBut Marcia's voice never went away. By 2010, I had stopped attending Kelly's concerts and I refrained from reviewing his albums. I slowly stopped citing his influence on other music in my writing, and I eventually stopped typing his name altogether. Should we be doing this? It had been seven years since Marcia's edit, but I had finally reached no. The last time I put Kelly's name in print was in 2014.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhy had it been so hard for me to give up on this music? I kept coming back to the word that Marcia had plugged into my review. Uniqueness. That had to be it, right? It wasn't that R. Kelly was great. It was that R. Kelly was singular. And after he entered his raunchy-absurdist phase in the mid-aughts, even his most studious imitators — The-Dream, Trey Songz — only seemed to prove that there would never be another singer as odd, agile or funny as R. Kelly.\n\nThe culture critics interviewed on screen in Surviving R. Kelly shed a lot more light on this. First, Ann Powers explains how Kelly's over-the-top prurience became a weird smokescreen for him — an almost winking ownership of his predatory behavior. Meantime, the critic Nelson George points to the uplifting end of Kelly's lyrical spectrum, noting how we've danced to Step in the Name of Love at countless weddings, how we've sung I Believe I Can Fly at countless high school graduations. To give up these songs is to give up our own memories.\n\nBut we can still hold plenty of memories in our heads at once. The next time I hear Ignition (Remix), I'll probably hear my friends singing it at a house party in 2003. I'll hear Marcia's voice, too, reminding me that how we talk about this world shapes how others see it. (I don't want to overestimate the impact of a few R. Kelly reviews, but I don't want to underestimate them, either.)
Adapted from a recent online discussion.\n\nHi, Carolyn! After a seven-year marriage, I initiated and was granted a divorce four months ago. It was an emotionally abusive marriage. Among other things, he didn't communicate for days, sometimes weeks. He was like Jekyll and Hyde. I am so happy now that it is over.\n\nA few months before my filing, an ex-boyfriend contacted me. We had not communicated in 10 years. We did not have a horrid ending but were just in different places in life. Now, we both seem to be at a place where we could get it right.\n\nWe have seen each other a few times and have been intimate. He isn't dating anyone. Is it too soon to have the defining-the-relationship talk? I know most men dread this convo, but I want to know how to proceed and protect my heart. We are both in our early 50s.\n\n— Defining the Relationship\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nDefining the Relationship: I thought the best part about turning 50 was outliving your interest in playing games. You define the relationship by saying what you want to say, and asking what you want to know.\n\nIf for some reason he hasn't crossed this emotional threshold and can be scared off by a frank conversation about how you feel and what your priorities are, then the sooner you scare him off the better.\n\nPart of aging out of game-playing means recognizing there is no such thing as protecting your heart. Caring is an act of courage, always, because caring means you're open to getting hurt.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is tell yourself the truth as freely as you tell it to him: Don't mistake seeing this man a few times as anything definitive, and don't mistake your relief at being out of a bad marriage as a sign that you're through healing from it. And don't assume he still is now what you knew back then.\n\nThat's not to say it's too soon to date — that's your call and no one else's — but it would make sense for you to be particularly mindful of your emotional state. We're all subject to having ours change on us in unexpected ways, but people fresh out of relationships, especially those that ended badly, are particularly susceptible.\n\nSo. Go ahead and treat your new love interest as exciting, promising, a welcome contrast to your marriage, but understand that only time gets to decide whether it's going to last or be right for you. Be patient, be yourself and be open to whatever he and the relationship are trying to tell you. It's important to resist the temptation to push things to fit your vision of how you want them to go.\n\nIf you find you're second-guessing yourself regularly and/or relying on a concept of what couples are supposed to do, then please consider getting some counseling, solo, with a reputable marriage and family therapist. The door into good relationships and out of bad ones is your ability to recognize what is (and isn't) healthy for you, and that requires judgment you're able to trust.
Georges Prêtre, a French conductor who for seven decades led some of the world's finest orchestras, found a second home in Vienna and forged close relationships with singer Maria Callas and composer Francis Poulenc, died Jan. 4 at his chateau in Naves, in southern France. He was 92.\n\nHis death was announced by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, where Mr. Prêtre held the title of honorary conductor, and Teatro alla Scala in Milan, where he was scheduled to lead concerts in March.\n\nThe peripatetic conductor led orchestras in cities such as Chicago, New York, Paris and Rome — holding few permanent conducting positions, he said, to avoid overly involving himself with the business and managerial sides of classical-music performance.\n\nHe was most closely associated with Vienna's world-renowned Philharmonic Orchestra, where he had remained a formidable though itinerant presence since conducting Charles Gounod's opera Faust in 1963, and the Vienna Symphony, where he was first principal conductor from 1986 to 1991.\n\nAt what amounted to a farewell concert with the Vienna Symphony, Mr. Prêtre earned standing ovations for his rendition of Maurice Ravel's Bolero in October.\n\nGeorges Prêtre leads a 2007 rehearsal on the stage of the Opéra Bastille in Paris. Beginning in the 1980s, he worked mainly in Vienna. (Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nGeorges Prêtre was both a sound wizard and a musician with an unparalleled intensity, Vienna Symphony Chairman Thomas Schindl wrote on Facebook. He combined concentration and individuality in a unique way and his daring and adventurous personality always spurred us on to perform at our very best — and sometimes beyond of what we believed to be capable of.\n\nMr. Prêtre, whose last name means priest, sometimes conducted as though he were possessed, shaking his arms and writhing at the rostrum in a manner that reminded some observers of his American peer Leonard Bernstein.\n\nHe considered himself a musical interpreter, not a hand-waving conductor, and typically sought to extract a maximum of emotion from the works he conducted — orchestral pieces as well as operas, in his native French and also in German or Italian.\n\nReviewing his performance of Bolero with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1995, Philadelphia Inquirer critic Lesley Valdes noted that under Mr. Prêtre's baton, the work's musical stresses . . . verged on the orgasmic. Not for him the stringencies of Ravel's intentionally formulaic layering of color over basic pattern; not for Prêtre the chiselings . . . of precise and graduated sonority. This was a siren dying to squeeze out of her girdle, so voluptuous was its interpretation.\n\nMr. Prêtre's emotion-driven approach to music made him a favorite of Poulenc, who entrusted him with the 1959 premiere of his opera La Voix Humaine, about the final phone conversation between a woman and her lover.\n\nIt also endeared him to Callas, a Greek American soprano with whom he recorded several acclaimed albums, including Georges Bizet's opera Carmen in 1964.\n\nMr. Prêtre's offstage hobbies, including judo and karate, may have also played a role in the friendship.\n\nHe was a man of my own heart, Callas said of Mr. Prêtre, according to a 1997 biography of Callas by David Bret. With Georges I could curse to my heart's content, and he never so much as batted an eyelid. Most of my conductors only wanted to take me to dinner after we'd finished working. This one, a black belt, wanted me to take judo lessons!\n\nThe son of a cobbler, Mr. Prêtre was born in Waziers, in northern France, on Aug. 14, 1924. He studied at conservatories in Douai, near his home town, and in Paris, playing the trumpet — not his first choice, the oboe — because the instrument was cheaper to acquire, he said.\n\nHe learned conducting in Paris under André Cluytens before debuting at the Opéra de Marseille in 1946, honing his understanding of the classical repertoire with weekly performances of Tosca, Carmen and The Valkyrie.\n\nMr. Prêtre was music director of the Opéra Comique in Paris from 1955 to 1959, when he made his U.S. debut at the Chicago Lyric Opera. He was in New York five years later, conducting the Metropolitan Opera in Camille Saint-Saëns's Samson and Delilah, and returned to Paris in 1970 to briefly serve as music director of the Paris Opera.\n\nAn early marriage to mezzo-soprano Suzanne Lefort ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife, Gina Marny, and their daughter, Isabelle Prêtre. A son, Jean-Reynald, died in 2012.\n\nMr. Prêtre's conducting, which employed an improvisational technique of sometimes slowing and sometimes speeding ahead through the score, was occasionally criticized as erratic. Yet he said his effectiveness was determined more by the nature of the orchestra than by his conducting style.\n\nI have only to set the pitch. They understand me right away. There is no need for many rehearsals, he told the Italian news agency ANSA in 2004. But if the orchestras are mediocre, there is nothing to be done. Further rehearsals are useless.
AD\n\nThe host pressed Gillibrand to answer for her transformation from a conservative congresswoman representing a rural district into an outspoken liberal senator. So, 10 years ago, when I became senator … I recognized I didn't know everything about the whole state, and one of the first things I did was I travel to Brooklyn, she replied. And I met with a family who had just lost their daughter, a teenage girl, who was shot with a stray bullet. … I just knew I was wrong, and I knew I had to do something to make sure that young beautiful girl did not die in vain. … And, now, I've been a leader on these issues.\n\nAD\n\nMaddow asked Gillibrand whether she's embarrassed by her previous positions on immigration. Gillibrand said yes. Well, I don`t think it was driven from my heart, the senator said. I was callous to the suffering of families who want to be with their loved ones, people who want to be reunited with their families. And so, looking back, I just really regretted that I didn't look beyond my district.\n\n-- Immigration has become a third rail during the Trump era in a way it was not previously. Democrats increasingly oppose the president's demand for a border wall as immoral, not just as an ineffective and wasteful idea. Even Bernie Sanders, perhaps the most ideologically consistent among the potential 2020 candidates, has vulnerabilities on this issue and has been trying to make amends since opposing the comprehensive overhaul package in 2006.\n\nAD\n\nCNN published a rundown last night of Gillibrand's reversals on immigration under the stinging headline How Kirsten Gillibrand went from pushing for more deportations to wanting to abolish ICE. The story points out that she even attacked the Republican congressman she defeated in 2006 from the right, blasting him as too soft on border security.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who is running for president in 2020, released a video on Jan. 17 apologizing for past statements regarding gay rights. (Tulsi Gabbard)\n\n-- Gillibrand may be the starkest example, but this week has shown that she's certainly not the only 2020 presidential candidate who is recalibrating in an effort to catch up with the party's base. The center of gravity in the Democratic Party has undeniably moved further to the left since Sanders's unexpectedly strong performance against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Half of Democrats now embrace the label liberal in Pew's polling, up 15 points from when Barack Obama won the nomination in 2008. Many of the party's pickups in the 2006 midterms came from conservative rural areas, including Gillibrand, but the gains in 2018 were mostly thanks to moderates in the suburbs. Democratic voters have adopted more-liberal stances on a battery of social issues, health care, guns and more. And politicians who have been on the scene for a while find themselves trying to catch up with the times.\n\nAD\n\nThere is a long tradition of lawmakers evolving as they pursue higher office, to use the euphemism that's been long favored by ambitious pols. After all, Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump were both registered Democrats a decade before they ran for president. And many pundits now assume flip-flops are less perilous than in the past, primarily because Trump has easily gotten away with so many. But that conventional wisdom will be tested as the Democratic nominating contest heats up over the coming months.\n\nAD\n\n-- Since announcing her long-shot bid for the presidency last Friday night, for example, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) has been unable to talk about anything other than her past hostility toward gay rights as a state legislator. Trying to jump-start her flailing campaign after its failure to launch, the 37-year-old recorded a four-minute apology video yesterday in which she insisted that her views have changed significantly.\n\nIn my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones, Gabbard says to the camera. I'm deeply sorry for having said them. My views have changed significantly since then, and my record in Congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Gabbard said publicly that Democrats should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. That view may be disqualifying in today's Democratic Party. She also worked for an anti-gay-rights group led by her father. In the damage-control video, she defends herself by noting that she grew up in a socially conservative household where I was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.\n\n-- Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has taken to describing herself as a progressive prosecutor while rolling out her new memoir, The Truths We Hold, ahead of a forthcoming presidential announcement. America has a deep and dark history of people using the power of the prosecutor as an instrument of injustice, Harris writes in the book. I know this history well — of innocent men framed, of charges brought against people without sufficient evidence, of prosecutors hiding information that would exonerate defendants, of the disproportionate application of the law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of the most widely read, and shared, op-eds in the New York Times yesterday was a blistering rebuttal of this attempted rebranding by law professor Lara Bazelon, who formerly directed the Loyola Law School innocence project: All too often, she was on the wrong side of that history. … Time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state's attorney general, Ms. Harris opposed them or stayed silent. Most troubling, Ms. Harris fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors. … If Kamala Harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past. A good first step would be to apologize to the wrongfully convicted people she has fought to keep in prison. ...\n\nConsider her record as San Francisco's district attorney from 2004 to 2011. Ms. Harris was criticized in 2010 for withholding information about a police laboratory technician who had been accused of 'intentionally sabotaging' her work and stealing drugs from the lab. After a memo surfaced showing that Ms. Harris's deputies knew about the technician's wrongdoing and recent conviction, but failed to alert defense lawyers, a judge condemned Ms. Harris's indifference to the systemic violation of the defendants' constitutional rights. Ms. Harris contested the ruling by arguing that the judge, whose husband was a defense attorney and had spoken publicly about the importance of disclosing evidence, had a conflict of interest. Ms. Harris lost. More than 600 cases handled by the corrupt technician were dismissed. …\n\nMs. Harris was similarly regressive as the state's attorney general. When a federal judge in Orange County ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional in 2014, Ms. Harris appealed. In a public statement, she made the bizarre argument that the decision 'undermines important protections that our courts provide to defendants.' In 2014, she declined to take a position on Proposition 47, a ballot initiative approved by voters, that reduced certain low-level felonies to misdemeanors. She laughed that year when a reporter asked if she would support the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. Ms. Harris finally reversed course in 2018, long after public opinion had shifted on the topic. In 2015, she opposed a bill requiring her office to investigate shootings involving officers. And she refused to support statewide standards regulating the use of body-worn cameras by police officers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRival campaigns-in-waiting circulated this piece on background and promised it's a taste of the attacks to come if Harris gets traction.\n\nUnderscoring the piece's potency, the Harris operation forcefully pushed back in a statement to reporters that made no apologies: Kamala Harris has spent her career fighting for reforms in the criminal justice system and pushing the envelope to keep everyone safer by bringing fairness and accountability, said Harris spokeswoman Lily Adams. When most prosecutors were using a tough on crime approach, Senator Harris was starting Back on Track in 2004 which diverted young people charged with first time drug offenses into apprenticeship and training programs instead of decades long prison sentences. When she was Attorney General, she brought accountability to the system with the first statewide training on implicit bias and procedural justice in the country, body cameras to the agents at DOJ, launched multiple pattern and practice investigations and demanded data on in-custody deaths and police shooting be made available to the public.\n\n-- Here's why these kinds of stories matter a great deal: Impressions of most Democratic candidates are both soft and fluid. An NPR-PBS-Marist poll released yesterday underscored just how unknown most of the 2020 candidates are at the grass-roots level. The national survey asked Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents if they have a favorable or unfavorable impression of 10 likely candidates. With the exceptions of Joe Biden, Sanders and, to a lesser extent, Elizabeth Warren, rank-and-file progressives don't have strong impressions of the people that Washington insiders are buzzing about. For example, 22 percent of those surveyed have a positive view of Gillibrand, 14 percent have a negative view, and 65 percent either have never heard of her or don't know enough to offer an opinion. The never-heard-of, or unsure, number was 49 percent for Cory Booker, 52 percent for Beto O'Rourke, 54 percent for Harris, 71 percent for Amy Klobuchar and 72 percent for Julián Castro. The pollsters didn't event test Gabbard.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- Programming note: In honor of Martin Luther King Jr., we will not publish on Monday.\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nPresident Trump ordered his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to BuzzFeed News.

The story cites two unnamed federal law enforcement officials. Trump also supported a plan, set up by Cohen, to visit Russia during the presidential campaign, in order to personally meet President Vladimir Putin and jump-start the tower negotiations. 'Make it happen,' the sources said Trump told Cohen. And even as Trump told the public he had no business deals with Russia, the sources said Trump and his children Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. received regular, detailed updates about the real estate development from Cohen, whom they put in charge of the project. …\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe special counsel's office learned about Trump's directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents.

(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\nDAY 28 OF THE SHUTDOWN:\n\n-- Bringing the government shutdown no closer to an end, Trump canceled House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's planned trip to Afghanistan in retaliation for her suggestion that he postpone his State of the Union address. Erica Werner and John Wagner report: Hours before Pelosi and top Democrats were set to depart for a visit to military leaders in Brussels and to see troops in Afghanistan, Trump released a letter canceling what he termed a 'public relations event.' 'I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown,' he wrote. 'We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over.' …\n\nDemocrats responded furiously to Trump's cancellation and accused the president of acting like a child. Lawmakers' visits to war zones are typically kept secret for security reasons, and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Trump's decision to disclose Pelosi's travel plans was 'completely and utterly irresponsible in every way.' … Things could spiral further: Though Pelosi asked Trump to reschedule his State of the Union address, her office made clear that she was not, at this point, denying him an invitation. The House and Senate must pass a resolution to formally invite Trump to come to Congress, and if Pelosi blocks the measure this year, it would almost certainly deny Trump a traditional State of the Union platform.\n\nTrump himself visited Iraq after the partial government shutdown began Dec. 22, raising questions about his stated rationale for blocking Pelosi's travel.

Politico's Burgess Everett and Heather Caygle report: 'I feel like I'm going to strangle you,' quipped one senator who's tried in vain to find a breakthrough when a reporter asked about their state of mind. That lawmaker was joking, probably, but the vibes in the Capitol are funereal at best. And with most members headed home for a long weekend, the partial shutdown is essentially guaranteed to enter into its second month. … Rank-and-file lawmakers can make noise and try to create momentum, but Trump has dismissed everything they've come up with — leading some members to wonder what they're even doing.\n\n-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin refused a request to testify before Congress on how the shutdown will affect tax season. Reuters reports: In a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, the Treasury Department offered to send senior officials 'who are most knowledgeable' about the department's plans during the shutdown. … Neal responded sharply to Mnuchin's refusal to appear. 'With more than 70,000 Treasury employees furloughed and missing paychecks, I strongly believe Secretary Mnuchin himself should appear before our committee and answer members' questions,' Neal said in a statement after Mnuchin declined the invitation to appear on Jan. 24.\n\n-- Chaos erupted on the House floor after Democrats tried to pass a bill to reopen the government by voice vote. The Hill's Juliegrace Brufke reports: The vote will be postponed after Republicans called foul on their request for a roll call vote not being granted. The Democratic bill, which would fund the government through Feb. 28, was expected to be approved but will be dead on arrival in the Senate. Democrats will request to vacate the vote and take it up again next week, according to a Democratic leadership aide. … Republicans argued they had called for a roll call vote on the measure, with Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) having made the request, which was ignored or not heard by Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), who was presiding over the floor during the vote. Sources on the floor said the request was made too late.\n\n-- Typifying the acrimony on Capitol Hill, a Republican lawmaker appeared to shout, Go back to Puerto Rico, at a Latino colleague on the House floor. But Rep. Jason T. Smith (R-Mo.) later said he was not specifically addressing Rep. Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.). Herman Wong reports: It was initially unclear who made the remark … [Smith] later admitted making the statement. However, Smith's communications director, Joey Brown, said in an email that the congressman was 'speaking to all the Democrats who were down vacationing in Puerto Rico last weekend during the shutdown, not any individual.' … Hours later, Smith called and 'took responsibility for the comment and sincerely apologized,' Cárdenas said.\n\n-- Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló lambasted the Trump administration amid escalating tensions over, among other things, the president's desire to use the island's disaster-relief funds for his border wall. Jeff Stein reports: Rosselló ripped the Trump administration Thursday for rejecting food stamp funding for the island and reportedly plotting to cut its emergency aid … The feud comes amid the resignation of a top Housing and Urban Development official, widely regarded as one of the most capable administrators in the agency, after the White House's attempt to block disaster recovery money for Puerto Rico. … In a Facebook video addressed to Trump, Rosselló attacked 'unconscionable' remarks and 'completely false and inaccurate information' tied to the Trump administration.\n\n-- A Democratic group aligned with Chuck Schumer, Majority Forward, is launching $600,000 in shutdown-based attack ads today against six Republican senators facing competitive 2020 elections. Sean Sullivan reports: The ads target Sens. Martha McSally (Ariz.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), David Perdue (Ga.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Susan Collins (Maine) and Thom Tillis (N.C.). ... As ominous music plays, a narrator points out that this is 'the longest government shutdown in history,' and warns of the impact on food safety inspections and air travel security. The ads are tailored to raise state-specific concerns about the effects of the shutdown. The North Carolina ad underscores the strain on hurricane recovery efforts.\n\nTHE HUMAN IMPACT:\n\n-- Many government agencies are scrambling to continue or resume basic operations to limit the shutdown's fallout, even though that often means sending people to work without pay. Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey report: The State Department ordered its employees to return to work next week, saying it has found money to cover a half-month in salary … The TSA acknowledged Thursday that the lengthy shutdown had affected its employees' ability to come to work, with many calling in sick. … And some agencies have had to deal with small-scale rebellions among the employees they are requiring to continue showing up for work. These employees have recently refused to put any work-related travel expenses on their personal credit cards, unsure when they will be repaid. Other agencies are ordering employees to return to work, without pay, to minimize the shutdown's impact on a variety of industries, including agriculture, ranching, logging, banking and fishing.\n\n-- States are reporting a sharp increase in the number of unemployment claims filed by federal workers. Tim Craig reports: Under federal guidelines, furloughed federal workers and contractors who have been told not to report to work are generally eligible to apply for unemployment benefits, although many will have to repay the money if they receive back pay when they return to the job. But on Wednesday, in another blow to federal workers, the U.S. Labor Department sent guidance to states clarifying that hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are working without pay do not qualify for unemployment benefits.\n\n-- Federal law enforcement agencies say the shutdown is harming ongoing investigations. Devlin Barrett and Mark Berman report: Most travel and training among the law enforcement agencies has been canceled. Many law enforcement officials said some undercover cases, including corruption probes, have been stymied in recent weeks because supervisors feel they cannot approve travel or cash for those operations. … Senior law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned that the anger among the rank and file is growing exponentially and could skyrocket next week if a second straight paycheck is skipped. Those who are charged with protecting the nation from criminals and terrorists could be facing enormous external financial stressors as they try to stay focused on their work.\n\n-- Federal courts could run out of money before the end of the month. The New York Times's Thomas Kaplan reports: Judges and court officials around the country are bracing for the likelihood that the federal judiciary will be unable to maintain its current operations within the next two weeks, once it exhausts the money it has been relying on since the shutdown began last month. Already, courts have been cutting down on expenses like travel and new hiring. Court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants have been working without pay since late December, according to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, which provides support for the court system.\n\n-- The FDA has decided to furlough more employees to focus its dwindling funds on drug reviews. Laurie McGinley reports: With money for drug reviews rapidly diminishing as the government shutdown drags into its fourth week, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in an interview Thursday that he plans to curtail 'discretionary activities' and call for additional furloughs in areas in which workloads have been reduced due to the shutdown. 'What we are trying to do is to keep the review process continuing because of important drugs in the pipeline,' he said. Yet the cost-saving measures will buy just weeks, not months, of extended life for the FDA's drug-review process, Gottlieb added.\n\n-- Metro said it is losing $400,000 a day from the shutdown. Faiz Siddiqui reports: The transit agency, which has estimated federal workers make up 40 percent of its rush-hour ridership, says it is suffering steep losses amid the shutdown … In [a letter to the region's senators], which was tweeted by Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.), Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld writes that the agency has suffered daily rail ridership losses averaging 16 percent; average daily ridership for Metrobus is down 8 percent.\n\nTRUMP'S IMMIGRATION WAR:\n\n-- The HHS inspector general issued a scathing report saying that the Trump administration separated thousands more migrant families than previously disclosed and that the policy existed for nearly a year before Trump appointees acknowledged it. They publicly insisted there was no family-separation policy even as they privately implemented it. Amy Goldstein reports: The report says no one systematically kept count of separated children until a lawsuit last spring triggered by the Trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policy, under which the government tried to criminally prosecute all parents who crossed the border illegally, taking their children from them in the process. As a result of the lawsuit, the government identified about 2,700 separated children in federal custody as of June, some of them infants and toddlers. … Although previous administrations also separated minors at the border in some instances — usually when they suspected the child was smuggled, or if the parent appeared unfit — the report said the practice appears far more common under Trump and began nearly a year before administration officials publicly acknowledged it.\n\n-- A draft of the family-separation policy shows the Trump administration considered denying migrant children asylum hearings and specifically targeting their parents for prosecution. NBC News's Julia Ainsley reports: In one comment, a Justice Department official suggests that Customs and Border Protection could see that children who have been separated from their parents would be denied an asylum hearing before an immigration judge, which is typically awarded to children who arrive at the border alone. Instead, the entire family would be given an order of 'expedited removal' and then separated, placing the child in the care of HHS in U.S. Marshall's custody while both await deportation. … 'It appears that they wanted to have it both ways — to separate children from their parents but deny them the full protections generally awarded to unaccompanied children,' said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who led the class action suit on behalf of migrant parents who had been separated from their children.\n\n-- A Latino Marine veteran who was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., was detained by ICE for possible deportation. Eli Rosenberg reports: Jilmar Ramos-Gomez, whose service as a lance corporal and tank crewman included time in Afghanistan, was born in the Michigan city of 200,000. … 'I immediately called ICE and shouted at them,' [immigration lawyer Richard Kessler] said. 'And they called me back and said, kind of, Oops, yeah, come and get him. They didn't say, Our bad, but kind of implied that.' Ramos-Gomez's story rocketed to national attention on Wednesday after the [ACLU] called for the county to investigate how an American citizen and decorated veteran was taken into ICE custody.\n\n-- The DOJ posted job listings for lawyers to handle property seizures related to the border wall. Politico's Ted Hesson reports: The two advertised jobs, based in McAllen and Brownsville [in South Texas], will pay between $53,062 and $138,790, according to a posting to a federal jobs website. … The attorneys likely will deal with eminent domain property seizures and quarrels with landowners over what their land is worth, according to Chris Rickerd, [ACLU's] senior policy counsel on border and immigration issues.\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- More than 130 House Republicans voted against the Treasury Department's plan to lift sanctions against companies owned by a Russian oligarch with close ties to Putin. Karoun Demirjian and Jeanne Whalen report: The overwhelming 362 to 53 vote will not prevent the Trump administration from easing sanctions on three companies connected to [Oleg Deripaska], as Senate Republicans narrowly blocked a similar measure on Wednesday. But the House vote does mean that a majority of Republicans on Capitol Hill oppose [Trump's] efforts to soften punitive measures on a Russian oligarch — a rejection with potential implications for the administration's continued stance on Russia, and for the GOP lawmakers who backed the plan to ease the sanctions. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and GOP Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) both broke with Trump to join Democrats to support the resolution, along with the rest of their leadership team — a particularly awkward rebellion for the White House and [Mitch McConnell].\n\n-- The DNC said it was among those targeted in a widespread cyberattack detected after the midterms. ABC News's Maryalice Parks and Lee Ferran report: 'On November 14, 2018, dozens of DNC email addresses were targeted in a spear-phishing campaign, although there is no evidence that the attack was successful,' the DNC wrote in an amended complaint filed late Thursday, part of an ongoing lawsuit against the Russian government, the 2016 Donald Trump campaign and others. The DNC said that the content and the timing of the emails led the organization to believe it was targeted as part of a wider phishing campaign that cybersecurity firms had previously said appeared to use some of the same technical tricks as a Russian hacking group known as Cozy Bear, or APT 29.\n\n-- A Belarusian model who claims she has evidence that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia was held in Moscow on prostitution charges. Anton Troianovski and Rosalind S. Helderman report: The model, Anastasia Vashukevich, had been deported from Thailand earlier in the day after spending nine months in prison on charges of conspiracy and soliciting prostitution. She was booked to fly to Minsk, Belarus, but was detained along with three others traveling with her as she changed planes at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Inter­national Airport, according to her husband and another person traveling with her. … Her arrest in Moscow was unexpected and blocked her from possibly talking to dozens of journalists waiting for her in the airport's arrivals zone.\n\n-- A recent court filing from special counsel Bob Mueller's team suggests Paul Manafort continued working on a Russia-related issue after he was indicted. Rosalind S. Helderman reports: The four words of unredacted text suggest that in February 2018 — four months after Manafort was first charged with crimes related to his work as a political consultant in Ukraine — he still appears to have been working on a peace initiative for Ukraine, a topic of intense interest to Russia. And it suggests he was doing so in concert with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian employee of his consulting firm who is alleged to have ties to Russian intelligence. The revelation, potentially inadvertent, comes as Manafort and Mueller's legal team have been battling in court over whether Manafort lied to prosecutors after he pleaded guilty in September to conspiring against the United States with his Ukraine work and agreed to cooperate with the probe.\n\n-- A U.S. law firm briefly entangled in Mueller's probe agreed to pay $4.6 million for failing to report its work for Ukraine. Matt Zapotosky and Tom Hamburger report: The firm — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom — conceded it should have registered as a foreign agent in 2012, when it was hired in a deal facilitated by [Manafort] to prepare a report about the prosecution of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko.\n\n-- Trump was startled to hear his attorney general nominee William Barr describe Mueller as a close friend during his confirmation hearings. CNN's Kaitlan Collins, Kevin Liptak and Jeff Zeleny report: While Barr said during his hearing that Trump 'was interested' in hearing about the friendship, the details that emerged this week caught the President off guard, [three] sources said. He bristled at Barr's description of the close relationship, complaining to aides he didn't realize how much their work overlapped or that they were so close. There is no indication Trump's surprise will jeopardize the nomination, however.\n\n-- Marci Whitaker, who is married to acting attorney general Matt Whitaker, sent an email to a Slate reporter who wrote a critical article about her husband. In her message, Marci Whitaker said her husband should not have to recuse himself from the Mueller probe, which she described as wrapping up. It isn't really or shouldn't be that controversial to state that the Mueller investigation should stay within the parameters given. Particularly when that is said more than a year prior as the investigation is just beginning, she wrote, apparently referring to her husband's past criticism of the probe. And by all means, assume that a person who speculated on a hypothetical scenario would then put some dark plan into motion, when by all accounts, the investigation is wrapping up and [the] eyes of the nation are upon them.\n\n-- Giuliani attempted to clean up his comments that he cannot say with certainty that people besides Trump on the 2016 campaign did not collude with Russia. He released a statement saying he has no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign. Trump's attorney added in an interview with The Post: With regard to the president, he was not involved in any collusion in any way, and he has no knowledge of any collusion. … The rest I can't be responsible for, except I can tell you the state of my knowledge, which is that I have no knowledge that anyone on the campaign illegally colluded with the Russians. (Philip Rucker)\n\n-- But many interpreted Giuliani's original comments as a warning: It's everyone for themselves, as Politico's Darren Samuelsohn writes. 'Ya think!!!' one former Trump campaign official wrote ... when asked if Giuliani was trying to protect the president at the expense of everyone who worked for him. … The sniping can have long-term legal consequences, and the president and his former aides have used press interviews, social media posts and court filings to take shots at each other in the interest of protecting themselves and their reputations.\n\nTHE NEW CONGRESS:\n\n-- Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.), who has served in Congress since 2010, announced he would resign next week to take a job in the private sector. Mike DeBonis reports: The former prosecutor was one of the first House Republicans to endorse Donald Trump for president and he was an informal adviser to the candidate. Marino has won handily in his heavily Republican district but faced a new reality as Democrats seized majority control of the House in November. [Trump] nominated Marino to be the nation's drug czar in 2017, but Marino withdrew from consideration following a Washington Post/'60 Minutes' investigation detailing how the lawmaker helped steer legislation through Congress that weakened the Drug Enforcement Administration's ability to go after drug distributors, even as opioid-related deaths continue to rise.\n\n-- Given the conservative bent of Marino's district, Democrats don't expect to flip the seat in a special election. From David Weigel: The words 'special election' and 'Pennsylvania' are enough to induce terror in Republicans after their disastrous 2018 performance in the state. The year began with them losing a once-safe district to Rep. Conor Lamb (D) and ended with them getting blown out statewide while dropping three more seats — and holding three more by single digits. But it would take a true political disaster for Marino's 12th Congressional District to become competitive. As drawn by a panel of judges last year, it covers a large rural swath of north and central Pennsylvania that was never very friendly to Democrats and has grown downright inhospitable.\n\n-- Kevin McCarthy's decision to strip Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) of his committee assignments could signal how the California Republican intends to assert himself as House minority leader. Robert Costa and Mike DeBonis have the behind-the-scenes details on the showdown between McCarthy and King: When [King] was ushered into [McCarthy's] office Monday night, after sparking outrage for questioning whether the term 'white supremacist' is offensive, he expected to be scolded. He did not expect his career in congressional politics to effectively end. But as the Iowa Republican sat on a couch beneath an eight-foot-tall portrait of Abraham Lincoln, it quickly became clear that ­McCarthy — whom King has long privately knocked as soft — was taking a hard line. King, an ally of [Trump's] and a regular guest on conservative media programs, offered to 'go quiet,' according to three people familiar with the exchange who were not authorized to speak publicly. McCarthy dismissed the suggestion — and the nine-term Republican was soon stripped of all his committee assignments.\n\nFor McCarthy, 53, the hour-long confrontation with King was a critical moment early in his tenure as the new leader of Republicans in the House, testing whether the easygoing Californian was willing to take on a popular conservative and assert himself in the wake of sweeping GOP defeats in the 2018 elections and the high-profile speakership of Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). It was also a reminder of how Republican leaders have done little to police their ranks on the charged issue of race in recent years, from their embrace of Trump despite him casting doubt on President Barack Obama's U.S. citizenship to their support of the divisive King — making his punishment an outlier rather than the standard.\n\n-- King is raising money off his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy. The Des Moines Register's Robin Opsahl reports: 'The unhinged left has teamed up with Republican 'NeverTrumpers' and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me,' King wrote in a campaign email to his supporters. In the email, King said the New York Times and 'rabid leftist media' are coming after him for supporting [Trump] and because of his views on immigration.\n\n-- Senate Republicans are weighing rules changes to accelerate confirmations of Trump's nominees. Seung Min Kim and Paul Kane report: Typically, a nomination can be debated for a maximum of 30 hours on the Senate floor after senators invoke cloture ... But Republicans are mulling cutting short those 30 hours to as brief as two hours for relatively noncontroversial nominees, such as candidates for the district court. … While GOP senators discussed wanting support from Democrats to revise the rules — a process that would take 67 votes — [Mitch McConnell] also raised the prospect of using the so-called 'nuclear option' to change the rules unilaterally.\n\n-- In a Post op-ed, McConnell slammed House Democrats' proposed changes to the Federal Election Commission. He writes: Since Watergate, the commission has been a six-member body so neither party can use it to punish political opponents. Apparently, Democrats have grown tired of playing fair. This bill would weaponize the FEC with a 3-to-2 partisan makeup. It would also empower that newly partisan FEC to track and catalogue more of what you say. It would broaden the type of speech the commission can define as 'campaign-related' and thus regulate. … Apparently the Democrats define 'democracy' as giving Washington a clearer view of whom to intimidate and leaving citizens more vulnerable to public harassment over private views.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nDemocratic lawmakers demanded an immediate investigation into the report that Trump allegedly told Cohen to lie to Congress.

'No,' I said, turning my head in the direction of his voice. 'You're the head of the American CIA station in Tehran,' he said. He never raised his voice, but he was accusatory: 'We know it. And you have a choice. Tell us everything, and you'll go home. You'll get on that flight to the United States on Friday as planned, but you'll be starting a new life working for the Ministry of Intelligence of the Islamic Republic.' The offer was absurd in its directness and so I didn't think he was completely serious. 'If not, you must change your clothes. When you put the prison clothes on it's not clear how long you're going to be here. The odds are you will spend the rest of your life as our guest. You'll never get out of here. So tell us everything.'\n\n-- Politico Magazine, How Jared Kushner Tried to Stop Me From Running the Trump Transition, by Chris Christie: I'd been around politics long enough to grasp what was happening. Jared was trying—and not so subtly—to derail my appointment as transition chairman. The issue wasn't the rushing. The issue was the guy. Donald didn't sound as convinced as Jared did. 'Jared,' he said, 'why would we have to wait on this? It's going to be a great announcement for him and a great announcement for us.' Jared let a beat pass before he spoke up. But when he started talking, he sounded like a person who'd been holding poison inside himself for a very long time. 'You really want to know why?' Jared asked. 'Yeah,' Trump said. 'Because I don't trust him to have this, and you know why I don't trust him to have it.'\n\n-- HuffPost, Jack Dorsey Has No Clue What He Wants, by Ashley Feinberg: A conversation with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey can be incredibly disorienting. Not because he's particularly clever or thought-provoking, but because he sounds like he should be. He takes long pauses before he speaks. He furrows his brow, setting you up for a considered response from the man many have called a genius. The words themselves sound like they should probably mean something, too. Dorsey is just hard enough to follow that it's easy to assume that any confusion is your own fault, and that if you just listen a little more or think a little harder, whatever he's saying will finally start to make sense. Whether Dorsey does this all deliberately or not, the reason his impassioned defenses of Twitter sound like gibberish is because they are.\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT: Activist who met with congressmen about 'DNA' posted about black 'violence gene,' from NBC News: An alt-right activist who met with two Republican congressmen to discuss 'DNA' and 'genetics' posted on Facebook that he believes Muslims are 'genetically different in their propensity for violence or rape' and linked to stories about how African-Americans 'possessed a 'violence' gene.' Chuck Johnson met with Reps. Andy Harris of Maryland and Phil Roe of Tennessee on Thursday. After a Huffington Post reporter tweeted a photo of Johnson with the two congressmen, and the photo attracted media attention because of Johnson's far-right views, Roe released a statement saying he and Harris had met with Johnson because he was representing a company advocating for 'increasing the number of sequenced genomes for research.' HOT ON THE RIGHT: Women's March setbacks reveal what can go wrong for progressive movements protesting Trump, from Frances Stead Sellers and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux: After a leader of Women's March Inc. attended an event at which Nation of Islam firebrand Louis Farrakhan criticized powerful Jews, the public reaction was swift and fierce. … In the months since, a movement that once bragged about its inclusivity has been roiled by reports of battles over diversity, hate speech and branding. The impact is not yet clear, but less than a week before the third-annual women's march, some regional events have been canceled. … The women's marches now loom as a lesson on what can go wrong when the decentralized grass-roots movements that gained traction after Donald Trump's election adopt rhetoric and behavior that challenges public sympathy.\n\nDAYBOOK:\n\nTrump will meet with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.

The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: Clouds and fog slowly try to dissipate, and we begin to dry out with light westerly breezes. High temperatures should make it into mid-40s, with perhaps some upper 40s slightly possible, especially south of town. Clouds may increase a bit again late afternoon, but we should stay rain-free.

(Isabelle Khurshudyan)\n\n-- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) unveiled a budget proposal that includes tax relief and raises for state employees. Ovetta Wiggins and Arelis R. Hernández report: The $46.6 billion budget proposal — a 4 percent increase over last year's fiscal plan — raises the pay of state employees by at least 3 percent, extends a tax relief to the retired military, police officers and fire and rescue workers, provides $57 million for businesses that locate in 'opportunity zones,' and sets aside $1.3 billion in reserves to guard against a potential economic downturn.\n\n-- Hogan's anti-Trump speeches and planned trip to Iowa in March are fueling 2020 speculation. Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: Hogan used his inaugural address on Wednesday to repudiate the 'debilitating politics' of Washington — and to raise the specter of impeachment. … The White House is paying close attention. The president's political aides have been monitoring the Maryland governor for months, and several said they regarded the inauguration speech as an unmistakable act of aggression. They noted that Trump 2016 primary rival Jeb Bush was a featured speaker at the ceremony, and that Mark Salter, a longtime Republican speechwriter and a fierce Trump critic, helped craft Hogan's address.\n\n-- The third annual Women's March on Saturday is expected to draw far fewer attendees than the past two years. Marissa J. Lang reports: Allegations of anti-Semitism, secretive financial dealings, infighting and disputes over who gets to own and define the Women's March have dogged organizers for months and led to calls for national co-chairs to resign. … Several high-profile supporters and progressive organizations declined to participate in the rally this year. Women who previously went out of their way to attend are opting to stay home and support independent groups. Jewish women remain torn about attending at all. Even the weather seems to be conspiring against the event.\n\n-- The antiabortion March for Life will be held today on the Mall. Julie Zauzmer reports: The march, which draws thousands of people annually, many of them youthful participants bused in from Catholic and other religious schools across the country, will also feature Democrats this year. … But some liberal-leaning antiabortion activists criticize the March for Life for alienating Democrats by embracing polarizing figures, from the president and vice president to this year's featured speaker, Ben Shapiro, a popular conservative commentator.\n\nVIDEOS OF THE DAY:\n\nStephen Colbert mocked Trump's suggestion that Pelosi take a commercial flight to Afghanistan after he canceled her trip:\n\nTrevor Noah applauded Cardi B for calling for an end to the shutdown:\n\nDeath Valley National Park in California released a time-lapse video showing the hours it took two park rangers to prepare a restroom for reopening:\n\nDEATH VALLEY, CA – Death Valley National Park announced today that some recently closed areas of the park will once again be accessible to visitors in the coming days. Some visitor services, including campgrounds and the Stovepipe Wells Contact Station, will also reopen using revenue generated by recreation fees. Visitors should go to the park website at nps.gov/deva while planning their trip to get the latest information on accessibility and available services. Areas that have been recently closed but that are or will be accessible to park visitors include: • Dantes View, Artists Drive, Natural Bridge, Harmony Borax Works and Mustard Canyon, Salt Creek, Keane Wonder Mine, Mesquite Sand Dunes, and Historic Stovepipe Wells Roads. Because of the distances and complexities involved and unknown nature of all issues, the opening of these sites may take a week or longer. Scotty's Castle remains closed due to flood damage. Mosaic Canyon Road remains closed in association with water utility work for Stovepipe Wells Village. Upper and Lower Wildrose Roads are closed due to snow and ice. National Park Service officials have determined that by using Federal Land and Recreation Enhancement funds to immediately bring back park maintenance crews to clean restrooms, remove trash, and remove health and safety risks park staff will be able to restore accessibility to the park. Through generous donations from the Death Valley Natural History Association, the Furnace Creek Visitor Center will remain open. Entrance fees and camping fees will not be collected and ranger programs will not be offered. We greatly appreciate the generous contributions of park partners who have provided support during the lapse in appropriations, said park superintendent Reynolds. Their efforts have contributed significantly to our ability to maintain access and limited services to Death Valley National Park.

Dear Miss Manners: My husband and I were recently married, and about half of our close friends were able to attend. We were touched that they used their vacation time to attend our wedding.\n\nEven so, the majority of our close friends who attended did not give us a congratulatory card or note and no gift of any kind. We had an online registry with affordable options, but it was hardly used.\n\nWe were a little hurt because we didn't ask them to spend much money on us outside of our wedding (no shower, etc.), and we always spend money on our friends to celebrate their life events (children, and hosting showers/bachelorette parties), so we thought that we would at least receive a card.\n\nMy friends spend lavishly on themselves, and our wedding cost about $150 per person. I understand if people can't afford much, but our friends earn about twice as much as we do.\n\nI feel petty for asking, but should I be insulted? I have never once forgotten to send a gift, even for weddings I can't attend. Is it now socially acceptable to not give anything to a bride and groom if their wedding is a destination wedding? Is the lack of even a sentimental note a sign that our friendship is not as strong as I thought, or am I overanalyzing it all?\n\nLittle clues in your question are giving Miss Manners pause. Like the fact that it was a destination wedding. How far a destination? That only half of your close friends were able to attend gives her an idea.\n\nAnd tallying the price of the dinner you gave and the amount of money your friends earn and spend on themselves is as irrelevant as it is unseemly.\n\nYes, a wedding present is generally given and a sentimental note is always thoughtful, although hardly a tradition or necessity from those who attended. But it seems to Miss Manners that after what can now be up to a year or two of celebrations and festivities surrounding a wedding, guests are simply exhausted. And they feel they have shown their sentiment for the couple merely by continuing to show up — and shell out.\n\nHow much more acknowledgment do you need? Surely it is time to turn your attentions to something else, like the marriage itself. Or as you stated at the outset, feeling grateful that your friends and family were there with you to celebrate it.\n\nOn (another) bright side, you have relatively few letters of thanks to send out — a tradition that many brides find abhorrent even for the lavish presents that they do receive.\n\nDear Miss Manners: I will be unable to attend an annual dinner party for family members this year because of a particularly hurtful event between myself and another attendee. I want to say that I will not attend without going into detail. What is your advice?\n\nTo say that you will not attend without going into detail.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Yet, I can't imagine going through the pain of breaking up with the perfect partner just because of a stupid seven-year itch.\n\nHow do I make sense of these feelings? I tell my partner everything, and hiding this feeling is suffocating, but I would never want to hurt them, and I know this would devastate them. I feel too young to be this seriously committed but obviously unwilling to dump someone I think could be right for marriage in 10 years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI thought I'd made up my mind to break up, but then I saw them and my mind was completely unmade because I love them so much. But how can I love them and still be interested in exploring other things? I could use some perspective.\n\n— To Break Up or Not to Break Up?\n\nTo Break Up or Not to Break Up?: Stop hiding this feeling.\n\nThe relationship might not be able to withstand your telling this truth, but it will not be able to withstand your hiding it.\n\nTrust that.\n\nAnd have a little more respect for your feelings. It's not a stupid seven-year-itch, it's a legitimate point in your development as a person. What you do with it won't be smart or stupid, either — there are only honest and dishonest. Hiding is dishonest. Stop thinking outcomes altogether, in fact, and just operate from a place of respect.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYour partner might feel the same way, no?\n\nGetting out of an outcome mind-set should include a hard look at your vocabulary. You're going to have a tough time figuring yourself out if you see this in terms of having to dump someone you obviously love. Respect your doubts, respect your partner and let your next step, whatever it is, be born of that respect.\n\nOften I advise people to figure out what they want to say before they go into a conversation, to help them focus, but it's also okay not to know what you want out of something besides the intimacy of sharing. You probably can't know what you want until you bring yourself to a place of integrity. So talk.\n\nAD\n\nYou can do this.\n\nRe: Break Up?: You've been with them since you were 16! You SHOULD be feeling this way!\n\n— Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Thanks. And:\n\nAD\n\nRe: Break Up: I've been with the same (and only) person since age 15 (now pushing 50). If sampling were the road to finding your perfect mate, there'd be no divorce. It's natural to think about other people sometimes, but life is about choices. If you and your partner are authentically kind and loving to each other, that's what makes life great.\n\nEveryone is wired differently so what was right for me may not be for everyone else, for sure.\n\n— Pushing 50\n\nPushing 50: . . . proving that know yourself is the only advice we need. Thanks.
In what seemed like no time at all, McCloskey — a member of Opus Dei, a small, ultra-conservative and controversial Catholic community — made his mark. The center moved to its current K Street NW location, just two blocks from the White House, and became a bustling gathering place for conservative academics, politicians, journalists and young professionals. Weekday Masses in the center's chapel were always packed. ­McCloskey was an energetic evangelist for his unyielding vision of the church, welcoming strangers and political celebrities alike to commit to its radically conservative beliefs.\n\nSoon, the telegenic priest was sharing his views as a regular on political talk shows such as Crossfire and Meet the Press, and on the Eternal Word Television Network, a Catholic cable channel. Political Washington didn't just take notice, it embraced him. He kept company with a rotating cast of right-of-center bigwigs, including Judge Robert H. Bork, Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), economist Larry Kudlow and former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), all of whom he helped convert to Catholicism. Articles described him as the Catholic Church's K Street lobbyist, a firm voice, fostering faith and a crusader.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPope Francis on Oct. 7 said the devil is working to undermine the Roman Catholic Church with the sexual abuse crisis. (Reuters)\n\nBut what no one envisioned was his rapid fall just five years after arriving in Washington for reasons that weren't disclosed until last week.\n\nAt his peak, McCloskey was a central figure in political Washington.\n\nThere's no question that he was the chaplain of Washington conservatives and he held a real appeal for them, said journalist Mark Shields, who met ­McCloskey only a few times, but knew him through his friend and longtime political sparring partner, Robert Novak. Shields, a liberal Catholic, said he often jousted over faith issues with Novak, who was drawn to McCloskey's traditional Catholicism and was later baptized and confirmed by him.\n\nAD\n\nAs his reputation grew, ­McCloskey opined often on matters of faith and church and culture. He criticized lay groups that wanted more control over investigations of clergy sexual abuse. He advocated forcefully against abortion and said married Catholic couples using birth control should refrain from taking Communion. He argued that American men suffered from Friendship Deficit Syndrome and said wives should encourage their husbands to spend more time with their male friends and less time at home. He added that men were afraid to go out in groups in big cities, because observers would think they were gay.\n\nAD\n\nIf other Catholic clergy members were circumspect about sharing their views, McCloskey didn't hold back. A liberal Catholic is oxymoronic, he told Slate in 2002. The definition of a person who disagrees with what the Catholic Church is teaching is called a Protestant.\n\nFor friends and followers, ­McCloskey's approach was overdue. And his message was one they wanted official Washington to hear.\n\nAD\n\nI'd like to unleash him on Capitol Hill, Kudlow told the Washington Times in 2001. A few doses of Father McCloskey, and we'll turn this country around. He's an old-fashioned evangelical pastor. In some ways, the Catholic Church has fallen short in its evangelizing mission, and I think Father John is awakening that.\n\nAnd then in late 2003, as his profile grew ever larger, ­McCloskey was gone. Not disappeared exactly, but nowhere to be seen, at least in any official capacity. He left, he told some friends and associates, for an opportunity to study in England. The work of the Catholic Information Center would continue, but without the direction of the man who had reignited its flame.\n\n'Quite a shock'\n\nMcCloskey's abrupt departure left some scratching their heads, but they assumed he had good reasons for giving up on the Washington grind of green rooms and galas. Last week, the real explanation for McCloskey's hasty exit from Washington was revealed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA woman who had gone to him in 2002 for spiritual guidance told The Washington Post that the popular prelate had victimized her. On several occasions during and after private spiritual counseling sessions in his office to discuss her troubled marriage, he put his hands on her hips and pressed himself against her, kissed her hair and caressed her, the woman said. She said she had smelled alcohol on his breath.\n\nThe global Opus Dei community confirmed last week that it ordered McCloskey to leave Washington in 2003 and said his priestly duties were restricted. Subsequent reports have raised questions about whether his duties were restricted and in which ways. He was later sent to Chicago and California. Opus Dei paid the woman a $977,000 sexual misconduct settlement in 2005.\n\nFor her, McCloskey's actions were a deep and humiliating betrayal.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe absolutely radiated holiness and kindness and caring and charisma, the woman said Thursday in an interview. He persuaded me that I needed to be hugged, which of course I did, but I needed to be hugged by my husband, not by him. The Post does not name victims of sexual assault without their consent.\n\nAnother woman told Opus Dei that she was made uncomfortable by the way McCloskey hugged her, the group told The Post. The community says it is investigating a third claim described by an Opus Dei spokesman as potentially serious. In a statement, Monsignor Thomas Bohlin, the Opus Dei vicar, said McCloskey's actions at the center were deeply painful for the woman who made the initial complaint and we are very sorry for all she suffered.\n\nMcCloskey, 65, is once again living in the Washington area and has advanced Alzheimer's disease, Opus Dei officials said.\n\nThe revelation about McCloskey's actions and the reason he was sent away stunned many who knew him at the height of his powers in the capital.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis whole thing has come as quite a shock to me, said Russell Shaw, who co-wrote a book with McCloskey, Good News, Bad News: Evangelization, Conversion and the Crisis of Faith. I thought it was abrupt when he left and now I wonder why I didn't dream of anything like this.\n\nHelena Metzger, a longtime volunteer and former board member at the Catholic Information Center, said she was surprised when McCloskey left and shocked when she found out the reason a few years later from another Opus Dei priest.\n\nHe was a very visible priest and I knew him quite well, and there were never any signs that anything like this was taking place, she said.\n\nMany of those closest to McCloskey when he was in Washington — including Brownback, Gingrich and Kudlow — did not return messages seeking comment.\n\n'A brashness about him'\n\nMcCloskey did not take a typical path to the priesthood. After graduating from St. John's College High School in Northwest Washington, he went to Columbia University, where he majored in economics. With his Ivy League degree in hand, he headed not to the seminary, but to Wall Street, where he worked for Citibank and Merrill Lynch. A few years later, he moved to Rome to begin his training to become a priest.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter his ordination in 1981, McCloskey returned to the United States and within a few years was installed as the Catholic chaplain at Princeton University. He soon became enmeshed in campus controversies. Critics said he told Catholic students to steer away from certain classes he considered insufficiently Christian, reports at the time said. Others were angered by his uncompromising positions on birth control and premarital sex. McCloskey had a way of finding controversy and attention no matter where he went.\n\nThere was a brashness about him that I always associated with the Wall Street ethos, the Rev. John Paul Wauck, an Opus Dei priest who knew McCloskey, wrote in an email. You could say that, as a priest, he maintained an entrepreneurial attitude. For some, this was off-putting; for others, it was, I'd say, invigorating and even entertaining.\n\nMcCloskey harnessed that entrepreneurial spirit to persuade people, mostly men, to become Catholics. In New York in 1997, he converted Kudlow, who was recovering from addiction. Mark Belnick, a former general counsel of Tyco International, who described McCloskey as a great friend in a New York magazine article, soon followed. They would be among the first in a long line of high-profile conversions that McCloskey facilitated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's just like the brokerage business or any business of sales, McCloskey told the National Catholic Reporter in 2003. You get a reputation, you deal with one person and they mention you to another person . . . and all of a sudden you have a string of people.\n\nThe conversions came naturally to McCloskey because he just had an absolute certainty about what he was proposing, and he had no hesi­ta­tion at all about unapologetically offering Catholicism as an option, said Shaw, his co-author.\n\nAlthough he left Washington at perhaps the height of his fame, McCloskey's legacy is the ongoing influence of the Catholic Information Center. The center's board includes Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, which helped shepherd the Supreme Court nominations of Brett M. Kavanaugh and Neil M. Gorsuch. White House counsel Pat Cipollone is a former board member, as is William P. Barr, who served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush and is now President Trump's nominee for the same position.\n\nAD\n\nThe small center — its members and its leaders — continue to have an outsize impact on policy and politics. It is the conservative spiritual and intellectual center that McCloskey had imagined and its influence is felt in all of Washington's corridors of power.\n\nBut for the woman who suffered years of emotional despair, the success of the center has two aspects. She remains a deeply religious Catholic and celebrates the center's work. But she is also left with the unshakable memory of the center's famous champion as he pushed against her 17 years ago.\n\nI was just thinking, this can't be happening. Am I crazy, this can't be happening, she remembered. He knew what buttons to push and then just let me go and glided serenely in his cassock to his desk and asked, 'When would you like to make the next appointment?' 
Ora Media, the production company he co-founded, announced his death but did not provide a cause, according to the Associated Press. CNN reported earlier this month that Mr. King had been hospitalized for complications of covid-19. The TV host, who was long beset by medical problems, including diabetes and heart attacks, underwent an operation to remove early-stage lung cancer in 2017 and had a stroke in 2019.\n\nIn a career that included print and radio, Mr. King was best known for sitting behind a bulbous RCA microphone in the anchor chair of his prime-time CNN show Larry King Live from 1985 to 2010. He began as a Miami disc jockey in the late 1950s, wrote a USA Today column of stream-of-consciousness musings for nearly 20 years and hosted a late-night Mutual Broadcasting System radio show that was beamed to more than 200 stations. He played himself in dozens of TV shows and movies.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCNN founder Ted Turner called Mr. King the most famous interviewer in the world, which, at Mr. King's peak, was closer to understatement than hyperbole. His show, with its colored-dot map of the world in the background, garnered more than 1.5 million nightly viewers for segments with guests as varied as George H.W. Bush, Frank Sinatra, Snoop Dogg, Magic Johnson, Donald Trump, Michelle Obama, Lady Gaga, Moammar Gaddafi, the Dalai Lama and Marlon Brando, who, at once playful and bizarre, sang an old pop song and planted a kiss on Mr. King.\n\nOthers to appear included sex therapists, ufologists, and Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. The Muppets wore suspenders in the host's honor.\n\nAudiences responded to Mr. King's gentle probing, smoky baritone and casual manner. His CNN show served as an antidote to the network's otherwise round-the-clock breaking news coverage and partisan shout fests. If other interview programs could resemble beds of nails, with gotcha inquisitions of newsmakers, Mr. King's show was a plush chaise longue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew York Times columnist Maureen Dowd referred to him as the resort area of American journalism, the media's Palm Springs, where politicians and other figures of controversy or celebrity can go to unwind, kick back and reflect.\n\nMr. King said he preferred to avoid reading background material on his guests in favor of a spontaneous approach of asking questions on the fly. He described himself as insatiably curious and said his favorite query was also the shortest: Why?\n\nOne of Mr. King's chief talents was his ability to put guests instantly at ease. He shunned the stiff suits favored by other newscasters for a jacketless look and rolled cuffs. His shoulders hunched as he leaned toward his guests. He seemed perpetually wide-eyed behind his windowpane glasses, keenly interested in what anyone sitting across from him had to say.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen nuclear physicist Edward Teller, a father of the hydrogen bomb, balked at an invitation to speak with Mr. King on his Mutual show, the host offered a deal: stay for the first question and, if desired, leave afterward. At the interview, according to a 1980 account in People magazine, Mr. King asked Teller why high school students found physics so intimidating. Teller launched into a heartfelt response about the importance of scientific study — and then answered the rest of Mr. King's questions.\n\nHis impromptu methods caught some subjects off guard. When Vice President Dan Quayle appeared on Larry King Live in 1992, the conservative Republican politician stumbled into a question about abortion.\n\nWhat if your daughter grew up, had a problem, came to you with that problem all fathers fear, how would you deal with it? Mr. King asked.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWell, it is a hypothetical situation, and I hope I never do have to deal with it, but obviously I would counsel her and talk to her and support her on whatever decision she'd make, Quayle said.\n\nAnd if the decision was abortion, you'd support her? Mr. King asked.\n\nI'd support my daughter, Quayle said.\n\nOther times, Mr. King made news despite himself. Hosting Texas business magnate H. Ross Perot in 1992, Mr. King asked about his political prospects. On the spot, Perot announced it was possible he would make an independent bid for the presidency, immediately shaking up the campaign in which he would tap into voters' frustration with the two major political parties.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking with Richard M. Nixon that same year, Mr. King asked the former president what he thought about as he drove past the Watergate apartment and office complex in Washington, the site of the political burglary and coverup that led to Nixon's resignation in 1974.\n\nAD\n\nWell, I've never been to the Watergate, Nixon replied. Other people were in there, though, unfortunately.\n\nSometimes, Mr. King was caught flat-footed. He was upbraided by Jerry Seinfeld when he intimated that the comedian's extremely popular sitcom had been terminated by NBC, when in fact the actor-producer chose to end it.\n\nWhen O.J. Simpson made a surprise call to Mr. King's show live on air in 1995, the day after the football star had been acquitted of murder charges, Mr. King's first question was, Uh, how are you?\n\nAD\n\nWhile his style was purposely simple, Mr. King's line of inquiry occasionally had an unintentional comedic effect.\n\nInitially thinking the Dalai Lama was a Muslim, he asked the Tibetan Buddhist leader: Do you pray? And if so, who do you pray to?\n\nMr. King said he was only posing the questions that members of his audience were too embarrassed to ask.\n\nAD\n\nMr. King, who collected Emmy and Peabody awards, conducted 50,000 interviews before leaving CNN in 2010 amid declining ratings. Into his 80s, he continued to appear on smaller cable outlets, notably the state-financed Russian television network RT, and on shows streamed online through a production company Mr. King founded with Mexican billionaire and telecom mogul Carlos Slim, Ora TV.\n\nAD\n\nThe son of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, Mr. King was born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn on Nov. 19, 1933. His father, who ran a bar and grill, died of a heart attack when Larry was a boy. His mother raised him and a younger brother. He later told New York magazine that he attributed their survival to government assistance, a belief that fueled his undying liberalism.\n\nAfter dropping out of high school, he held odd jobs before moving to Florida. At a radio station, he found work as a janitor but made clear his ambition to go on the air. He got his chance in 1957, when a disc jockey missed his shift. The station manager, advising a less Jewish-sounding name, christened him Larry King.\n\nAD\n\nMr. King soon started an interview program at Pumpernik's deli, a well-known hangout for celebrities. Before long he had his own radio show, television program and a column in the Miami Herald. But by the end of the 1960s, he was gambling compulsively, on his fifth marriage and deeply in debt.\n\nAD\n\nHe allegedly stole $5,000 from industrialist Louis E. Wolfson, leading to grand larceny charges against Mr. King in 1971. The charges were eventually dropped because the statute of limitations had expired, but the host continued over the next several years to face problems over bad checks and debts exceeding $300,000.\n\nHe was fired from the radio station, and his lucrative connections to the TV and newspaper industries disintegrated. Mr. King worked as a publicist for a thoroughbred racetrack, among various jobs. In 1975, a sympathetic radio station manager gave him back his old job, and he slowly rebuilt his career, even as he filed for bankruptcy protection in 1978.\n\nAD\n\nAround that time, Mutual radio lured Mr. King for a national late-night talk show based at studios in Arlington, Va. This incarnation of the The Larry King Show, which featured show business and government newsmakers as well as offbeat personalities, ran from midnight to 5:30 a.m. (later cut back to 5) and drew a following that made him a star.\n\nSoon, he was offered a column in the start-up newspaper USA Today, where he shared random, koanlike thoughts (Jell-O is still one of the all-time great desserts, I get a good feeling when I see a police officer on a horse) and occasional witticisms (Is there a better feeling than having to sneeze and then sneezing?). He ended his run in 2001.\n\nInto his 80s, Mr. King maintained a loyal Twitter following numbering more than 2.4 million. Although he still used a flip phone, he mastered social media with tweets he tagged #ItsMy2Cents that featured a variety of underexplored ideas and questions: Don't know why but corn tastes different off the cob, and Of what possible use is the pinkie toe?\n\nMr. King, known for his wandering eye and monumental self-regard, had a complicated private life. He was married eight times (I love the chase! he once declared), including twice to former Playboy bunny Alene Akins. His last marriage was to singer Shawn Southwick. They reportedly were in the process of getting a divorce at the time of his death.\n\nMy career always came first, he told USA Today in 2020 after he filed for divorce from Southwick. I used to say if CNN called with an emergency and my wife called with an emergency, I'd call CNN back first.\n\nTwo of his children with Akins died, Andy King in July 2020 after a heart attack and Chaia King of lung cancer in August 2020. He had three other children, including a son, Larry Jr., with Annette Kaye, and two sons, Chance and Cannon, with Southwick. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.\n\nMr. King, who wrote several memoirs, was a natural raconteur, a skill he said he developed in childhood on the stoops of Brooklyn. Many of his stories, often involving sexual invitations, strained credulity. Some were outright false.\n\nFor years, Mr. King spoke in detail of his friendship as a teenager with a fellow Brooklyn native, the Baseball Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, and a bet that led to a trip in New Haven, Conn., and some high jinks in that college town. But Koufax told The Washington Post in 1991 that he had never been to New Haven and did not meet Mr. King until both were adults. Mr. King admitted that the story was a fabrication aimed to aggrandize the sorrowful childhood of Larry Zeiger.\n\nI'm a funny storyteller, Mr. King told The Post. Now, that answers what I am. Who I am? It's a question I've never asked.\n\nThen how about Larry Zeiger? Who was he? a reporter asked.\n\nHe was an acne-faced, overweight, Jewish kid whose father died, who was on welfare, whose mother spoiled him. And then, in the course of his life, in his mid-20s, he became Larry King, he said.\n\nAnd who is Larry King? he was asked.\n\nAll the things that Larry Zeiger never was, he said.\n\nSo who was telling that story . . . Larry Zeiger or Larry King?\n\nProbably Larry Zeiger, he said. Larry King wouldn't have to exaggerate anything.
_____________\n\nQ. My mother has a lot of anxieties that she refuses to address or get taken care of. She is a fun and spirited person who used to be adventurous, but the older she has gotten, the more afraid of germs/planes/unusual foods/changes in routine she has become. It makes me sad because I always visualized that we would travel together once she retired. We have always been close and she raised me as a single mom. I have a lot of flexibility with my job and can go to some pretty cool places and I want her to come along. But she has gotten more and more rigid, and now that she has finally stopped working and is in a place to enjoy life, she is balking at accompanying me because of these irrational fears and worries. —Sad Daughter\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut does she view these fears and worries as irrational? And more important, does she actually want to change them? It's unclear to me if travel has always been a joint vision for you both, or if it's more what you think she should do. But she's got to be on board mentally before getting on board a plane, train or automobile.\n\nMany people become less adaptable as they get older, whether just from routines getting ingrained or from heightened anxiety about being less autonomous within their daily lives. If she really wants both to travel and to work on the barriers she has in getting there, then you can help her get help through cognitive behavioral therapy techniques that gradually nudge her out of her comfort zone. But if the only motivation is coming from you, you've got to ask yourself: At what point does a nudge toward adventure become a shove off of a cliff?\n\nHe cheated. Is it my turn now?\n\nQ. My husband had a three-month affair with someone he worked with. I believe it has truly been over for a year and he did come clean about it on his own (after we started having tension about him being distant from me). We have communicated well and I believe I have forgiven him, but I can't shake the idea that I should sleep with someone else to even it out. I know it sounds terrible. Is this part of my not being over it yet? —Can't Shake It\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWell, it depends on your definition of over it. There are many aspects of infidelity that need to be healed. It could be that trust and love are being rebuilt, but you still feel like you've been cheated in a different way: that he got to break the rules and experience something you can't. This might be made worse if you feel like he's gotten away with other things too, or that you are putting in more work than he is. But given that (let's agree on this) your sleeping with someone else would only damage your marriage further, you need to decide how to address these feelings in a constructive way. What is the deficit that's still shouting that it needs to be filled? You can start with some individual therapy of your own to figure that out, and learn what to do about it.\n\nSend your questions for Baggage Check to Dr. Andrea Bonior at baggage@wpost.com.

My wife is an enthusiastic extrovert, and though she sees the bad listeners around us, she rarely gets disillusioned, telling me my expectations are too high and, It's just socializing. Go with it. She also labels me an introvert, and while this is probably true, I also thoroughly enjoy a thoughtful conversation, one where people offer interesting ideas and listen as often as they talk. These conversations are increasingly rare. I've chalked it up to the self-absorption that creeps into people as they age, coupled with modern content overload that has mutilated our attention spans. But it's still deeply unpleasant.\n\nI've tried coping mechanisms: I abandon expectations. I listen carefully — more than I speak. I limit the stories I tell and answer questions concisely. When all else fails, I decline the invitation and settle down with a good book.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAm I having a midlife crisis? Have I become a misanthrope? Do I need new friends? I suspect I come across as rigid and judgmental. But I enjoy good company and long for the days when people delighted in listening to a story as much as telling five. Please show me the way to socialize happily with bad listeners.\n\n— Lost in the Din\n\nLost in the Din: I was going to recommend misanthropy and a book, but you beat me to it.\n\nI doubt there's any way to make these bad listeners any more interesting or satisfying company. You are who you are, for one thing. And, you've tried most of the coping tactics available to you. The only one I'd add is to reframe your reasons for seeing these people. Rather than enjoy myself, try something a little longer-range, such as to keep my marriage happy or to increase the likelihood of casseroles during rough patches, or, to keep me from talking to squirrels. Eyes-on-the-horizon-range. (Plus books.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut you do have options under the new friends banner. Just-social friends, over time, can grow numb to each other's day-to-day. You can like each other immensely and care about each other and still not have much new earth left to turn over. So that points to friends through common interests — ideally where you work collectively toward a tangible outcome, since that often forces verbal exchanges, which in turn discourage the dread sequential monologuing of catching up.\n\nWhat might this mythic conversation-juicing shared outcome be? Not for me to say. With a range wide enough to reach from causes to community theater to joining or coaching teams to chairing local events to cultivating obscure intellectual interests, there's no place for outsiders in this decision. And you'll face pandemic limitations, and probably more new bores than gems. But to my ear, you sound ready to do something interesting — whether anyone lets you tell them about it or not.
Helgason, who lives in Iceland, discovered the germ of this book when he made a phone call for a 2006 political campaign. On the other end of the line was Brynhildur Georgia Bjornsson, granddaughter of Iceland's first president. Her father was one of the few Icelanders who chose to fight with the Nazis in Germany. And she really was living in a garage.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith the character of Herra, Helgason has fictionalized Brynhildur's life, which she described in a memoir before she died in 2007. In Helgason's version, 12-year-old Herra is deposited by her father at the Hamburg train station to meet her mother in 1942. When she never arrives, the girl is forced to make her own way to safety.\n\nIt's been more than two years since I became an orphan and entered the war from the Hamburg Central Station, she writes of a terrible day in 1944. I've been roaming around the Reich of war, through ruins and raids, seeking shelter in shelters and sleeping in courtyards, attics, here and there. . . . And all this time I managed to fight off the hands of war and keep myself a child, all the way up to this eastern forest, all the way up to last night.\n\nThe life she leads is tragic, and in the end, readers will understand why Herra clutches her grenade so close. She has endured a bad marriage and had sons by a few different men. But not one of her adult experiences can compare to the hell of those teen years during the war.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps that's why Helgason chooses to have his narrator unspool her story and then reel it tightly back in at odd intervals. He is demonstrating how impossible it is for trauma survivors to make sense of their own lives. Numbed by deprivation, sexual violence and horrors she can't unsee, Herra tosses off anecdotes about a brief affair with John Lennon at the same pace she describes neglect by her children. She is the most unreliable of unreliable narrators, but her perspective might be just what we need in these uncertain times: She survives and shares her story on her terms. And what a story it is, one worth reading to further understand the complexity of World War II — and to enjoy the quick wit of a woman you won't forget.\n\nBethanne Patrick is the editor, most recently, of The Books That Changed My Life: Reflections by 100 Authors, Actors, Musicians and Other Remarkable People.\n\nWoman at 1,000 Degrees\n\nBy Hallgrimur Helgason\n\nTranslated from the Icelandic by Brian FitzGibbon
Dear Miss Manners: My father is very ill and will not be with us for too much longer.\n\nOne of his daughters is estranged from the family and has been for about 20 years. This was by her own doing, and despite overtures from us — and even her ex-husband admitting that he stirred up the trouble between her and the family — she has chosen to keep her distance.\n\nEven knowing how sick he is now, she has not reached out. That is fine; while it hurt my father very much, he has accepted it and never mentions her.\n\nMy sister and I, who are responsible for helping our mother with arrangements, wonder whether to list her, her daughter and her grandson as survivors in the obituary. Most etiquette guidelines I've found approach the topic from the point of view of the family estranging the child and not the other way around. This daughter is from my father's first marriage, so my sister and I are trying to determine the correct thing to do without worrying our mother.\n\nOf course, we are inclined to leave her out given that she initiated and maintained the estrangement, but we do wonder if there is a point of view that we aren't considering.\n\nYes, unfortunately. The facts.\n\nDespite the estranged nature of the relationship, a relationship nevertheless technically exists. An obituary is a form of journalism, and journalism reflects the truth, not opinions about what should have happened. It does not punish people for bad behavior by erasing them from history.\n\nDear Miss Manners: What is the correct way to address (by introduction and mail) a physician whose license has been permanently revoked?\n\nBy his or her former preferred honorific — unless you are the victim of the license's revocation.\n\nDear Miss Manners: What verbiage can I use when inviting guests to a party at a restaurant when I want them to pay for their own meals?\n\nYou have touched upon an issue that does much to create animosity among those who are supposedly friends. Miss Manners hears constantly from people who thought they were being invited to be guests, only to be given a bill.\n\nSo please drop that language. You are not inviting people to be your guests but asking them if they would like to meet you for a meal out.\n\nDear Miss Manners: I was trying to explain to my 5-year-old daughter that I would like for her to grow up to be a lady, and her brother, a gentleman. When she asked me what a lady was, however, I struggled to come up with an answer! Can you please tell me what defines a lady and gentleman?\n\nGood manners, impeccable poise and a covered bum.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays on washingtonpost.com/advice.

I acknowledged her concern by saying that of course I would wear a mask.\n\nI have decided to no longer engage in personal conversations at work and now this seems to be a problem for her.\n\nI haven't been mean about it; I am simply choosing to no longer engage in private conversations with her.\n\nAD\n\nWhat I do away from work is really no one else's business. I am a very safe traveler and practice good hygiene and have not been sick since the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nAD\n\nThis particular co-worker smokes and drinks to excess on her days off, but I have never judged her or spoken to her about her chances of contracting cancer from her habits.\n\nDo you have any words of wisdom for those of us still working in an office on handling the various attitudes and personal responsibilities to one another during this time?\n\n— Don't Judge Me\n\nDon't Judge Me: If you don't want to be harshly judged, then don't be reactive and judgmental, yourself.\n\nYour co-worker's smoking and drinking habits when she is at home have no bearing on your health — and you know it.\n\nAD\n\nYour traveling could (conceivably) have a bearing on hers — and others' — and you know that, too.\n\nMy advice to people sharing office space is to comply with the local, state and company guidelines.\n\nMy advice to people wrestling with how to behave toward others who are at risk, nervous, anxious — or outright neurotic about contracting covid — is that the people who are physically and mentally healthier should adjust their behavior to the level of the most vulnerable.\n\nAD\n\nIt's no fun, and sometimes (as in your case), you can feel manipulated, disrespected or wounded.\n\nYour co-worker's mask request was reasonable. Your defensive response was ridiculous, as was hers! At last, common ground.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: My husband and I have been through a lot of ups and downs over the years. Despite having a 1-year-old child together, we have discussed divorce more than once, but we're still hanging in there.\n\nRegardless, at the end of the day, every wife wants to hear her husband say, Babe, if I had to marry you all over again, I'd do it in a heartbeat. But I know that he genuinely does not feel this way. And because of that, I feel less secure. Should I be worried?\n\n— Confused\n\nConfused: If you had it to do all over again, would you marry your husband in a heartbeat? Some days yes, some days probably not.\n\nAD\n\nThe first couple of years of family life with a baby can be extremely stressful. I think you should decide to shelve your question. Put it aside.\n\nAD\n\nI can't tell you whether to be worried about the future of your marriage, but I can say, with certainty, that hanging in there is something to celebrate.\n\nDear Amy: I want to give your readers a different perspective on how rough the holiday season has been.\n\nI am married to a police officer. We do not have children. A lot of years I am alone on Christmas or attend family events by myself because he is working or sleeping to prepare for his shift.\n\nAnd you know what? It's okay! I plan movies to watch, light some candles and buy food I love to indulge in.\n\nSeveral years ago, my mom was in the hospital on Christmas and those doctors, nurses and support staff were there, too.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFirefighters, hotel workers and road crews do not get to celebrate with their families, either.\n\nFor us, this is not the new normal, it's just normal.\n\nHopefully next year will be normal for those of you going through this new normal, but remember next year that your normal is not everyone's reality.\n\n— A Different Normal\n\nDifferent Normal: Thank you! You've offered your important perspective at the perfect time. None of us should ever forget the lessons we have learned this year. My gratitude goes out — way, way out — to all who work so hard to give the rest of us a normal.
They were the soul and the heart of the people in this community, said Maj. Srikant Bhatnagar, who along with his wife, Indrani, are corps officers for the Salvation Army on Sherman Avenue NW, where the Wilsons worshiped.\n\nAD\n\nThe blaze broke out around 2:50 a.m. in the 4200 block of Eighth Street NW. Investigators on Thursday had not determined the cause or origin of the fire, which extended to at least one adjacent home and displaced its occupants. A rear porch partially collapsed, and one firefighter was injured.\n\nAD\n\nOne victim was found on the first floor; the other on the second floor.\n\nThe Wilsons were born in Jamaica, where they married and had seven children. The couple moved to the United States in 1969 — some children came then, others followed later — and purchased the house on Eighth Street in Petworth in 1972. They sent their children to public high schools and are survived by 10 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nShe loved them all, said one of their sons, Dwayne Wilson, 60, who lives in Maryland.\n\nWilson said he was the quiet one in the family — so quiet his father feared he was too soft for public school and wanted to send him to a military academy.\n\nIn the end, Wilson, who works at a car dealership, went to the District's Roosevelt High School. Many people he went to school with did not make it, falling to gunfire or to drugs, or to both. My father told me I was not going to do that stuff in his house, Dwayne Wilson recalled. He told me I was going to get an education and do better than that.\n\nAD\n\nHe said his parents stuck by their children well into adulthood. About 15 years ago, he said, he fell on hard times, his first marriage failed and he was forced to leave the church.\n\nAD\n\nHe said his father took his retirement savings and bought him a new vehicle to help get him back on his feet. He has rebounded, he said, because of my father's strength and encouragement.\n\nFamily members said Lester Wilson worked in the construction trade, helping to build a library dedicated to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the FBI building in downtown Washington. Rosa Wilson worked for years as a cleaner at a hospital in Prince George's County in Maryland.\n\nDwayne Wilson said his mother dedicated herself to the Salvation Army, where she helped people others had given up on. She cooked meals for them; other times she slipped them a few dollars for food or bus fare, or she paid for a church trip they couldn't afford.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe said he and other relatives had checked up on the couple this past weekend, bringing over precooked dinners for the week, picking up medicine at a drugstore and treating an injury to Lester Wilson's leg.\n\nSrikant Bhatnagar said the Wilsons had been involved in the organization in Jamaica and continued when they moved to Petworth. The congregation there is small, about 30 people, but the Bhatnagars said Rosa Wilson had an outsize impact.\n\nEven slowed by age, Rosa Wilson made it to church and to the community center several times a week, though the coronavirus pandemic had prevented her from attending in the past 10 months.\n\nStill, she kept sending out birthday cards, adding notes of encouragement, followed by, Praying for you.\n\nAD
Lee's name is included on a banner near the building's main entrance: Santa Cruz Warriors: NBA Call-Ups. The nondescript sign is a badge of honor for the minor-league franchise and a naked reminder to its players: The G League is intended to be a launchpad, not a destination. For the undrafted prospects and journeymen who live in a nearby hotel for the six-month season, the road to the NBA runs through here.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn recent years, though, G League teams have increasingly hosted high-profile NBA players returning from injury such as Cousins, whose $18.1 million contract in 2017-18 was more than 500 times greater than the standard G League salary of $35,000. These rehab assignments are a marriage of convenience, pairing NBA players coming off injuries with pro-level competition that can mimic the speed and physicality of the big league without taxing actual NBA players during the middle of their season.\n\nThis rise in rehab assignments is a helpful barometer for the G League's growth. Since its founding in 2001, the G League has expanded from eight teams to 27 teams, and formalized the relationships between NBA teams and their minor-league affiliates. Rather than sharing far-flung affiliates with other teams as they did in the past, most NBA teams now operate their own G League teams in one-to-one relationships. This trend has allowed NBA teams greater control over style of play on the court, sales and marketing off the court, and even the location of the franchises. Meanwhile, the NBA has expanded roster sizes and added new player designations, such as two-way contract players who can shuttle back and forth between the NBA and G League, to encourage greater investment in the minor-league product. The G League will expand to 28 teams in 2019-20 and expects to have 30 affiliates to match the 30 NBA franchises within the next 18 months.\n\nAs the G League has added and relocated franchises, the convenience factor has sharply increased. The Santa Cruz Warriors, who relocated from North Dakota in 2012, are a prime example. Pitching a rehab stint in Bismarck in mid-December? Good luck. Coordinating a 75-minute drive down from Oakland? No problem.\n\nProximity has mattered for other franchises, too. The Los Angeles Lakers assigned guard Rajon Rondo to their South Bay affiliate, which plays its home games at the team's El Segundo practice facility. The Chicago Bulls have placed Zach LaVine and Kris Dunn with their Windy City affiliate, which plays just 25 minutes from downtown. When the Los Angeles Clippers sent Blake Griffin to practice with their Agua Caliente affiliate last season, they hand-delivered the competition to their star by bringing in the G League players from Ontario, Calif., to practice at their Playa Vista training facility.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to data provided by the G League, the average distance between an NBA team and its G League affiliate this season is 142 miles — down sharply from 452 miles in 2013-14. That geographical shift has led to a corresponding spike in rehab assignments, which have long been common practice for Major League Baseball teams and their farm clubs. From 2013-14 to 2016-17, an average of five NBA players per year were sent to their G League affiliates to aid in their recoveries. Over the past 18 months, 19 players have undertaken rehab assignments, including six all-stars.\n\nRehab assignments are another value-add for the G League, said Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who began his tenure as G League president on Monday. You can use the G League to develop your young players and coaches, but you can also give players like Cousins the opportunity to get practice and game time. We've seen Tony Parker and Brandon Knight do it, too.\n\nLocation is one-half of the equation; commitment is the other. The Warriors have purposefully merged their NBA and G League operations whenever possible, utilizing similar strategies, play calls and terminology. Santa Cruz Coach Aaron Miles joined the Warriors staff during the playoffs and training camp, Santa Cruz's strength coaches are in regular contact with their NBA counterparts, and the Warriors employ a coach who is dedicated to handling the franchise's two-way contract players.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe G League affiliate also mimics Golden State's marketing approaches, utilizing the same blue and yellow color scheme and handing out the same bobbleheads and replica championship rings to Santa Cruz fans that the Warriors dispense at Oracle Arena.\n\nThis comprehensive organizational synergy, as Santa Cruz President Chris Murphy termed it, has enabled Santa Cruz to operate at a profit and cultivate 1,200 season ticket holders. It also perfectly set the table for Cousins's rehab stint, which occurred over three sessions in December during a quieter stretch of Santa Cruz's schedule.\n\nUp at Golden State, DeMarcus was doing a lot of two-on-two stuff, Miles said. [Warriors Coach] Steve Kerr told me he wanted DeMarcus to get up and down. Golden State practices, but they don't do a lot of scrimmaging, it's more fine details. We wanted to give Cousins what he needed. It was big for him to just play because it's been a year or so since he was in an NBA game.\n\nCousins, who tore his Achilles' tendon in January 2018 as a member of the New Orleans Pelicans, went through full-court, five-on-five scrimmages that featured elongated halves to test his conditioning. The Warriors sent down Rick Celebrini, their director of sports medicine, to monitor his performance and members of their digital team to capture highlights for their website. Because Golden State tapes and analyzes all of Santa Cruz's practices and games using the PlaySight and Second Spectrum video services, Kerr's management had complete and immediate access to Cousins's workouts.\n\nWhile it's tempting to picture Cousins barnstorming through Santa Cruz, laying waste to the overmatched competition in front of gawking crowds, that's not what happened. Instead, he teased his younger brother, Jaleel, a 6-10 center for Santa Cruz, and impressed his temporary teammates with his passing skills and outside shooting. The practices occurred in a near-empty gym and received little media attention. It was business as usual, Murphy said. We could have sold hundreds of tickets to the practice, but it was pretty cool to have a player of his caliber have a very comfortable experience.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany of the players knew Cousins from Warriors training camp, which lightened the mood and made his appearance feel routine. It wasn't like our team is a bunch of high school kids in awe, Jaleel Cousins said. Santa Cruz is a professional setting, and this was a professional thing. DeMarcus was trash-talking, trying to motivate guys. Like with your friends playing backyard ball, you talk s---. He said, 'D-up. You can't guard me.' \n\nMiles and his players saw Cousins moving easily as he began to work his way back into game shape. He tested his leg in various situations: setting screens, rolling to the hoop, popping to the three-point line and pivoting through traffic. Miles's eyes lit up as he described how Kerr can use Cousins: by running split cuts off the big man to utilize his passing skills, and by dumping it to him in the post to set up an inside-out game for the Warriors' shooters.\n\nWhen Santa Cruz huddled after practice, Cousins addressed the team, praising their collective talent and offering encouragement. He said to keep grinding and he thanked everybody for playing five-on-five and doing extra for him, Jaleel Cousins said. His message was, 'You guys could have said that you have a game coming up and you wanted to focus on yourselves, but I appreciate you allowing me to join you and helping me to get back to where I was.' \n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough the Warriors elected not to assign Cousins to play in a G League game, his Santa Cruz teammates still dreamed about the possibility. Guard Kendrick Nunn laughed at the idea of Cousins intimidating G League opponents, while forward Kevin Young imagined Miles force-feeding Cousins for crazy numbers.\n\nTo Abdur-Rahim, the concept is no joke. After all, New York Knicks guard Courtney Lee logged 32 minutes in a December game with their Westchester affiliate while on a rehab assignment, another sign that minor-league stigma is fading. I can absolutely see NBA players playing in G League games becoming a trend, said Abdur-Rahim. It takes just one star who wants to play and get his rhythm. Then it would turn commonplace. The structure and the resources support it right now.\n\nWithout question, Cousins's return represents one of the key mileposts of the 2018-19 season. Kerr plans to start him at center, giving Golden State a starting five composed entirely of all-stars from a season ago (the last team with such a luxury was the 1975-76 Boston Celtics). If Cousins fits in and looks healthy, the Warriors are overwhelming favorites to claim their third straight title. If there are bumps or setbacks, the mercurial Cousins — known for his arguments with officials and occasional emotional outbursts — will become a lightning rod.\n\nSanta Cruz's players noted that Cousins won't need to carry as heavy of a burden with the Warriors as he shouldered with the Sacramento Kings and Pelicans earlier in his career. Lee said that Cousins's repeated trips to Santa Cruz showed how humble of a person he is, and Miles spoke positively of Cousins's demeanor and leadership during his visits.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJaleel Cousins said his brother is in a good place mentally because the Warriors have given him a lot of downtime during his rehabilitation and because his comeback represents a chance to rewrite his reputation. He's mingled with the team and meshed with them perfectly, Jaleel said. He's not the monster everybody tries to make him out to be.\n\nThe Santa Cruz Warriors, like the rest of the basketball world, will be tuning into Cousins's first game, but only after they try to beat the Salt Lake City Stars in front of their 68th straight home sellout. I've played in Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and Iceland, Young mused. In Argentina, we had seven fans in the stands at one game. Some places, basketball isn't everything. Here, it's like a family and we try to mimic the Warriors organization in every way. We all want each other to succeed.\n\nIf Golden State scores big with a healthy Cousins, credit Santa Cruz with the assist.
Emhoff — first male spouse and first Jew in the quartet of American presidents, vice presidents and their spouses — gets to define a role that was merely another era's awkward possibility but now seems much less unusual in a nation where gender roles aren't so fixed anymore.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGeraldine Ferraro's husband, John Zaccaro, could have been the trailblazer when his wife became the first woman on a major party's presidential ticket as Democrat Walter Mondale's 1984 running mate. And more recently there was that tantalizing chance that a former president, Bill Clinton, might have been the first gentleman to his wife, the Democrat's failed 2016 presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut it's the 56-year-old Emhoff who is going where Zaccaro and Clinton could not.\n\nEmhoff rides a wave of vagueness into his position at the side of his wife. He and his staff have been rigorously imprecise about plans for his official duties.\n\nHe's left a curious capital with only teensy hints about what's to come. During a campaign fundraising appearance with comedian David Letterman, Emhoff alerted his lawyer friends in the audience to expect a call from him seeking their assistance with efforts to help people get access to legal services. He also made some oblique references to helping his wife, the president and first lady bring together a country racked by so much pain.\n\nMaking history has come with professional sacrifices for Emhoff, who until recently was a high-powered Los Angeles attorney. As some fretted about potential conflicts of interest, Emhoff announced that he'd be leaving his law partnership at DLA Piper, a massive firm with a lobbying portfolio that surely would have created appearance problems.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut in Washington, the prominent can almost always find a soft landing, and Emhoff has secured himself a palatable, seemingly controversy-free job teaching entertainment law at the Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nI've long wanted to teach and serve the next generation of young lawyers, Emhoff said when the appointment was announced in mid-December. I couldn't be more excited.\n\nLegal rainmaker\n\nThough new to the glare of national politics, Emhoff quickly grasped the art of settling on an origin story and then setting it on repeat. His version goes like this: Born in Brooklyn. Raised in New Jersey. Happy memories of Jewish summer camp, where he won some athletic awards. Moved to suburban Los Angeles when he was in high school because his father got a new job. Bar mitzvah in a corny suit.\n\nAD\n\nEmhoff, who declined to be interviewed for this story, graduated from Cal State Northridge, whose reputation is miles behind the prestige factories of the big University of California system schools. Aaron Jacoby, a former law partner of Emhoff's, says his friend's second-tier undergraduate degree may have inspired him to overachieve when he stepped it up several notches by getting his law degree from the University of Southern California and later beginning his legal career with an overriding urge to prove himself.\n\nAD\n\nAfter law school, Emhoff made the obligatory stop at a large firm but eventually formed his own practice with Jacoby and another attorney in a quirky former entertainment company building they found in Beverly Hills — a fancy residential Zip code, but removed from the locus of Los Angeles legal swagger in the glass towers of Century City.\n\nJacoby and Emhoff had met in a Lamaze class when their first wives were pregnant, and they saw each other through divorces. While Jacoby was going through his breakup, he says, Emhoff demonstrated a radar for detecting when he was lonely and needed to be taken to dinner.\n\nAD\n\nTheir firm quickly boomed. In the years to come, Emhoff straddled a line — rising star, but never too showy. An avid golfer with a handicap in the teens, according to friends, Emhoff joined Hillcrest, a historically Jewish country club formed when others rarely admitted Jews.\n\nAD\n\nIt wasn't one of the fanciest in their image-conscious world, but fancy enough, Jacoby said.\n\n(Emhoff was mum when asked for this article whether he has joined one of the many golf and country clubs in the Washington area, where the capital's political, lobbying and corporate elite commune in relative privacy.)\n\nAt his Los Angeles law firm, Emhoff was the convener, the rainmaker, the organized one, the one who saw the future. He persuaded Jacoby to overcome his reluctance to fold into a large firm, Venable, where he was able to scale their practice and supersize the firm's West Coast presence. Later, DLA Piper lured him to do the same.\n\nBuilding teams was Emhoff's forte, says Alex Weingarten, his partner at Venable. When they worked on cases together, they'd good-cop, bad-cop the opposing side. Emhoff was always the good cop.\n\nWhile at Venable, he was set up on a blind date with Harris, who was California's attorney general. Their origin story is finely honed, too, laid out in Harris's 2019 memoir, The Truths We Hold. Emhoff texted her from a Los Angeles Lakers game. He left her a long, rambling voice mail by way of introduction; it was awkward, but she found it endearing. She flew down to Los Angeles for their first date. Early the next morning, Emhoff sent her an email: I'm too old to play games, or hide the ball. I really like you and I want to see if we can make this work.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe budding relationship was sotto voce.\n\nI've met someone but can't say anything about her, Emhoff would say. Jacoby guessed it was a starlet.\n\nHarris, who had attended a Pentecostal church as a child, and Emhoff had a small wedding — her first, his second — in Santa Barbara in 2014. The ceremony included Jewish traditions such as the breaking of a glass.\n\nDefying cliche, Harris and Emhoff's first wife — Los Angeles film producer Kerstin Emhoff — have become good friends. It has helped that Harris clicked with Emhoff's children from his first marriage: Cole, who was named for jazz legend John Coltrane; and Ella, named for Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nWe sometimes joke that our modern family is almost too functional, Harris wrote in her memoir.\n\nAn improved husband\n\nIn 2017, the chummy threesome — Emhoff, his ex-wife and his wife of three years, then a freshly minted U.S. senator from California — settled in at a restaurant table at the Hotel NoMad.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHarris, now the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, launched into a story that evening about how she had recently awakened to hear Doug Emhoff drop a surprise announcement: They were going on a trip. He'd planned everything.\n\nKerstin Emhoff nearly spit out her wine, she recalled in an interview. This was not the driven attorney with whom she had spent more than two decades, a man whose idea of a good time was spending hours on a golf course, endlessly watching sports on TV or attending pro basketball games.\n\nI'm so much better than I was before, he said.\n\nGobsmacked, his ex-wife smiled, and turned to Harris.\n\nI don't know what you've done to this man, she said. But it's great.\n\nStepping up\n\nOutside the most insidery of California political types, Emhoff was once a relative unknown.\n\nAD\n\nBut with his wife seeking national office, he became a thing. A 2019 video of Emhoff dancing in a convertible with Harris, who was then running for the Democratic presidential nomination, at the San Francisco Pride Parade went viral. In a tweet, Emhoff repurposed the video into a jokey fundraising pitch, cracking about making dad moves with my dad bod.\n\nAD\n\nSince then, Emhoff — a man of medium height with a receding, graying hairline, a relaxed manner and a far-from-imposing presence — has become such a hit for posting candid moments from the campaign and puppy-love images of him and Harris that he's spawned a hashtag: #Doug­hive, a play on Beyoncé fans' BeyHive. Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.), who has campaigned with Emhoff, called the unassuming lawyer an election year sensation.\n\nThat notoriety has given Emhoff a loud voice on matters of public policy and behavior. In late December, he posted a photograph of himself wearing a mask for his 750,000-plus Twitter followers with the message, Wear a mask.\n\nDoug Emhoff, husband of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), spoke at a drive-in rally on Sept. 26 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Joe Biden/YouTube)\n\nIn acronym-obsessed Washington, Emhoff presents a challenge. There's POTUS (president of the United States), VPOTUS (vice president of the United States) and FLOTUS (first lady of the United States). Regardless of whether Emhoff gets his very own acronym, the media has mainly settled on a title for him: Second Gentleman. (That one will be hard to condense. SGOTUS doesn't have much of a ring to it.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis cohorts on the campaign didn't need to struggle for something to call him. He was referred to as a mensch so many times that it might as well have been on his business cards.\n\nObviously there's a tremendous amount of nachas to have one of our own in that role, says Weingarten, the former Emhoff law partner who is a prominent leader in the Los Angeles Jewish community, invoking a Yiddish word for pride.\n\nEmhoff's path to a perch as the second gentleman has stirred curiosity among some in the Jewish community.\n\nThey ask me if he really is Jewish — whatever that means, said Jacoby, Emhoff's former partner. And you say: 'There's a whole list of things. He is pro-Israel. They did break a glass at their wedding.' All these things they want to know that are proving his level of Jewishness. It's kind of funny.\n\nFriends say Emhoff is not a member of a temple and describe him as a less-than-observant Jew who nonetheless identifies deeply with Judaism and has been shaped by its values. On a trip last year to Michigan, he went to Temple Israel in West Bloomfield with Marseille Allen, a local activist. When Allen told him that she'd recently converted to Judaism, the low-key Emhoff surprised her by throwing up his hands.\n\nWelcome to the tribe! he said.\n\nProblematic clients\n\nPolitical spouses seldom cause a ripple, but sometimes they can be a liability. Ferraro's husband, John Zaccaro, a real estate investor, caused a controversy when he initially refused to release his financial information and his practices as a landlord were criticized.\n\nEmhoff presented a more complex set of questions. Over the years, alongside the boilerplate corporate and real estate work, he has sometimes represented heavily regulated companies or firms that might be frowned upon on the left.\n\nHe represented Merck in cases involving allegations that the drug Fosamax caused bone disease, an entanglement that could cause appearance problems given Democrats' criticism of the drug industry. Even more touchy, his clients have included Abbott Laboratories in an OxyContin fraud case and the arms dealer Dolarian Capital in a dispute related to a contract to transfer weapons from Romania to the Afghan military.\n\nThe cases that have gotten the most attention lately, though, have been the quirkiest. He succeeded in shielding an advertising agency from paying a massive judgment in a case involving the origins of the Chihuahua featured in Taco Bell advertisements. And he has represented Jukin Media, a California company, in copyright infringement lawsuits related to a viral video of the Pizza Rat dragging a big slice in a New York subway, and others with titles such as 2nd story beer pong dunk fail.\n\nEmhoff initially took a leave of absence from his law firm during the campaign. During the transition he announced he'd depart from the firm completely before Inauguration Day.\n\nEven if he could have figured out a way to build a firewall between his legal work and the lobbying and government work of his firm, DLA Piper, it's likely that real or perceived conflicts of interest would have been alleged by his wife's political opponents.\n\nThe closest parallel for Emhoff may be Marilyn Quayle, the wife of President George H.W. Bush's vice president, Dan Quayle. She made inquiries about resuming her legal career when her husband took office, but her plans fizzled amid conflict-of-interest sniping and reluctance within firms to open themselves to undue scrutiny.\n\nShe gave up everything for her husband, said Christian Josi, a longtime Quayle adviser and confidant. My take is she was never entirely happy about it. But she sucked it up for the country and her husband.\n\nFor Emhoff, joining the faculty at Georgetown, where he will be a Distinguished Visitor from Practice and teach a two-credit course in entertainment law, has become his workaround.\n\nDoug is one of the nation's leading intellectual property and business litigators, and he has a strong commitment to social justice, William M. Treanor, dean of the law school, said in a statement announcing Emhoff's teaching job. I know our students will greatly benefit from his experience and insight, and I am eagerly looking forward to his arrival.\n\nEmhoff declined through a spokesperson to reveal how much he will be paid, whether he solicited the job, was recommended by someone or recruited, or whether his wife played a role in his appointment. A Georgetown spokeswoman declined to answer the same questions.\n\nLow profile\n\nThere have been signs that Emhoff will take steps to avoid deflecting the spotlight from the biggest marquee name in his marriage.\n\nWhen Harris received the Moderna coronavirus vaccine at a public event on Dec. 29, Emhoff received the shot too, but outside the view of that day's pool reporter. Later he tweeted a photograph of himself getting the injection in his left arm with Harris standing over his right shoulder.\n\nToday @KamalaHarris and I received the COVID-19 vaccine. It was quick, easy — and safe! Grateful to our nurse Patricia and all the frontline workers saving lives across the country. We each have a role to play to keep ourselves and our communities safe.\n\nAt other appearances, he's exuded that same unscripted, self-effacing amiability that connected him with voters during the campaign.\n\nI learned to cook a few things during the pandemic, he said during an appearance with his wife in early January.\n\nRight on cue, Harris, a cooking enthusiast who often shares kitchen tips, quipped that he set off the fire alarms a few times. He's had to learn a few things over and over again, she said.\n\nHe might not have been the perfect fill-in for his family's home life. But at least he was trying.\n\nAnd that, it's certain, goes a long way to explaining why the people who loved Kamala have come to love Doug.\n\nNot long ago, Emhoff participated in a virtual forum with PL+US, a group that advocates for paid family and caregiver leave, said Katie Bethell, the group's founder and executive director. The group's virtual events usually draw a few hundred attendees. When Emhoff appeared, they got 60,000.\n\nI'm doing what I always do: supporting Kamala, being there for her, loving her, Emhoff told the audience, and giving her whatever support she needs.\n\nAfterward Bethell says a girlfriend of hers sent a text message.
Beyoncé hid the news well. It's not as if she hasn't been spotted out and about lately: She reportedly came to the White House in early January for a celebrity-filled goodbye party for the Obamas.\n\nWednesday's announcement was met by total shock on social media, where the topic BEYONCE IS HAVING TWINS — yes, in all caps — trended on Twitter. By 9 p.m., Guinness World Records announced that Queen Bey had shattered a previous world record held by Selena Gomez after her Instagram baby bump picture garnered more than 6.3 million likes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe later posted the rest of what turned out to be was quite an elaborate maternity photo shoot on her website, captioned with poetic lines.\n\nIn a world where anyone with a smartphone, a signal and a bunch of time on their hands can turn into a sleuth, the details and contours of Beyoncé's life and work have been remarkably kept under wraps.\n\nThis discipline extends to her professional output. Beyoncé has been able to record and produce; shoot and finish albums; and film dozens of music videos nearly entirely under the radar. While some of her most die-hard fans follow tea leaves incredibly closely and speculate as to what's around the corner, Beyoncé generally presents a master class for super-famous people in the art of controlling the narrative.\n\nAD\n\nThis is the woman who in 2013 dropped her surprise, self-titled visual album on a Friday night, immediately causing a social-media frenzy. And as if we didn't learn our lesson, she basically did the same thing two years later with Formation. She posted the music video to social media on a Saturday afternoon and about 24 hours later, performed the song during the Super Bowl halftime show. By then, plenty of Americans had played the song on repeat; Formation was no longer a new release.\n\nWho else can do that? Frank Ocean basically did the opposite: Anticipation built for years over whether he would release new music, and people closely tracked rumors, signs and signals as to when he'd drop his eagerly awaited follow-up to Channel Orange. It became so watched that a website was established to alert fans as soon as the album dropped.\n\nBeyoncé is pregnant with twins and people have a lot of feelings. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)\n\nEven Taylor Swift's fans have tried to crack the code as to when her newest work will be out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKendrick Lamar followed the Beyoncé playbook with a 2015 surprise release, but he doesn't command anywhere near the level of attention that Queen Bey's every move does.\n\nIt hasn't always been this way for Beyoncé, whose album 4 leaked onto the Internet in 2011. While this is not how I wanted to present my new songs, she said in a statement at the time, I appreciate the positive response from my fans.\n\nBut considering how a music video from Beyoncé can spawn a week of essays and podcasts and SNL sketches, the star has remarkably let little leak since, including details of her personal life.\n\nFor years, rumors have percolated at various times as to her maternal status, but murmuring would quickly subside. Instead, Beyoncé took it upon herself to reveal her pregnancy during a live performance at the 2011 MTV Music Awards and, in the process, created one of the year's most talked about TV moments.\n\nOne of the only off-scripted moments that ballooned from a tabloid sensation into a mainstream news topic was the infamous 2014 elevator surveillance video TMZ posted showing her sister, Solange, attacking her husband Jay Z. In a rare move, the family released a statement acknowledging the video and the great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. The most important thing is that our family has worked through it, they said. Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEventually, Beyoncé was able to reclaim the fallout from the elevator video — Of course sometimes s— go down when it's a billion dollars on an elevator, she sang on a song released months after the incident — and rumors of potential infidelity.\n\nWith the visual album Lemonade, the singer presented a story of a cheating partner and a woman embarking on a journey of anger, heartbreak and forgiveness. Was this tale about her marriage? Given how incredibly private the A-list couple is, meh, probably not. But she provided enough tantalizing clues and lyrics to get people talking for a long time about the project.\n\nAnd that's really what any celebrity wants: to be discussed, on their terms.
As she seeks a foothold in a crowded Democratic field, Gabbard, 37, has been viewed suspiciously by many on the left because of her opposition to civil unions for same-sex couples while a state legislator in the early 2000s.\n\nAt a forum during that period, Gabbard said that Democrats should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who is running for president in 2020, released a video on Jan. 17 apologizing for past statements regarding gay rights. (Tulsi Gabbard)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGabbard also previously worked for an anti-gay-rights organization in Hawaii led by her father.\n\nIn her video, Gabbard noted that she had previously apologized for her past views.\n\nIn my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were hurtful to people in the LGBTQ community and to their loved ones, she said. I'm deeply sorry for having said them. My views have changed significantly since then, and my record in Congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart.\n\nGabbard said she grew up in a socially conservative household where I was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.\n\nAnd she described her father as an activist who was fighting against gay rights and marriage equality in Hawaii, acknowledging that at that time I forcefully defended him and his cause.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe said that her views had changed over the years and become her own.\n\nEarlier this week, Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.), who is openly gay, defended Gabbard and her evolving views.\n\nIn a statement, he said that he has experienced discrimination firsthand and said those who work against equality carry that stain and must be held accountable.
Gurley may be the most dynamic offensive weapon in football, and over the past two seasons, he has emerged as the standard of the versatile NFL running back. The league is now brimming with young and intriguing ball carriers who can catch, block and test offenses with their power and their speed. But Gurley so consistently drops jaws — hurdling defenders, making one-handed snags, standing up pass rushers, zipping past other speedy players with ease — that even his teammates are nonchalant about his play.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTodd is Todd, Rams defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh said.\n\nAs part of a two-man rushing attack with C.J. Anderson that ran over the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC divisional round, Gurley, the most important and irreplaceable player on the star-studded Rams' roster, has L.A. one win from the Super Bowl. His 115-yard performance last Saturday included a 35-yard touchdown run in which Dallas made one mistake, and Gurley blazed through a hole and didn't look back. It happened so fast. It was exhilarating.\n\nFor Gurley, it was normal.\n\nThe Red Sea parted, and I ran, man, he said after the game. All I had to do was cut one time and just run.\n\nJust a few years ago, the accepted belief was that tailbacks possessed diminished value in this evolving, pass-centric game. The lead back was becoming a specialist, an opening act to the supposed third-down back, whose popularity had risen because of his multipurpose talents in up-tempo, spread-out offenses. But now, there is a generation of running backs who have done it all their entire lives, and they are leading a renaissance for the position.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGurley is at the top of that list. He led the NFL last season with 2,093 yards from scrimmage and scored 21 touchdowns in 15 games, and was honored as the league's offensive player of the year. Then he redefined the market for his position by signing a four-year, $57.5 million contract extension, including $45 million in guarantees, last July. This season, he finished fourth in yards from scrimmage with 1,831 and reached the end zone 19 times despite missing the final two games with a knee injury.\n\nThis is an era in which Christian McCaffrey just set a record for running backs with 107 receptions during the 2018 season, in which Le'Veon Bell basically averages 1,300 rushing yards and 80 receptions when he's not holding out, in which Ezekiel Elliott flashes the talent and production of an all-time great and Saquon Barkley set the league afire as a rookie. But skill for skill, Gurley has an unrivaled toolbox.\n\nHis ability to make an impact at every level — as a runner, as a receiver, as a blocker, in all kinds of different situations — sets him apart, said Rob Rang, a senior analyst for NFLDraftScout.com, which is affiliated with the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A lot of backs can catch the ball or have speed and elusiveness, but they're not also the pile-driver and red-zone primary threat that Gurley is. I don't think there's a back next to him. Anything you need him to do, Todd Gurley can do.\n\nGurley does it, and then he shrugs. No big deal. For this new crop of do-it-all running backs, versatility is a requirement. Historically, they're special. In their minds, this is simply the job.\n\n'He brings it all'\n\nFive running backs surpassed 1,500 yards from scrimmage this season: Barkley, Elliott, McCaffrey, Gurley and Alvin Kamara. All of them complemented their running ability by gaining at least 500 receiving yards. Ten years ago, eight backs broke the 1,500-yard mark, but none of them reached 500 yards receiving. Most of them didn't even come close.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat statistic illustrates how much the game has changed. It used to be that, once a generation, a Marshall Faulk or a LaDainian Tomlinson would come along and show off dual-threat running back traits. Now that skill set is expected — and not just because offenses have become more pass-heavy. The freakish ability of pass rushers has changed the game, too. Quarterbacks need to get rid of the football quickly.\n\nRunning backs in today's era now have to catch the ball out of the backfield, Rang said. They have to stay on the field for all three downs to help speed the game up, because substitutions can slow everything down and allows defenses to go to their sub-packages.\n\nThe Rams and New Orleans Saints will play an NFC title game that features two explosive offenses built around the run. Los Angeles ranked third in the NFL in rushing offense during the regular season. New Orleans was sixth. Despite the quality quarterback play of Jared Goff and Drew Brees, and all the receiving talent on the field, both teams play through their running backs. The Saints have a 1-2 punch with Kamara and Mark Ingram. The Rams' late-season acquisition of Anderson, who has rushed for more than 120 yards in three straight games, has added a fresh dimension to their offense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnderson carried a heavier load than Gurley against the Cowboys and finished with 123 yards and two touchdowns. For most of the regular season, and for most of his four years with the Rams, the 24-year-old Gurley has been the every-down centerpiece of the offense. He still is, but with Anderson assisting Gurley, the team can wear down defenses without wearing out their superstar.\n\nIt's allowed both of them to be fresher, said Aaron Kromer, the Los Angeles run-game coordinator. If one guy has to play the whole game, that's a tough [task]. You could see where in games throughout the second half of the season, when Todd had to stay in there as long as he had to stay in there, he wasn't as effective because he was tired. And any running back that I know gets subbed in and out. And what this has allowed us to do is give both of them a rest.\n\nDon't confuse that with any dissatisfaction with Gurley or ongoing concern about his health. Reporters wondered this week whether Anderson, who is small at 5-foot-8 and powerful at 225 pounds, provided something that Gurley can't do.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKromer chuckled at the suggestion. Gurley, unable to do something? No, no, no.\n\nI can't picture anything that Todd doesn't bring to the run game, Kromer said. He brings it all. He's got speed. He's got power. He's got size. He's intelligent. And he has been productive all year for us and has done a great job.\n\nThe Rams just want to preserve a player they've turned into the NFL's ultimate weapon. Rang considers it a perfect marriage of player and scheme. Because Coach Sean McVay has Gurley terrifying opposing defenses, he can do so much. The Rams are one of the most frequent and effective users of the play-action pass, and they take their base personnel package (one running back, one tight end, three wide receivers) and run so many creative looks from it.\n\nAD\n\nMcVay relies heavily on Gurley, and Gurley benefits from what McVay has installed around him. Similar to Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith, Gurley thrives with the combination of incredible individual talent, play-calling and great playmakers around him. The Rams had two 1,200-yard receivers this season, Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods. Before an anterior cruciate ligament injury sidelined him at midseason, Cooper Kupp was on pace to catch 80 passes for 1,100 yards.\n\nAD\n\nEarlier this season, Gurley joked about his impact on the balanced attack. Sometimes, he finds himself playing decoy.\n\nI tell those guys they need me out there, he told reporters. I tell them, 'Thank me all the time.' When I go in motion, and they get their little touchdowns.\n\nAD\n\nThen he'll turn serious.\n\nThe balance means everything, he said.\n\n'Todd is Todd'\n\nHerschel Walker, a running back icon at Georgia long before Gurley, used to watch the Bulldogs and see Gurley's NFL future. Back then, he wasn't used much as a receiver. But Walker saw the soft hands and raw skills.\n\nYou know what's so funny about watching him now? said Walker, who caught 512 passes during his NFL career. I said. 'He don't realize it, but he can catch the football.' When he was at Georgia, I would get to sit with him and talk with him, and I knew he had it all. Running backs who can catch, you don't have to take out. You're not running them off the field on third down.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGurley, he's such a threat. He sets up everything the Rams do.\n\nGurley shares Walker's otherworldly physical gifts, and he's listed at 6-foot-1 and 225 pounds, which was Walker's height and weight in his mid-20s. Walker is one of the greatest college football players ever and a physical marvel even at age 56. But Gurley is on pace to have a better NFL career.\n\nPerhaps the only threat to that is Gurley's health. He tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee at Georgia in 2014, which didn't stop the Rams from picking him 10th overall in the following year's draft. Since returning, he has missed only three games, although the Rams will need to monitor his workload in future seasons, as this new wave of versatile backs will face similar physical punishment to their run-first predecessors.\n\nAD\n\nGurley's NFL career has gone just the way that his former coaches at Tarboro High School in North Carolina figured it would. Andrew Harding, his former track and field coach and a current football assistant, still remembers watching him as a teenager.\n\nHe has the athletic ability to do whatever he wants, Harding said. I used to think, 'He can be an NFL Hall of Famer or an Olympic champion in the hurdles.' It was that clear. Everything he did was straight up off of natural ability.\n\nTell Harding about Gurley's soft-spoken demeanor as a pro, and he laughs. The running back would laugh and joke with friends, but on the field, he has always been humble and disinterested in boasting. He was the guy who, as a junior, would take himself out of the same so that his senior friend could get some snaps at running back.\n\nTarboro Coach Jeff Craddock once saw a huge hole on a play and declared, Touchdown. Then he realized the senior was in the game, not Gurley.\n\nListen, you don't come out of the game until I tell you to, Craddock said.\n\nCoach, that's my boy, Gurley replied. He's a senior. I'm a junior.\n\nGurley has always helped others shine. It's no surprise to his old coaches that he continues to do so with the Rams.\n\nThat's just who he is, Harding said. Todd is Todd.\n\nEarlier this week, Gurley posted an Instagram picture in which he stood next to Barry Sanders. When Harding and Craddock first saw the image, they nudged each other, both giddy. After marveling that their pupil was hanging with one of their football heroes, they realized something: Their guy belonged. The image felt natural. Of course, the NFL's current ultimate weapon would be standing next to one from the past.\n\nTodd is Todd. He's extraordinary, but it's understood now. Todd is Todd.
We both knew I was in no position to divorce, as maintaining a stable environment for my young family is my priority. We tried to keep the intensity level low, which we did at times, but then the intensity kept returning. We shared a brief and limited physical element.\n\nEventually, I realized I was not at peace. I ended contact with him. I realized I needed to put the energy I was putting into my emotional relationship back into my marriage. Things are better, and I am glad I am working on the marriage. But I know (actually I knew for years) that my husband and I are not really soul mates and that we are a cultural and intellectual mismatch — the elements that draw me to my friend in the first place.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI still have lingering, and often very strong feelings. I keep wondering if these feelings are preventing me from further improving my marriage. My friend has been fully understanding about why it is probably best for us not to have contact.\n\nDuring one of our last conversations, he said his concern was that we might end up over-romanticizing or over-idealizing each other in our memories.\n\nAs emotional (and lightly physical) partners, we did not have to deal with the day-to-day issues of a real relationship, and could focus more on the intellectual and cultural connection.\n\nHe suggested I consider an occasional normalizing meeting: a coffee or lunch in which we remind ourselves that our relationship at its most intense was meaningful but not really realistic.\n\nAD\n\nI am torn. I think I am over-romanticizing. But I am not sure if a normalizing meeting would bring my feelings down to earth — or simply respark the attraction.\n\nAD\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nTorn\n\nTorn: I think that occasional normalizing meetings where you and your friend remind yourselves of the intensity of your romance as a way to move on from it, are the perfect trigger to rekindling the romance.\n\nYou (and he) seem to have already processed this relationship. You claim to already know what you need to know — that your marriage is important to you, that you are committed to it and that this other relationship interfered with your marriage. Why, then, would you need yet more evidence that this extramarital relationship was not good for you?\n\nAD\n\nIn this case, normalizing sounds like an intellectually framed rationalization to see one another. I vote no.\n\nI'd be interested in hearing from other readers regarding how they've recovered from intense emotional affairs.\n\nDear Amy: A very good friend of mine was to get married. Again — for (about) the third time. She has called off each wedding with various excuses. The most recent wedding was one I was to be in.\n\nAD\n\nA week before the wedding, she called this one off with the excuse that he was not good looking.\n\nShe said, Can you imagine waking up to him for the rest of your life?! What upset me was she never called me to let me know the wedding was called off. I was very mad that she did not call me to let me know, and I told her that it upset me. She said, You'll get over it.\n\nAD\n\nMy question is, should I hang on to this so-called friendship, or let it go?\n\nWondering\n\nWondering: You should treat this relationship as sensitively as your friend regards her various engagements. Drop the friendship, and assure her that she is right in this regard: You will definitely get over it.\n\nDear Amy: Oh boy, the question from Broken Family really hit home. An alcoholic family member would get drunk and fire off offensive emails late at night.\n\nAD\n\nI used to have a drinking problem, and I also considered it a great idea to have three or four drinks and then fire off some toxic emails.\n\nWhen someone gets a DUI, they will be ordered to get an ignition interlock device, requiring them to blow into a breathalyzer.\n\nHow about installing a breathalyzer interlock device on laptops?\n\nThat would have saved me, several times.\n\nHappily, I'm now sober.\n\nCelebrating Sobriety\n\nCelebrating Sobriety: I love your idea. Let's share the patent.
My boyfriend doesn't want to live in a small town — ever. His career relies on him living in a city. He loves city life.\n\nThis is the biggest of several differences between us.\n\nI'm ready to give up my dreams to be with him, and even though I love him deeply, I think I'll be miserable.\n\nAD\n\nI don't want to lose him.\n\nWill this doom us? What can we do?\n\nDesperate\n\nDesperate: A doomed relationship could be your liberation.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States is projected to have a shortfall of up to 121,900 physicians by 2032, owing to older doctors retiring, and the increased needs of a rising number of older Americans requiring more doctors.\n\nThe physician shortage is most acute in rural areas. In small towns and small cities, your ability to provide health care will quite literally be a lifesaver. You will get to know your patients and their families. The fact that you are seeking a small-town lifestyle means that you will be personally happier, once you land in the right spot.\n\nAD\n\nMore than a decade ago, I left the big city and moved back to my rural hometown. Unlike you, I enjoyed life in the city — but this morning I walked through the snowy woods as the sun came up. Life in the country, and being around others who also embrace this (sometimes challenging) lifestyle, is a daily tonic.\n\nAD\n\nMarrying someone you love while believing that you will be miserable is not a rational, healthy or adult choice. You've been together for seven years. Marriage will not magically transform your personal preferences or your life's goals. Perhaps you two could agree to a year of a long-distance relationship, where you each live where you want to live. You could also research cities with outdoorsy reputations (such as Boston, Portland, Seattle, Vancouver and Denver) that might give you each the lifestyle you want.\n\nDear Amy: When our niece was a young, single mother of two, we took her and her young children into our home, and — with the understanding that it was a loan — helped her financially. She has made no effort to repay the near $20,000 she owes (for car repairs, etc.).\n\nAD\n\nShe's now engaged to a wonderful man (and pregnant again).\n\nAD\n\nWe want to warn her betrothed of her debts owed, but at the same time, we feel it's not our place to rat on her. So, WWAD (What Would Amy Do?).\n\nConflicted in CA\n\nConflicted in CA: Here's what I wouldn't do: I wouldn't warn a fiance of a debt unless I had tried mightily to collect from the person who owes it.\n\nYour loan understanding might not even be a loan. Was this acknowledged in writing, or did you — out of the goodness of your hearts — take in a needy relative and her children and help this family to survive, with a vague understanding that you would be repaid some day?\n\nYou should communicate with your niece about this. If you have a valid agreement in place, review it with her and tell her that you expect to be repaid. Depending on what state the couple lives in, her debt will carry over into her new marriage and become the couple's debt, and, yes, her fianc should be told.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCommunicate respectfully and attempt to negotiate a reasonable repayment schedule for this substantial amount. There are online services that could help you to formalize this loan, with promissory notes and repayment tracking.\n\nDear Amy: Going Nuts in Niagara complained about the neighbors feeding local squirrels, resulting in a large amount of empty peanut shells on their property.\n\nYou should have suggested that the neighbors feed the squirrels shelled peanuts. Why didn't you?\n\nWondering\n\nWondering: Mainly, I didn't think of it. Feeding the squirrels at all was the true nut of the problem, but I agree that offering them peanuts out of the shell would have eliminated some of the mess.
The shadow of that unpleasantness — in a community that is 98.3 percent White and where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 2 to 1 — hardly darkens the poignant and at times wry new documentary Some Kind of Heaven, which looks at the search for love in a planned community where 80 percent of the residents are over 65. And yet it is hard not to sometimes be reminded of the Villager's outburst in a film with such a startling lack of diversity. Nearly everyone on camera is White (though thanks to frequent sunbathing, the skin color of many of the film's participants is closer to that of toasted almonds).\n\nThe feature debut of Lance Oppenheim, Heaven follows four subjects, three of whom are Villagers, over the course of several months. Barbara Lochiatto is a lonely widow who moved from Massachusetts to The Villages several years ago, and who strikes up a courtship with golf cart salesman and Jimmy Buffett disciple Lynn Henry. Then there are the Kincers, Anne and Reggie, whose marriage of 47 years is threatened when Reggie's recreational drug use gets him in trouble with the law, even as he seems to be sliding into dementia. Finally, there's Dennis Dean, a somewhat sleazy, 81-year-old California playboy who is living out of his van as he looks for a wealthy woman in The Villages to move in with.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDennis's story takes a surprising turn, midway through the movie, lending the film a bit of drama.\n\nThe most amusing, perhaps even surreal portions of Oppenheim's film have to do with everyday life in The Villages, described as Disney World for retirees for its fake Spanish-colonial backstory, carefully engineered to mask the fact that The Villages only came into existence in the 1980s. There are thousands of organized activities and clubs, including one in which all the members are named Elaine. If Heaven had just stuck with the bizarro, it would have made a nice, perhaps even Oscar-worthy short film.\n\nBut the film deepens and grows more thoughtful — and, yes, sad — as its spotlight on the need for human connection — at any age — comes into focus. The stories of the four people at its center show Villagers to be more than statistics.
The pressure was easy to manage in the past because she lived only an hour away and we could meet for lunch, etc. Last year she moved six hours away, and now our visits end up lasting a whole weekend.\n\nShe wants us to get together all the time (every other month), and I feel so much pressure to do that. In between visits, she goes on about how she misses me, and when I do visit she will talk about how the visit was too short.\n\nAD\n\nI know I sound like a spoiled brat. I feel this huge amount of guilt from her and I can't just tell her, I've had my fill of you. How about we get together in five months? — but this is really what I want.\n\nAD\n\nI sometimes think about how the guilt would go away when she passes away. I get upset because I have these terrible thoughts. I love my mom very much. I like spending time with her.\n\nWe have talked about how the visits are too often for me, but the guilt is ALWAYS there, so then I just give in to the visits to relieve the guilt.\n\nHow do I either cope with this guilt, or slow down the visits without crushing my mom? I feel so bad because she doesn't have a companion as my dad does.\n\nAD\n\nGuilted\n\nGuilted: Your mother doesn't have a companion, but if she did, would she miss you any less? I don't think so.\n\nIf you are an only child, your mother might have relied on you heavily for emotional support, starting in adolescence. But, if she is so emotionally reliant on you, why did she move so far away?\n\nShe is making choices. You do NOT get to feel guilty about her choices. It takes two people to initiate a guilt trip: your mother might book the tickets, but you don't have to pack your bags.\n\nAD\n\nReframing your own perceptions might help. Seeing her six times a year seems like nothing to her, but it is all the time to you. When she says how much she loves spending time with you, you feel the guilt ratchet up, while if a friend said this to you, you would welcome it.\n\nAD\n\nBecause this is so persistent and upsetting, you should see a therapist who could help you to work on your boundaries and coach you to tolerate a level of discomfort regarding the guilt you feel. Therapy would also help you to find the words to say to this person whom you really might love better from a greater distance. Talking with her about your own feelings (without shaming or blaming) will help to clear the air.\n\nDear Amy: I am a 57-year-old woman.\n\nI have a brother somewhere. Long ago my father was married briefly and had a son. They divorced, and to my knowledge he never saw the child again. (There was an ugly history involved in that arranged marriage.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI learned about this brother in my teens from my father. I have been respectful of my father's desire to leave it be.\n\nMy mother has been dead for years, and my elderly father has dementia.\n\nDo you think it would be acceptable for me to try to contact this brother, or has too much time gone by and it would serve no good? We share only DNA, after all. Maybe I'm just being foolish?\n\nA Page From History\n\nPage From History: Yes, I think you should attempt to locate your brother. You are obviously curious about him, and the search itself could help you to come to terms with aspects of your own life.\n\nIt is vital that you keep your expectations in check. DNA can be a powerful connector, but DNA does not determine a person's character or emotional health.\n\nDear Amy: Dismissed and Invisible has politely and patiently waited for people to stop interrupting or talking over her, to no avail.\n\nWhen I find myself in similar situations, I often say with great effectiveness, I'm sorry, I didn't realize I was done.\n\nKimberly\n\nKimberly: I love this phrasing. Thank you.
But derivative works and adaptations can't fully explain why Christie's work endures. A splendid biography by Laura Thompson, however, does. Agatha Christie: A Mysterious Life was published in Britain over a decade ago and took an inexplicable amount of time to cross the pond. Yet the timing is perfect because Thompson's thorough yet readable treatment of Christie's life, in combination with artful critical context on her work, arrives at the reason for her endurance:\n\nAs she would often do, Agatha has used the familiarity of the stereotype to subvert our expectations. It was one of the cleverest tricks she would play. It was, in fact, more than a trick: By such means she revealed her insight, her lightly worn understanding of human nature.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChristie, as Thompson details, came by such understanding through the traditional means of early hardship. Born Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller in 1890, her middle-class upbringing in Torquay was idyllic, with a fierce, close relationship with her mother, a woman determined to shield Agatha from a repeat of her own childhood hurts. Young Agatha was imaginative but practical, a skillful nurse during World War I who wished for a domestic life as a wife and mother — and got it, after marrying Archie Christie and giving birth to their only child, Rosalind.\n\nBut her imagination needed an outlet. Healthy competition with her older sister, who also published stories, spurred Christie to write the book eventually published as The Mysterious Affair at Styles (1920), the first of many outings for her iconic Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot.\n\nHe seemed to have emerged from the ether, as Christie liked to tell it, though her careful reading of earlier detective fiction greats — especially Émile Gaboriau's Monsieur Lecoq novels — was no doubt a contributing factor. The singular alchemy of careful plotting, ruthless character study and her absolute belief that each person had an immutable essence, usually unknown even to themselves was already in evidence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChristie's life and work collided in 1926. She had already published The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, the Poirot novel that still provokes vociferous reader debate, to modest success and critical acclaim. By December she was infamous, the subject of constant media scrutiny, after an 11-day disappearance that ended when she was discovered at a Harrogate spa.\n\nShe never discussed the underlying reasons for the vanishing. Thompson lays out a plausible theory of a fugue state, brought on by the crushing discovery that Archie was in love with someone else, exacerbated by terror and shame that essentially paralyzed Christie. The spell broke, she and Christie divorced, she married the archaeologist Max Mallowan and lived a merry life of travel and riches and hard work. But the key enigma, this mystery story, is, as Thompson notes, her finest, because it cannot be solved.\n\nAfterward, there was the public Agatha, whose Poirots, Miss Marples and other detective fictions reached readers at a near-annual clip. But the more private one had a creative outlet, too, under the pseudonym of Mary Westmacott. Thompson artfully demonstrates how Christie revealed in the Westmacott novels her pain about her collapsed first marriage, her difficult relationship with Rosalind and her overwhelming love for her mother.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChristie, in essence, was the Elena Ferrante of her day. She did not take public ownership of the pseudonym until the 1960s. While Agatha Christie could present herself as the clever, controlled, sensible woman who knew all about human emotion but who dealt with it, every time, and kept chaos at bay, Mary Westmacott was, by contrast, the sensitive, secret creature who had been born of the drifting ghost of Harrogate . . . who could never have existed without the strange freedom that came from using another woman's name.\n\nWhile Thompson makes a good case for reading the Westmacott romances, any Christie biography must ultimately be about the mystery novels that brought her such extraordinary commercial success. Thompson does not cheerlead when it isn't warranted — at least one of Christie's novels (The Burden) is deemed diffuse and barely structured — and she argues that Christie's zenith, in plot and in prose, was during and after World War II.\n\nThat this era of tremendous carnage, societal upheaval and polarization would be Christie's triumph is obvious in hindsight. Her novels are the epitome of order restored out of chaos. She, too, needed that catharsis, and she determined to provide it to her readers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this isn't the full explanation, or else why would we still be reading her work now? Surely, her brand of order cannot overcome all possible chaos caused by contemporary ills?\n\nAn insightful quotation by P.G. Wodehouse, in a 1969 letter to Christie, offers a further clue. I don't find it spoils an Agatha Christie a bit 'knowing the end,'  he wrote, because the characters are so interesting. As much as Christie's fame rests on her fiendish plotting, what girds their iron-cast base are the people who populate her stories. Poirot's little gray cells. Miss Marple's near-omniscient observations. The wants, needs, desires and grievances of incidental players and possible suspects.\n\nWhen one wants, one is capable of murder. That's what Agatha Christie knew. That's what she wrote about so well. That's why we still read her — and always will.\n\nSarah Weinman is the editor, most recently, of Women Crime Writers: Eight Suspense Novels of the 1940s & 50s and the author of The Real Lolita: The Kidnapping of Sally Horner and the Novel That Scandalized the World, to be published this fall.\n\nRead more:\n\nAgatha Christie\n\nA Mysterious Life\n\nBy Laura Thompson
Since he was nearly 3, when his little sister was born, Joe and Val have shared a personal partnership, with the two oldest siblings followed by two younger brothers, Jim and Frank. The entire family has been involved in his life, but particularly Valerie Biden Owens, who has been fundamental in building his political career and with whom he shares a deep bond.\n\nWhen he had a debilitating stutter, she helped him overcome it. When he ran for high school class president, she directed the effort. And she has run Biden's campaigns ever since — for county councilman, U.S. senator and his first two bids for president.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 2020 campaign was the first Biden operation not run by his sister, but Owens, 75, participated in every debate preparation and scrutinized all major ads before they were released.\n\nOwens has the same mannerisms and tells the same stories as Biden — even if he's sitting right next to her — but she has an added bit of irreverence. To me, she's almost the yin and yang in one person, said Margaret Aitken, who has worked on Biden's campaigns and in his Senate office. I describe her as an iron fist in a cashmere glove.\n\nAs Biden's circle rapidly expanded, Owens served as a conduit, often meeting with new staffers over spaghetti or other Italian dishes — back when that could be done.\n\nAD\n\nHer role is often to be the shaper of policy rather than the creator. She is particularly concerned with making sure a message translates to voters, weighing in if she feels advisers are making things too complicated.\n\nAD\n\nOwens was instrumental in one of the biggest changes Biden made during his campaign, when in 2019 he dropped his support for the Hyde Amendment, for the first time urging repeal of the federal law that sharply restricts the use of taxpayer money for abortion.\n\nBiden initially stuck to the position he had held for decades, according to a person familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. But Owens and several other high-ranking female staffers argued abortion rights faced an unprecedented threat, especially for low-income women and women of color who had gained access to health care through the Affordable Care Act. Biden ultimately agreed.\n\nAD\n\nOwens's career has been tied to Biden's political rise for 50 years: She has been paid by his campaigns, become a successful consultant in their home state, given speeches on his races and held top positions with a foundation and an institute connected with him.\n\nAD\n\nRon Klain, a top Biden adviser who is the incoming White House chief of staff, considers Owens's role to be unique in the Biden operation. What she brings to it is an ear for what she thinks is effective, Klain said. She's got a great gut and instinct with what connects with people. She's sharp as a whip and tough — as you expect from the only girl who grew up in a family of all brothers.\n\nAnd, he added, she's not afraid to tell her brother that he's wrong.\n\nAD\n\nBiden is equally lavish in his descriptions. Some people say she can finish my sentences. The truth is — and most of you would be too polite to say it — she has written the best of my sentences, he said in a 2010 speech. She has not only believed in me, she has helped me believe in myself.\n\nOwens was 27 when she ran her brother's first Senate race in 1972, a time when women were not prominent in politics. Toward the end of that campaign, the Evening Journal in Wilmington, Del., ran a column profiling the former University of Delaware homecoming queen — and dean's list honoree — in cringeworthy terms.\n\nShe told me about her tomboyish girlhood, and it was then that I whipped up a leer and said, 'It must have been fun playing touch football with you, especially for the other team,'  the columnist wrote. She has to be the best looking campaign manager in the country. He described her as chic and slender, with her brother's quasi-sharp features.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnly much later in the column did the writer note Owens oversaw a staff of 25 and a volunteer corps of 1,700. She set up coffees and wrote notes to potential supporters. The campaign could not afford a statewide mailing, so Owens invented what staffers called the Biden Post Office, where volunteers hand-delivered a weekly campaign newspaper.\n\nJoe and I tend to think along the same lines, she said at the time. Nine out of 10 times, we have the same intuitive reaction to things.\n\nOwens, who declined a request for an interview, was with Biden in Washington in December 1972 when they got a call saying Biden's wife and three children had been in a car accident.\n\nAD\n\nHis wife and infant daughter were killed, and Biden, who had been elected to the Senate but had not yet taken office, considered resigning to care for his two surviving boys. Several senators urged him to try balancing home and Senate for six months, and Biden did, commuting from Delaware.\n\nAD\n\nThat allowed his career to continue. What made it work was Valerie, said Kaufman, who often took the train home with Biden or, for a time, a car large enough to fit phone equipment so he was never out of reach. She moved in with the boys. He said, 'Okay, I've got it.' He saw how it could work.\n\nAnd it drew the siblings closer. Owens did the cooking, shopping, laundry, driving — the aunt becoming the mother.\n\nEverybody can point to a family tragedy, Beau Biden, who died of brain cancer in 2015, told the News Journal in 2010. One of two things happens. They either get closer together or they get torn apart. We were a pretty close family to begin with, and we got even closer. My aunt was a big part of that.\n\nAt the time, her own marriage was fraying, but she kept this painful experience from her brother. I made a big mistake. But your life was shattered, she told him later, according to an account in Biden's book, Promises to Keep. You were bleeding from every pore, and I was trying to shore you up, to be a happy face for you and the boys.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFollowing her divorce, she married Jack Owens, who had been Biden's best friend at law school in Syracuse. They have three children.\n\nBiden also has strong bonds with his two brothers, but they have been less of a visible presence in recent years and have brought unwelcome attention by testing the limits on using their brother's name to win private sector work.\n\nIt's a tremendous asset, Biden's youngest brother, Frank, told The Washington Post in a 2011 interview. I enjoy automatic acceptance or at least listening to what I have to say.\n\nBiden's brother James was the chief fundraiser on his first Senate campaign, but he has pursued a wide range of business interests and investments that intertwine with issues that touch on his brother's political interests.\n\nAD\n\nHe most recently has drawn scrutiny for a business venture in China with Biden's son Hunter, which Hunter has acknowledged is part of a federal tax investigation.\n\nAD\n\nOwens, too, has recognized that over the years she has benefited from her brother's connections and success.\n\nI had a better seat at the table because my brother was at the head, she told a group of students at the University of Delaware in 2017.\n\nA 2008 report from Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit watchdog, found Biden was among the top senators paying family members, with Owens and her daughter getting nearly $55,000 from his 2002 Senate campaign.\n\nFor nearly two decades, Owens served as executive vice president of Joe Slade White & Co., a political consulting and media firm, and she became a go-to adviser for political candidates in Delaware and around the country.\n\nIn recent years, Owens has served as vice chair of the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware and held a similar title with the Biden Foundation, which aims to advance causes embraced by Joe and Jill Biden. The foundation suspended its operations when Biden announced his presidential campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAs Biden deliberated for months over whether to run, Owens was in every meeting of the inner circle, either by phone or personally in the basement of the home he then rented in McLean, Va.\n\nShe was a forceful voice urging him to jump in the race — and, later, encouraging him when his campaign hit a dismal stretch after losses in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nVal's been there — beginning, middle and end; morning, noon and night, said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), who has known the Bidens for decades.
Also announcing her retirement, on their shared website, was Eaton's wife, Brianne Theisen-Eaton, who won a heptathlon bronze for Canada at Rio and is the reigning indoor pentathlon champion. The pair met while competing at Oregon and were married in 2013.\n\nNoting that it has been 10 years since his first experience in the decathlon, Eaton said, It's my time to depart from athletics; to do something new. Frankly there isn't much more I want to do in sport.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEaton has done more than most, considering that, at Rio, he became just the third decathlete ever to repeat as Olympic champion, joining fellow American Bob Mathias (1948, 1952) and Great Britain's Daley Thompson (1980, 1984). Since coming in second at the 2011 world championships in Daegu, South Korea, Eaton has triumphed in every major international competition, including two world championships and three indoor heptathlon championships.\n\nAt the 2015 outdoor championships in Beijing, Eaton set the mark at decathlon with 9,045 points, breaking the world record of 9,039 points he set at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore. Eaton is just the second man to surpass 9,000 points, joining Roman Sebrle of the Czech Republic, and the first to do it twice.\n\nEaton paid tribute to Sebrle on Wednesday as a childhood inspiration, recalling seeing the Czech champion on the cover of a newspaper with a suggestion that he would be Earth's representative in an Interstellar Olympics. A few years later, someone asked whether Eaton, an Oregon native, wanted to try the decathlon, and the result was a competitor that Trey Hardee, the 2011 world champion, described Wednesday as the GOAT [greatest of all time].\n\nI gave the most physically robust years of my life to the discovery and pursuit of my limits in this domain, Eaton said on his website. Did I reach them? Truthfully I'm not sure anyone really does. It seems like we tend to run out of time or will before we run out of potential. That makes humanity limitless then, as far as I'm concerned. And I think that's inspiring.\n\nAs the start of the 2017 season drew nearer, I felt more and more resistant to begin training, Theisen-Eaton said. I gave the last 4 years everything I could. I put my life on hold. Track and field was the priority before everything else: my family, my friends, my marriage, my future. This is something I chose to do and I don't regret it for a second. It made me happy to pursue something I was so passionate about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut I've done it. I went after what I set out to do and whether I achieved it or fell short is not the point. The point is that I know deep down that I gave it every ounce of energy I had and that if I went back and did it all over again, I would not change a thing; I could not have done anything better.\n\nIn the multi-events, where there are so many pitfalls, they have avoided those pitfalls, Harry Marra, the Eatons' longtime coach, who also officiated their wedding, told the Oregonian. But how long could they go on like that? At some point, something will bite you.\n\nHow many athletes have you seen who were the best in the world who hang on for the extra money or the notoriety, and they don't do it as well? Something goes haywire. Ash and Brianne can walk away now, satisfied they have done everything they can do to be the best they can be.
She continued: The same monster you all confronting me about is my father. I am well aware of who and what he is. I grew up in that house. My choice to not speak on him and what he does is for my peace of mind. My emotional state. And for MY healing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAndrea Lee, Joann Kelly's mother, participated in the Lifetime docuseries, in which she claimed the singer was abusive during their marriage.\n\nAfter decades of abuse allegations R. Kelly's accusers ask if his music will finally stop. (Whitney Leaming, Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)\n\nR. Kelly has been under a fresh round of scrutiny in the past week, following the airing of Surviving R. Kelly, which takes a sweeping look at allegations of sexual misconduct against the singer. Discussions sparked by the docuseries, one of the highest-rated programs for Lifetime in recent years, not only dominated social media but also prompted the Cook County district attorney to ask for witnesses or victims related to the claims to come forward.\n\nFamilies of two individuals have called Illinois prosecutors, and since a Tuesday news conference, more people have contacted the office, a spokesman confirmed. Separately, an attorney for Timothy and JonJelyn Savage, who claim their daughter has been brainwashed by Kelly, told The Post that the Fulton County District Attorney's office has asked to speak with his clients. (That office is not commenting on whether there's an investigation into Kelly.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe singer has long denied allegations of sexual encounters with minors and sexual assault. Steven Greenberg, an attorney for Kelly who did not return The Post's inquiries, told Good Morning America on Friday that although he hadn't watched the entire docuseries (he had seen snippets), the claims laid out in the episodes were untrue.\n\nWe know what happened, and we know those things didn't happen, Greenberg said. The man was not operating a harem, or a sex cult, or holding people hostage or anything like that.\n\nWhile much of what's described in Surviving R. Kelly isn't new information, its scope and timing has led to an ongoing public outcry, the likes of which Kelly hasn't experienced before. Celebrities have increasingly been denouncing him, including John Legend and Chance the Rapper, who appeared in the docuseries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe truth is any of us who ever ignored the R Kelly stories, or ever believed he was being setup/attacked by the system (as black men often are) were doing so at the detriment of black women and girls, Chance the Rapper subsequently tweeted. I apologize to all of his survivors for working with him and for taking this long to speak out.\n\nJada Pinkett Smith is devoting two episodes of her Facebook Watch show, Red Table Talk, to the allegations. She will interview accuser Lisa Van Allen on Friday's episode.\n\nSince the Lifetime series aired, Lady Gaga — who had been under pressure to denounce Kelly given her 2013 song with him, Do What U Want — issued a public apology this week for the collaboration and vowed to pull the song from streaming services.\n\nI stand behind these women 1000%, believe them, know they are suffering and in pain, and feel strongly that their voices should be heard and taken seriously, Lady Gaga wrote in a statement. I think it's clear how explicitly twisted my thinking was at the time of the song, adding: I'm sorry, both for my poor judgment when I was young and for not speaking out sooner.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe band Phoenix apologized Thursday for working with Kelly; they featured him on the remix of Trying to Be Cool and performed with him during their 2013 headlining set at Coachella.
It is not rude for your husband to want to change the channel, only to follow through.\n\nAs with the law, the rule should be weighted toward first possession. After that, polite negotiation should ensue.\n\nHowever, if all else fails, consider a second television. As with having separate bathrooms, Miss Manners has found that it can be worth its price in arguments. But she feels compelled to add, for the sake of your marriage, you would do well to also make time for actual conversation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDear Miss Manners: I am a single lady acquainted with a couple I adore. They introduced me to a single gentleman they've known for decades, and I accepted his invitations for several dates before I became concerned about his maturity, and even his mental health.\n\nThough I gently explained that I did not wish to continue our association, he requested reconsideration as a suitor so persistently that I had to block him from communications by phone and social media.\n\nHe, my friends and I all frequent a weekly community event. When I was standing in a circle with my friends and others, greatly enjoying the conversation, he approached, greeted each of us, and I responded in kind. Not wishing to share his company, I soon excused myself from the group to powder my nose.''\n\nAD\n\nUnfortunately, he asked in front of all, Oh, do I make you uncomfortable?'' I laughingly responded that my only discomfort was biological, and left the group.\n\nAD\n\nThis uncomfortable situation seems certain to repeat itself. I do not wish to engage in conversation that includes him, nor spend the evening in the powder room. I don't wish to appear rude to my friends (I did not inform them of his behavior), nor for them to feel badly for the introduction. He seems determined to confront me publicly, and one can only cite biological needs or admiration for the buffet so many times.\n\nYour instinct to spare your friends the details of what you find wrong with their friend is commendable. No good can come from forcing them to choose between you.\n\nAD\n\nBut if they are truly good friends, they should be able to understand — and probably have already surmised — that a romantic relationship has not grown between you and this gentleman. Miss Manners recommends that you tell them privately and without detail that you are afraid it did not work out, but that you do not wish to hurt his feelings any more by having to declare it publicly. Surely they will then find ways to help separate you in public — or be sympathetic if those tactics are clumsily thwarted by him.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice. You can send questions to Miss Manners at her website, missmanners.com.
The answer, I've discovered, depends on who you ask — and how you define the term.\n\nShame is the feeling you get when you've done something wrong, and you think you should have known better, said April Masini, a relationship expert and author who also runs an online relationship advice forum. It's derivative of guilt, and there is a place for it in parenting.\n\nAD\n\nOther experts, however, disagree.\n\nIn my experience, people use shame and guilt interchangeably, and I don't think that's correct, said Tanisha Ranger, a licensed psychologist at Insight to Action. Guilt is what we feel when we've done something wrong. … Shame, on the other hand, is a deep and pervasive feeling that something is wrong with us.\n\nLe Shepard, a therapist and mom of three who blogs at Mom*, agrees with Ranger. Guilt is actually a very healthy emotion and it is what helps develop empathy. Guilt says 'I did something bad,' while shame says, 'I am bad.' Shame creates a negative self-image instead of recognizing and feeling remorse for a negative action.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA shameful feeling\n\nSo if guilt is the more productive emotion, what do we do with shame? Some see it as a way to bring about change in a child's heart. If we are talking about shame as a harrowing feeling, brought on by an awareness of something said or done that was improper, mean or dishonorable, then it can be an impetus for change, said Tim Thayne, a marriage and family therapist and author of Not By Chance: How Parents Boost Their Teen's Success In and Out of Treatment.\n\nKaye Wilson, of ParentCoachOKC, also believes shame can be helpful in some circumstances. We've lost sight of the value of feeling appropriately ashamed of things we do to others out of selfishness or pride or just plain meanness, she said. There is an appropriate kind of shame, and I believe that this comes of parents overtly teaching that there is a right and a wrong way to behave.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOkay, maybe shame isn't all bad when it's an internal reaction, stemming from a child's knowledge that he hasn't behaved well. But what about when a parent, teacher or other authority figure imposes shame on a child? Does that harm the child's mental well-being?\n\nShame shouldn't be used as a way of inhibiting children from being who they truly are, added David Ezell, the clinical director of Darien Wellness. For example, I worked with an athletic dad who had a son who was not athletic. Dad shamed him with pejorative language and even punishment because the boy was not who Dad thought he 'should' be. The child suffered emotionally as a result, affecting his social relationships and grades.\n\nShame on you\n\nAD\n\nEven if we don't shame our kids on purpose, chances are, they will feel ashamed at some point because of something they did, or something someone said to them. When a child feels ashamed, it's important to not ignore that.\n\nAD\n\nExplore it. Ask them what they feel, and let them know it's okay to feel disappointed and uncomfortable — as long as they ask themselves why they feel that way, Masini said. Help them articulate these forms of expression, then ask what they can do differently next time, as well as what they can do now to make adjustments. It's important not to pretend the behavior that led to the shame didn't happen — and it's important to help children find roads to take so they can evolve and not get stuck in negative patterns.\n\nTeaching a child to own their mistakes isn't the same as making them believe they are a bad person for making those mistakes. In a difficult moment, we can teach our children that their mistakes don't taint them as an unloveable or bad person, Thayne said. What happened may be a mistake that they regret, but their worth and belonging are constants. He recommends that parents talk about what shame feels like and said that, in the right dosage, it's a motivator for making changes.\n\nAD\n\nBecause mistakes are part of being human, kids need to learn how to not let shame take root in their hearts. The guilt after a mistake helps with the development of a sense of right and wrong, but shame often makes people dig their heels into the bad behavior in an attempt to convince themselves that what they're doing is okay, or to give up on the idea that they could ever be 'good,' said Shephard.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, it's critical that parents don't use shame to make their kids feel stupid, dumb, or bad about themselves. I never believe instilling an identity of shame is healthy for a child, said Tim Elmore, president of Growing Leaders. I do, however, believe in speaking with a child about a past behavior and letting them know they are guilty of behavior that may hurt someone else. Then I would separate that behavior from their identity. In other words, say to the child: 'You are better than this.'\n\nWords, more than actions, can instill a sense of shame, so we should be careful with how we address misbehavior. When parents say 'you are …' instead of 'you did …' they may be using shame. … When we focus on actions, we're looking at guilt. When we act in ways that push our kids to identify as bad or broken, we're using shame to punish, said Shephard.\n\nAD\n\nI want to avoid heaping shame on my kids, and instead try to help them process the shame they feel as a result of their own wrongdoing in a way that's more positive than negative. And I'm trying hard to replace, You should be/feel ashamed with What you did was wrong. It's a small change, but one I think will benefit them in the future.\n\nAD\n\nSarah Hamaker is a parent coach who blogs about parenting at parentcoachnova.com.

Trump's video address Tuesday and his live remarks Wednesday were what we should have heard from him these past two months. Yes, there was the usual bravado and credit-grabbing, but those traits are accepted as part of who Trump is. The good wishes and prayers he extended in the past 48 hours to the new administration — granted, without mentioning Biden's name — were the tone that should have been set from shortly after the election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInstead, Trump's legacy will be that of further inciting an already angry mob of thousands gathered in Washington. Immediately following their president's call to action, they marched on the U.S. Capitol, with many of them breaching security to: break into offices, pose for pictures, create mayhem, destruction, death and occupy the halls of Congress — all while disrupting a constitutionally mandated ceremony being conducted by Trump's vice president.\n\nFormer vice president Mike Pence emerges from Trump's chaos in relatively good shape and well-positioned for the future. His loyalty to Trump through thick and thin should ultimately place him in good standing with most Trump supporters. Well, all but the kind who would stage an incursion of the Capitol. However, Pence's dedication to adhering to the Constitution following the election and, especially, in the wake of the Capitol riot made him welcome at Biden's inauguration and won him some grudging respect even from mainstream media commentators.\n\nAmong the many unfair ways Trump was treated through his presidency was untoward speculation about the state of his marriage. Whether first lady Melania Trump on occasion pulled her hand away from his as they walked together was a common subject of social media conjecture. On Wednesday, after Trump briefly addressed the press corps outside the White House, it looked from my TV angle that the first lady reached out and took the president's hand as they strolled to the helicopter. One doesn't see Trump as a man in need of comforting, but on Wednesday, Melania seemed to know that he did.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo his credit, Biden spent little time in his inaugural address chiding Trump supporters or dwelling on anyone's sins. He called for unity, as expected, and even gave a nod to everyone's right to voice dissent — perhaps a reference to the wrongness of social media silencing conservative voices. It was a good thing to say. Biden's address was commendable for its brevity and admirable for its focus on the future, not the past.\n\nBy contrast, at Joint Base Andrews a few hours earlier, Trump was, of course, looking back. He again rattled off what are legitimate successes, from his political viewpoint — unshackling free enterprise by rolling back regulations, making the border more secure, not engaging the United States in new wars, renegotiating numerous trade agreements, achieving historic Middle East accords, delivering a coronavirus vaccine in record time — and enjoying cheers and applause one last time as president.\n\nHe told the relatively small gathering assembled to see him off that neither he, nor they, should have regrets. They had left it all on the field, he said. No one will have to reflect, he said, and say, You know, if we only worked a little harder.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps not. What they might someday, somewhere, after the passage of enough years, find themselves doing is looking back and saying, You know, if we had only conceded the election …  But that chance is forever lost. Called on to rise to the moment after the November election — and given one final chance on Jan. 6 — Trump will forever be remembered for the choice he made, and tragically so.
The election season was full of jaw-dropping moments that eclipsed this confrontation. But Morain returns to it and offers a telling snapshot of Harris. He portrays her as a confident, seasoned public figure, whose success rests upon the intimate loyalties of others and whose candidacy could not avoid being symbolic. Witnessing those harrowing seconds, some flashed back to the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., while others saw the ubiquitous threat of 21st-century gun violence. Americans had no precedent for a scene in which harm might come to a woman of color — the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants — while she campaigned for the highest office in the land.\n\nFor readers eager to understand how Harris became someone who could hold her own on a national stage, Morain charts her route. His premise is that there was nothing predictable about the journey of a daughter of immigrants, a Howard University alum and a Hastings College of Law graduate from local prosecutor to vice president-elect. He stresses that it does no justice to Harris's story to label her a female Obama. Morain gives readers the public Harris on her own terms: a leader who rose to power in the crowded terrain of California politics. Though Berkeley was her girlhood home, Harris was not a politician who came up from the grass roots. Instead, beginning with her career as a prosecutor in Alameda County, home to Oakland, Harris committed herself to public service, working in the trenches of the justice system for those she termed the voiceless and vulnerable. It is a perspective that continues to frame her work to this day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut principles alone did not take Harris beyond the seedy courthouses of the East Bay. Her rise from local prosecutor to district attorney of San Francisco, attorney general of California, U.S. senator and finally vice president took three decades. Building relationships, Morain explains, was key. Early on, Harris was an intimate of her state's unrivaled Black power broker, lawmaker Willie Brown, who showed her California's political underbelly and its ropes. Along the way he boosted Harris's statewide visibility. Harris's sister, Maya, who headed the ACLU of Northern California, and her husband, Tony West, associate attorney general under President Barack Obama, have served as her steadfast confidants and strategists.\n\nIn 2007, Harris was a surrogate for Obama during his presidential run, and her star was rising. She jockeyed with Gavin Newsom as the two ascended in California politics; Newsom won the governorship, and Harris moved from attorney general to the Senate. She parlayed her roots in the Democratic stronghold of the Bay Area into alliances with East Coast figures such as Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) and the late Delaware attorney general Beau Biden.\n\nWhile some observers, including those on San Francisco's society pages, have focused on Harris's style, Morain, a former longtime reporter and editor for the Los Angeles Times and the Sacramento Bee, keeps the spotlight on her achievements. After becoming California's attorney general in 2011, Harris earned a voice on issues that had national resonance: the death penalty, marriage equality, gun control, the mortgage crisis, for-profit colleges, reproductive rights and human trafficking.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere, Morain is admiring of Harris and forgives her for the policy compromises that still attract criticism. In 2008, as San Francisco's district attorney, Harris aimed to curb truancy with a stick: prosecuting parents whose children failed to attend school. Though she had built her public career as a death penalty opponent, in 2014 Attorney General Harris fended off a constitutional challenge to California's death penalty. Morain explains that Kamala's way meant she balanced her principles against her political ambitions. She assessed matters through the lens of the larger public issue. In the case of prosecuting parents for their children's truancy, she sought to enforce a child's right to an education. On the death penalty, she sided with the need for a balance of powers that ensures that courts settle constitutional questions. But her approach still riles detractors who brand Harris a public official too steeped in a law-and-order model of justice.\n\nMorain relies on insights he gathered in his time covering California politics, bolstered by interviews with Harris's colleagues through the years, giving the book the feel of an insider's tale. But without access to the vice president-elect or her family, Morain cannot get to the inner Kamala Harris. Curiously, Kamala's Way provides little on how racism and sexism shaped Harris's path. In his effort to explain her character, Morain comes very close to trading in old, pernicious stereotypes about Black women, though perhaps unwittingly so. In his telling, Harris sometimes comes across as a Jezebel who callously exploited intimacies, even one with a married public figure; a Mammy who, though she had no children, readily mothered others; an angry Black woman wielding a sharp tongue and sharper wit; or an ambitiously talented professional who knew that to get ahead she had to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have, as Olivia Pope's father told her in the television show Scandal.\n\nWhile chronicling Harris's climb, Kamala's Way also has one eye trained on the present. It is, after all, a book that seeks to explain how Harris and America both got to this historic moment: the election of the first woman, first African American and first Asian American as vice president. It is likely that Harris's most intimate revelations will remain with her, at least until she pens her own memoir after leaving office. In the meantime, this story about how she ran the gantlet of American politics will leave readers admiring Harris for how she has not only survived but thrived.\n\nKamala's Way\n\nAn American Life\n\nBy Dan Morain
One of the items is a pledge to live a personal life of moral purity.\n\nAD\n\nI understand that the term 'marriage' has only one meaning; the uniting of one man and one woman in a single, exclusive covenant union as delineated in Scripture, the section says, saying that God intended sexual acts to occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other.\n\nAD\n\nMoral misconduct which violates the bona fide occupational qualifications for employees includes, but is not limited to, such behaviors as the following: heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female, sexual harassment, use or viewing of pornographic material or websites, and sexual abuse or improprieties toward minors as defined by Scripture and federal or state law.\n\nRobert W. Tuttle, a professor of law and religion at George Washington Law School, said that the school's language on sexuality was typical of conservative Christian institutions, and was not surprised by Pence's school choice, which he said was well within her rights.\n\nAD\n\nThey have staked out a certain set of positions on issues that are confrontational, he said of the Trump White House. The administration seems to live on wedges, so paying attention to this just feeds their interest in driving one more wedge. And this confirms their bona fides with religious conservatives and they sort of seem to do that, because Donald Trump, whatever he might say, is not that.\n\nThe passage was noted by HuffPost reporter Rebecca Klein on Twitter in the hours after Pence's new position was announced.\n\nAD\n\nThe application says that employees are subject to termination for the sexual immorality it described above. Another section asks prospective teachers to explain their view of the debate about creation and evolution.\n\nThe Pences have long been known for their religiously influenced brand of conservatism.\n\nAD\n\nKara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Pence, pointed out that the second lady had taught at the school for 12 years previously when Mike Pence was a member of Congress.\n\nIt's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack, Brooks said.\n\nShe did not answer a question about whether Karen Pence signed an application with the morality pledge as part of her employment. The school did not return a request for comment.\n\nIn a parent agreement the school hosts on its website, Immanuel Christian School notes that it has the right to refuse admission or kick out students if the activities of either the student or their parents or guardians go against the biblical lifestyle espoused by the school. This includes condoning sexual immorality, homosexual activity or bi-sexual activity, promoting such practices, or being unable to support the moral principles of the school.\n\nJoDee Winterhof, senior vice president for policy and political affairs at the Human Rights Campaign, questioned Karen Pence's choice of the institution in a statement given to HuffPost.\n\nThe Pences never seem to miss an opportunity to show their public service only extends to some, she wrote.\n\nRead more:
Dear Amy: I am a 40-year-old woman married to a 30-year-old man. He is sweet, intelligent, funny, passionate, hard-working and kind.\n\nWhen we were still dating, I became aware of his porn habit and interest in prostitutes. I've never had an issue with nudity or porn that wasn't abusive toward women. This is.\n\nI was shocked and disgusted.\n\nHe told me that he had used prostitutes in the past but promised that this was history.\n\nI couldn't figure out how my wonderful, loving, tender husband was the same guy who thought it was okay to purchase a woman like a thing and demean women when talking with his friends.\n\nI became insecure about my looks and age. I snooped a lot.\n\nWe both went into therapy, and two years later, we are better than ever.\n\nThen this week I learned that he has been engaging in live online pornography on a site that is filled with jokes about domestic violence, images of oppression and scenarios about murdering women.\n\nWe had a huge fight. I got drunk (I rarely drink), and I pushed him multiple times and kicked him.\n\nWe were both horrified by our behavior and are very contrite and apologetic.\n\nHe promised me that he won't participate in anymore websites that conflate sex and violence against women or that facilitate prostitution.\n\nOtherwise, our life together is so good, that I am trying to figure out how to be a feminist and accept that my husband isn't. He treats me with respect but views sexual images of women that are vile and demeaning.\n\nCan a man who is clearly aroused by prostitutes and casually enjoys jokes about killing b---hy and slutty women be educated about sexual politics and learn not to participate in rape culture?\n\nCan a woman who feels suspicious, angry and insecure learn to let go and just enjoy her otherwise wonderful marriage?\n\nBetwixt\n\nBetwixt: The way you present this, your husband treats you beautifully but you have witnessed his habit of using and degrading women he's not married to.\n\nThis is obviously the complete opposite of your stated core values. And so now you want to (somehow) educate him not to participate in rape culture.\n\nBut, why is it your job to teach your husband how not to degrade women? Shouldn't he know how not to degrade women?\n\nYour duty is to take care of yourself, and in some respects, you don't seem to have done a very good job.\n\nAsk yourself: How does being with your husband raise you up? Why in your mind does his decent treatment of you somehow balance his degrading treatment of others?\n\nYour determination to stay with someone you snoop on, rage at, physically abuse and whose values you deplore says much more about your low opinion of yourself than about him.\n\nYou two should double down on the counseling; I hope you mutually agree to part.\n\nDear Amy: I plan to retire in two years. The problem is that I have started getting emails, phone calls (both at work and on my cellphone), as well as at least two inches of junk mail.\n\nI have found this to be the biggest intrusion in my life in more than 60 years. I do not answer my phone anymore when I don't recognize the phone number, however, when they call me at work, I have to answer my phone.\n\nThe last call I got I asked them where they got my phone number from because I am on the Do Not Call Registry. They would not disclose where they had gotten my name.\n\nIs this something I have to put up with for two years?\n\nSo how do I get this to stop?\n\nFrustrated Future Retiree\n\nFrustrated Future Retiree: In researching your question, I found the information on the Federal Trade Commission's website quite comprehensive. Check Consumer.ftc.gov and do a search for unsolicited mail. You will be pointed toward all of the credit reporting agencies, the national Do Not Call Registry, as well as the Direct Marketing Association's Do not mail list: Dmachoice.org.\n\nDear Amy: Our office used to be burdened with birthday gift exchanges like Overextended's until a clever colleague proposed that we exchange birthday cards instead — homemade or store-bought. Everyone made an effort to find or create a card the recipient would enjoy. The result was even more festive than trinkets. Then the office supplied the cake.\n\nCR\n\nCR: I LOVE this idea.
Fred Tuttle for Senate: Why Not? Senate candidate Fred Tuttle doffs his hat in a field near his Tunbridge, Vt., home. (AP)\n\nBy Michael Colton\n\nWashington Post Staff Writer\n\nFriday, September 4, 1998; Page D1 BURLINGTON, Vt.—It would be tough to create an effective television advertisement for Fred Tuttle's U.S. Senate campaign, and not just because of his self-imposed spending cap of $16. Such an ad would have to begin with Fred, wearing his standard uniform of blue overalls, thick glasses and blue baseball cap emblazoned with his first name, nuzzling against a Jersey cow. (Fred, 79, may lack any relevant political experience and possess only a 10th-grade education, but he was a dairy farmer for decades.) In the commercial, he'd be leaning on a walker, since he just had his knees replaced. He's also weathered three heart attacks, four cataract operations, diabetes and prostate cancer. Maybe he could introduce himself, except that with his thick Vermont accent and the absence of several key teeth (lost in a bar fight years ago) his name sounds like Furry Turtle. Senate Candidate Fred Tuttle On . . . Washington: I hate Washington. Lot of crime. I liked the government buildings, but the city itself, oh, no. Too crowded, too everything. Look at all the traffic you go through.\n\nPresident Clinton's troubles: When I was young growing up I never heard of sex. Now you hear it all the time so I don't understand all this stuff really . . . He's a busy man, got a lot on his mind, so if he made some mistakes, you can't really blame him too bad, because we all make mistakes.\n\nHis voting record: Yeah, yeah, I voted for Clinton.\n\nHis voting record, after being reminded by his campaign director that he didn't vote in the last presidential election: No, no, I probably didn't vote.\n\nAbortion: If a woman's sick, and maybe something happens, then she should be able to get an abortion. But if she went out and got knocked up on purpose, then she shouldn't be able to.\n\nThe land-mine ban: I was in those land mines in World War II. . . . I saw a horse they led across the minefield once. It just blew that horse all to pieces. . . . I could go to France right now and I bet I could find mines where they still were.\n\nWhy people should vote for him: I don't know.\n\nWhy they should vote for him over incumbent Patrick Leahy: I hope they don't. Can I get out after the primaries? How do I do that? Then there'd have to be some sound bites. But what to choose from? Fred on fellow Republican Jack McMullen, his opponent in Tuesday's primary: He's a good, friendly man. I like him. Bought me a big bouquet of flowers. Fred on the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Patrick Leahy, whom he will face if he defeats McMullen: Patrick Leahy is a pretty smart man. He been down in Washington a long time, and he's done a lot for Vermont. Fred on the First Amendment: What's the First Amendment? And Fred's wife, Dottie, on Fred: I hope people have a little more sense than to think that Fred could do anything down in Washington. He doesn't know one thing about politics. He can't even get around the house – he expects me to wait on him hand and foot. It wouldn't be the most persuasive ad, even for a protest candidate who doesn't really want to be senator. But there's something about Fred. He's a movie star and Vermont icon. He's the focus of a publicity stunt for a satirical film, he's added a humorous jolt to Vermont politics, and along the way he's managed to become a symbol of old-fashioned values. In a culture in which irony has become the signature element of entertainment, Fred Tuttle personifies a new level of irony in politics: Vote for him because he's uniquely unqualified. No one will plausibly suggest that Fred could defeat Leahy in November and become Vermont's next senator. Voters here are not stupid. But ask around – organized opinion polls being prohibitively expensive – and people will tell you he has the edge in the primary on Tuesday, an open primary in which Democrats can cross over and vote on the Republican ticket, if they're so moved by a particular candidate – or moved against one. In a liberal state like Vermont, that can make a big difference. It's the most bizarre primary season I've ever seen in Vermont, says Peter Freyne, the political columnist for Seven Days, Burlington's alternative weekly. As Fred walks – hobbles is more accurate – around town, he's interrupted by well-wishers and autograph-seekers. Fred, you're so cute, girls tell him. His folksy charisma appeals to everyone, from elderly small-towners to dreadlocked stoners to drag queens. He's like the incoherent Grampa from The Simpsons, except people actually want to be near him. He's a doddering codger, a forgetful, helpless old man who happens to be having the time of his life and basking in his surprising stardom. How do you campaign against such a man? If you're Jack McMullen, Massachusetts management consultant, multimillionaire and recent Vermont transplant, first you challenge him, then you befriend him, then you play along with him, all the while trying to deflect criticism that you're a carpetbagger. You debate Fred, even though such an event can only produce surreal comedy. (Fred, do you think people should take you seriously in your bid to go to Washington? I suppose so. I think so, yeah.) And how do you campaign for him? If you're John O'Brien, campaign director, filmmaker, political gadfly (a Democrat, for Heaven's sake) and Fred's longtime neighbor – I jokingly say Fred's been like a father to me, a brother, a son and a significant other all in one – you have some fun and let Fred be Fred. I learned making the film that Fred can't memorize a compound sentence, so I don't even try, O'Brien says. In the debates, I just nod and give him a thumbs-up. And is Sen. Leahy getting nervous? I may have to start wearing a blue cap with 'Pat' on it, he says. Time of His Life Fred Tuttle and John O'Brien are Vermont's version of Scorsese and De Niro, each responsible for the other's success. Without one, there would not be the other. The two live on neighboring farms in remote Tunbridge, two miles apart, and often get together to play an old Vermont card game called 88. O'Brien is the physical antithesis of Fred – thin and fresh-faced, where Fred is compact and toughened. He cast Fred in his 1992 film, Vermont Is for Lovers, the first of his community cinema trilogy, in which his friends and neighbors play themselves in fictional stories. Fred proved so captivating that O'Brien gave him the title role in his 1996 epic, Man With a Plan. The film played briefly in Washington, among other cities, at the now-defunct Key Theatre, but it earned back most of its $100,000 budget through video sales in Vermont. Everyone in Vermont, it seems, has seen the movie, which is why Fred now rivals Ben, Jerry and the rock group Phish for the title of Vermont's Finest. In the gentle, folksy satire, Fred Tuttle, a dairy farmer in need of some cash flow, decides to run for Congress. His platform is summarized by FRED: Friendly, Renewable, Extraterrestrial, Dinky. He suggests launching our excess garbage into space. It was around the same time Ross Perot was running for president, so I thought, 'If this guy can be taken seriously, why not Fred Tuttle?'' says O'Brien over home-cooked miso soup at his Tunbridge spread. His 40 sheep bleat outside. Sort of like Ross Perot with no money. O'Brien, 35, grew up in a political family; his father was a Democratic state senator, and O'Brien remembers throwing snowballs at Ronald Reagan when Reagan visited the state in the 1970s. He is a justice of the peace, though the thought that he has the power to unite people in marriage makes him anxious. He once aspired to be a Vermont politician, but now he considers himself disillusioned with both parties – he voted for Ralph Nader in the last presidential election. Once the film came out, O'Brien noticed that Fred attracted a following. In elections, Vermonters gave Fred write-in votes for everything from president to state treasurer to bailiff. Through a Harvard connection, O'Brien nabbed a guest spot on Late Night With Conan O'Brien for Fred. (The two O'Briens reside next to each other in the 1985 Harvard yearbook.) Fred's wife didn't like the new attention. I really wish John hadn't gotten us into it, says Dottie Tuttle two years later. There is no privacy anymore. We even went to a funeral yesterday and he had to sign autographs. Those who've watched Fred's ascent from a distance might believe he's being taken advantage of. Not so, says O'Brien. People think any time a young guy like me is hanging out with an old guy like Fred, he must be manipulating him. Ask Fred if he's being used, and he replies, I'm enjoying myself. He likes getting kissed by random women on the street. It's the most exciting time of his life, next to the liberation of Paris when he was a soldier in World War II. Fred's Chance Once O'Brien had persuaded PBS to air Man With a Plan next month, he began thinking of ways to publicize the broadcast. A real political campaign seemed ideal: life imitating art imitating life, far more literally than any Wag the Dog scenario. And with McMullen in the race, a man whom many Vermonters perceive as an outsider trying to buy an election (he's personally lent his campaign $227,000, according to the Burlington Free Press), O'Brien could send a message. If this joke has a punch line, O'Brien says, it's on the Republican Party, for not cultivating young, qualified Vermonters. (For the record, Fred's $16 spending limit is not quite accurate, because most of O'Brien's expenditures are considered movie promotion, not campaign spending. Tomorrow the Tuttle farm will host Fredfest, a nickel-a-plate fund-raising dinner.) In July, O'Brien collected the 500 required signatures to qualify for candidacy, but the state Republican Party challenged them and found that signatures from unregistered voters had left Fred 23 short. O'Brien and Fred came back the next week with 2,300 signatures, and the campaign began – Fred spent the first few weeks in the hospital for knee surgery. McMullen, a slight man with a voice like a smooth-jazz deejay, visited Fred there. McMullen, 56, likes Fred, and during a debate Monday he displayed genuine affection toward him. Their debates, he says, are more like Vermont kitchen-table conversations. I still think it's a shame to take the core democratic process and make a joke out of it – and worse yet, use it for commercial purposes, he says. But even though it's an announced non-serious candidacy, I'm going to treat him as a fellow Republican candidate and we're going to have some fun together. Ruth Stokes, the executive director of the Vermont Republican Party, is in an awkward position, having to publicly back such an unlikely candidate because he might actually win. We welcome him aboard, she says. Still, her bias is obvious. I hope people won't treat this process as a joke. In his defense, Fred's supporters like to point to the kernels of truth embedded in his often rambling statements. They make him out to be a Forrest Gump, or a Chance, the slow-witted gardener played by Peter Sellers in Being There, whose simple pronouncements were mistaken for profundity. In the 1979 film, which influenced O'Brien when making Man With a Plan, Chance eventually becomes an adviser to the president. Fred is not mentally challenged like these characters – he's just a simple man, and what he has to say about Vermont life is valid. The dairy farms are disappearing; rich transplants are crowding out the poor. The communities of Fred's youth, in which neighbors looked after one another, are disappearing as Vermont gives itself over to Silicon Valley companies and Wal-Marts. Fred embodies a passing way of life, says Pamela Polston, the editor of Seven Days. But Fred is less of a simpleton savant than he is a parody of a politician. He wants to like everyone and be liked by everyone; he makes vapid promises and recites cliches; he has ideas but no suggestions on how to implement them. He is a Man With No Plan. Listen to his opening statement at Monday's debate against McMullen: I think Vermont needs a lot of changes. The farms are going and we need to do something to bring the farms back. Do something for education so poor people, it wouldn't have to cost quite so much money for the education. Highways are going and bridges are all falling in. If we get down to Washington maybe we can do something down there. I don't know what. With his frequent urges to do something, anything, Fred represents all the powerless would-be politicians who run on a vacant platform of change and empty rhetoric without offering specifics. After Fred debated McMullen, O'Brien remarked: They sound similar at times. Here's one guy, who's completely serious and who's done his research and says, 'I want some changes in Vermont,' whereas Fred – just off the top of his head – says, 'I want some changes.' Neither one's ever held public office, so looking at the record, you'd be like, 'These guys are both jokes.'' A vote for Fred, you see, is a vote against politics. McMullen does not believe enough Democrats will cross over Tuesday to make Fred a serious threat. The primary is the day after Labor Day, and you have to be a really mean-spirited, motivated person of the opposite party to ask for a ballot of the party of your nonbeliefs and file just to mess up the other guy. He acknowledges, though, that Fred, whose great-grandfather moved to Vermont in 1832, represents a tradition that he does not. McMullen's a flatlander, someone who's not originally from Vermont. He's owned a vacation home in Vermont for 15 years, but became a legal resident less than 15 months ago, renting an apartment in Burlington. He has degrees from Columbia and Harvard and sits on the boards of seven companies, but according to many Vermonters, what matters is not job experience, but Vermont experience. The issue is, Jack McMullen has to be beat on primary day to send a message to every other multimillionaire in New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts shopping around for a cheap Senate seat in the future, says Freyne. Before our candidates tell us how to live our lives in Vermont, we want them to live there for a while, says Leahy, who, McMullen points out, has lived in the Washington area for much of the past 24 years. The villain in Man With a Plan is a Rep. Blachly, an out-of-touch incumbent who's lived in McLean for 12 years. If people go out and rent the movie, they're going to think a lot more readily of Senator Leahy than they are of me, says McMullen. McMullen believes that Leahy, who hosted a reception for Fred when the movie screened for Congress (and can do a passable imitation of Fred's twangy Yankee patois), is partly responsible for Fred's campaign, in an attempt to meddle with the Republican primary. I can't prove it, but I strongly believe Pat Leahy is an active participant in this joke, he says. Leahy vehemently denies the allegation, and says he first heard of Fred's candidacy from Freyne's column, and that his chief of staff even advised O'Brien not to go through with it. If Fred Tuttle wins Tuesday, O'Brien plans to continue to spread Fred, as his bumper stickers say. We'll run a fun and informative campaign against Leahy, make him sweat a little, O'Brien says, naming campaign finance reform and voter turnout as two issues to address. Fred, though, has indicated that he might bow out of the race. Such a move would deny us a conclusion like the one in Man With a Plan, both fantastic and nightmarish: Fred, settling down to a picnic lunch at the Tidal Basin, quizzically perusing a copy of the U.S. budget. © Copyright 1998 The Washington Post Company\n\nBack to the top
The 48 men who have served as vice president of the United States constitute a monochromatic collection whose diversity could generously be defined as whether someone wore a bow tie or a regular tie, had a mustache or a beard, was balding or merely on the verge.\n\nAs the nation spent 2½ centuries growing increasingly multicultural, its leaders remained startlingly homogeneous, resembling a smaller and smaller slice of its population. When Kamala D. Harris raises her hand on the steps of the Capitol on Jan. 20, all that will change.\n\nThe Black daughter of a Jamaican father and Indian mother, alumna of Howard University and California-bred former prosecutor will walk into history as no one has before. She is, to her supporters, the long-awaited torchbearer for centuries of women, people of color, and others whose ambitions were denied and who never saw themselves reflected in the nation's leadership before — a woman who will break a ceiling that once seemed out of reach.\n\nBut what substance will emerge from the breakthrough is not yet clear, for absent a few issues, Harris has become better known for what she is against than specifics about where her passions lie.\n\n[Readers wrote to Kamala Harris on the eve of her inauguration]\n\nHad any number of former presidential candidates been named next-in-line by Joe Biden, they would have done so with their political canvas more filled in, the portrait more familiar. But Harris arrives as a work-in-progress, her time in Washington so short and so fluid that the paint has yet to dry.\n\nKamala Harris is at left in January 1970 with sister Maya and mother Shyamala Gopalan. Throughout her career, Harris has spoken of her mother's profound influence. (Kamala Harris campaign/AP)\n\nHarris, 56, has yet to offer any grand vision of what kind of vice president she hopes to be, although few vice presidents have by Inauguration Day. In her dozen or so appearances since the ticket declared victory, Harris has praised Biden, lauded his nominees, assured the American people that change is coming and outlined the urgent crises facing the country. Her social media feed, never exactly uninhibited, is now an even more carefully curated thread of lines from speeches and supportive platitudes. She has been a dutiful partner, making little news and no public waves.\n\nPeople familiar with her role in the transition say that loyalty is Harris's primary goal. Biden has also made clear in multiple interviews since the election that he wants to empower Harris to take the lead on certain issues when his plate is full. Harris, meanwhile, has avoided outlining any priorities for herself.\n\nThe most consistent through line of her political career has been a commitment to opening the doors of American leadership to more people like her.\n\nWhen she arrived in the Senate in 2017, Harris told her tiny team that she wanted her staff to look like California, according to two former Senate aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. As the only Black woman in the Senate, Harris has lifted women, particularly women of color, of historically Black colleges and universities, and others to senior staff positions. She did the same on her presidential campaign.\n\nHarris, shown in 2004, began her career as a prosecutor in the Bay Area.

(Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)\n\nAs the transition team assembled her vice-presidential staff, Harris was unapologetic about making sure people had a chance to serve, said Minyon Moore, who has managed Harris's transition. Moore said Harris cast a wide net in her search for staff members and asked key questions in dozens of Zoom interviews — including what she should be looking at as vice president.\n\nUltimately, she chose a chief of staff, communications director, press secretary, and head of policy who are all women of color.\n\nPeople familiar with the inner workings of the transition say Biden has been adamant about Harris being the last voice he hears on issues — to, as Moore put it, an exacting extent. She also said — while declining to share details — that while Harris did often agree with Biden about a candidate or issue, she has not been shy about speaking up when she doesn't.\n\nShe has got a different voice, a voice of gravitas, a complete and rounded voice, Moore said. She has not shied away from her voice and [Biden] has not shied away from her opinion.\n\nBut Harris is not expected to spend four years hovering politely in the background. As the partner to a 78-year-old president, she is the heir apparent in the Democratic Party — a party whose heir was so unapparent a little over a year ago that two dozen people ran in its presidential primary.\n\nYet even in that wide-open race, Harris found it hard to craft a unique brand. She began the primary as an on-paper favorite, drew one of its biggest crowds to her campaign launch in Oakland, Calif., then foundered so profoundly that she dropped out of the race before any votes were cast. She could not dislodge Biden as the voice of Democrats hunting for practicality and normalcy. She did not have the progressive track record to pry away loyalists to Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and she did not foster the newcomer zing of then-South Bend., Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nAlthough she climbed her way through the bruising world of California politics over the course of a decade, Harris did not emerge as a Washington presence until she arrived in the Senate in 2017. She spent little time there before contemplating a presidential campaign; by late 2018, she had written a memoir scheduled to publish right around the time Democrats, including her, would be starting to announce their candidacies for president.\n\nBy that point, she had made a national name for herself by channeling her prosecutorial background into pointed interrogations of some of President Trump's appointees, becoming one of the faces of the Trump resistance.\n\nHer questions in high-profile Senate hearings flustered attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions, stumped Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh and left another attorney general nominee, William P. Barr, stumbling for words.\n\nThat reality, which cost Harris an opportunity to fight for what mattered to her, has left her priorities far from clear.\n\nOn the surface, what Harris symbolizes to an increasingly diverse party has been obvious: She is a woman of color who tugged at a historic desire for representation, brought a lengthy résumé from the nation's most populous Democratic state, and has held her own against the Trump administration. To her supporters, she is a symbol for equity and empowerment for a party that has long sought both.\n\nBut, as her campaign strategists learned the hard way, Harris is not easily summed up in a pithy slogan. Her work in the criminal justice system, which had been beneficial during her rise in California, put her askance the social justice advocates gaining power in the national party. She has projected a political persona that is more practical than ideological in a party lurching to the left. The combination proved a tough sell in a field full of presidential candidates with firm ideological moorings, encyclopedic plans and résumés the length of dissertations.\n\nHarris, with fellow Democratic Sens.

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nEarly in the primary, the issue of health insurance emerged to define Harris's sometimes fluid positioning. Warren and Sanders supported Medicare-for-all and the resulting end of private health insurance — which aligned them with the more liberal wing of the party and showed a willingness to stiff-arm corporate America.\n\nOthers, like Biden and Buttigieg, argued for adding more government-run insurance options alongside existing private plans, a more incremental approach that signaled moderation.\n\nHarris, meanwhile, found herself stuck in between. She spent the early months of the primary race advocating Medicare-for-all as an early signatory of Sanders's landmark bill. But as the months went on, she seemed to tiptoe around the role of private insurance.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post in the back of a bus rolling through Iowa a few months before she dropped out of the primary race, Harris admitted she had always been uncomfortable with the idea of abolishing private insurance, despite endorsing a plan that did just that. She eventually drafted a plan of her own that would expand government-run plans while allowing private plans to continue for a longer period.\n\nOne of the problems with our politics is that it often demands 60-second sound bites or slogans to answer complex questions, Harris wrote in a post announcing her new plan.\n\nHer quest for nuance drew criticism from some Democrats but was in keeping with Harris's career-long approach.\n\nShe's pretty much a fundamentally pragmatic person . . . always asking about: 'What is the real impact this is going to have on people's lives?'  Jill Habig, who served as an adviser to Harris's attorney general's office and Senate campaign, said in a 2019 interview with The Post. But in terms of the methodology of how you get to that goal, she's not very ideological. Her approach is pretty much: 'What's going to be most effective? What's going to get us there?' \n\nHarris gives her first news conference as California's attorney general-elect in Los Angeles on Nov. 30, 2010.

(Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\nHarris began her career as a relatively liberal prosecutor in the Bay Area, one who launched a gutsy first bid for elective office against her former boss, a rough-and-tumble incumbent named Terence Hallinan, for the job of San Francisco district attorney. She won, taking a high-profile stand against capital punishment in the process.\n\nHer convictions were tested almost immediately when a man fatally shot a San Francisco police officer and many of the state's highest-profile officials pressured her to pursue the death penalty. At the officer's funeral, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) declared his death the special circumstance called for by the death penalty law. The crowd stood and cheered.\n\nHarris didn't budge. She was similarly steadfast in her support of same-sex marriage, as well as a far less popular anti-truancy policy as district attorney that she eventually implemented statewide.\n\nBut many racial justice activists felt Harris did not take advantage of her groundbreaking role as the first woman of color to serve as attorney general of California. They assert that when Harris had unprecedented power, she did not push hard enough to overhaul a criminal justice system long tougher on racial minorities.\n\nSome said they felt Harris was trying to have it both ways — pushing for change only when it was politically expedient. While she was a prosecutor, Harris opposed legalization of marijuana and argued for higher bail fees as a deterrent to crime in San Francisco. Harris is now a staunch opponent of cash bail, arguing that it penalizes the poor, and a prominent advocate of legalization, which has grown more politically popular since her prosecutor days.\n\nFormer California governor Jerry Brown (D), who also served as attorney general, sees Harris's California experience as a positive for her vice-presidential tenure, in that it exposed her to a variety of issues that she will probably have to confront in her new job.\n\nThe key point for me with Kamala is, she has wide experience. She's encountered a range of personalities and topics and that makes her very well prepared to assist the president, said Brown, who swore Harris in as San Francisco's district attorney.\n\nI think she is someone who could carry important responsibilities in a diverse and troubled world.\n\nHarris speaks to a Phoenix crowd in late October, days before the presidential election.

(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post)\n\nHarris will almost certainly be scrutinized more than most of the men who preceded her.\n\nShe carries the weight of being the first, the promise and peril of being different. She will be dodging the vitriol of those seeking to derail her future ambitions, while shouldering the expectations of those who hope for her to rise even higher.\n\nShe knows her shoulders have to be wide and strong because we're standing on her shoulders, Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said after Harris was named to the ticket. We're so proud of her. And she knows we can have her back. And she has quite a task in front of her.\n\nHarris goes out of her way to speak the names and ideas of those who came before her — not the generations of men who reached the vice presidency, but the generations of women who fought so someone like her could join them some day.\n\nHer biggest role model is her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, an Indian immigrant, civil rights activist and breast cancer researcher who raised two daughters mostly by herself. During her presidential campaign and in the months since she was added to the Democratic ticket, Harris has spoken of her mother as much as Trump or Biden or anyone else, most often to share a piece of advice Gopalan drilled into her as a child.\n\nIt was, as Harris has recited over and over, Gopalan's insistence that you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you're not the last. So much of the pressure on Harris now — to ensure that she stands out for substantive accomplishments that pave the way for others — is pressure she says she has felt before.\n\nIf she puts any pressure on herself, it is the pressure that she does not want to be the last, said Moore, one of the first Black women to break into the upper echelons of Democratic politics. You're always thinking about how you can make sure that door stays open to someone else. You don't want the doors to close behind you, because they would really never open if they do.\n\nHarris greets supporters at the Chase Center in Wilmington, Del., on the night of Nov. 7 in her first public appearance as vice president-elect.

This leaves very little for a person who has no political affiliation to talk to her about. It is also very tough to get her to go along with many of the coronavirus safety guidelines.\n\nAD\n\nShe also wants to relocate from a very nice area — and the community I have lived in all my life, because she feels the state government is too liberal.\n\nAD\n\nI am feeling pretty lost right now. Any suggestions would be appreciated.\n\n— Lost in California\n\nLost in California: Without judging your wife's intelligence or political opinions, it is obvious that you two are at a relationship impasse.\n\nWhen she talks about moving and leaving the state, is she really talking about leaving you? It undoubtedly feels that way to you.\n\nCouples on opposite ends of the political spectrum can have healthy relationships as long as each recognizes the other's point of view and tries to understand their rationale for their viewpoint. Have your wife's overall views toward the world changed, and if so, can she explain when this happened, and why?\n\nAD\n\nWithout offering knee-jerk and defensive reactions to one another, you — and she — might find a sliver of common ground upon which to rebuild. And then you both can revert to the age-old wisdom of picking your battles wisely.\n\nAD\n\nMarriage counseling could help you to communicate more effectively about your problems, including discussing the direction you each see your lives taking.\n\nHer reaction to the idea of meeting with a counselor would reveal the extent of her commitment to moving your marriage back toward the center of your lives.\n\nDear Amy: My close friend, Marcia is in her early-60s. She has been seeing Brad off and on for many years.\n\nUnfortunately, Brad has a violent temper. The two of them could be floating along in Loveland, and then he will lose it, push her, yell at her, slam out of the house — and she will be terrified.\n\nAD\n\nMonths or even a year will go by, and then they will get back together.\n\nBrad apologizes, Marcia rationalizes his behavior, and then she pretends he's the perfect man. Until he loses it again.\n\nAD\n\nAs her friend, if I express my concern, she ignores my comments and then slowly cuts herself off from me.\n\nShe is hypercritical of the men I date. She tells me I could do better. Should I just give up?\n\nI don't feel like this is a true friendship anymore. Advice?\n\n— Loyal, But Lost\n\nLost, But Lost: I wonder if you have ever described this pattern of your friendship's ups and downs to Marcia. It might inspire her to see more clearly how her relationship with Brad impacts the rest of her friendships.\n\nAD\n\nShe is criticizing the men you see because deflecting is the easiest way for her to cope with the impact of her choices. She withdraws because she has low self-esteem, she is embarrassed, and she cannot face you. Brad might also be pressuring her to isolate from you.\n\nWhen a loved-one is embroiled in an abusive relationship, the fallout is depressing, as well as exhausting.\n\nAD\n\nI hope you will see through her negative behavior, and simply try your very hardest to be compassionate, patient, and supportive. Urge her to see a counselor. The National Domestic Violence Hotline (thehotline.org) offers a number of helpful suggestions for ways to support someone in an abusive relationship.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: Concerned reported that her very close friend had recently suffered the loss of her own dear friend, a married man who Concerned suspected was more than just a friend.\n\nYou encouraged Concerned to dive in and try to figure out the nature of this relationship. Amy, it is none of her business!\n\n— Upset\n\nUpset: Concerned was genuinely worried about the extreme grief her friend was experiencing over this recent death. She reported that her friend seemed to want to talk about the nature of the relationship. Because of that, I encouraged Concerned to remain open and available to discuss it, without judgment.

Can I press my luck?\n\nDonna: Sure.\n\nMe: Why did you just pronounce it erb ? Why don't you pronounce the h?\n\nDonna: Never really thought about that.

My question is, would Glad® ClingWrap work just as well?\n\nAlex: I would imagine so. It would cling even better, more than likely.\n\nMe: Do you recommend that application?\n\nAlex: I can't officially recommend it because it is not a recommended use. But Glad® ClingWrap doesn't have any negative effect on the body.\n\nMe: Can I ask you a favor, Alex? Man to man?\n\nAlex: Sure.\n\nMe: My wife gets all feministy about this and says if she has to do it, I should have to do it, too.

Everybody lives differently in Colin Thubron's new novel, but they all burn to death in the same way. Night of Fire is a collection of stories about the tenants in an old apartment building that's consumed one evening while they sleep. Older or younger, loved or lonely, each of the victims initially ignores the pungent odor, awakens into smoldering confusion and then succumbs.\n\nIn that grim sense, Night of Fire may be the hottest novel of the year, but the real heat is generated by Thubron's gorgeous prose and his reflections on the persistence of memory. Long celebrated for his travel writing — Mirror to Damascus  appeared 50 years ago — Thubron offers the kind of luxuriant sentences and philosophical ruminations that would feel antique if he weren't so timelessly elegant. Having wandered the world, he presents a constellation of characters stuck in their rooms as the flames unmake them. Where, each story asks, does the substance of consciousness reside?\n\nLike hanging, the prospect of incineration concentrates the mind, but terror is only a fleeting element of this novel. Instead, the smoke induces reverie in these people before they die. A woman recalls the events that led to her career as a naturalist. A photographer considers the deceptions he perpetrated while dating. The oldest tenant relives a traumatic betrayal in grade school.\n\nTheir stories would seem to be entirely independent — the neighbors have barely acknowledged each other for years — but tantalizing echoes gradually emerge. Regret hangs heavy in all these rooms, along with memories of lost mothers, and most of these victims look to the stars as they contemplate the twinkling light of their faith. There's even a mystical twist when some later characters appear to have dreamed up earlier ones.\n\nIn the longest story, an unforgettable piece called Priest, an ascetic man living on the ground floor discovers an old photograph from his spiritually tumultuous seminary days. That picture draws the priest back to a trip he took with a few other divinity students to Mount Athos. It's a plot perfectly drawn to capitalize on Thubron's skills and past travels. The Greek mountains rise from the shimmering haze of memory as three young men catch sight of the mother monastery of Athos: less a building than a whole fortified settlement crossing the heights in battlements and turrets, dark with cypress trees. Ushered inside by Greek Orthodox monks, the students lapse into baffled wonderment and experience a level of intimacy they never felt in their British seminary.\n\nBut that closeness leads to a tragedy that has troubled the old priest for decades, clouding his faith and leaving him in the shadow of remorse. It's an extraordinary story about the stain of cowardice, a demonstration that what haunts us longest is often not our actions, but our failures to act, those gaping moments of moral timidity that admit no closure.\n\nAuthor Colin Thubron (Sally Soames)\n\nEqually powerful, though in a setting far removed from the priest's exotic travels, is the story of a neurosurgeon dreaming of his upcoming marriage. Inspired by watching a brain operation in a Welsh hospital, Thubron uses this doctor's work to concentrate on the theme that pulses through Night of Fire: He thought of the brain as he might of an unbreakable cipher, Thubron writes. In its memories it held the web of human identity. It was the incarnate self. But of course, that description — with its allusion to Christ — opens only to greater mystery. How can just a few pounds of matter, a labyrinth of electro-chemical activity, contain what seems transcendent and immaterial: our very selves, past and present?\n\nThe neurosurgeon's story revolves around the treatment of two patients suffering the effects of brain tumors: One is a woman desperate to retain her memories of a cherished affair; the other is a religious fanatic whose spirituality could be carved away by surgery. For the doctor, their cases present an unresolvable tension between pathology and identity. The hippocampus was totally sclerotic, the neurosurgeon thinks with faux self-confidence, and my business is to heal people, not preserve their fantasies. This is that rare tale that lures us into a metaphysical black hole: the nature of identity that eludes conclusion. When the surgeon's devout patient whispers, My brain is not me. I'm me, we feel his desperation and confusion. He's staring into the paradox that Emily Dickinson articulated:\n\nThe Brain is just the weight of God –\n\nFor – Heft them – Pound for Pound –\n\nAnd they will differ – if they do –\n\nAs Syllable from Sound –\n\nThat distinction between the physical world and the intangible realm of thought grows ever more mysterious as the apartment building and its residents are consumed by flames. In the final moments, the neurosurgeon recalls arguing that consciousness is merely an illusion that emerges only from the raw material of our speech and perceptions. But that explanation suggests a series of nested questions about who is perceiving that illusion of selfhood. Thubron inscribes that dilemma in his novel's subtly complex narration, which shifts without notice from third person to first, creating on the page a simulacrum of selfhood that we inhabit without notice.\n\nAppropriately, the final tenant we hear from is a retired teacher for whom travel became a compulsion, a subtle liberation. While staying in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in India, he once saw bodies consigned to funeral pyres and wondered, What survives death? A friendly monk leads him to an ancient understanding not so different from the neurosurgeon's up-to-date science.\n\nThubron's ability to span that geographical, cultural and philosophical range is just one remarkable element of this profound and exquisite novel.\n\nRon Charles is the editor of Book World.

Michael Birchenall, the editor and publisher of restaurant industry publication Foodservice Monthly and an advocate for the Washington dining scene, died Jan. 9 at a hospital in Fairfax County, Va. He was 68.\n\nMr. Birchenall, a resident of Bowie, Md., had developed liver failure and other complications as a result of a lung transplant he underwent following a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, said his wife, Acquaetta Williams.\n\nMr. Birchenall spent much of his early career in hotel and restaurant management and, while based in Columbus, Ohio, in the early 1990s, he created what the Columbus Dispatch called the best restaurant newsletter in town. Not long after, he settled in the Washington area, wrote restaurant and theater reviews for the Times Community Newspapers chain in Northern Virginia and worked for a publication run by the Restaurant Association Metropolitan Washington.\n\nMr. Birchenall, instantly recognizable in the local restaurant scene for his gray ponytail and the camera around his neck, founded Foodservice Monthly in 2002. The publication, which covers dining trends and legislative news affecting restaurant operators and their suppliers, became an influential voice in the restaurant industry throughout the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nFoodservice Monthly has a circulation of 20,000, including paid subscriptions and copies sent to restaurants, food vendors, hotels and other industry members. Soon after Mr. Birchenall started Foodservice Monthly, he sold it to Silver Communications but remained its driving force as editor and publisher.\n\nMichael Birchenall (Courtesy Foodservice Monthly)\n\nWilliams said Mr. Birchenall enjoyed making connections with chefs, farmers and wine makers, as well as mentoring many in the food and media industries. He was a frequent participant in food industry roundtables and competitions in which he served as a judge. Mr. Birchenall also served on the board of the Atlantic Seaboard Wine Association, which promotes East Coast wines and wineries.\n\nMichael Birchenall was born in New York City's Bronx borough on May 17, 1948, and grew up in Macon, Ga. He graduated from Georgia State University in 1972 with a major in English but took a job in the hotel industry out of college to support his young daughter. He continued his career in food and beverage management, at one point taking the helm at Christophers restaurant in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWilliams said Mr. Birchenall eventually burned out on working in hotels and restaurants and seized the opportunity to begin writing. Foodservice Monthly was his ultimate passion project: Longtime friend and colleague Linda Roth, a hospitality industry publicist, said she was working with Mr. Birchenall on the February issue of the magazine while he was hospitalized just days before he died. Lisa Silber, Foodservice Monthly's sales manager, called the publication his legacy.\n\nHis marriages to Beryl Thomas and Carolyn Hirzel ended in divorce. Besides Williams, his wife of 20 years, survivors include a daughter from his first marriage, Sasha Birchenall of Asheville, N.C.; two sons from his second marriage, Neill Birchenall of Sheffield, England, and Eric Birchenall of Berkhamsted, England; two sisters; a brother; nine grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.
Al Jarreau, a Grammy Award-winning singer whose versatile tenor voice and vibrant stage style blurred the lines between jazz, soul and pop music, died Feb. 12 at a Los Angeles hospital. He was 76.\n\nHis publicist, Joe Gordon, announced the death, saying the singer had been treated for exhaustion, after announcing his retirement from touring last week. The cause of death was not immediately known.\n\nMr. Jarreau was loosely classified as a jazz singer, but his eclectic style was entirely his own, polished through years of obscure apprenticeship in lonely nightclubs. He did not release his first album until 1975, when he was 35, but within two years, he had won the first of his seven Grammy Awards and had begun to attract a wide following.\n\nHe was dubbed the acrobat of scat for the way he adopted the fast, wordless syllables of bebop jazz musicians, but he did not limit himself to the musical backdrop of an earlier generation. His approach emphasized the percussion-heavy and electronically amplified sound of rhythm-and-blues and funk music, and he had a particular gift for mimicking almost any kind of musical instrument or sound.\n\nJarreau imitates the electronic and percussive hardware of the 1970s, critic Robert Palmer wrote in Rolling Stone in 1979. But he does more than that. He stands there and makes it all sound natural, singing so sweetly and unaffectedly you'd think he just happened on this remarkable vocal vocabulary.\n\nAl Jarreau in 2010. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)\n\nAfter winning awards and plaudits as a jazz singer, Mr. Jarreau found a wider audience with his 1981 album Breakin' Away, which sold more than 1 million copies and included a Top 20 hit, We're in This Love Together. The album won Grammy Awards in the jazz and pop vocal categories, propelling Mr. Jarreau to widespread stardom.\n\nHe was soon appearing on television, touring with a 10-piece band and taking the stage with dramatic lighting and choreographed dance moves. He seemed poised for a popular breakthrough that never quite arrived. Despite his Grammy Awards and growing acclaim, Mr. Jarreau groused that Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder and Al Green sold more records, even though they — in the view of many, including Mr. Jarreau — could not match his vocal chops.\n\nAs the 1980s wore on, Mr. Jarreau explored rock, reggae and international music and recorded the theme song for the TV series Moonlighting. His 1992 album Heaven and Earth won a Grammy for best R&B vocal performance, giving Mr. Jarreau Grammys in three categories.\n\nHe branched out into other fields, performing with symphony orchestras and acting on Broadway in 1996 in the role of Teen Angel in Grease.\n\nAs time went on, Mr. Jarreau returned to his early inspiration in straight-ahead jazz. He recorded an album of jazz standards in 2004 called Accentuate the Positive, which included songs by Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington and Johnny Mercer and was considered a triumphant return to form.\n\nIt's really the first jazz record I've ever done, Mr. Jarreau told Billboard magazine. Everything else that came before was pop and R&B. This is a thanks to the kind of music that made me the person I am today.\n\nAlwyn Lopez Jarreau was born March 12, 1940, in Milwaukee. His father, originally from New Orleans, was a former Seventh-day Adventist preacher, and his mother was a piano teacher. Mr. Jarreau sang gospel in church and doo-wop on street corners, absorbing the many musical styles of his melting-pot home town.\n\nAl Jarreau. (Stacy-Ann Ellis/For The Washington Post)\n\nHe had listened from an early age to Nat King Cole, Billy Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald, but his two greatest influences were jazz scat artist Jon Hendricks and the smooth ballad singer Johnny Mathis.\n\nA lot of who I am is described in the qualities of those two guys — the fiery jazz singer and the balladeer — and how they performed, he said in 2005. Somewhere in there, too, is an R&B guy who went to Motown University.\n\nAn excellent athlete, Mr. Jarreau tried out with the Milwaukee Braves baseball team and played basketball at Wisconsin's Ripon College, from which he graduated in 1962. He sang in dance bands in college and graduate school and, in 1964, received a master's degree in vocational rehabilitation from the University of Iowa.\n\nAfter moving to San Francisco, Mr. Jarreau worked by day as a counselor for the disabled and sang in jazz clubs at night, quitting his counseling job in 1968 to devote himself to music. Working with a Brazilian guitarist, he learned to fill empty musical spaces with expressive improvisations. He devised inventive versions of songs by Joni Mitchell and the Beatles, wrote original tunes and seemed at home in any musical style.\n\nIn 2007, he won two more Grammys for a recording made with guitarist George Benson, Givin' It Up. Mr. Jarreau remained in demand in recording studios and on concert stages around the world into his 70s. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2001, hosted a public television program on jazz singing and established a scholarship fund at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee for students interested in becoming teachers.\n\nHis marriage to Phyllis Hall ended in divorce.\n\nSurvivors include his wife of 39 years, Susan Player, and a son from his second marriage.\n\nNever one to stay in one physical or musical place for long, Mr. Jarreau described his constantly evolving approach to music to the Chicago Tribune in 1989.\n\nJazz, whatever we think its purest form is, is a dynamic and changing form, he said. It will never be the jazz of the 1930s and '40s and '50s, because it's changing and responding to its environment. That environment includes the influences of Michael Jackson, Sting and hip-hop just as much as Charlie Parker or bebop.
Manville plays Joan, and Neeson her husband Tom, in a moving story that is bookended by two Christmases, taking us through 12 months of medical tests, surgeries, therapeutic treatments and their side effects, and the aftermath. (Ordinary Love is not for anyone who, like Tom, hates hospitals. Interestingly, the film — which was shot in Belfast, where the United Kingdom's National Health Service provides most services free — never mentions cost once.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut this is no medical drama.\n\nAs much focus as the film devotes to clinical procedures, even more of it is directed at relationships. In addition to Tom and Joan's marriage, which has the warm if slightly itchy feel of a pair of well-worn wool socks, the film also looks at Joan's friendship with a fellow cancer patient (David Wilmot), who used to teach their late daughter.\n\nThat loss — mentioned only obliquely and without specifics — informs Tom and Joan's unusually close bond, as well as offering the opportunity for a slightly contrived scene in which Tom delivers a monologue at his dead daughter's gravesite, while his wife is having tests at the hospital. To be fair, Tom does acknowledge the absurdity of talking to a bit of stone, as he puts it. And the speech, in which he confesses his own vulnerability, only takes place at Joan's insistence (it's the anniversary of their daughter's birthday).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOtherwise, the screenplay by Irish playwright Owen McCafferty (Quietly) is a lovely, understated thing.\n\nIt does include some heavy conversations, freighted by Tom and Joan's reciprocal fears and insecurities, and we see the toll these stresses take on them in an ugly argument that flares late in the film. Frankly, the fight is necessary from a storytelling standpoint, adding critical texture to a tale that might otherwise be all about the unstinting devotion of a selfless spouse.\n\nBut true to its title, Ordinary Love's true subject is the mundane, not the melodramatic.\n\nMuch of the film centers on quotidian routine: meals; shopping for groceries; the daily walks that Tom and Joan take; their bickering about traffic and Tom's annoying habits; and, when she gets sick, the domestic adjustments made to accommodate painkillers, nausea and, inevitably, far more major sacrifices.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDespite the serious subject matter, Ordinary Love might sound, by one measure, slight. As Humphrey Bogart observed in Casablanca, It doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. But that film was set against the tumultuous backdrop of World War II, and this one, well, is more concerned with how many Brussels sprouts to buy.\n\nThe point being: Even when questions of life and death loom large, someone still has to make dinner. That observation doesn't make Ordinary Love a major motion picture event. But it does, in its own quiet, wise way, nudge it just a little bit closer to the extraordinary.
Dulos, 52, is accused of killing his estranged wife, whose disappearance in spring 2019 set off a statewide search and shocked the affluent community where she lived.\n\nPattis initially told media that Dulos was dead by suicide, but the lawyer retracted that statement and clarified that Dulos had a weak pulse and was being taken to a hospital. At a Tuesday afternoon news conference, Farmington Police Lt. Tim McKenzie told reporters that police went to Dulos's house for a welfare check shortly before noon, after he was late for a court appearance. When officers arrived, McKenzie said, they looked through a window and saw Dulos inside a vehicle in his garage with obvious signs of medical distress. First responders performed CPR in the home's driveway.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcKenzie said Dulos was in critical condition and being treated for carbon monoxide poisoning at UConn Health but declined to comment further on his medical status. He said it was way too early to confirm that his condition was the result of a suicide attempt. Dulos was later flown to Jacobi Medical Center in New York, according to WFSB-TV. The facility offers hyperbaric oxygen treatment, which can be used in cases of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nThis is a shocking and truly sad day, Pattis told the Connecticut Post. My heart goes out to his children and his family. It's just a horrible day.\n\nConnecticut State Police announced this month that Dulos had been arrested and charged with various counts, including murder, felony murder and kidnapping, in the disappearance of Jennifer Dulos, a mother of five who went missing after dropping her children off at school on a May morning last year. Fotis Dulos has denied involvement in her disappearance, and her body has not been found.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe five children, who ranged in age from 8 to 13 when Jennifer Dulos disappeared, have been staying with their maternal grandmother in New York City, the Associated Press reported.\n\nPattis has previously said the arrest warrants for Fotis Dulos revealed a shocking lack of confidence by the state and suggested Jennifer Dulos may still be alive. He did not return an email requesting comment Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWe categorically deny that Mr. Dulos had any involvement in the disappearance of his wife, Jennifer. And we defy the state to prove that she is in fact dead, Pattis told reporters earlier this month. If this is all the state's got, we wonder why it bothered.\n\nAD\n\nWFSB-TV reported that Dulos was placed under house arrest after his most recent appearance in court Thursday. Numerous local outlets reported Tuesday that Dulos was due back in court for a hearing about his $6 million bond.\n\nAD\n\nDulos's former girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, and a local lawyer who represented him in civil cases, Kent Mawhinney, were also charged with conspiracy to commit murder. The arrests were indicative of a new chapter in the closely watched case, which drew national attention after Jennifer Dulos vanished from New Canaan, a town 45 miles north of New York City that ranks among the wealthiest in the country and seldom experiences violent crime.\n\nThe 50-year-old's disappearance on May 24 sent state and federal law enforcement scouring the region, aided by drones, helicopters and cadaver dogs in an operation that continued for months. Her car was discovered by police shortly after her disappearance, though she was not inside.\n\nAD\n\nIn arrest warrants made public earlier this month, police alleged that Fotis Dulos killed his wife in her garage between 8:05 a.m. and 10:25 a.m. on May 24, then tried to clean up the scene with paper towels and other supplies from the house.\n\nAD\n\nCellphone data and a chain of surveillance footage collected by investigators showed that Dulos and Troconis acted together to cover up the alleged killing, driving to Hartford later that evening to dump black plastic bags filled with evidence in trash cans, according to the warrants. The evidence included a bloodstained sponge, plastic zip ties and what appeared to be cut clothing and undergarments with a blood-like substance, police said.\n\nJennifer Dulos's marriage had disintegrated years before she went missing, and the couple were slogging through a bitter divorce. By summer 2017, things had become so bad that she feared her husband would harm her or her children, she told a judge at the time.\n\nI am afraid for my safety, she said in a sworn affidavit from June 2017 obtained by Fox 61. Dulos alleged that her husband had exhibited irrational, unsafe, bullying, threatening and controlling behavior.\n\nFotis Dulos's bond hearing was rescheduled to Wednesday afternoon, the Connecticut Post reported.\n\nDerek Hawkins, Kayla Epstein and Alex Horton contributed to this report.
We are still a paper nation.\n\nDespite technological advances, we continue to use a lot of paper. And a lot of it is stuffed in closets, file cabinets and shopping bags. And, for some of us, stacked on our floors.\n\nSince Jan. 8, I've been encouraging people to participate in my #NoDebtNoMess Color of Money Challenge. It started with assessing the mess in your home and in your finances. The second week dealt with reducing redundancy, such as paying off and then closing credit card accounts you don't need.\n\nThis week, we are focusing on lightening your load. For me, this means addressing the paper load I'm carrying. I have pay stubs from decades ago. I keep receipts and instruction manuals for items I no longer own. This paper has got to go.\n\n[To clean up your financial life, first assess the mess.]\n\nBut to be sure I keep what I truly need, I asked some professionals for advice on what documents should be retained.\n\nLet's start with tax records. Brent Neiser, a certified financial planner and a senior director at the National Endowment for Financial Education, offered these guidelines:\n\n● Keep tax records up to seven years after the return is filed.\n\n● If you fail to file in any year, or if the IRS has found you filed something fraudulent, you'd better save your records indefinitely.\n\n● Keep business, real estate and investment purchase records until seven years after you've sold the asset and included the sale in a tax return.\n\n● Keep your tax returns indefinitely. A return is a window into you and your family's economic history, Neiser said. It shows the big employment, investment, charitable, spending choices and decisions you made.\n\nMaintaining years of tax returns can help if you ever need to research payments made into Social Security, said Michael Eisenberg, a Los Angeles-based certified public accountant and member of the financial literacy commission for the American Institute of CPAs.\n\n[To cut down on clutter, cut up some of those credit cards.]\n\nSave receipts for big-ticket items such as a TV or computer for insurance purposes. Hold on to each receipt as long as you own the item.\n\nDon Grant, a CFP from Wichita, gave this advice regarding credit card statements: It's nice to see a monthly itemization, but most credit card companies will provide you with a year-end statement that has all expenses categorized. It you're happy with that, shred [the monthly statements] at the end of the year.\n\nWhen it comes to home improvement documents, Kelley Long, a Chicago-based CPA and CFP, says hold on to them at least until you sell.\n\nIf you sell your home for more than $250,000 ($500,000 for married people) more than you originally paid, you will have a taxable gain, Long said. You can add the cost of any improvements to the original amount you paid to reduce the amount of the gain.\n\nOn medical bills, she said: If you paid a medical expense with your health savings or flexible spending account, you need to keep the receipt for three years. Consider it a tax-related document.\n\nAs for investment and real estate records, there's some gray area here, said Long, who is part of AICPA's consumer advocacy group. But any investment statements that are available online do not need to also be kept as paper. The most important reason to maintain these records would be to establish your cost basis when selling to make sure you claim the proper capital gain or loss on your tax return.\n\nThere are what Long referred to as forever documents, which you should keep in a safe location where they are protected from damage, loss and theft. Such documents, which may be hard or costly to replace, include:\n\n● Birth certificates and adoption papers\n\n● Marriage license and divorce documents\n\n● Wills\n\n● Death certificates\n\n● Military records\n\n● End-of-year pay stubs\n\n● Mortgage, student and car-loan payoff statements. If you negotiated to pay less on a debt you owed, keep the document proving you paid off that loan.\n\nThe NEFE has a noncommercial financial education site where you can find more information about record keeping. Go to smartaboutmoney.org and search for How Long Should You Keep Financial Documents.\n\nAll the experts recommended scanning documents to reduce your paper load.\n\nI have instructed all of my clients to search for a place in the cloud that they feel comfortable storing all of these documents in a password-protected vault, said Brad Ledwith, a CFP from Silicon Valley. If they secure storage of files in the cloud, then the questions of how long to keep things are moot.\n\nNow that I know, I'm ready to let go.\n\nWrite Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or singletarym@washpost.com.

If you haven't finished the Shonda Rhimes-produced series, you might want to put a bookmark here and come back after you've seen the big reveal. (Seriously, spoiler alert.)\n\nYou do not know me, and rest assured you never shall, Lady Whistledown, voiced by an especially saucy Julie Andrews, tells her readers in the show's first episode. To her credit, the elusive scribe does an impressive job at covering her tracks.\n\nAD\n\nBut the show, adapted from the Bridgerton book series by Julia Quinn, ultimately reveals Lady Whistledown's identity far sooner than its source material. It's Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan), the bookish and most self-aware daughter in Grosvenor Square's most ridiculed household.\n\nAD\n\nCreator Chris Van Dusen told Oprah magazine that the unveiling sets up future seasons in a really interesting way. (The show has yet to officially be renewed for a second season, but this is Shondaland we're talking about!) Even before the reveal, the show drops plenty of hints about its narrator. We couldn't help but wonder — to quote another famed gossip columnist-turned-narrator — if the clues really added up.\n\nLet's take a look at the biggest hints.\n\nShe's not a fan of the Ton's traditions.\n\nThe time has come to place our bets on the upcoming social season, Lady Whistledown tells us at the start of the premiere episode. Her words are intentional here, of course, because the annual marriage market is pure (and brutal) sport. The first image to drive this home is Lady Featherington (Polly Walker) ordering her staff to tighten one of her daughter's corsets to extremes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYes, before we even meet the titular Bridgerton family — which Whistledown describes as noted for its bounty of perfectly handsome sons and perfectly beautiful daughters — we get a ferocious breakdown of the Featherington household: three misses foisted upon the marriage market like sorrowful sows by their tasteless, tactless mama.\n\nThis is our first hint that Whistledown is Featherington-adjacent. Another narrator would have presumably started with Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor), the incomparable who gets Queen Charlotte's (Golda Rosheuvel) kiss of approval after the Featherington sisters fail to make a favorable impression.\n\nThough Whistledown calls Daphne a diamond of the first water, it is here that our cynical narrator reminds us that the brighter a lady shines, the faster she may burn. And things heat up rather quickly thanks to the arrival of Marina Thompson (Ruby Barker), a cousin of the Featheringtons, whose beauty finds suitors lining up at the Featheringtons' door.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs we see the marriage market unfold in all its patriarchal glory, Whistledown tells us that the titled, chaste and innocent daughters of the Ton have been preparing for marriage since birth. That's certainly true for Daphne. But we know of at least two daughters who would like to postpone the tradition for as long as possible: Daphne's sister, Eloise (Claudia Jessie) — and her BFF Penelope.\n\nEloise is granted one more year to enjoy her childhood, but Penelope's request to continue her studies is flatly denied by Lady Featherington, who cautions that reading could confuse her thoughts.\n\nBy the end of the first episode, Whistledown reports on Daphne's budding relationship with Simon (Regé-Jean Page), the Duke of Hastings. As Bridgerton shows the couple dancing, we see Penelope taking in what Whistledown deems the biggest coup of the season.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow the young miss secured her suitor is yet to be determined, but if anyone should reveal the circumstances of this match, it is I, yours truly, Whistledown promises.\n\nShe knows the Ton's best-kept secret.\n\nPerhaps the biggest giveaway that Penelope is Lady Whistledown arrives in the sixth episode, when Marina's scandalous pregnancy — which predates her arrival in Grosvenor Square — is revealed to the aristocracy.\n\nOnly a few people know that Marina is with child, and we can assume the anti-reading Lady Featherington isn't the one churning out the gossip sheets. Penelope, on the other hand, has earned her cousin's trust, and thus, knowledge of her scandal. Pen also has reason to expose it, as Marina attempts to beguile Eloise's brother, Colin (Luke Newton), into marrying her — without disclosing the pregnancy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou can choose anyone but him. He is my friend, Pen tells Marina. I've known him forever. And I do not want him to be tricked and deceived into a lifelong commitment.\n\nMarina seals her fate when she pursues Colin anyway. We can practically see the steam coming out of Pen's ears as she watches her cousin charm Colin. By the next episode, Colin announces his intention to marry Marina, leaving Penelope heartbroken.\n\nDespite her resentment, Pen tells Marina she would never bring scandal upon her or their family. But her opinion seems to change after Pen overhears her sisters share an insensitive laugh about how oblivious Colin is to Marina's condition.\n\nAD\n\nPen tries in vain to change Colin's mind. When she discovers that he and Marina are planning to have a quickie marriage in Scotland, it's the last straw. The series cuts to Eloise consoling a distraught Penelope as Lady Whistledown lets the bombshell rip: The bond between man and bride is private, sacred, she writes. But I must tell you, I have learned that a grave fraud is afoot.\n\nAD\n\nIt's possible that Penelope told someone else about Marina's secret, but that someone would most likely be Eloise. It seems unlikely that Eloise, entrusted by the queen to investigate Lady Whistledown's identity, would have publicly revealed information that would be so harmful to her brother and family.\n\nShe didn't (gasp!) write anything about the queen's luncheon.\n\nLady Whistledown only writes what she sees, the wise Lady Danbury tells Lady Bridgerton in the premiere. And we see that play out in Episode 7 as the Featheringtons are frozen out of high-society events, including the queen's luncheon.\n\nAD\n\nBefore the Featheringtons are turned away, Eloise and Penelope have a brief exchange. Lady Whistledown has gone too far this time, Eloise tells Penelope about their entangled family drama. Pen smiles faintly and says, And I thought you her greatest admirer.\n\nAD\n\nA few scenes later, the queen is disheartened to learn that Whistledown wrote not one word about her event. Eloise concludes Whistledown must be a tradesperson — someone who has access to the members of the Ton but isn't part of high society herself.\n\nEloise smartly zeros in on Madame Delacroix (Kathryn Drysdale), the square's sought-after modiste. Delacroix briefly looks like a viable suspect. In addition to her flubbed pedigree (she pretends to be French), her business affords her access to the very people Whistledown writes about in her column. But it turns out to be a red herring. In the eighth and final episode, we learn that the modiste was, rather scandalously, with Eloise's older brother, Benedict Bridgerton (Luke Thompson), when Whistledown was en route to the printing press.\n\nAD\n\nAs Eloise realizes Madame Delacroix couldn't possibly be Whistledown, the real deal is revealed: Penelope, a.k.a. Lady Whistledown, in her carriage on the way to the press. Perhaps I may come forward one day, she says in voice-over, though you must know, dear reader, that decision shall be left entirely up to me.\n\nAD\n\nOverall, the clues make sense. Penelope has a backstory befitting a high-society gossip columnist — after all, her nickname is literally Pen. We had one lingering qualm after finishing the season — Whistledown initially distributes her gossip sheet for free, which the Bridgertons found incredible. Given the Featherington family patriarch's gambling problem, we marveled at the notion that Pen would be able to continue to issue her in-demand columns for free. As several dear readers have pointed out, however, this author missed a clear reference to Lady Whistledown eventually charging for her gossip sheet. It's in Episode 4: Eloise, in conversation with Pen, calls Whistledown a brilliant woman of business who fools the entire ton, whilst pocketing their money. Forgive us for thinking Whistledown wouldn't monetize her talents.\n\nThis post has been updated.
Experts say Trump's claims are 'divorced from reality.' His comment Friday was at least the second time he has mentioned taped-up women since The Post initially published this story on Jan. 17, bringing the total number of statements on taped-up women to at least 10 times in 22 days.\n\nAD\n\nORIGINAL STORY:\n\nPresident Trump has a new favorite anecdote, one that fixates on tape.\n\nSpecifically, in public remarks at the White House, at the border and at farming conventions, the president has been talking about tape on the mouths of migrant women. On at least eight occasions over a period of 12 days this month, the president has argued publicly for his proposed wall on the southern border by claiming without evidence that traffickers tie up and silence women with tape before illegally driving them through the desert from Mexico to the United States in the backs of cars and windowless vans.\n\nAD\n\nIn Trump's telling, the adhesive is sometimes blue tape. Other times it is electrical tape or duct tape.\n\nAD\n\nIn some instances, the descriptions are more salacious and graphic. Human trafficking — grabbing women, in particular — and children, but women — taping them up, wrapping tape around their mouths so they can't shout or scream, tying up their hands behind their back and even their legs and putting them in a back seat of a car or a van — three, four, five, six, seven at a time, the president said in the Cabinet Room on Jan. 11. (A timeline of the president's taped-women remarks appears below.)\n\nWith an eerie specificity, Trump has characterized these acts as commonplace.\n\nYet human-trafficking experts and advocates for immigrant women have said they are perplexed by this increasingly repeated story in Trump's repertoire — and are at a loss for where he got his information. It was not from them, they say; in fact, they have no idea what he is talking about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI think his statements are completely divorced from reality, said Ashley Huebner, associate director of legal services at the National Immigrant Justice Center. That's not a fact pattern that we see.\n\nIn interviews with The Washington Post this week, nine aid workers and academics who have worked on the border or have knowledge of trafficking there said the president's tape anecdote did not mirror what they have seen or heard. A separate story reported in the Toronto Star cited several additional experts who said Trump's lurid narrative — migrant women bound, gagged and driven across the border — does not align with their known reality.\n\nI have no idea the roots of it, said Edna Yang, assistant executive director of American Gateways, a Texas-based immigration legal services and advocacy nonprofit. I haven't seen a case like that.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI've never had that, said Anne Chandler, executive director of the Houston office of the Tahirih Justice Center, who said she has been dealing with human trafficking for 20 years and recently met with people in Tijuana, traveling with a migrant caravan.\n\nHis representation of how traffickers get their victims into the country just isn't what we're seeing, said Evangeline Chan, director of the Immigration Law Project at Safe Horizon, a leading victim assistance organization. It is very, very different.\n\nI'm not really sure where his information is coming from, said Leah Chavla, a policy adviser with the Women's Refugee Commission, who has made nearly 15 trips to the border since 2017 and has worked with Latin American migrants.\n\nAD\n\nNo prominent news reports have detailed a case that matches the president's description.\n\nAD\n\nSince Trump took office two years ago, he has made more than 7,645 false or misleading claims, according to The Post's Fact Checker database, more than 1,000 of which were about immigration.\n\nBut those who spoke with The Post did not rule out the possibility that there are female trafficking victims near the border who have been bound or gagged. They were also careful to make clear that they could not speak for what others, such as law enforcement officials, may have told the president.\n\nCould it happen? Sure, it could, Yang said.\n\nBut the women she has represented have never talked about being tied up with tape, she said, noting that a border wall would not have saved them from traffickers.\n\nAD\n\nIt's clear that he just doesn't have an understanding of what happens at the border, Yang said. I think that all President Trump is doing is pushing a wall. A wall is not going to stop individuals fleeing to the United States when home conditions are terrible. He's just trying different tactics to get what he wants.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on the origins of the president's talking point. Questions sent to the national and state public affairs offices for U.S. Customs and Border Protection were not answered, perhaps because of the government shutdown.\n\nAD\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol agents, also did not respond to multiple inquiries about whether any of its members had witnessed a scenario matching the president's description.\n\nAD\n\nTop officials from the union met with Trump at the White House on Jan. 3 to discuss border security; the president began using the taped-mouths anecdote the following day.\n\nMigrant women do face great dangers while traveling to the U.S. border through Mexico. Some are fleeing domestic violence, forced marriage, sexual exploitation or sex trafficking in their home countries. One Amnesty International estimate claimed 60 percent of migrant women and girls are raped on their journey. Experts say women and girls take birth control before traveling north, in anticipation of the sexual violence they may encounter.\n\nAD\n\nWhen women, children and men are trafficked into the country, experts say it does not happen — at least not regularly — in the way Trump has been describing it over the past two weeks. Often, the migrants are willingly led on foot to illegally cross the border or legally enter with a visa at a port with the promise of a job when they arrive.\n\nAD\n\nWe have had individuals lured through recruiters and smugglers, not realizing that the job that waits for them is trafficking, said Chandler of the Tahirih Justice Center. On the journey, at the U.S.-Mexico border, they are completely unaware that they're walking into a trafficking situation.\n\nIt is possible that migrant women have been bound and gagged at stash houses on either side of the border, locations where people are taken and held for ransom and at times sexually exploited, said Elaine Carey, a dean at Purdue University Northwest who has studied trafficking at the border.\n\nAD\n\nThe introduction of the taped women in Trump's description of border-crossing situations coincides with a shift in tone by his administration on the need for border wall funding, a request that Congress has refused to grant. The impasse has led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nTrump appears to have introduced the anecdote on Jan. 4 while speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden, after a meeting with congressional leadership on border security. That was also around the time the president began describing the situation at the border as a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIn the Rose Garden, Trump said he told meeting attendees that one of the things that happens there is human traffickers — maybe that's the worst of all — where you'll have traffickers having three and four women with tape on their mouths and tied up, sitting in the back of a van or a car.\n\nAD\n\nTrafficking experts theorized that the president may have taken this description from a private conversation he had with a Border Patrol agent.\n\nThe day before the anecdote's Rose Garden debut, Trump made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room and said the people in our country want the wall. (A Washington Post-ABC News poll recently found that 42 percent of Americans support the wall and 54 percent oppose it.) Trump was flanked that day by National Border Patrol Council officials who championed his demand.\n\nTimeline: Evolution of the tape anecdote\n\nJan. 4, Washington | Remarks in Rose Garden after meeting with congressional leadership on border security\n\nOne of the things that happens there is human traffickers — maybe that's the worst of all — where you'll have traffickers having three and four women with tape on their mouths and tied up, sitting in the back of a van or a car, and they'll drive that van or the car not through a port of entry, where we have very talented people that look for every little morsel of drugs, or even people, or whatever they're looking for. Not going to go there. They get off the road and they drive out into the desert, and they come on, they make a left turn. Usually it's a left, not a right.\n\nJan. 6, Washington | Remarks on South Lawn before Marine One departure\n\nHuman trafficking — where they grab women, put tape over their mouth, come through our border, and sell them. …\n\n . . . But if you look at the human trafficking, they come in, they nab women, they grab them, they put tape over their mouth, they tie their hands, and they take them to another country, and they go right over that border.\n\nJan. 9, Washington | Signing ceremony in Oval Office for Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act\n\nWe're talking about, in many cases, women and children grabbed, thrown into the back seat of a car, or thrown into a van with no windows, with no — any form of air. Tape put across their mouths. And they're brought across the border. And they don't go through checkpoints; they go through the emptiest spot they can find, with no walls, with no fences.\n\nJan. 10, McAllen, Tex. | Roundtable on border security\n\nAnd where there's no fencing or walls of any kind, they just make a left into the United States, and they come in and they have women tied up. They have tape over their mouths — electrical tape. Usually blue tape, as they call it. It's powerful stuff. Not good.\n\nJan. 11, Washington | Roundtable in Cabinet Room on border security\n\nThe Internet has made things, in many ways, better, and, in many ways, much worse. But human trafficking — grabbing women, in particular — and children, but women — taping them up, wrapping tape around their mouths so they can't shout or scream, tying up their hands behind their back and even their legs and putting them in a back seat of a car or a van — three, four, five, six, seven at a time.\n\nJan. 12, Fox News | Interview on Justice with Judge Jeanine\n\nMany of our crimes, much of MS-13, comes through the border, drugs — a big proportion of the drugs from that we have from this country, in this country, come through the border. The human trafficking where they tie women up, they put duct tape over their mouths, electrical tape, and they bring them in. They traffic in women and children, and they come through the border.\n\nJan. 14, Washington | Remarks on the South Lawn before Marine One departure\n\nWe're talking about border security. Who could be against it? We're talking about drugs pouring in — human traffickers tying up women, putting tape on their mouth, and pouring into our country. We can't have that. We can't have that.\n\nJan. 14, New Orleans | American Farm Bureau Federation 100th annual convention\n\nThey target young children — the Internet. And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped — their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape. They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the back seat of cars and vans, and they go — they don't come in through your port of entry because you'd see them. You couldn't do that.\n\nJan. 24, Washington | Meeting on U.S. Reciprocal Trade Act\n\nWe have to have the wall. You'd stop drugs. You'd stop human trafficking. I mean, human trafficking — where they tie up women and they put duct tape on their mouths, and they put them in the backseat of a car or in a van....\n\n... I mean, you have hundreds of miles of open space, and they go out there, and they're loaded up with drugs or they have women in the backseat of the cars with duct tape all over the place. It's a disgrace.\n\nJan. 25, Washington | Remarks from Rose Garden on temporary end to partial government shutdown\n\nWomen are tied up, they're bound, duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases they can't even breathe. They're put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks...\n\n... They can't come through the port, because if they come through the port, people will see four women sitting in a van with tape around their face and around their mouth. Can't have that.
During a recent argument, my brother-in-law yelled obscenities at my sister and spit in her face twice because she was trying to ignore his ranting. He has also pulled her hair and pushed her.\n\nShe tries to stay calm and ignore him, which makes him angrier. She tries to keep the peace because of her two older teenagers who live at home.\n\nAD\n\nI am afraid that someone will be injured, arrested or even killed.\n\nI am also upset that her children have grown up witnessing this. Both kids have anger issues.\n\nAD\n\nShould our family talk to my brother-in-law? He can be a fun, nice guy.\n\nWe talked to my sister about getting professional help, but this has been going on for years.\n\nShe is funny, extremely well liked and very attractive. I believe he is jealous of her. How can we help?\n\n— Worried Sibling\n\nWorried Sibling: Your family should advocate for your sister and the children by urging her to get help immediately and to leave this marriage safely. This situation is violent. Witnessing this has affected the kids. Your family should do everything possible to protect them.\n\nAD\n\nI read your letter to Cory Ryan, [former] executive director of Connections for Abused Women and Their Children in Chicago. She responds, This is very alarming. It is a dangerous situation. It is important that this woman get help from people who will not judge her.\n\nAD\n\nChildren who grow up in violent homes suffer trauma; there is a risk that they will become violent.\n\nConcerned friends or family members could call the National Domestic Violence Hotline for advice on how to address this and learn of local resources. This woman needs to have a safety plan and legal advocacy.\n\nCall the hotline at 800-799-SAFE, or visit thehotline.org.\n\nSeptember 2010\n\nDear Amy: You regularly condone and even encourage sex without the benefit of marriage.\n\nAD\n\nI wonder if you have ever considered how many of society's problems can be traced back to this. Please consider for a moment what the world would be like if sex occurred only inside of marriage.\n\nThe number of unwanted pregnancies would be decimated. Abortion would be eliminated. Few, if any, children would grow up in a single-parent home. Imagine what would happen to the welfare system! What if almost everyone grew up in stable, two-parent homes? It boggles the mind, doesn't it?\n\nAD\n\n— K\n\nK: Getting married does not prevent children from growing up in single-parent homes. People have been marrying and dissolving their marriages for a long time.\n\nMany two-parent homes are unstable, and some stable families are led by two parents who, until recently, couldn't legally marry.\n\nAD\n\nConsenting adults can and will have sex regardless of what you (or I) say. It's not my business, and as long as it doesn't injure or harm anyone, involve the kids or break up another relationship or family, it shouldn't be your business, either.\n\nMarch 2010\n\nDear Amy: I am a 32-year-old single woman with many married friends. Recently, I went to a concert with some couples, and also a married man who didn't bring his wife.\n\nIn the back seat of a car on the way home, he tried to kiss me. I pulled away. The next day when he sent me an email saying he had a good time, I didn't respond.\n\nAD\n\nI saw him with his family at a recent dinner party. He said that he wanted to have coffee sometime and that he'd like to get to know me better. I was polite and hoped nothing would come of it, but he recently emailed me and asked to get a drink.\n\nAD\n\nHe is a nice person. I don't want to assume he wants to have an affair. How do I respond?\n\n— Troubled Single\n\nTroubled Single: You say he's a nice person, but nice (and married) men don't try to force kisses on disinterested women in the back seats of cars, and nice men don't do end runs around their wives and kids at a dinner party.\n\nIn those old movies I love, this guy would be called a prize heel.\n\nAugust 2010
She made the announcement during an interview on ABC's Good Morning America and in a video that her campaign posted online.\n\nThe future of our country depends on you and millions of others lifting our voices to fight for our American values, she said in the video. That's why I'm running for president of the United States.\n\nAD\n\nHarris plans a more formal campaign launch in Oakland, Calif., on Sunday, when she will give a speech outlining her candidacy.\n\nAD\n\nAs she weighed whether to enter the race, Harris spoke about the challenges of running a campaign that would attempt to break several barriers. If elected, she would be the first woman, the first person of Asian heritage and the first African American woman as president.\n\nYet on Monday, Harris's message was largely one of unity. During a news conference at Howard University hours after her announcement, she said the core issue of her campaign is the people, as opposed to any of the vast array of issues that other Democratic candidates say drew them to run.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) entered the 2020 presidential race with a campaign video announcement on Jan. 21. (Kamala Harris)\n\nNobody is living their life through the lens of one issue. I think what people want is, they want leadership that sees them through the complexity of each of our lives and pays equal attention to their needs, Harris said. Let's not put people in a box. And as they make their decisions, let's make sure we give them credit for being smarter than that.\n\nHarris's announcement drew on history, coming on a day commemorating the legacy of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., a timing that she said was very important to her. Her campaign noted that Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to run for president in a major party, launched her campaign 47 years ago this week.\n\nAD\n\nAmid that context, however, Harris played down the role of race on Monday.\n\nAD\n\nWhen people wake up in the middle of the night — whether it be a mom in Compton or a mom in Kentucky — she's waking up having the same concerns, Harris said, about how she's going to be able to raise those babies, how she's going to be able to pay the rent at the end of the month, how she's going to be able to retire with dignity.\n\nWhen a reporter asked how she would describe her identity, Harris replied: I describe myself as a proud American.\n\nHarris is relatively unknown nationally — a CNN survey in September found that 51 percent of registered voters had not heard of her — and has recently tried to introduce herself through the requisite campaign book The Truths We Hold, released Jan. 8. In the Senate she has earned a reputation for sharp questioning and a skeptical approach to Trump administration officials. On the Senate Judiciary Committee, she has been one of the body's more pointed interrogators, particularly during high-profile moments such as the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring a tense exchange with then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions over Trump campaign contacts with Russia, Sessions stopped her.\n\nI'm not able to be rushed this fast, he said. It makes me nervous.\n\nHarris's rich mixture of heritage has led some supporters to refer to her as the female Barack Obama. The former Democratic president also launched his presidential campaign two years after joining the Senate.\n\nAs a child, Harris attended a Hindu temple and a black Baptist church. Her first name (which she pronounces comma-la) comes from the Sanskrit word for lotus plant.\n\nHarris's late mother immigrated to the United States from India as an adult and became a physician specializing in breast cancer. Her Jamaican father became an economics professor at Stanford University. They divorced when Harris was young, and her mother raised her and her younger sister, Maya.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHarris attended Howard University in Washington and the University of California Hastings College of the Law. She then set out on a career as a prosecutor.\n\nWhen she ran in 2003 and unseated her onetime boss, San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan, she became the first black woman to be elected district attorney in California. When she was elected attorney general of California in 2010, she became the state's first female, the first African American and first Asian American to hold the position.\n\nHer tenure as attorney general was marked by efforts to protect consumers and fight sexual trafficking. But she also came under fire for tough stances against felons whose guilt fell under question.\n\nAD\n\nSome of that tenure is bound to come under scrutiny during her presidential campaign, but she nonetheless is expected to highlight her career as a prosecutor. The campaign slogan in her announcement video is For the People, which campaign advisers said was a nod to her rising in court to say, Kamala Harris, for the people.\n\nAD\n\nIn her first remarks after announcing her presidential campaign, Harris described the criminal justice system as horribly flawed and in need of change. Yet, she said, all communities also support law enforcement.\n\nThere is a lot of work to do, but to suggest it's one or the other, I don't buy that, she said.\n\nIn 2014, she married Doug Emhoff, a media, entertainment and intellectual property partner, with two children from his earlier marriage.\n\nAD\n\nHarris's Senate colleagues Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) have announced presidential bids. Among those expected to join the race are Democratic Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) Also pondering a run is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\nIn the weeks before the November elections, Harris made trips to Iowa and South Carolina, both early-voting states. She is positioned to do well in her home state, which has moved its primary from June to March 2020, as well as neighboring Nevada.\n\nAD\n\nHarris has faced controversy: One of her senior advisers, Larry Wallace, resigned in December amid questions about a $400,000 lawsuit that was settled in 2017. The suit resulted from allegations that he sexually harassed a female assistant when they worked for Harris at the California Department of Justice.\n\nAD\n\nAmong several allegations in a lawsuit cited by the Sacramento Bee, Wallace placed a printer underneath his desk and forced his female assistant to replace ink or paper in it every day, even when she asked to move it to another location to avoid crawling under his desk in dresses or skirts.\n\nHarris has played a prominent role as Washington confronted the #MeToo movement, and was among the first senators to call on Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to resign last year amid allegations of misconduct.
Our interests were different, said Ziegler, 62. But we were always good friends, and family was a big part of our lives. Like a lot of other couples, we'd just grown apart.\n\nIn February 2018, though, she and Henrichs learned they were a match in a different way.\n\nAD\n\nHenrichs's kidneys were failing, and he was in need of a transplant. After nearly 40 family members and friends were tested as possible donors, only one person turned out to be a perfect match: Ziegler.\n\nAD\n\nThere was never any question in Ziegler's mind about whether she'd do it.\n\nI just immediately knew that it was going to happen, she said. Bill and I grew up together, we had two children together. And I knew that my children and grandchildren needed their father and grandfather in their lives.\n\nSo on Oct. 16, more than four decades after they said I do, she and Henrichs, 62, were wheeled into an operating room at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and one of Ziegler's healthy kidneys was removed and given to her ex-husband. The transplant went smoothly, with Ziegler going home after three days and Henrichs after two weeks of tests and observation.\n\nThe surgery went well, and the [new kidney] transplant is functioning well and continuing to improve as Mr. Henrichs recovers from the surgery, said Andrew Bentall, a transplant nephrologist at the Mayo Clinic and one of Henrichs's doctors.\n\nThe donation from Ziegler is important, said Bentall, because it allows Henrichs to avoid going through months or years of dialysis treatments while waiting for a kidney, a process that takes a toll on the body.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHenrichs said he was beyond grateful for his ex-wife's compassion and generosity, but he also worried in the hours before the surgery. What if something happens to you? he told Ziegler. What if something happens to me?\n\nMary told me, 'If something happens, that's the way it's supposed to be,'  Henrichs recalled. We talked about it for a bit, and she made me feel better. And of course I said, 'Thank you.' What she did is incredible. I'm still overcome when I wake up in the night and think about it.\n\nHenrichs and Ziegler were 14 when they met in a school activity bus in ninth grade after singing at a nursing home for extra credit in social studies.\n\nAD\n\nThe bus was super-crowded, Ziegler recalled. And I ended up sitting on Bill's lap.\n\nAfter that, the pair attended a few dances together and became involved in what was then Future Farmers of America in their small town of Princeton, Minn. We became good friends and got along really well, Henrichs said. After we graduated [from high school], it seemed only natural to get married.\n\nBill played the bass guitar and was going to be a famous rock star, Ziegler said, and I was going to go to college.\n\nAD\n\nLife got in the way, though, when they realized that they'd have to get full-time jobs to pay their bills. She attended college for a year, then went to work for a beverage distributor, a job she has held for more than 40 years. Henrichs was in the communications business for years until switching to food catering before he retired.\n\nAD\n\nAbout 14 years into their marriage, they decided to start a family, raising Matthew, now 32, and Macy, now 28.\n\nWe married when we were 18, so I wasn't ready to start a family until later, Ziegler said. As she approached 40, she realized that she and Henrichs hadn't been ready for something else, as well: marriage.\n\nWe'd developed into who we really were, she said. And it was obvious that our interests were very different. It wasn't that we didn't like each other as people, we just no longer had that much in common.\n\nWhile she was outdoorsy and enjoyed hiking and biking, she said, Henrichs was more content to spend a day at the library.\n\nAD\n\nI was also working a lot and spending too much time away from the family, Henrichs said.\n\nAD\n\nThey decided that it was important to stay on friendly terms after their divorce to make life easier for their children, Ziegler said. She was thrilled when her ex met somebody new two years later and remarried. Linda Henrichs, a software marketing employee and mother of two grown daughters, is the best thing that ever happened to her high school sweetheart, Ziegler said.\n\nLinda Henrichs, 57, has something to say about that.\n\nI'm thankful that Mary really gave me Bill twice — once via divorce and once via a kidney transplant, she said.\n\nMary's generous spirit and willingness to help whoever needs it is wonderful, and we are lucky to have her and her family in our lives, she added. As Mary always says, 'Bill never left the family, I just joined it.' \n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZiegler, who met a new hiking companion, Bill Moes, 11 years ago (they were married in 2016 in a ceremony catered by her former spouse), had been concerned about her ex-husband's health for years. He found out he had diabetes shortly after their divorce.\n\nWhen I learned that he needed a new kidney, there wasn't any question that I would get tested, she said.\n\nJust a few days later, a call came from the Mayo Clinic to let her know that not only was she a strong match (she and Bill Henrichs share the same O blood type), but she also shares some antigens with him. Although their daughter also was considered a good possibility, Ziegler didn't want to put her through the surgery, as she has two young children.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Ziegler called Henrichs to let him know that she wanted to be his donor, he recalled, he felt overwhelmed.\n\nAD\n\nI could have been on the transplant list for three to six years, he said. Or I would have finally had to go through dialysis. Doctors had held me off from dialysis as long as they could, so it was a relief that Mary volunteered. But I was also worried about her coming through it okay.\n\nZiegler didn't share those concerns.\n\nI'm in good shape for my age. I do a lot of yoga, and I eat clean, she said. The only thing I was remotely concerned about was my down time, because I'm not a 'sitting around'-type person.\n\nJust three weeks after the transplant, she was back to work and doing yoga — a quick turnaround considering that the average kidney donor needs a healing period of six to eight weeks, Ziegler said.\n\nAD\n\nI know that he and Linda are grateful, and I'm delighted that I could help, she said. I'd have to say that this entire experience has brought us all closer together.\n\nAD\n\nShe and Henrichs hope that by sharing their story, other families will realize that divorce is not always a reason to cut off ties.\n\nDivorce is divorce, but there's no reason to squabble, Henrichs said. There are lots of reasons why it's important to get along. He pauses and laughs. Someday, you just might need a kidney.
The Good Place has been such a hit in part because it's unique in taking up this core, human question — Why be good? And for the hundreds of millions of people who believe or suspect there is something after death, what does it have to do with how we treat others?\n\nAD\n\nAs the NBC show heads to the finale of its third season Thursday night, an answer seems to be in sight. The Good Place has created a heaven and hell for our time, a system in which it's all about how humans treat one another and in which we rise or fall together rather than alone.\n\nSpoiler warning, for those who haven't seen the show!\n\nAD\n\nThings have been speeding toward a conclusion, unveiled in the last couple episodes, that the whole afterlife system is apparently rigged — humans can't get into the Good Place (a.k.a. heaven) these days because modern life in our flattening world is so complicated, we can't avoid unintended bad consequences.\n\nAll of this may go against the grain of a wide swath of Christianity, evangelical Christianity in particular, which argues that belief — not actions — is essential to salvation. But as an evangelical, I embrace The Good Place theology if it affirms that, yes, we are our brother's keeper. There has not been a more pressing time to consider that biblical story than today.\n\nAD\n\nThe Good Place, created by Michael Schur (who was also behind the shows Parks and Recreation and The Office), imagines the afterlives of four humans who, on balance, lived mostly average lives on earth. It begins with strident salesman Eleanor, indecisive philosopher Chidi, self-involved socialite Tahani, and clueless Floridian Jason thinking they're in the Good Place, then realizing they've been tricked and are actually in the Bad Place — a secular stand-in for hell. The show, which has been renewed for a fourth season, coming this fall, can also be watched on streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu.\n\nAD\n\nIn a combo buddy-chase scene that takes place in trippy alternative dimensions, they wind up escaping with the help of the demon Michael (Ted Danson) who was supposed to torment them but became their friend, and his assistant, not-a-robot Janet. The six of them become an unlikely but endearing team, crusading against the unfair point system that relegates humans to the Bad Place and working tirelessly to reveal and rectify injustices with the help of the powers that be — namely, the Judge (played by Maya Rudolph), in whose fair and capable hands their fate rests.\n\nThroughout the show, it becomes clearer and clearer that gaining points is tied directly to being good — and deep questions are raised about whether humans can become better, and whether we become good (or better) on our own, or whether our standing rises or falls communally.\n\nAD\n\nThe point system in The Good Place is specific. Singing to a child is a net gain of 0.69 points. Committing genocide, on the other hand, will cost you 433,115.25 points. Maintaining one's composure in line at a water park in Houston will get you 61.14 points, but telling a woman to smile is a withdrawal of 53.83 points. The list goes on, with debits and credits racked up according to what will bring another person (or group of people) pleasure or pain. This isn't bald utilitarianism; instead, it is a sort of point system based on the Golden Rule as laid out by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount: In everything do to others as you would have them do to you.\n\nAD\n\nConceptions of heaven vary from one religion to the next, and some say the right belief is the necessary ingredient to enter their respective Good Places. Particularly in American evangelical strains of Christianity, orthodoxy is often viewed as more important than orthopraxy — a word for having the correct conduct. Believe the right things, the thinking goes, and God will command St. Peter to open up the pearly gates. You may have done the right things all your life, but if you don't believe correctly, then you will be left sitting outside the gates, in the place where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.\n\nThe Good Place concerns itself almost not at all with right belief. It barely touches institutional religion, except at the very start, when Michael explains that all the world religions were only a few percentage points right about how the afterlife works. The only person to have correctly predicted the afterlife before death, he says, was not a saint or monk but a Canadian named Doug Forcett who, during a mushroom trip, predicted the Good Place with 92 percent accuracy, says Michael, in whose office hangs a portrait of Forcett. The closest thing the Good Place has to God is the Judge, played by an exceedingly rational, burrito-loving Rudolph, who does not require belief or even loyalty so much as honesty and reason.\n\nThe characters spent the first season figuring out that what they thought was the Good Place was a twisted version of the Bad Place, tailor-made to torture them. But somehow the experience ended up bonding them together, so much so that they found each other back on earth when Michael was able to get them all a second chance at earning more points. They didn't come to any astonishing beliefs about God or the salvific nature of Jesus, but they did grow in love of each other. They learned to put each other first, to serve one another, to care for other people.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn an earlier season, a once-strident, individualistic Eleanor forgoes her chance to head to the Good Place alone so that she can stay with her friends. Over time, she and Chidi fall in love with each other, but even then they don't abandon the rest of their crew. Tahani frees Jason from their questionable marriage so that he and Janet are free to be together, and the group is able to resist the seeds of division sown by Trevor, a chaotic demon from the Bad Place. They stick together. They have gone through trials and tribulations and come out stronger. This keeps them heading to the Good Place.\n\nAm I my brother's keeper? is a question we all have to answer for ourselves, and our current political climate makes that question feel especially urgent. How are we responsible for each other, the show wants to ask.\n\nThe Good Place is not an inherently partisan or political show, but that question has incredible political consequences. If we are, indeed, our brothers' keepers, then we cannot in good conscience allow our brothers to be torn from their families at our nation's borders. If we are our brothers' keepers, we cannot stand idly by while they are banned from serving in the military, or lose the ability to put food on their table during a government shutdown, or are the victims of racism and violence. If we answer the question Am I my brother's keeper? in the affirmative — as The Good Place does — then we are responsible to our brothers. And the afterlife, and our admission to it, depends on how we answer this question.\n\nJesus said that whatever we do for the least of my brothers, it is as if we have done it for him.
After trying to kill himself during my entire life, this is how it ended: One car hit him, then another while he was walking home from Dunkin' Donuts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was my first time back in the city in over 10 years, my first night away from my husband and children in a decade. My siblings were supposed to be there, too. But one by one, they canceled, because of money, illness, decades of residual anger. I needed the closure. So I'd go alone, with ashes my sister would mail.\n\nI'd been picturing a petite pill bottle, 30-day Xanax prescription-size. What she sent was better suited for horse tranquilizers. If I was going to carry my dad around with me until I figured out where to let him go, I'd have to make him more manageable.\n\nHuman ashes are not fine. With a shirt tied around my face, I sifted him through my son's plastic funnel into clear travel shampoo containers. Sharp bony bits (his vertebrae?) refused to cooperate. Underneath the shirt mask, I sweated. My glasses fogging up, I tapped the funnel against the side of the sink in a rhythm: You are gone; this is what is left. You are gone; this is what is left. In the end, he took up as little space as he possibly could — just two bottles' worth — like when he was in a depressive cycle and his body and voice shrank so that you hardly knew he was there.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy father's ashes and I walked north from Washington Square Park. We saw a movie, a play, an improv show. Being back in New York by myself felt like being on another planet. I could do interesting things without feeling sad that my husband didn't want to do them with me or selfish for wanting to do them anyway. My father's ashes and I went dancing at a terrible club. We sat in my hotel room and cried over my declining marriage.\n\nIn the evenings, I listened to tapes my dad had sent me years earlier, in a manic phase, detailing his life's story. I tried to parse which version was real — the dad who carried me from my dorm room delirious with fever? The dad who boasted of 43 kills in four separate arms of the Israeli military? The dad whose particulate matter was caught in my eyelashes and lungs?\n\nEvery day we walked, 36 miles all told. With each step, I was losing my grip on who my father was and who he had become but gaining an understanding of who I had become and who I wanted to be. I fantasized that the hotel room was my apartment. I read. I wrote. I took three showers one day, just because the hot water felt good.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy dad went out one morning in the fog to get a jelly doughnut and a coffee, and then he made a gift of his body: He gave me permission to get on a plane alone, to breathe, to think.\n\nHere's what I decided: I want more.\n\nIt felt greedy, wanting more. I wanted more than my good, decent husband. More than fondness. I wanted someone to feel with me, want with me, take on the whole damn world with me. For the next 15 years of my life, I wanted more than being alone together.\n\nThe day before I flew home, my father and I took our last walk. After we crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, I found a quiet spot at the end of the pier. I'd been listening to him recollect, with awe, sneaking away from a refugee camp in Vienna, exploring the city by boat. Lowering my hands beneath the guardrail, I tapped and tapped until the cloud of white dust that was my father drifted away. Thank you, I tapped, for the dad I'd been missing. Thank you, I tapped, for the dad I'd found. Thank you, I tapped, for the dad who'd helped me find myself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn the tarmac the next day, I turned on Bill Withers's Lovely Day and sank into my seat. For the first time in my life, I felt exhilaration — not fear — during takeoff. I cried because I was sad and because I was happy. I cried because I knew exactly what I needed to do.\n\nI didn't unpack for weeks. You seem different, my husband remarked. I was. Do we need to talk? he asked. We did.\n\nAfter sitting with my decision for three weeks, I was sure that I was sure. I met my husband in a parking lot near Atlanta's BeltLine. He walked toward me just like he had when he was 24, coming out of the tall grass from the side of the road where we'd pulled over somewhere in North Dakota. Only this time, he wasn't looking at me like he'd just discovered me, and I wasn't beaming back with possibility.\n\nAD\n\nI wanted him to understand. Just as I had mourned the emotional loss of my father for years before I experienced his physical loss, I had been mourning the emotional loss of our marriage during our long drift away from one another. I wanted him to understand that we were not the same people we were when we met. At least, I wasn't.\n\nAD\n\nFinding the courage at 41 to push the words, I think I want a divorce, out of my mouth was so much more difficult than finding the courage at 19 to say, I think I love you. And yet, both times, I made my mouth say the words my heart felt.\n\nWe sat together for a while, talking quietly. I'm sorry, I called after him as he headed for his car. Then I stood up and walked in the opposite direction. I walked as fast and as hard as I could away from the couple we no longer were and toward the person I had become.
Now we're in Lima, Peru, where six of Peter's contestants remain. His forehead bandage is off and he has to decide: Who's going home? And who's he going home with? Here's a rundown of where the six women stand after Monday night's episode.\n\nMadison, 23, a foster parent recruiter from Auburn, Ala.\n\nMadison's first one-on-one date was already an insanely early and awkward hometown. She accompanied the Bachelor as his parents renewed their vows in their backyard. At the time, it seemed far too intimate for a first date. We imagined Peter's parents thinking: Uh, who is this stranger who'll forever be in photos of our vow renewal? But Peter is still crazy about Madison. She's the only one this season who doesn't have petty drama surrounding her. Last week, for example, their make-out session was interrupted by the screeching sounds of other contestants fighting with one another.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis week, she's the first one-on-one date, where they board a fishing boat off the coast of Lima. (Peter, make sure to get a shot of you holding up a fish just in case all this doesn't work out and you end up on Tinder in three months!) During their dinner, Madison tells him that she's looking for a partner with a strong religious background. Faith is literally my whole life, she tells him. And she wants someone who also has that relationship with the Lord. Peter takes a long pause before saying that, though he feels his faith could be stronger, it is important to him. At this point, a Bachelor is usually looking for a contestant to reassure him that she's falling for him. Instead, Peter is the one to say those words to Madison — the only one of the women remaining to get such confirmation of his strong feelings. She gets a rose and is a front-runner.\n\nNatasha, 31, event planner from New York\n\nHow are we one week from hometowns and Natasha still hasn't had a one-on-one? Well, we are — and Natasha finally (finally!) gets some alone time with Peter. They walk along the Plaza de Armas and visit some street vendors, where Natasha's good humor shines through. She models a headband with mini-figurines of women on it and says, It's like two weeks ago — all your girlfriends. They seem to have an easy and fun demeanor together, which makes it boggling as to why they haven't had any real time together until now. During their dinner, he pays Natasha quite the compliment, saying he's seen more sides of her than any of the other women — her goofy and fun side, her bold side, her honest side. She's three-dimensional! Look at that. Quite a rarity in Bachelor Nation, and yet this is their first date, so Peter predictably tells her that his other relationships are farther ahead. Therefore, he can't give Natasha the rose. She takes it extremely well, telling him: I hope you find what you're looking for. I know I will.\n\nKelsey, 28, a professional clothier from Des Moines\n\nKelsey started out as pure petty drama (see the champagne crisis above). However, there's a bit more depth to her. She's had a hard childhood. She found out her dad was leaving her mom before her mother even knew. She's intent upon having a career and a family. She says of her imagined future: I want to be involved in my kids' lives, but still have something for me. Kelsey tells Peter a bit more about her family — that she's recently been talking to her dad again and is considering resuming a relationship with him, which clearly touches Peter. I do think it's so beautiful that you'll give your dad a second chance, he tells her. She tells Peter that he has a lot of qualities she's been looking for and hasn't found. She gets the rose and they kiss. Onward to Iowa!\n\nHannah Ann, 23, a model from Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nHannah Ann started off strong with the first-impression rose, which often indicates future success. Last week she had a tough one-on-one where Peter inquired about whether she'd ever been in love. She said she hadn't, a notion some viewers dispute because of Instagram evidence of a past long-term relationship. Peter seemed to be asking as a way of determining whether she's ready for marriage. Still, on a tense three-on-one date this week, Peter tells her: I have enjoyed every moment with you up to this point, commenting on her sweet nature. During their date, she read to him from a list of things she loves about him, dotting her I's with literal hearts. What is this, middle school? Pretty much. Peter gives her a rose.\n\nVictoria, 26, a medical sales representative from Virginia Beach\n\nNearly every conversation with Victoria centers on Peter reassuring her that he likes her, or trying to buck up her confidence. Their first one-on-one included a very awkward serenading by her ex-boyfriend, country singer Chase Rice. Her drama is not just on-screen. Last week, she won a group date where she was to be on the cover of Cosmopolitan magazine. However, once Cosmo found out she'd done some white lives matter ads, they pulled their digital cover. During their three-on-one Monday night, it looks as if Peter is going to say goodbye. He leads Victoria away from Hannah Ann and Kelley, walking her to an SUV. She seems incredibly worried that this is it … until Peter tells her: I really appreciate what we have. I know it's not always been super easy between the two of us. I want you to know how much I appreciate you opening up today, and I want you to know that I hope to continue this. She gets a rose. Kelley's predictions — that Hannah Ann or Victoria will be going home — are proved wrong.\n\nKelley, 27, an attorney from Chicago\n\nKelley seemed to have a leg up on her fellow contestants, as she met Peter before this whole Bachelor season began. They'd both been at a hotel in Westlake Village, Calif., she at a wedding, he at a high school reunion. She has an actual life and career, and proclaims herself on a different emotional level than the other women here. We agree. However, Peter's the one making the decisions here. When she tells him this week that he's so easy to be around you and how fun their relationship is, he pushes back, wondering if that's enough. I don't know why we met the way we did, but I'm grateful for it, he tells Kelley, right before giving his final rose to Hannah Ann. Throughout it all, Kelley did seem to be having fun — not stressing every step of the way, as some of the younger contestants have. We see this as a sign of her maturity and readiness for a serious relationship. But of course, this is The Bachelor, so her lack of neediness is apparently a red flag. We hope she and Natasha are bonding at an airport bar, heads held high, toasting their singledom.
Just before 10 on a balmy Sunday morning in mid-October, right on time, Pete Buttigieg marches into a squat brown building on the edge of Colonial Williamsburg, ready to fire up a group of door-knocking volunteers for Elaine Luria, a former Navy commander challenging a scandal-plagued Republican for a U.S. House seat from Virginia. Inside he comes upon a mere half-dozen bleary-eyed folks milling around Luria's headquarters. They seem not quite sure just who this perky young dude in the crisp white shirt, blue tie and neatly pressed slacks might be.\n\nListen to this and other great stories from The Washington Post Magazine on the Curio app.\n\nThe local field organizer is full of apologies. We had 10 people email this morning and say they couldn't come because of the storm, she says. A surprise weather system had blasted through two nights earlier on the tail of Hurricane Michael, felling pine trees and downing power lines. It was like, 'I haven't had a shower in days and I just can't.' But we're so glad to have you!\n\nPete Buttigieg, who was first elected at age 29, is a two-term mayor of South Bend, Ind.\n\nButtigieg, the wunderkind mayor of South Bend, Ind., and one of the longest of 2020 presidential long shots, knew about the storm. His plane from Chicago had been delayed by the bad weather on Friday night, finally touching down in Charleston, S.C., at 3 a.m. After three Saturday events in the Carolinas, he had driven five hours through the night with Matt McKenna, his lanky and eternally patient young aide, only to find most of Williamsburg's tourist hotels booked solid with local families and work crews. Somebody forgot to make reservations. For the second straight morning, Buttigieg has had to skip his 6 a.m. run. He's just learned that his second planned event of the day, another pep talk for another congressional candidate in Richmond, has been canceled.\n\nIn short, his trial campaign run through the South is not proceeding quite as planned. But there are seven people here to inspire and impress — eight, if you count me — and Buttigieg is not one to waste an opportunity.\n\nI'm glad too! he says, and does the politician thing he has perfected despite his innate shyness: He trains his full attention on everyone in turn, peppering them with questions about their lives, the power outages, the poll numbers, how folks are responding when they come knocking, the provenance of this bland office suite. What did this place used to be before the campaign? he asks.\n\nA dentist's office? one of the young women replies. And I think a massage parlor.\n\nA normal politician might be miffed at the low turnout. A regular human being might not be looking quite so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed under the circumstances. But normal and regular are not adjectives that apply to the son of a Maltese immigrant father and an Army brat mom who grew up in decaying South Bend, got himself into Harvard, summer-interned for Ted Kennedy, worked for John Kerry's presidential campaign, won a Rhodes Scholarship, learned Arabic in Tunisia, landed a jet-setting consultant's job, left it to return to his beat-up hometown and become the youngest mayor of a midsize U.S. city, transformed that city into a national model of renewal, and then — deep breath — volunteered for active duty in Afghanistan while serving as mayor, came out as gay in the local newspaper, married a schoolteacher live on YouTube, turned heads in a dark-horse bid to lead the Democratic National Committee, and had the New York Times's Frank Bruni gushing about him as potentially the First Gay President— all by age 36.\n\n[Pete Buttigieg, citing need for generational change, joins 2020 Democratic presidential race]\n\nButtigieg, in fact, appears intent on proving Bruni right far sooner than the columnist might have expected; he's currently making all the moves one would expect from an about-to-declare 2020 candidate. But he won't be hinging his long-shot bid on the prospect of being the first openly gay president. Instead, he'll be running as the herald of a new generation.\n\nButtigieg performs a marriage ceremony in his mayoral office for Catherine Pittman, left, and Victoria Powers.\n\nMillennials became the country's largest voting-age cohort in 2018, displacing baby boomers — and their politics break sharply with their parents' and grandparents'. (Opinions vary as to where the millennial generation technically begins and ends, but the Pew Research Center defines it as those born between 1981 and 1996. Buttigieg was born in 1982.) This group not only leans heavily Democratic, but emphatically leftward. Of course, they overwhelmingly tell pollsters, gay people should be able to marry. Of course black and brown people have been shortchanged throughout history and continue to be. Of course immigrants do nothing but make the country stronger. Of course the government owes every citizen decent health care. And of course climate change is humanity's greatest peril.\n\nThe center of gravity of the American people is way to the left of the center of gravity of Congress and, in many ways, to the left of the national Democratic Party, Buttigieg had told me earlier in the year. That's especially true of millennials. Their political outlook is shaped by being the first post-World War II generation to face diminished economic prospects, and also the first to fully experience the diminished quality of life wrought by decades of tax-slashing, privatization and deregulation: inefficient social services, unaffordable child care, crummy roads and trains and public transportation, slow Internet speeds, and a rapidly warming Earth. Buttigieg's peers are eager to embrace a politics that's bigger and more ambitious — more New Deal than New Democrat. They want swing-for-the-fences solutions from politicians who don't pretend that all the country needs is just some minor tweaks.\n\nDonald Trump got elected because, in his twisted way, he pointed out the huge troubles in our economy and our democracy, Buttigieg says. At least he didn't go around saying that America was already great, like Hillary did.\n\nThe mistake Democrats risk making in 2020, he says, is looking in the rearview mirror for solutions. I get the urge people will have after Trump. 'Look at the chaos and the exhaustion: Wouldn't it be better to go back to something more stable with somebody we know?' But there's no going back to a pre-Trump universe. We can't be saying the system will be fine again just like it was. Because that's not true; it wasn't fine. Not if we could careen into this kind of politics.\n\nButtigieg, who was elected South Bend mayor in 2011, will not run for a third term.\n\nAfter a 10-minute wait to see who else might turn up, a bushy-bearded Afghanistan veteran in a hoodie is called upon to introduce the special guest and mangles his name four different ways. Buttigieg (buddha-judge) just beams. You can call me Pete; everybody does, he says. He stands and delivers a condensed version of the talk he's been giving around the country since the summer, mostly in support of the 20 first-time House candidates in red districts that he's backing with his super PAC, Hitting Home.\n\nThen he watches the organizer run through her tips for the day, looking as rapt as an eager first-time canvasser. What's that behind you? he asks, pointing to a big sheet of paper tacked on the wall with names and messages scrawled all over it. The volunteers are asked to sign it when they come to canvass, the organizer says. We're going to give it to Elaine after she wins.\n\nThat, he says, is an incredible idea.\n\nI figure he's just being super polite, but after we make our exit and he takes the wheel of his rented SUV — You navigate, I'll drive, he tells McKenna; I've always been terrible at land navigation — it becomes clear that he wasn't pretending. That banner she's having them sign, what a good way to build teamwork, he says. It's the kind of thing that builds a sense that you're all working together, and toward something. A good organizer knows about building a social culture in a campaign.\n\nWith McKenna navigating from the back seat, we speed off with controlled aggression toward the interstate and two fundraisers in Northern Virginia. It's a shame about Richmond, but we'll have more time to talk this way, Buttigieg says. I have to make a couple of calls, just so you know. I figure what we ought to do is we'll find a place with a decent lunch. There should be good barbecue in this part of Virginia, right? As long as we're in Fairfax by 3 o'clock or so we'll be okay. So I'm pretty much all yours. We can make this a rolling interview. So to speak!\n\n[Evangelicals helped get Trump into the White House. Pete Buttigieg believes the religious left will get him out.]\n\nRolling monologue is more like it. Buttigieg is a human data-processor, one very interesting topic suggesting the next, punctuated by observations about something he's spotted out the window in passing. One minute he's telling me about his plans for the rest of the midterm election season, then he's asking me about the prospects for the campaigns I've covered, then he's on to the theory of parks and recreation, the wonders of tax-increment financing, the time he drove a van for Al Gore and got lost in Boston, and the unpredictable dress codes at different kinds of campaign events. I was underdressed for the fundraiser in Columbia. It turned out to be a very dignified thing at Don Fowler's house — the former DNC chief — and now this morning, I felt overdressed with the tie with the volunteers. It took me years to calibrate my way around South Bend, and now I'm trying to crack the campaign dress code. I'm beginning to absorb the lifestyle of somebody who's running. Most of our events have been surgical, flying in and out, but it's going to be this way for the next three weeks and, hey, Matt, look! There's the bucket trucks we saw in the parking lot last night, right? Maybe not the exact ones.\n\nButtigieg speaks with Shatoria Adams, left, and Kenneth Garrett during a visit to Elkhart Plastics in South Bend.\n\nButtigieg can come off like a combination Boy Scout and lovable dork. You can easily imagine him in Silicon Valley, deeply debating the future of artificial intelligence with his college friend Mark Zuckerberg before leaving work to feed the homeless. But politics has always been his main obsession. As a senior and student-government officer in high school, he won the 2000 JFK Profile in Courage Essay Contest, earning a trip to Boston for the annual ceremony. His subject was as millennial as it gets: Bernie Sanders.\n\nCandidates have discovered that it's easier to be elected by not offending anyone rather than by impressing the voters, he wrote. Politicians are rushing for the center, careful not to stick their necks out on issues. Most Democrats shy away from the word 'liberal' like a horrid accusation. But not the man from Vermont. Sanders' courage is evident in the first word he uses to describe himself: 'Socialist.' \n\nReading his paean to Bernie, it's clear that young Buttigieg already had a streak of ambition and opportunism to match his idealism. I have heard that no sensible young person today would want to give his or her life to public service, the senior-class president and valedictorian of St. Joseph High concluded. I can personally assure you this is untrue. And it paid off: At the award ceremony in Boston, Ted Kennedy offered him a summer internship on the spot. That first wide-eyed taste of Washington after his freshman year at Harvard set him on the path that could soon, improbably enough, have him facing off against the once-obscure socialist congressman who struck him, 18 years ago, as both immensely admirable and impossibly old.\n\nButtigieg at the Progress Iowa holiday party in December. His appearance there signaled his intentions to political observers.\n\nThe departure of the Clintons kind of uncorks a new energy, Buttigieg is saying as we rattle up the interstate. It's an exciting time to be a Democrat. The party has to figure out what it means now.\n\nHe'd endorsed Hillary Clinton after her nomination in 2016, as any aspiring party leader must, but he clearly won't be writing any laudatory essays about her campaign. I organized a Union Hall event for her in South Bend, he says, and shakes his head. You could just tell the enthusiasm wasn't there. The problem, he says, was partly that the stakes seemed too low. We need a bigger scope of ambition for people to rally around. A return to the Clinton and Obama style of centrist incrementalism, he says, will invite disaster just as surely in 2020. Change is something we need to face with clear eyes. It's scary, but it's also exciting.\n\nHe paints his potential presidential campaign as a kind of blown-up version of his first run for mayor. Buttigieg announced his 2011 campaign two weeks after Newsweek featured South Bend as one of America's Dying Cities. People had been promised a return of manufacturing jobs for almost half a century, Buttigieg says — a little like Trump in coal country. From 1902 to 1963, the city was the home of carmaker Studebaker, which employed nearly 25,000 local workers at its peak, before going belly-up. The city never recovered. When he was growing up, a lot of people would still talk about the closure like it happened yesterday, he says. When I ran, we had to paint a picture of the future that did not translate into nostalgia.\n\nHe points with particular pride to the massive infrastructure projects he undertook: refashioning the old, decaying Studebaker building into a hub for small creative industries like tech start-ups, and pledging that 1,000 homes in 1,000 days would either be razed or refurbished to rid neighborhoods of the crumbling vestiges of the past. The word 'again' was not part of our vision, he says. The message from the start was, 'The Studebaker plant isn't coming back, but we are, and here's how.' \n\nButtigieg knew that if he could make good on his audacious promises, he could also make a name for himself — which he quickly proceeded to do, beating the 1,000-day target and spiffing up the old plant over the harrumphs of the city council veterans and longtime government officials who couldn't help resenting the technocratic kid from the fancy schools and the global consultancy.\n\nAs we proceed through Virginia, interstate traffic, as it's wont to do, repeatedly bottles up for no apparent reason. We've still got plenty of time to get to Fairfax County for the first event up there, but the creeping pace is driving Buttigieg to distraction. Let's find an alternate route, he says.\n\nOkay. Two miles and you're going to hop on 301, McKenna says.\n\nGot it, Buttigieg responds. Wow, this needs resurfacing. There's a Nobel Prize waiting for someone who can figure out how to make asphalt last longer than 12 years. I'm not kidding. I really think there ought to be a Manhattan Project for this. It's classic market failure.\n\nButtigieg has a magnetism about him. ... I think his age is an advantage, says former DNC chairman Howard Dean.\n\nIf Buttigieg becomes president, you sense, the future will be chock-full of Manhattan Projects. But first he has to overcome the considerable odds and find a way to win. He has clearly made a close study of how Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and John F. Kennedy took their nontraditional paths to the presidency at young ages. When you run young, your face says you represent change, he says. But he doesn't want to stop at symbolism: His message for 2020 will be centered on a clean, sharp break with the Lite Republicanism that Democrats embraced in the 1990s. While older voters still tell pollsters they favor keeping taxes low and ambitions modest, millennials overwhelmingly support Medicare-for-all, free college, heavy spending to tackle poverty and climate change, and major infrastructure investments — social democracy, in a nutshell.\n\n[In a coastal state with 4.5 million Trump voters, Pete Buttigieg says coastal states don't know Trump voters]\n\nThough Buttigieg prefers to label himself — if he must label himself — a progressive Democrat, he can deliver a spontaneous dissertation on why young Americans say they prefer socialism to capitalism that would do Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez proud. Nobody should mistake it for youthful idealism or recklessness, he says. I think the new generation that emerges now will have a different kind of seriousness about the future, he says. It's more immediate and personal, the younger you are. You're going to be on the business end of climate change, of tax cuts; you're going to be touched more by our post-9/11 wars. Matt, how old were you on 9/11?\n\nUm, let's see — I was 5.\n\nThat's what I mean. You can be a grown-a– man like Matt here and don't recall us not being at war. Which is a whole 'nother part of it. Look how many candidates this year — including 11 of the House candidates he's been boosting — are young veterans. I think the sense of obligation kicked in, the awareness that it's part of a civic duty and a moral failure when you only have other people fighting your wars. And in my case, that included a lot of the people I was commanding in the reserves. That's part of what pushed me into it. I thought, 'Why not me?' \n\nWhy not me? is also the way Buttigieg thinks about running for president. It's no accident, he says, that this year's Democratic field could include five other current and former mayors: Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, Andrew Gillum of Tallahassee, Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, Michael Bloomberg of New York and Julián Castro of San Antonio. With most state capitols every bit as clogged up in partisan stalemates as Washington, mayors still actually get to do stuff, as he puts it.\n\nThe discussion in Washington has gotten so abstracted from reality, he says. He wants to drive politics back toward the lived experiences of the citizenry, which don't divide them the way ideological abstractions do. What makes a country great, really? We like to talk about 'freedom' and 'security' and 'family values' or whatever, he says. But the measure of a country's greatness is whether it helps people lead better lives, with less worry.\n\nButtigieg takes a selfie with a customer outside Taqueria El Aguila in South Bend in December.\n\nAs soon as we've broken free of bottlenecks, Buttigieg starts searching the side of the highway for a lunch spot. South of Fredericksburg, he spots a low-slung, ramshackle series of structures: Hey, there's two things I've never seen paired: restaurant and thrift shop. In a split second, he's making a quick swerve left. Let's check it out! he says, as McKenna lets out a little groan.\n\nAfter a quick scan of the dingy thrift shop — Matt, look, $7 suits! — we follow him into Lou's Soul Food, which smells like 30 years of fried food. It's a buffet, he says, as if that settles things, and we find a table near the back to talk about his first campaign experience.\n\nRight after college I went to work for John Kerry, June of 2004. It was one of those deals where you graduate, pack a bag and go where they tell you. I thought I was going to D.C., so I moved there, started sleeping on a friend's couch, and then got a phone call from Arizona: 'I hear you're my new research director.' I'm like, 'Oh, okay.' They said, 'Do you have a car?' No, I didn't. 'Well, buy one tomorrow, start driving, and you can be here at work on Friday.' So that's what I did.\n\nWhen Kerry's Arizona experiment floundered, they pulled us, a month out from the election. I got reassigned. In classic campaign fashion, I thought I was supposed to go to Denver, so I drove eight hours to Denver, turned up at the office, introduced myself, carved out a desk space somewhere, called Washington and said, 'Okay, now what?' And they said, 'Oh, Denver? We actually wanted you to go to Albuquerque.' So that's how I learned what a presidential campaign was actually like.\n\nAfter the Kerry campaign, Buttigieg went back to Washington for six months, biding his time before the Rhodes Scholarship kicked in. When he graduated from Oxford, he decided to give the business world a try and took a job at McKinsey, the prestigious global consulting firm. I knew that I really didn't understand the way the world worked, he says. How do people make money, operate and move around the world? How does this stuff work?\n\nIn all the hours I've spent talking to Buttigieg, this is the first time I catch a whiff of disingenuousness. Companies like McKinsey, a little like their Silicon Valley compadres, are magnets for high-achieving Ivy Leaguers who like to talk about making the world better while raking in some serious salaries.\n\nHis 2020 message will be centered on a clean break with the Lite Republicanism that Democrats once embraced.\n\nBut Buttigieg, who worked out of Chicago and specialized in energy and economic development, didn't make a career of it. He left McKinsey after three years and two extended leaves to door-knock for Obama in 2008 and serve as research director for the gubernatorial campaign of Indiana Democrat Jill Long Thompson.\n\nIn 2009, he got his dander up when Richard Mourdock, the Republican state treasurer facing reelection in Indiana, sued the Obama administration to block the auto bailout. This was an insane thing for an elected official in Indiana to do, Buttigieg says. That made me start asking: Why don't I run against this guy?\n\nButtigieg's Meet Pete campaign never took flight. He blew through his McKinsey savings and still got clobbered, losing by 25 points. But in a way, he says, it was my first experience in winning by losing. The defeat stung, but I learned how to organize a team, he says. And he learned that smarts weren't the only secret to political success: It matters more to understand human beings and how to reach them, how to move them.\n\nFor all his aw-shucksiness, if Buttigieg has the least bit of doubt that he's ready to make the leap to commander in chief, at an age that barely qualifies him constitutionally for the job, it's impossible to detect. He has often been urged to run for Congress — the next logical steppingstone — but he sees it as a dead end. I would find it demoralizing, he says. David Axelrod, Obama's political guru, is among the powerhouse Democrats who see no reason Buttigieg should wait. Axelrod's first Pete sighting was in November 2015, when the young mayor was given the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award at Harvard. He spoke without a note in front of him and gave one of the most stirring speeches I've heard, Axelrod told the South Bend Tribune. He has that gift. Axelrod has given Buttigieg the same advice he gave Obama after his famous Democratic National Convention keynote speech in 2004: The biggest mistake politicians make is missing their moment by hesitating.\n\nWhen Buttigieg decided to undertake the DNC race in 2017 — gambling that if he couldn't knock off Keith Ellison and Tom Perez, the favorites of the Sanders and Clinton camps, he could at least give his future a rocket-boost and once again win by losing — he debated circles around the two front-runners, and charmed cable-news viewers and grizzled party elders with his unexpected eloquence and fresh vision for the party, which included a bundle of bright ideas for digital strategies. Right before the vote, headed for a third-place finish, he bowed out and returned to South Bend with enough new backers to form a super PAC that would give him an excuse to travel the country in 2018 and lay the groundwork for 2020.\n\nHe might very well have won the DNC race if you could have had a secret ballot, says Howard Dean, who endorsed Buttigieg for his old job. But it's such an insider race. … That was hard to overcome. Dean, who has spoken with Buttigieg about his own experience vaulting from obscurity to the top of the 2004 Democratic primaries, sees a lot of Obama­esque qualities in the mayor. He has a magnetism about him, he says. And I think he projects this idea of, 'Let's get past all this partisan crap and do something for the country for a change.' I think his age is an advantage. I really think the American people would like to see our generation step aside and see a new generation take leadership.\n\nObama is also a Buttigieg fan. In his 2017 New Yorker exit interview, the former president named Buttigieg as one of four Democrats who would lead the party forward. They've met at least once to discuss the future.\n\nAccording to Buttigieg's husband, Chasten Buttigieg, there's another Obama parallel that most people wouldn't guess from Pete's genial retail politicking and smooth style on the stump: He's definitely an introvert. And he's still coming out of some of his shells. That's something he's learned in part from Chasten, who does improv comedy on the side and maintains a busy Twitter feed that can be flat-out hilarious. When we go out, we'll go to events and then I'd want to keep going out to a bar for a beer, Chasten says. And he'll be wanting to go home and curl up with a book.\n\nWhile Buttigieg frames his sexual orientation as part of his next-generation appeal, he finds it uncomfortable to talk about why it took him so long — until he was 33, and back from Afghanistan — to accept the plain fact that I'm gay. When he spoke to Axelrod for his podcast, The Axe Files, in March 2017, his silver tongue abandoned him as he tried to explain. If willpower alone could make somebody straight, you know … I would've —. He didn't complete the thought but acknowledged that his struggle had something to do with his political aspirations and his desire to serve in the military while don't ask, don't tell was still in effect.\n\nBut once he finally abandoned the struggle, Buttigieg was characteristically all in. He came out in the South Bend Tribune during his mayoral reelection campaign, soon after then-Gov. Mike Pence signed his infamously anti-gay Religious Freedom Restoration Act. And in short order he met Chasten online and quickly fell in love. When the two wed in June 2018, they timed it for Pride Week. The ceremony was live-streamed on YouTube — and afterward, the couple joined revelers at a Pride block party, with a New York Times reporter in tow.\n\nStill, Buttigieg doesn't much care for being identified primarily as the first gay anything. Millennials are supposed to be obsessed with identity politics, but Buttigieg thinks that Democrats make a serious mistake when they slice-and-dice their message to appeal to particular identities. Along the way, the party fell into this pattern of thinking we should have a message for each constituency, he says. But the reality is that people care about issues that aren't 'their' issues, quote unquote. Elderly residents care about education. Suburban women care about racial justice. Young people care about social programs for the elderly.\n\nButtigieg at home with his husband, Chasten, and their dogs Buddy, left, and Truman.\n\nI've ridden along with candidates for decades and have long since grown accustomed to the interview pausing when they approach the next event. This is the time for a tense, whispering huddle with aides, reviewing talking points and notes on the pols and donors who need impressing. Buttigieg, by contrast, grows practically giddy the closer we get to the first event in Northern Virginia, taking only a minute to quiz McKenna on the essentials of the fundraiser for Jennifer Wexton, a young Virginia state senator challenging Republican Barbara Comstock for her U.S. House seat.\n\nEarlier in the day, Buttigieg had told me how much he relishes coming into an environment like this, where nobody knows me from Adam, and seeing what happens when he starts speaking. Sometimes you can watch people as you go up to the podium and they're like, 'What's the deal with this guy?' And then it's, 'Okay, he's up there, he can talk.' If it's going right, I love to watch the faces then: Partly I like to study them to see what's working and not, what to cut out next time or maybe expand. But there's this look, when you know you really have them. It's hard to describe, but it's unmistakable.\n\nThis time, the turnout is clearly not going to be a disappointment; we start to see the lines of very nice parked cars a couple of blocks before we reach the McMansion that is our destination. Inside, the vast open living, dining and kitchen space is jammed with well-off white people in high cocktail mode. Only Wexton recognizes the special guest, and they chat briefly before the folks are hushed and Buttigieg (pronounced properly) is introduced.\n\nStanding in front of a big fireplace and a huge TV showing the Redskins game on mute, Buttigieg is in his element, opening with some banter about where he's from — You might know us for our football team — before segueing into the message he's honing for 2020. It's very important for people in communities like mine to know there's a formula for moving forward that isn't resentment, that isn't nostalgia, he says, recounting his first campaign for mayor. We didn't go around saying we're going to make South Bend great again. The folks laugh heartily at the implicit dig at Trump. I didn't go around thumping my chest saying I alone can fix it. We came together and identified problem-solvers to get things done and actually change the trajectory of our future.\n\nI'm watching the faces he's watching, seeing folks whisper low to their spouses: Who is this guy again?\n\nWe're finding a whole new vocabulary for why people should vote, Buttigieg is saying. We're reclaiming some territory that our party, in my opinion, foolishly left to the other side. Like freedom, right? The so-called Freedom Caucus, as you know, has the most fanatical members of Congress. But they don't seem to know that you're not free if you can't change jobs because you'll lose your health care. And that you're not free if you can't sue a credit-card company that's ripping you off. And you're certainly not free if somebody you've never met gets to tell you who you can and can't marry based on their interpretation of their religion.\n\nThere's one little hitch in the performance, when he praises Wexton for being in the minority in the state assembly and still passing four pieces of major legislation. (Actually, it's 40, she says, interjecting with a smile but an unmistakable note of sharpness.) Buttigieg plays it off laughingly, saying he's so much more impressed with her now, since in our legislature back home, four bills for a Democrat would be quite a feat, and hands over the mic to the candidate, who smiles a bit warily, looking like she knows she's been upstaged.\n\nWhen Wexton finishes her spiel, Buttigieg is mobbed by wine-sipping admirers. It takes McKenna a bit of elbowing and sorry-ing to push his way near enough to start nudging his man out the door; there's another crowd of tony Democrats waiting on the other side of Fairfax County. Buttigieg grips and grins his way out the door, feeling that feeling. As we bustle out to the SUV, he looks over at me and says, Yep. You saw that, right?\n\nButtigieg with staff members, from left, Laura O'Sullivan, Mark Bode and Suzanna Fritzberg.\n\nDuring our day trip in October, Buttigieg was coy about his plans for the future. But on Dec. 20, three days after announcing that he wouldn't run for a third term in South Bend, he spoke at the annual Progress Iowa holiday party in Des Moines — signaling his intentions to political observers. In January, he hired Marcus Switzer, Hillary Clinton's 2016 deputy finance director. And in February, following the release of his book, Shortest Way Home: One Mayor's Challenge and a Model for America's Future, Buttigieg plans to strike out across the country on what will likely amount to an exploratory campaign for the presidency.\n\nHe knows that the effort might add up to nothing more than one more instance of winning by losing — raising his profile for whatever else might lie ahead. But he's calculating that the whole bundle of firsts he represents will make him stand out from the pack of senior citizens — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bloomberg, Sanders — and the football-team's worth of middle-aged members of Congress harboring White House dreams.\n\nWhile others might see his age and inexperience as fatal liabilities, Buttigieg recognizes that the path to the White House often evolves. It's actually been a very long time since Democrats recaptured power without a candidate who didn't represent a departure from political norms: the young, Catholic JFK; the up-from-nowhere Southerner Jimmy Carter; the New Democrat Bill Clinton; and Barack Obama, the African American just a few years removed from being an Illinois state senator.\n\nCould it now be time for a millennial? When we catch up in early December, Buttigieg says he saw glimmers of it in 2018: We saw indications that it's okay to talk about our values as Democrats again. That the politics of conviction that appealed to young people, with Bernie in 2016, can also be articulated successfully by the next generation.\n\nI mention that the day before, Biden, on his own book tour, had proclaimed himself the most qualified person in the country to be president. Buttigieg laughs. So was Hillary, he says. Game on.\n\nBob Moser is a writer in Beacon, N.Y.
On Monday, McCain, a new mother, returned to her co-hosting slot on The View for the first time since giving birth last fall. She'd planned to come back before the election, she explained, but unexpected medical complications kicked my butt and doubled her time out of the office.\n\nThe extension prompted a lightbulb moment: As I thought about it, the more angry I got that there weren't women in the rest of America that had the same kind of luxury that I had, she said. It takes personal experience sometimes to get on board.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut now that she was fully onboarded, she had a request for her co-hosts: The women of The View should make paid maternity leave their 2021 mission. They should put [politicians'] feet to the fire — especially members of McCain's own Republican Party who pay lip service to family values — to make paid maternity leave a legislated guarantee.\n\nMcCain is, of course, completely correct. Among the world's 41 wealthiest countries, the United States is the only one that doesn't mandate paid leave — leagues behind top-ranking Estonia, Hungary and the other countries that offer more than a year. Paid parental leave is good for families, good for children and good for working parents, and America's failure on this matter is so self-evident that we don't need to spend more than this one paragraph emphasizing it. Meghan McCain is one thousand percent right.\n\nWhat I'm most interested in is how she got there. Or rather, why it took her so long to get there. Or rather, how we can speed up this process so that it doesn't require every leave-denier to personally birth a child before they also get on board.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWould McCain now support leave if she'd had an easy, complication-free labor? She seemed to be arguing for Congress to specifically support the amount of time she herself had taken: three months. What if she'd recovered after only 10 weeks? Would that then be her policy recommendation? Or conversely, what if her postpartum experience had been even more trying or if she'd lacked the support system of the husband and mother-in-law she said she relied on? Would she be asking the women of The View to stump for four months of paid leave? Five?\n\nWhen co-host Sara Haines suggested that paid leave shouldn't just be for mothers — Dads also need that time, with the modern family structure changing — McCain politely shot her down. I do think we should start with the mother, she said.\n\nPersonal experiences can be powerful and life-altering. But the trouble with policies guided by the personal struggles of famous TV personalities is that they are not based on what average citizens need or what experts determine is optimal. They are based on the solipsism of influential people who are scandalized only by injustices that they experience personally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou saw this with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who only began to support same-sex marriage when his son came out as gay. Or with Jared Kushner, who decided to make criminal justice reform a signature issue because of his father's experiences being convicted and imprisoned for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering. Chris Christie — who, incidentally, had prosecuted Charles Kushner as New Jersey's attorney general — recently filmed a video begging his constituents to wear masks, but only after he'd contracted the coronavirus after attending a White House ceremony, maskless.\n\nYou see it when daughters support universal health care only after their fathers are diagnosed with cancer, or when fathers support access to abortion only when their daughters need one.\n\nIt's funny, McCain's co-host Whoopi Goldberg replied to McCain, in a tone that did not sound amused, it sounded as if she were reminding herself not to pummel a colleague on national television. We've been fighting for this for years. Begging. Screaming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNevertheless, Goldberg nodded along to McCain's request, as did the other co-hosts. Of course they were on board with holding politicians' feet to the fire on this issue. They had been doing so for a long time.\n\nGentleness is the only constructive response. Of course we need to applaud people when they change their minds, of course we need to welcome them wholeheartedly to the team, of course we need to bite our tongues when they discover 40-year-old talking points, of course we need to recognize that someone like McCain might be a more resonant voice for conservative viewers than liberals like Goldberg or Joy Behar. Righteously scolding latecomers is gratifying but counterproductive to the cause — a self-centered move in its own right.\n\nEmpathy is a muscle. It would do all of us good to strengthen it, and that means not just reflecting on our experiences but exercising our imaginations. Imagine a terrible thing happening to you, and how you would like to be treated in the aftermath; now recognize that the terrible thing already happens to thousands of Americans every day. The goal is not to walk a mile in someone else's shoes; the goal is to recognize that someone else's shoes may never fit you and yet they still deserved to be warm and dry.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt should not take a difficult childbirth/a gay son/a wife with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma/a transgender parent to realize that medical bankruptcy or discrimination are terrible, dehumanizing things. People deserve empathy not because we see our own suffering in theirs but because they are people who are suffering.\n\nAnd if a personal experience does bring a specific experience of suffering into focus, have the humility to outsource your ideas about what needs to be done to experts and activists who have thought and cared about the terrible thing for longer than you have.\n\nMeghan McCain's realization about the necessity of universal parental leave is wonderful, and I'm grateful for it. I'm eager to see her try to hold politicians' feet to the fire. And I expect that in doing so, she might have another realization: That it's frustrating to try to persuade people to care about an injustice when they haven't suffered through it themselves.
One of the bummers of getting older, as most baby boomers can attest, is that the list of stuff you don't do as well as you once did keeps getting longer.\n\nBennett Beach, 67, can measure his decline with a stopwatch. Three hours, 27 minutes, 56 seconds: That's the difference between his best time in the Boston Marathon (2:27:26) and his worst (5:55:22).\n\nOn April 17, he'll be running the famous race once again. If he completes the course in less than six hours, he will have officially finished his 50th consecutive Boston Marathon.\n\nNo one has ever done that.\n\nNor, as far as he knows, will any of his 32,000 fellow racers be coping, as he is, with the rare and debilitating neurological movement disorder known as task-specific dystonia. Whenever he strides, Beach's left leg gets hijacked by erratic signals from his brain. His walk is nearly normal, but for the past 15 years he has been running with a severe limp.\n\n[My heart breaks in a million ways: a father passes a disorder to his son]\n\nHis pursuit of the milestone has been fueled in roughly equal measure by antithetical parts — an Ahab-grade obsession mixed with an older-but-wiser acceptance of his body's limits. If someone had told me 30 years ago I'd be struggling to finish this race in six hours, I'd have said, 'Spare me.' Now I'm grateful.\n\nBeach is a marathoner by demeanor: quiet, unassuming, self-effacing, iron-willed. And by body type: 5-foot-7, 125 pounds.\n\nHe played all sports as a kid, distinguishing himself at none: I just didn't have the size or strength. As a senior in prep school, he happened upon a radio broadcast of the Boston Marathon. It was 30 degrees, it was sleeting, and these guys were out there running 26 miles, he remembers. Just the sort of bizarre, crazy thing I was drawn to. I already knew I'd be in Boston the next year, so I decided I'd give it a shot.\n\nHe'd never run a road race before, never had a track coach. As a Harvard freshman the following spring, he cooked up his own one-month workout regimen. He added a mile a day to his training runs until he topped out at 20 miles two days before the big race. Laughably stupid, he now says.\n\nBut it worked just fine. He finished that first marathon in 1968 in 3:23, well under his goal of four hours. Here I was, an athletic washout, running a famous race, hearing my name called by the public-address announcer as I crossed the finish line. It was beyond my wildest dreams. Chokes me up just to think about it.\n\n[I've missed qualifying for the Boston marathon 25 times. Twenty-four.]\n\nWhen the 1972 marathon approached, Beach was no longer living in Boston. He was ringing doorbells in Wisconsin for George McGovern's presidential campaign. By then, the race had its hooks deep enough into his DNA that he flew halfway across the country to run it for a fifth straight time. Psychologically, that's when the streak was born.\n\nI'm a guy who latches on to things, he says. When I find something I like, I do it over and over again. It's become part of my identity.\n\nOn April 2, Beach ran in his 45th consecutive Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run in Washington. (No one else has done that, either.) This fall, he'll host his 45th consecutive tailgate party at the annual Harvard-Yale football game. And on the first day of every month since he and his wife, Carol, started dating — 470 and counting — they do something they've never done before. Ben keeps a list. He can recite it by heart.\n\nThrough the decades — marriage, law school, three kids, a long career as an editor at the Wilderness Society, a grandchild — Ben has also kept running. In his prime, he trained up to 90 miles a week, willing himself into becoming a top-flight marathoner and keeping his times below the three-hour mark until he was just shy of his 50th birthday.\n\nIn 2002, his left leg started to misbehave. Whenever he ran, it would drag or clip his right ankle or fire off at other erratic angles. For four years, he consulted a procession of doctors, all of them baffled. Finally, a neurologist uttered the word dystonia and referred him to the National Institutes of Health near his Bethesda home.\n\nHis problem isn't his muscles, the NIH doctors confirmed. It's his wiring. For reasons medical science doesn't fully comprehend, when his brain sends the stride signal to his left leg, the instructions get scrambled.\n\nThere's no cure for dystonia, but Ben gets partial relief from injections of Botox into his left hamstring every four months. By weakening the muscle, the Botox renders it less susceptible to the neurological chaos.\n\nHe still trains for two hours a day, mostly by running stairs, biking, rowing, swimming or hitting the elliptical, all of which he can do with less difficulty than running. He limits his runs to 15 miles per week, which he calls a lousy way to prepare for a marathon.\n\n[IHow a great marathoner — Joan Benoit Samuelson — keeps going as she nears 60.]\n\nWith his lopsided stride, it's amazing the rest of his body hasn't broken down. But the marathon gets more grueling for him by the year, so much so that his grown kids have taken turns running for stretches alongside him to help keep his spirits up.\n\nIn 2013, Ben got hit with a searing pain in his left calf at the 10-mile mark, the worst muscle pull he'd ever suffered during a race. Stopping was out of the question. A Pennsylvanian who had started his own streak in 1967 had finally succumbed the year before to hip and back pain, so this was the race that would crown Ben as the consecutive-streak king.\n\nIt was also the year of the Boston terrorist bombing. Ben was in his 21st mile, on pace to walk his way to the finish line in just under six hours, when the race was stopped. Eventually, the Boston Athletic Association deemed that every runner who had been at least halfway through would get credit for a finish. That ruling preserved streaks not just for Ben and but also for dozens of others in the marathon's Quarter Century Club.\n\nSince then, Ben has been breaking his own record each time he finishes. And now, with 50 in sight, he's also becoming a bit of a celebrity.\n\nOn the day before the race, he'll be tossing out the first pitch at a Red Sox game (courtesy of a childhood friend with ownership connections). He's also slated to appear at a BAA pre-race news conference and has been featured in a Dystonia Medical Research Foundation news release. His doctors consider him a marvel: We have some patients who are able to continue running, but there's no one like Ben, said Katharine Alter of NIH.\n\nAssuming he can finish this year in under six hours, some of Ben's friends (and maybe Carol, who's way too clever to comment) think he should retire on a high note and a round number rather than wait for time and dystonia to do their thing.\n\nI've been Ben's neighbor and friend for more than 30 years. Gingerly, I raised the subject with him last week as we were tossing a baseball in his back yard, prepping him for the big Fenway Park moment.\n\nHe dismissed the thought with a gentle smile. And no, it's not only because there's another 67-year-old with a 47-year streak nipping at his heels.\n\nIt's because he's still looking ahead, not behind. What he sees is the legend of Johnny Kelley, the most famous Boston Marathoner of all, who ran the race 61 times, finished 58 of them (but only 24 consecutively) and won the event twice. That's the whale he's still chasing.\n\nFifty-eight seems like a long way from here, he said. But I have it in my head that some smart person is going to solve dystonia. That would be a game-changer.\n\nRead More:\n\n[Dystonia often goes undiagnosed.

Martin spoke after the long-awaited release of a 3,000-page report from the Commission on Mother and Baby Homes, which investigated conditions for the 56,000 unmarried mothers and 57,000 children who passed through the system — at 18 homes run by the state and by Catholic charities — from 1920 until 1998, when the last facility was shuttered.\n\nThe unmarried mothers, often destitute, desperate and young, with nowhere else to turn, sought last-ditch refuge in the homes or were shoved into them, having been cast out by their families.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInfant mortality at the institutions was in many years double the national average. Some 9,000 infants died — 15 percent of all those who were born in the system — a statistic the investigators call appalling.\n\nMost of the babies who survived were offered up for adoption, including in the United States, often without full consent by the mothers.\n\nMartin said: We treated women exceptionally badly. We treated children exceptionally badly.\n\nThe Irish leader said his society had suffered from a warped attitude to sexuality and intimacy, with a very striking absence of kindness.\n\nWe honored piety but failed to show even basic kindness to those who needed it most, he said.\n\nAD\n\nNew details of what happened to the women and their babies still have the ability to shock — though testimonies, novels, films and news reports have told of the homes for years.\n\nAD\n\nThe release of the report has dominated the conversation in Ireland, even as the country faces the world's highest rate of coronavirus infections.\n\nThe Irish Times called the findings a condemnation of Irish society in past days, its rigid rules and conventions about sexual matters, its savage intolerance, its harsh judgmentalism, its un-Christian cruelty.\n\nThe impetus for the report came from the discovery of infant remains at the Bon Secours Sisters home in Tuam, western Ireland. Dogged historians discovered death certificates for almost 800 infants at the home but could not find burial records, until the grim excavations began.\n\nAD\n\nWhile much blame has been directed at the Catholic Church and its religious orders, the report stresses that the some of the homes with the most wretched conditions were operated by the local health authorities.\n\nAD\n\nIn his remarks in Parliament, Martin highlighted extracts:\n\nI was treated like a second-class citizen by my family. Society had an obsession with hiding everything, one witness said.\n\nNobody will want you now, said the mother of a witness, pregnant at 14.\n\nGet her put away! were the words of a father of a 19-year old when told of her pregnancy.\n\nSurvivors of the homes have been telling their stories on Irish television, too.\n\nTerri Harrison went to London when she discovered she was pregnant, only to be tracked down by a priest and nuns, who brought her back to Ireland and placed her in a mother and baby home.\n\nAD\n\nIt was 1973, and Harrison was 18 at the time.\n\nThey dehumanized and distanced us but kept reminding us how dirty and filthy we were, she said.\n\nHer son was put in a locked nursery, and she was allowed to see him only at feeding times. And then one day her son was gone.\n\nI fed him at 6 a.m. That was the first feed on the Saturday morning. He would have been five weeks old. I went up, and his cot was empty, she said.\n\nHarrison said: They threatened me with the high courts. They were going to ring my father in his place of work. They were going to put me in the national newspapers, and under no circumstances would I ever be allowed to take my son back because he was happy with his Mommy and Daddy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI couldn't fight them, I didn't have the tools, she said.\n\nThe authors of the report note that the experience of women and children in the 1920s was vastly different than in the 1990s. In the early years, Ireland was an impoverished country, among the poorest in Europe, and life was hard for many, and the homes for unmarried mothers were run like workhouses. In later years, there was schooling, counseling and more services.\n\nBut the report notes that for the unmarried mothers, Ireland wasn't just poor, but a cold harsh environment.\n\nThe investigation found that greatest number of admissions was in the 1960s and early 1970s: The proportion of Irish unmarried mothers who were admitted to mother and baby homes or county homes in the twentieth century was probably the highest in the world.\n\nAD\n\nThe report makes for hard reading: Many of the women did suffer emotional abuse and were often subject to denigration and derogatory remarks. It appears that there was little kindness shown to them and this was particularly the case when they were giving birth.\n\nAD\n\nThe Sisters of Bon Secours, a Catholic religious order, which ran the mother-and-baby-home in Tuam, offered its profound apologies in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe order wrote: We were part of the system in which they suffered hardship, loneliness and terrible hurt. We acknowledge in particular that infants and children who died at the Home were buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way. For all that, we are deeply sorry.\n\nColm O'Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland, said the report absolutely validates the testimony of many survivors and victims over the years who talked about forced labor, appalling acts of abuse and forced adoptions.\n\nAD\n\nAdoption without freedom of consent is not consensual adoption. I don't know how else it can possibly be described, he told The Washington Post.\n\nAD\n\nThese should have been the safest places for children to be born; instead, they were the most dangerous places, he said.\n\nO'Gorman said that while the church had apologized, we've yet to see the church fully acknowledge the degree to which it created and enforced the culture, rather than saying it was merely part of a culture.\n\nHe said it was a mistake to focus on the role of society, as opposed to the role of the Catholic Church and of the state. As if somehow people were free to oppose that dogma and norms of the time. . . . The reality is that up until relatively recently, Ireland was effectively a theocracy.\n\nAD\n\nIn Ireland, the once dominant Catholic Church shared power with the government, overseeing daily lives, running schools, hospitals, nursing homes, social welfare and poverty programs. But in recent years, the Irish have steadily rejected directives from the church, overturning constitutional prohibitions against divorce, birth control, same-sex marriage and abortion.\n\nIf the church is to be fully honest, it needs to acknowledge that it wasn't simply somehow an equal partner in all of this, O'Gorman said, but rather it directed and dominated a culture that stigmatized women, that violated the rights of women and children, that brutalized people in this country and hundreds of thousands of women in particular.\n\nThe Irish prime minister vowed to act on all the recommendations of the report, including a restorative justice program, and to deliver the legislative change necessary to at least start to heal the wounds that endure.
On the Hill\n\nJANUARY SURPRISE: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's decision to signal he is open to impeaching President Trump has dramatically shifted the endgame for the Twitterless man on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nMcConnell's (R-Ky.) turnabout — he was reported by the New York Times to be pleased with the idea of impeaching the president after Trump incited a riot at the U.S. Capitol and Republicans lost the Senate majority — has changed the GOP calculus as the House will today likely vote to impeach the president for the second time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe majority leader's move means, according to Senate Republican aides, White House staffers and GOP strategists we spoke to, it's no longer out of the realm of possibility the Senate could vote to convict the president even as Joe Biden is slated to be sworn in a week from now.\n\n President Trump planned and incited a riot against our democracy to stay in power — that's an impeachable offense,  a GOP Senate aide said point blank.\n\nMcConnell's sway with his caucus? Probably huge, a White House staffer said of the difference it might make in pushing fence-sitters to consider voting to convict Trump, which would require two-thirds of the Senate.\n\nYes, if he really tried and wanted to get to 17 [Republican lawmakers], he probably could, a former GOP Senate aide told Power Up.\n\nSo which 17 Republican members might ultimately convict Trump? One GOP strategist speculated Trump's removal might be supported by old, random members 96 percent of the country couldn't pick out of a lineup.\n\nReceipts, please: The Kentucky Republican has yet to make a personal commitment to vote to convict Trump. And some view his telegraphing a desire to purge Trump from the party and private conclusion that Trump has probably committed impeachable offenses to the Times's Jonathan Martin, Maggie Haberman, and Nick Fandos as the most expedient way to create an opening for Republicans to move away from Trump and embrace other GOP leaders.\n\nI'm not really sure he wants to remove him… just wants to bring down Trump's popularity enough that it becomes okay again to criticize him, the former GOP Senate aide added.\n\nA person who spoke with McConnell told our colleagues Josh Dawsey and Phil Rucker the soon-to-be minority leader still wants to hear evidence.\n\nThe marriage of convenience between McConnell and Trump has essentially collapsed in recent weeks. They haven't spoken since Dec. 14 and McConnell has told others he never plans to speak to Trump again and is furious with him, Josh reports.\n\nTL;DR: If Mitch is a yes, [Trump's] done, a Senate GOP source told CNN.\n\nYet McConnell's move has opened the floodgates for others Republicans to turn against Trump as the House prepares to vote this afternoon on a single article of impeachment charging Trump with incitement of insurrection. It's created a roller-coaster situation for Republicans who are hemming and hawing over how to proceed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAn unrepentant Trump did not help his own case: during a visit to Alamo, Tex. on Tuesday. During the president's first public appearance in six days, he denied any responsibility for the violent riot that resulted in several deaths.\n\nHe said his remarks encouraging throngs of supporters last Wednesday to march to the Capitol in a show of force to pressure and intimidate lawmakers to overturn the election results were 'totally appropriate,' per Josh and Phil.\n\nThe impeachment hoax is a continuation of the greatest and most vicious witch hunt in the history of our country and is causing tremendous anger and division and pain, far greater than most people will ever understand, which is very dangerous for the U.S.A., especially at this very tender time, Trump told reporters.\n\nCount 'em: At least five House Republicans are expected to join Democrats in impeaching Trump, making him the first president in American history to be impeached twice. The third ranking House Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), who the president explicitly called weak and encouraged his supporters to get rid of during his pre-riot speech, has backed the impeachment effort, along with the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. John Katko (N.Y.).\n\nThere has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution, Cheney said in a statement. I will vote to impeach the president.\n\n Cheney's historic decision Tuesday to vote to impeach President Trump had its roots in a dramatic phone call from her father, former vice president Richard B. Cheney, who was watching events unfold on television last week and warned that she was being verbally attacked by the president, our colleague Cheney's historic decision Tuesday to vote to impeach President Trump had its roots in a dramatic phone call from her father, former vice president Richard B. Cheney, who was watching events unfold on television last week and warned that she was being verbally attacked by the president, our colleague Michael Kranish reports\n\nThe rest of 'em: Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) became the fourth House Republican to support impeaching Trump, according to our colleague Mike DeBonis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) yesterday signed on: There is no doubt in my mind that the President of the United States broke his oath of office and incited this insurrection … I will vote in favor of impeachment.\n\n: I believe President Trump acted against his oath of office, so I will vote to impeach him. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.) became the fifth to say she'll vote yeaI believe President Trump acted against his oath of office, so I will vote to impeach him.\n\nOur colleague J.M. Rieger is keeping track of the GOP defectors here. The number could very well rise throughout the day.\n\nAlternative justice: Six House Republicans introduced a resolution censuring Trump for trying to overturn his defeat in the presidential race and violating his oath of office, according to our colleague Felicia Sonmez — an off-ramp of sorts.\n\nMy Kevin — Trump's fabled pet-name for the top House Republican Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) — will not be whipping his members one way or the other. The minority leader, however, has been a source of frustration for members who believe he's not done enough to distance himself from the president in the wake of last week's riot.\n\nMcCarthy has not publicly said whether he supports the impeachment process but is personally opposed to impeachment, per the Times.\n\nHe previously supported the extreme and ill-fated attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the Supreme Court last month,  our  our colleague Aaron Blake notes. McCarthy also stood back as McConnell issued strong statements about the election being over, essentially foreclosing the idea that the Senate would comply with House Republicans' attempt to overturn the result.\n\nSince last Wednesday's attack, McCarthy has been all over the place, veering from asking Republican colleagues if he should call on Mr. Trump to resign to privately floating impeachment to his current posture, opposed to impeachment but open to a censure. He even approached Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, about a censure vote, saying he could deliver a large number of Republican votes for a formal rebuke if Democrats backed off impeachment, Martin and Haberman report.\n\n👀: After four years with no daylight between the two, a Republican Hill staffer notes to Power Up: It's very interesting that Kevin McCarthy is now working to distance himself from Trump with everything his office is leaking about their conversations — and he can't be on the receiving end of a mean Trump tweet.\n\nAbout last night: the House adopted a resolution officially calling on Vice President Pence to remove Trump from office by invoking the 25th Amendment.

The court's three liberals, Justices Stephen G.

If his 6-foot-6 frame and familiar face, covered by a beard but not a mask, didn't give away Keller's identity to those who knew him, one chilling, telltale detail certainly did: the Team USA jacket he was wearing, with the U.S. Olympic team patch on the front left shoulder.\n\nBut in the aftermath of last week's abortive insurrection at the Capitol — which resulted in five deaths and left Keller, along with others who participated, facing federal charges — the questions haunting his friends, former teammates and ex-coaches are the ones they have struggled to answer: How? And why?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHow did Keller become so radicalized as to join thousands — including, according to media reports, members of white nationalist and extremist groups — in what some have characterized as an attempted overthrow of the U.S. government? Rioters smashed windows and doors, ransacked congressional offices and violently attacked U.S. Capitol Police officers, killing one of them.\n\nAnd why, after working to turn his life around in recent years following a bottoming-out in 2014, would Keller risk it all in such a reckless way?\n\nThat's what's so confounding. I just can't answer those, said Gary Hall Jr., a 10-time Olympic medalist who has known Keller since childhood and was his Olympic teammate in Sydney in 2000 and in Athens in 2004. For him to throw everything away, I don't understand it. It's very, very troubling.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKeller, 38, was charged in U.S. District Court on Wednesday with three counts related to the Jan. 6 uprising at the Capitol, in which supporters of President Trump, who lost the 2020 election, smashed their way into the building and clashed with police in an attempt to disrupt the counting of electoral votes.\n\nHe was taken into custody Thursday in Colorado, where he lives, and made an initial court appearance there before being released on a personal recognizance bond. He did not respond to interview requests. If convicted of all three counts — violent entry, disorderly conduct and obstructing law enforcement — Keller could face up to 15½ years in prison.\n\nWithin the tightknit community of Olympic swimmers, Keller was known as a carefree spirit and a mighty freestyler who gained the respect of peers and a measure of national fame for anchoring the 800-meter freestyle relay in 2004 that vanquished the Australians and earned Michael Phelps the fifth of his six gold medals in Athens. Among those fellow swimmers, the news of Keller's involvement was surprising but not particularly shocking.\n\nNot shocking because his friends knew him to be a staunch conservative and gun aficionado — one described him as infatuated with guns — whose posts on social media in recent years had shown him to be an increasingly fervent Trump supporter. (Keller's social media accounts have since been deleted, and messages to him have gone unreturned. There have been no indications Keller was armed Jan. 6.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of those friends and ex-teammates were also familiar with the difficult trajectory of Keller's post-competition life, which included a divorce and child-custody fight and a brief period of homelessness, during which Keller was living out of his car and sleeping in a Walmart parking lot.\n\nKlete and I no longer have a personal relationship, [because] during and since his swimming career he's had many personal issues [that] he's chosen not to address, Cari Sherrill, Keller's ex-wife and the mother of his three children, said in a text message. That in itself has always been concerning and continues to be.\n\nThree-time Olympian and two-time medalist Tom Malchow, Keller's roommate in Sydney and Athens and a Team USA captain at the latter, said he hadn't spoken to Keller in about seven years but now regrets not reaching out to him.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI think we all wish we had done a little more to help him find his way outside of the Olympics, Malchow said. A lot of people struggle after their careers end. You're a hero. You have all these people catering to your needs, taking care of you. And when that ride is over, real life, unfortunately, is just different.\n\nBut at least among the former teammates, coaches and swimming insiders interviewed for this story, the news was still surprising. Because nothing, they said, revealed any inclination Keller might go so far as to travel from his Colorado Springs home to Washington and join thousands of other Trump supporters in violently protesting the certification of an election the president falsely characterized as fraudulent.\n\nI just don't know what would have sparked this in him, said longtime U.S. Olympic coach Jon Urbanchek, who has remained in touch with Keller following the latter's retirement from competitive swimming in 2008; he last corresponded with him in November. Keller, Urbanchek said, had a great heart.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany in Keller's circles also knew that he appeared to have turned his life around in recent years, starting work as a real estate agent in Colorado Springs and launching a website, theolympicagent.com, that touted his athletic achievements — I bring an Olympic effort to the business, his website reads — and included pictures of Keller with his kids. Some were aware Keller also had recently gotten engaged. (The most recent brokerage to employ Keller, Hoff & Leigh, scrubbed all references to him from its website and said in a statement he had resigned from his position.)\n\nHe was just starting to pull his life back together, Hall said in a telephone interview. He had a job. He got engaged. To see all that implode is just heartbreaking.\n\nLike others interviewed for this story, Hall, who has known Keller since they came up together as kids through the same Phoenix-area swim club, had a difficult time squaring the Klete he knew during their competition days with the one he saw on those videos.\n\nKlete and I stand on opposite sides of the political spectrum, Hall said. What any protester did in storming the Capitol is a despicable act. I want to be very clear: I condemn that behavior. Having said that, my heart is broken. I feel such a heavy weight knowing that he was involved. Because somewhere underneath all that mess, he's a decent guy that his teammates care deeply about.\n\n'A lost soul'\n\nOn the Today show the morning of Aug. 18, 2004, host Katie Couric called him the Giant Keller — a pun that made reference both to Keller's height and the fact that the night before, in the finals of the 800-meter freestyle relay, he had held off Australian legend Ian Thorpe in the anchor leg to win gold for Team USA.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI knew Klete would come through, Phelps told the media. His swim was the reason we won that relay. He held off the greatest 200[-meter] freestylist in history.\n\nWhy was Keller, 22 at the time, chosen to face off against the great Thorpe, instead of one of the rising young stars — Phelps, who swam the first leg, or Ryan Lochte, who went second?\n\nEvery time we really wanted to win a relay, we put Klete at anchor, said Urbanchek, Keller's coach through much of his competitive career and a coach on all three Olympic teams for which Keller competed. He wasn't afraid of straining until it hurt. He wasn't afraid to be challenged.\n\nMalchow, who trained with Keller under Urbanchek, called Keller a model teammate, saying: He was a fun guy. He always had your back. He'd be the first one there to pick you up after a bad race.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLongtime University of Southern California and Olympic team coach Dave Salo, who trained Keller at Trojan Swim Club for the latter's final Olympics in 2008, recalled him as a carefree type who would sometimes saunter into practice a little late, unconcerned with drawing the wrath of his coach and teammates. He said Keller, who had dropped out of USC in 2001 to turn professional and focus on swimming, finished his degree in public policy and real estate development after the Beijing Olympics.\n\nI would run into him periodically, Salo said. He was very focused on finishing that degree. He felt it was unfinished business.\n\nBut Keller struggled acutely to adapt to life after swimming, telling NBCSports.com in 2014 that he should have retired after the 2004 Olympics. Instead, he trained for another four-year quad culminating in Beijing 2008, where he won another gold in the 800-meter freestyle relay — his second gold, to go with one silver and two bronzes.\n\nI should've put a lot more time into thinking about … what I was doing after swimming. I just got tunnel vision with swimming, Keller said then. You get done, and you're like, 'Oh, God, what do you do now?' If I could go back, I probably wouldn't have done another Olympics. I would've retired after Athens and probably went back to school.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy January 2014, Keller was divorced, jobless and, briefly, homeless, according to an interview he gave to USA Swimming's website in 2018. At one point, he said, he went four years without being allowed to see his kids despite living just 10 minutes from them. In the story, which has been removed from USA Swimming's website, Keller took responsibility for how his life bottomed out.\n\nWithin a matter of a few years, I went from Olympic gold medalist to husband, homeowner, guy with a series of sales jobs — life insurance, software, medical devices, financial products — and father of three, and I had a really difficult time accepting who I was without swimming in my life, he said. I really struggled with things. I didn't enjoy my work, and that unhappiness and lack of identity started creeping into my marriage.\n\nKeller also described his bout of homelessness, during which he lived out of a Ford Fusion. At 6-foot-6, it was challenging to make room to sleep, he recalled. He slept in the parking lots of Walmarts and rest stops, using a gym membership he had managed to hold on to to take showers.\n\nIn swimming, you have to be selfish to a large degree to be successful. But when you are a husband and father, you have to be more selfless — and I wasn't, he said then. As I look back now, I wasn't a very good husband. But now, I feel like I've come through the darkness and found the light that I always wanted and needed to be happy. I'm getting there.\n\nOlympic swimmers, even across different generations, often speak of their ranks as a fraternity and refer to each other as brothers and sisters. But many lost touch with Keller during this dark period. The 2018 story on USA Swimming's website served as a comforting bit of news: It looked as if Keller had turned his life around.\n\nThat sense of comfort was shattered in the aftermath of Jan. 6. Seeing Keller in those videos drove the reality home with his former teammates: He wasn't better. Their optimism was replaced by horror and those haunting questions: How? Why?\n\nOne of Keller's former Olympic teammates, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss Keller's apparent descent, drew a line from the goofy, oafish swimmer he knew in the 2000s to the aimless, rudderless, 30-something man who, he speculated, became a perfect candidate to fall into a radical, conservative rabbit hole of conspiracy theorists and rioters involved in insurrection.\n\nHe was a lost soul, long before the Trump thing, said Rowdy Gaines, a three-time gold medalist at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics who, as NBC's lead commentator since 1996, serves as the unofficial voice and face of the sport to its many fans. He hit some hard times where he went through some things in life that probably wouldn't be real good for anyone. Sometimes when you get lost, you become a follower instead of a leader.\n\nA towering figure\n\nMel Stewart started getting the text messages only a few days after the attack on the Capitol. A video shot by a reporter from right-wing media outlet Townhall showed a figure who looked a lot like Klete Keller, towering over the other people in the video as they surged into the Rotunda.\n\nStewart, a two-time Olympian and three-time medalist, is also the publisher of SwimSwam, a leading swimming website and magazine that he co-founded in 2012. The texts he received in the days after Jan. 6 began with a trickle and, as word got around the Olympic swimming community, eventually became a flood.\n\nIt was just a giant mushroom cloud going out, Stewart said of the video. At a certain point, I had to start telling people: 'Yes, I've seen it. Stop sending it to me.' \n\nSwimSwam broke the news of Keller's apparent involvement in the attack Monday, blasting the news well beyond the insular world of elite, Olympic-level swimming. The reactions, in some cases influenced by political viewpoint, ranged from anger to concern to indifference. Some demanded that USA Swimming or the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee strip Keller of his medals, a power neither body possesses. Others took pains to point out Keller is never shown instigating any violence toward Capitol Police, at least in the parts of the videos made public. At one point, he is seen standing calmly in the Rotunda holding a bottle of water.\n\nHe stands out as a 6-foot-6 guy in a USA jacket, Salo said. But he wasn't stealing a lectern. He didn't seem threatening. I don't know that there should be too much criticism of someone who was voicing their opinion. … I don't think he was part of the group that was trying to do anything but protest. I think he was probably caught up in the crowd surging towards the Capitol.\n\nMalchow said the former teammates he has communicated with since the video came to light were mostly like-minded in condemning the act: Obviously, he has a right to stand up and support Trump, Malchow said. But we also have to abide by the rule of law.\n\nThose in the Olympic swimming community, no matter their political bent, appeared united over one aspect of Keller's involvement: the notion that he tarnished all of them by choosing to wear that jacket.\n\nThe reactions I was getting were: 'Oh, my God. I can't believe he's wearing the Olympic garb,'  said Stewart. There was some anger.\n\nIt's a terrible reflection on the sport and the Olympic team, Hall said. Great care is taken to remove any political agenda from Team USA. For him to drag that in by wearing the sacred colors was especially painful.\n\nIt embarrasses the movement when you do that, Gaines said. It's embarrassing to the sport, and it's embarrassing to my other brothers and sisters.\n\nNeither USA Swimming nor the USOPC has addressed questions regarding Keller, but USA Swimming sent a message to members Wednesday. [W]hile we respect private individuals' and groups' rights to peacefully protest, we strongly condemned the unlawful actions taken by those at the Capitol last week, it read. It is very simple and very clear. Mr. Keller's actions in no way represent the values or mission of USA Swimming.\n\nGaines, who called Keller's greatest race from the NBC broadcast booth on that August day in Athens more than 16 years before, saw something else in Keller's choice of outerwear Jan. 6: a call for help.
We're focused on an intersectional, international strategy that sets the narrative for 2020, said Linda Sarsour, one of the four co-founders of the Women's March. You want to knock on our door and get our vote in 2020? You'd better get with the agenda.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut there's no spinning it: Women's March Inc., which has organized the largest rallies and political campaigns of the young movement, is coming into 2019 dogged by controversy. Tamika Mallory, one of the group's other co-founders, has associated with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, has never completely denounced his anti-Semitism, and has been accused of holding her own conspiratorial beliefs about Jews.\n\nAs The Post's Marissa J. Lang has reported, a number of marches that never relied on Women's March Inc. for support have issued statements saying they have nothing to do with Sarsour's group. The Democratic National Committee and nearly 300 other organizations that endorsed the 2017 march are no longer affiliated with it. Few actual or potential Democratic 2020 candidates are planning to wade into the crowds.\n\nWhat began as an astoundingly successful grass-roots organization has become a politically fraught one, in ways that could shape Democratic politics and the 2020 primaries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe 2017 Women's March was a seminal event for Democrats, especially those with presidential ambitions. In speeches and memoirs, many of them have referred to the event as the beginning of a real resistance to the Trump presidency, even more than the surprisingly successful health-care rallies that took place before the inauguration.\n\nIt was a clear, heroic story line: First women marched, then they organized, and then they won. They drew a direct line from the 2017 rallies, organized by Women's March, to the 2018 campaign, which the Women's March engaged in through rallies and voter registration drives, to the victory that created the largest class of women in Congress.\n\nNo one could move, but everyone seemed to understand that the march was a glimpse of a new kind of coalition whose true strength had yet to be tested, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) wrote in her in new memoir, about the Washington march.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn a cold, bright, Saturday morning, something special was happening, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wrote in her own memoir, about a women's march in Boston. I knew that we had tens of millions of people with us and that this fight would be our fight.\n\nNeither Harris nor Warren will participate in a women's march event this weekend. Representatives for most of the Democrats seen as likely 2020 candidates said that they would not be at the events — not citing the controversy, but tacitly acknowledging that the march was no longer the sort of event they must participate in. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a short interview that she will be attending a funeral; a spokesman for Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who attended the 2017 march in Washington, said he will be traveling Saturday.\n\nThe Democrats who are going to march this weekend have also had to tread carefully. A spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti noted that he will be attending a march that is not affiliated with Women's March Inc. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) will attend a Women's March-affiliated event in Des Moines; asked first by Buzzfeed's Ruby Cramer, she responded to the anti-Semitism controversy by emphasizing that local organizers were running the event she'd be attending.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSenator Gillibrand strongly condemns anti-Semitism from anyone, in all forms, and believes it has no place in a movement for women's empowerment or anywhere else, her campaign said.\n\nOn its own, attending or skipping one march shouldn't say much about a candidate, and schedule conflicts can be real. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt), who spoke at the 2017 march in Burlington, has not ruled out attending a march this weekend, but just two weeks ago he hosted Sarsour and Women's March co-founder Bob Bland at his Senate swearing-in party. (Sarsour worked on Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign.) And Gillibrand has never distanced herself from the national organization.\n\nSenator Gillibrand has been an ally to us and a leader on a number of fights, said Winnie Wong, a Women's March organizer focusing on the Medicare-for-all lobby day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEvery time a party gains power, it reassesses its relationship to grass-roots organizers, and those organizers become bigger, more important targets for critics. Democrats have to deal with an inevitable and sticky fact of politics — associating with activists or politicians who come under fire for their own associations or remarks. For some Republicans, the ostracization of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) over his racist remarks was meant to signal that their party policed itself and Democrats did not.\n\nI've watched Democrats being accused of different crimes, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said after stripping King of his committee assignments. I've watched Democrats say things that are offensive to all Americans. The real challenge here: I've watched the Speaker be silent.\n\nMcCarthy did not name names, but within days, the New York Post and the Washington Examiner had published columns asking why, if Republicans could condemn King, Democrats could not condemn new Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a Palestinian American who had asked whether supporters of legislation to punish boycotts of Israel forgot what country they represent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, McCarthy and other House GOP leaders asked Democrats to condemn a 2012 tweet in which Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), a new member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that Israel had hypnotized the world and to distance themselves from Omar's support for the boycott, divestment, and sactions movement. (Omar has pointed out that her tweet was opposing airstrikes Israel was carrying out across the Gaza Strip.)\n\nPelosi must make Tlaib pay a price for her use of the language of Jew-hatred, Jonathan Tobin wrote in the New York Post. If she doesn't, it won't just be a matter of hypocrisy but a sign of the growing tolerance for anti-Semitism on the left.\n\nPlenty of liberal-leaning writers have pushed back on the idea that supporting BDS is anti-Semitic; Republicans have replied by pointing out that Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) says that it is. The Democratic Party's shift to the left since 2016 hasn't met much resistance from its establishment and didn't stop it from winning the midterms. But many campaigns have been tripped up by associations, both by having them and by seeming skittish if they ended them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWomen's March Inc. is plowing ahead, cognizant of how the controversy has altered its role. It's no longer part of the cadre of liberal groups that Democrats will comfortably line up with.\n\nThis is a social movement, a decentralized protest movement, focused on building institutional power and capacity, Wong said. Trump and his cronies are doing a good job of derailing what the new House had wanted to focus on. The shutdown has been a massive distraction. And so, once again, the Women's March is leading and bringing the focus where it should be, while Democrats have been sidetracked.\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\nWill you vote to reelect Trump? (NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist, 873 registered voters)\n\nAD\n\nNo — 57%\n\nYes — 30%\n\nThis is an unspinnably bad poll for the president, coming just a few days after Brad Parscale, his 2020 campaign manager, said internal data showed him in his strongest-ever position. Other presidents have seen the won't reelect number surge past the will reelect number and prevailed. That happened to Bill Clinton; it happened to Barack Obama. But we're three weeks into the shutdown with no public data that suggests it has fixed the president's problems outside his base. Even 7 percent of voters who backed the president in 2016 say they would not in 2020; if he gained no additional voters, that would put him at 43 percent support, wiping out his win margins in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAD\n\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\n\nJust two weeks into the 116th Congress, we have a member pulling the ripcord: Rep. Tom Marino (R-Pa.), a five-term conservative who arrived in Washington with the tea party wave.\n\nThe words special election and Pennsylvania are enough to induce terror in Republicans after their disastrous 2018 performance in the state. The year began with them losing a once-safe district to Rep. Conor Lamb (D) and ended with them getting blown out statewide while dropping three more seats — and holding three more by single digits.\n\nBut it would take a true political disaster for Marino's 12th Congressional District to become competitive. As drawn by a panel of judges last year, it covers a large rural swath of north and central Pennsylvania that was never very friendly to Democrats and has grown downright inhospitable.\n\nMarino was first elected in 2010 to represent much of the same territory, in what was at the time the most Republican-leaning Pennsylvania district represented by a Democrat. Chris Carney, a moderate Democrat who'd worked on counterintelligence for the Bush administration, won the seat in 2006 after Don Sherwood, a formerly safe Republican incumbent, was revealed to have conducted a years-long abusive affair.\n\nCarney won that election narrowly and won a second term in 2008 by running far ahead of Barack Obama. But Marino defeated him by 10 points and held onto the seat comfortably after two rounds of redistricting. In 2016, President Trump carried the district with 66.1 percent of the vote, one of his strongest performances anywhere in the state.\n\nTwo years later, as Democrats swept the state, Marino won his final term by 32 points. But even Scott Wagner, the Republican nominee for governor who lost statewide by 17.1 points, carried Marino's seat by 20. It's never a good sign when an incumbent heads for the exits, but a Republican loss here would take an even more dramatic swing than the one that elected Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.).\n\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\n\nLike Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand ended one of the first days of her presidential campaign (sorry, yes, exploratory committee, fine) with an interview on The Rachel Maddow Show. But the setups couldn't have been more different.\n\nMaddow's interview with Warren began with a preroll of the senator's interviews on NBC News as a consumer rights advocate, demonstrating that the senator had been building a record for years before she ever ran for office. The interview with Gillibrand began with the story of how she flipped a historically Republican House seat in Upstate New York.\n\nShe had conservative bona fides,Maddow said. She had an A rating from the NRA. She said she wanted to make English the official language of the U.S.A. Her first question to Gillibrand began with this: Tell me about that transformation.\n\nFor once, liberal members of the media are asking the same questions that Republicans are raising. The Republican National Committee welcomed chameleon Kirsten to the 2020 campaign by predicting that she'd be apologizing for the stances she'd held in her four years representing the upper Hudson Valley. Indeed, she's been moving left ever since her 2009 appointment to the Senate and has explained her transition as a process of steady, informed evolution.\n\nOn gun rights, for example, Gillibrand told Maddow that her eyes were opened as soon as she began talking to her new constituents in New York City. I traveled to Brooklyn, and I met with a family who had just lost their daughter, she said. I just knew I was wrong.\n\nThere are many ways to divvy up the Democratic field: One easy way is to divide the evolved candidates with the ones who've never really changed. Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) frequently point out that he has talked (and to some extent looked) the same for his entire career in politics, advocating for a European-style welfare state, moving to the left on only gun rights and some aspects of criminal justice reform. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), a 2016 Sanders backer who is bidding for his voters, has already apologized for her previous, heated opposition to LGBT rights, releasing a three-minute video this week to explain how she changed.\n\nSanders's consistency was one of his greatest assets in 2016, but the next Democratic field will probably include several candidates who've never really changed. Neither Warren nor John Delaney had run for office before 2012. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has always been a center-left politician, evolving on only same-sex marriage; Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has a voting record that doesn't start until January 2017, though she is already taking fire for her record as a California prosecutor. Many others with longer résumés will have changes to account for.\n\nIn past campaigns, Democrats have foundered over accusations of flip-flopping. What has changed since then? Basically, it was the victory of Donald Trump, who rolled into his 2016 campaign with a long, often videotaped record of liberal statements. There is a precedent now for telling voters how you evolved and why you won't change back and for making commitments to interest groups that you'll deliver for them. But the candidates who never had to evolve have it easier.\n\n2020\n\nSeth Moulton. His attempt to block Nancy Pelosi from the speaker's gavel didn't work, but he's heading to speak to suburban Democrats in New Hampshire on Feb. 2. As the Boston Globe's James Pindell points out, Moulton has never ruled out a bid for president.\n\nSherrod Brown. He will launch a dignity of work tour in Cleveland on Jan. 30, heading from there to the first four primary states. There is no set timeline for a Brown announcement or exploratory committee.\n\nEric Swalwell. He's traveling around the South for Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, spending the day itself at events in Atlanta.\n\nKamala Harris. She's the focus of a devastating Laura Bazelon column on her prosecutorial record, which remains the single biggest impediment in her effort.\n\nJoe Biden. He'll be an honoree at the Rev. Al Sharpton's MLK Day breakfast in Washington.\n\nMike Bloomberg. He'll join Sharpton at the same event as Biden.\n\nREADING LIST\n\nHow policy decisions spawned today's hyperpoliticized media, by Kevin Kruse and Julian Zelizer\n\nThe story of how unwinding the Fairness Doctrine created a market for hard-charging partisan TV, which a few decades later elected a president.\n\nThe shutdown is giving some Trump advisers what they've long wanted: A smaller government, by Lisa Rein, Robert Costa and Danielle Paquette\n\nEvery modern shutdown eventually gets to this point: some conservative speculation that voters will learn how little they need the government and urge Congress to shrink it.\n\nJack Dorsey has no clue what he wants, by Ashley Feinberg\n\nA tough Q&A with the man who, more than anyone, could shape the social media conversation about 2020.\n\nCOUNTDOWN
Thus, the mere title of James Wyllie's new book, Nazi Wives: The Women at the Top of Hitler's Germany, promises a delicious opportunity to answer a few of those more intimate questions about a group of towering figures in the canon of male monstrosity. They are so well-known that their surnames are all we need to summon the epochal evils of Hitler's regime: Goebbels, the minister of propaganda; Goering, the Luftwaffe commander and second-most-powerful Nazi; Heydrich, Gestapo chief and final solution architect; Himmler, the SS chief and Holocaust implementer; Hess, deputy Führer; and Bormann, Hitler's private secretary. All of them had their specific remit of horrors, and all of them were committed to Adolf Hitler and the anti-Semitic, racist, xenophobic and totalitarian values of his regime. In seeing the dynamics of their married lives, do we learn something more about these men — their motivations, their petty jealousies, their messy and repugnant humanity — that could shed light on what they did?\n\nFor years, the role of women in Nazi Germany was eclipsed by the preoccupation with the actions of prominent men. Then, as Wyllie notes, in the 1980s feminist scholarship began to examine this world. In her book Hitler's Furies: German Women in the Nazi Killing Fields (a 2013 finalist for National Book Award), Wendy Lower observed, The consensus in Holocaust and genocide studies is that the systems that make mass murder possible would not function without the broad participation of society, and yet nearly all histories of the Holocaust leave out half of those who populated that society, as if women's history happens somewhere else. Lower looked at the women in the trenches, the wives of some of the camp leaders, and women who worked as willing agents for the regime.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf these women were the worker bees, Wyllie, a British author, screenwriter and broadcaster, focuses on the queens. The women who in various ways competed for Hitler's attention to embody the beau ideal of womanhood in the Reich: fecund, contentedly subservient, vying for the Fürher's admiration. Extra points for a sense of humor. Ilse Hess, who unfortunately had a husband who made the mistake of getting captured in Scotland in 1941 because of a botched diplomatic mission and spent his life imprisoned, would describe how much Hitler enjoyed a good laugh; not one for telling jokes, Hitler did impressions and liked nothing better than listening to a well-told funny story as long as it wasn't about him. You don't get this from learned histories of World War II.\n\nDespite Hitler's well-known bachelorhood (until his hasty, pre-suicide marriage to Eva Braun), his leadership was required to be married, never divorce and have many children. Magda Goebbels for many years claimed the title of first lady of the Reich for her blond beauty and for the six blond and beautiful children she had with her wily and serially unfaithful husband, the Nazi propaganda minister. Wyllie describes her rather dignified desire to have a quiet divorce while her husband was enmeshed in another passionate romance, and her genuine suffering when that was denied. In a gesture of ultimate loyalty, or despair, the parents poisoned all six children on May 1, 1945, before poisoning themselves.\n\nHermann Goering was widowed in 1931, when his beloved and always sickly Swedish wife, Carin, died after a heart attack. But Carin's presence throughout his subsequent marriage to the actress Emmy Sonnemann seemed to border on a menage a trois. Her name was affixed to their home and to his yachts; her portraits hung prominently. Nonetheless, Emmy, with her beauty, talent and wit, could ignore her predecessor as she enjoyed the incredible riches bestowed on her by her predacious husband: several estates, castles, lavish jewels, and most notably an astonishing art collection accumulated from the Reich's various conquests and from Jewish collectors who were sent to the camps. Early on, she became another favorite of Hitler's, serving as hostess at many official functions and becoming another first lady of the Reich.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer thespian self-confidence, combined with her cosseted life, made her a bit too arrogant and condescending to Eva Braun, whom she held in special contempt. The ever-loyal, emotionally unstable and utterly immature Braun flits in and out of the lives of several of the wives, forging alliances but breaking others. Hitler, who clearly had more important things to worry about than the complaints of his mistress, sent Goering a harsh note demanding that his wife treat Eva with more respect. After that, Emmy lost her standing in Hitler's inner circle but compensated with her position as the wife of one of the most powerful, and certainly one of the wealthiest, men in Europe.\n\nGoering and Carin never had children, and his sexuality never matched the robust promiscuity of Joseph Goebbels and Reinhard Heydrich. As Wyllie writes, Emmy and Goering's sex life had already given rise to a number of wedding night jokes that focused on his performance in the bedroom (for example, that Emmy had stopped going to church after their honeymoon because she'd lost faith in the resurrection of the flesh). Eventually, they had a daughter, Edda, and Goering celebrated by having 500 planes fly over Berlin in their honor. (Edda died in 2018, still loyal to her dad.)\n\nWyllie acknowledges that much of the source material has to be treated with caution. But he recounts their stories with a bracing combination of scholarship and an almost cinematic — not surprising, given his other work — approach to spinning a compelling narrative. While the bombing of Britain, the Russian campaign, the Holocaust, the unspeakable suffering inflicted on humanity by these people unfolded as an international catastrophe, Wyllie shows us the petty competitions, the moments of domestic sadism, the appalling grift and the daily lives of those responsible for it. Like in the most banal Real Housewives episode, we see the in-groups and out-groups establish themselves. Margaret Himmler, corpulent and determined, and Lina Heydrich, lacking any public stature or particular charisma, were never included in what Wyllie describes as the Berghof clique. And so they involved their husbands. There is something disorienting about imagining Heinrich Himmler, the man who created the unsparing efficiency of the Nazi extermination machine, chiding his SS colleague Heydrich about the behavior of his wife.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven though they might not have been privy to their husbands' daily decisions, Wyllie writes, the evidence of their murderous work was all around: the looted art on the walls; the furniture made from human skin and bones stashed in the attic; the fruit and vegetables taken from the local concentration camp gardens; the slave labor tilling their land. In the end, one is left thinking that the question of how could she possibly be married to him may not be the right one. Instead, I thought of what Samuel Butler once wrote about the marriage of Jane and Thomas Carlyle: It was very good of God to let Carlyle and Mrs. Carlyle marry one another, and so make only two people miserable and not four.\n\nNazi Wives\n\nThe Women\n\nat the Top\n\nof Hitler's Germany\n\nBy James Wyllie
Hey, Carolyn: I'm writing from the mudroom of my house, to give you some perspective:\n\nMy wife has always claimed she's much better friends with her family — her parents and grandparents — and prefers them over friends. I thought this was an exaggeration until I realized she doesn't maintain friendships at all!\n\nAnyway, her parents came into town today, and even though she talks to them almost daily, they've taken over the family room discussing medical directives and other extremely personal family matters without a worry about me. I've been playing games in the mudroom for at least 25 minutes and they don't even realize I'm missing!\n\nI know my wife will say it's because she doesn't get to see her family often (true). But every time we do see them, she ditches me to discuss family matters while I fend for myself. I love her family, but I feel marriage should be a lot more inclusive.\n\nI grew up in a very impersonal family so maybe I'm blowing this out of proportion.\n\n— Vaping in the Boys Room\n\nVaping in the Boys Room: I don't have great news for you on the should front, because people don't do what they should — they do what they do.\n\nIt sounds as if your family didn't serve you well in this regard. Their detachment left you to figure out on your own how families get and stay close, and when kids in your position become adults, it's common for the outcome to look a lot like the one you're living now: one with expectations built on an imagined version of how things are supposed to be.\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, necessarily. You just believed in your vision over what reality tried to say.\n\nThat would explain why you expected your wife to maintain typical friendships even as she told you herself, outright, that she preferred family to friends. And why you expect to be included in family visits even as your wife ditches you every time.\n\nThe good news is, a marriage — a life — built around reality is so much more satisfying than whatever we think should happen, messier though it may be. Your wife doesn't have to have outside friendships for a happy marriage. You don't have to be included in the medical-directives conversations for a happy marriage.\n\nThe more important thing to have is always available: awareness of what you can and can't change. You can't make your wife cultivate outside friendships, but you can cultivate them. You can encourage your wife to join you when you see these friends and choose not to mind if she opts out.\n\nLikewise, you can't change how she conducts family visits, but you can choose to make an effort to join their discussions; to tell her you feel shut out instead of hoping she'll notice you're gone; and/or to treat her family visits as your chance to do your own thing.\n\nCouples don't need 100 percent shared interests; they just need love and support for whatever those interests are.\n\nGood family therapists can help with this process.\n\nIn a memorable part of Apollo 13, engineers have to build a carbon-dioxide filter with only material on hand. That applies to marriage, too: Understand what you need, see what you actually have, then try to build something that works.
The supervisor-employee relationship is really like a marriage — they have to work together and they have a common goal in mind, said Roberts. If [phubbing] is bad in a romantic relationship, I can't believe it can have anything but negative consequences in the workplace.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn their study titled Put Down Your Phone and Listen to Me: How boss phubbing undermines the psychological conditions necessary for employee engagement, Roberts and Meredith found that behavior as simple as using a cell phone in the workplace can ultimately undermine an employee's success.\n\nOur results reveal that cell phone use by supervisors while in the presence of their employees negatively affects employee engagement, they wrote.\n\nTheir research, made up of three studies, drew on survey responses from 413 supervisors and employees. The participants were asked to respond to statements that measured degrees of boss phubbing, such as My boss places his or her cell phone where I can see it when we are together, When my boss' cell phone rings or beeps, he/she pulls it out even if we are in the middle of a conversation,and I can rely on my supervisor to keep the promises he/she makes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe researchers found that boss phubbing negatively impacts employees' trust in their supervisor, which in turn negatively affects the employee's feeling that their work is meaningful, that they have the necessary resources to do their job, and that they are in a safe working environment. All this in turn leads to decreased employee engagement and productivity.\n\nEmployees who experience boss phubbing, they wrote, are less likely to feel that their work is valuable or conducive to their own professional growth. In addition, employees who work under the supervision of an untrusted, phubbing supervisor tend to have lower confidence in their own ability to carry out their job, which negatively impacts engagement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe distracted supervisor is not a new development, of course. Even without a cell phone, bosses can snub their employees by not giving them their full attention, whether that's twirling a pen or leafing through other documents. But cell phones, because they are so ubiquitous, exacerbate the snubbing dynamic, said Roberts.\n\nIt is different, but it is also intensifying, he said of cell phones. By being so salient, it grabs our attention. It's almost automatic attention.\n\nBut could boss phubbing be a calculated power move on the supervisor's part, a signal to the employee that he or she is indispensably important? While that tactic may have worked in the past, Roberts said, it is unlikely that it will be effective today.\n\nAD\n\nParticularly for young workers, millennials, that's just not going to cut it, he said, explaining how cell phones are so ubiquitous now that they do not necessarily convey the same prestige or authority that they may have before.\n\nAD\n\nFor both bosses and employees, this study has important implications for workplace culture, said Roberts.\n\nPhubbing is harmful behavior, and regardless of whether the phubbing occurs when eating with others or in a meeting with others, it undermines any corporate culture based on respect for others, the researchers wrote. …Thus, it is crucial that corporations strive to create a corporate culture embodied by care for one another.\n\nAD
Mr. Mance, who was a professional musician at the age of 10, had one of the longest and most varied careers in jazz, beginning in the 1930s and lasting well into the 21st century. He appeared on hundreds of albums and had fruitful musical partnerships in the 1950s with singer Dinah Washington, saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nAD\n\nHe was active through several major periods of jazz innovation, from swing to bebop to a freer, postmodern style, but Mr. Mance's approach was always shaped by the blues, which he absorbed from childhood.\n\nAD\n\nLiving in Chicago, that was Bluesville, he told Newsday in 1987. There were people around like Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, Memphis Slim; boogie-woogie players like Jim Yancey, Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons. When I was a kid, my mother loved the blues and bought nothing but blues records. When I started making gigs with horn players, I didn't turn my back on the blues.\n\nIn his late teens, he became the pianist for Chicago saxophonist Gene Ammons, the son of pianist Albert Ammons, and played with visiting musicians, including saxophonists Charlie Parker and Sonny Stitt. In 1949, he joined a band led by Lester Young, one of the defining voices of the tenor saxophone.\n\nAD\n\nThe first time I played with him, Mr. Mance recalled in 2013 to the Jerusalem Post, he called a record date, and I thought, 'What am I going to do on this?' . . . There was one tune that didn't have a title. So when the sound engineer asked him what the name was, Lester just looked round the room and then at me and said, 'Oh, that's called June Bug. ' That was after me!\n\nAD\n\nDrafted into the Army in 1951, Mr. Mance was training as an infantryman and was on guard duty one night at Fort Knox, Ky., when he heard music coming from a service club. During his break, he entered the club and saw a band led by Adderley, an alto saxophonist then stationed at the base.\n\nMr. Mance, still wearing his helmet, cartridge belt and combat boots, asked if he could sit in on piano. Adderley gave him a wary look, then agreed. Mr. Mance, who hadn't touched a keyboard in weeks, played an extended solo that had the band members snapping their fingers and nodding their heads.\n\nAD\n\nAnd so after that was over, he said in an interview with the Hamilton College Jazz Archive. Cannonball comes over to the piano and says, 'Yeah man, that's great, what's your name?' I say, 'Junior Mance.' \n\nAdderley knew his name from his earlier associations with Ammons and Stitt.\n\nAD\n\nSo he laughs, he says, 'If you're Junior Mance, what are you doing here in those clothes?' I said, 'What are you doing here?' \n\nThe next day, Adderley helped arrange a transfer out of the infantry for Mr. Mance, who became a clerk and spent his nights playing in Adderley's Army band. Many members of his previous infantry unit were killed in battle during the Korean War.\n\nAD\n\nI sort of think that Cannonball might have saved my life, he said in the Hamilton College interview. If it weren't for him, I might not be here.\n\nAfter his discharge in 1953, Mr. Mance returned to Chicago, then spent two years as the pianist for Washington, a dynamic blues and jazz singer. He joined Gillespie, one of the founding figures of bebop, in 1956, touring the world and making several recordings with him. He considered Gillespie a friend and mentor, helping to lead him in new musical directions.\n\nI used to play a lot of notes, going nowhere, Mr. Mance told the San Jose Mercury News in 2004. Dizzy called me one night and told me, 'The sound of maturity in a musician is when he learns what not to play, what to leave out.' That's all he said, and it stuck with me.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJulian Clifford Mance Jr. was born Oct. 10, 1928, in Chicago and grew up in Evanston, Ill. His mother was a housekeeper, and his father was a clothes presser and amateur pianist.\n\nMr. Mance was 5 when he began picking out tunes on the piano from ear. He was just 10 when a neighbor who played saxophone hired him for his first professional jobs. Musicians began calling him Junior because of his youth, not just because it was part of his formal name.\n\nMr. Mance's mother wanted him to study medicine, but he focused primarily on music at Roosevelt University in Chicago. When one of his classical music professors heard him playing the blues in a practice room, Mr. Mance was suspended for a week. He eventually dropped out of college to pursue a career in jazz.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1959, he made the first of more than 50 albums as a leader. Among his most notable were The Soulful Piano of Junior Mance (1960) and Junior's Blues (1962), which is considered a landmark example of blending a traditional blues feeling with modern jazz.\n\nAD\n\nHe's so rooted in the blues, drummer Akira Tana told the Mercury News, and he plays certain grooves with such authority you really get a sense of who Junior Mance is, yet he can turn around and play very beautiful ballads.\n\nBesides Washington, Mr. Mance accompanied many singers over the years, including Carmen McRae, Johnny Hartman, Joe Williams and Jimmy Witherspoon. He often performed on jazz cruises and had large followings in Japan, Israel and Europe. He taught for 23 years at the New School in New York and was the author of a book on playing blues piano.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Mance was married four times. Survivors include his wife of 22 years, the former Gloria Clayborne of New York; a stepdaughter from his second marriage, Gail Wilson; two stepchildren from his fourth marriage, Nadia King and Walter H. Jones III; four grandchildren; and a great-grandson.\n\nAD\n\nIn his later years, Mr. Mance established a music publishing company and a record label, JunGlo, with his wife. After a serious stroke in 2012, he embarked on an international tour the following year. He released hs final recording, For My Fans, It's All About You, in 2015.\n\nPlaying with joy is part of it, Mr. Mance said in 2013. You've got to feel something to play well. You can get a job anywhere, but loving what you're doing and playing well, that's real happiness.
I am far from thinking that this ascendancy of women is a harm in itself. It is a gift bestowed upon them by nature for the happiness of the human race: better directed, it might produce as much good as today it does harm. We are not sufficiently aware of what advantages would arise from giving a better education to that half of the human race that governs the other. Men will always be what is pleasing to women: if then you want them to become great and virtuous, teach women what greatness of soul and virtue is. The reflections this subject provokes, and which Plato made in bygone times, greatly deserve to be better developed by a pen worthy of following such a master and of defending a cause so great.\n\nThe reflections to which Rousseau refers are found primarily in Plato's Laws, and they were developed several years later by Rousseau himself in his Letter to d'Alembert on the Theater.\n\nThe Laws shows how a philosopher who wanted to influence practical politics might go about it. In the dialogue, an old man known only as the Athenian Stranger talks at length with two other old men, a Cretan who is charged with helping to draw up new laws for a new polity and a Spartan who is visiting Crete.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese two Dorians are children of a culture in which manliness is celebrated as the highest human virtue. One of the Stranger's most important tasks, and perhaps the most indispensable, is to cure his interlocutors of that prejudice.\n\nThe difficulty of this undertaking can be glimpsed by considering a few of the novel laws that the Stranger recommends. Girls are to be given the same education as boys. That includes mandatory military training, and women will be required to serve in combat when they are needed. The women will take their meals together in public, just as men do in Crete and Sparta.\n\nIn addition, male homosexuality (an important bonding mechanism in the warrior culture of the Dorians) will be outlawed, and women will have substantially equal rights in marriage. Adultery during the childbearing years will be punished in both sexes, while adultery after the childbearing years will be tolerated in both. Women will be eligible for nearly all public offices, including the most powerful.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Stranger openly criticizes the Dorian conflation of manly virtue with human virtue. He implicitly criticizes the Athenian view of feminine virtue, which assigns women to manage the household but allows them to take no part in public life. The Stranger never purports to say what human virtue is, and the dialogue ends with the suggestion that the rulers of the new polity will need to promote civic harmony and the happiness of the citizens by undertaking a search for the truth about human virtue.\n\nRousseau returned to the Laws for guidance in a most surprising situation. Members of his intellectual circle in Paris publicly proposed that a theater be established in Rousseau's native city, the republic of Geneva. This would require a change in the sumptuary laws, and Rousseau foresaw a cascade of harmful consequences for the moral climate of the city. His lengthy and detailed critique was both philosophically subtle and politically effective in helping to defeat the proposal.\n\nUnlike the Stranger, Rousseau is not proposing new laws for a new city but defending the existing laws of what he regards as an exceptionally healthy modern polity. Unlike the Stranger, Rousseau is not seeking to moderate excessive manliness, but to warn the Genevans against an unhealthy ascendance of women and feminine tastes, which would inevitably accompany the introduction of a theater into their city.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNotwithstanding many important dissimilarities, the Laws and the Letter to d'Alembert are fundamentally akin. The common ground on which Rousseau and the Athenian Stranger stand emerges from an understanding of the advantages that would arise from giving an appropriate education to women.\n\nIn ancient Greece, that required a more masculine education for women and a moderation of the domineering masculinity of their men. In Geneva, it meant defending bourgeois manliness and educating women to seek their happiness primarily in the role of wife and mother. The differences in the prescriptions, which are striking enough, reflect different applications in different circumstances of insights the two philosophers shared.\n\nOne of the interesting suggestions we find in the Laws is that even the hypermasculine men of Crete and Sparta were ruled by their women to a far greater extent than they realized, which is why it was a mistake for the legislators in those polities to neglect the education of women. Although Rousseau was obviously aware that women are also affected by what men want them to be, he did not believe that the effects are symmetrical. Men are always much more likely than women to believe they are ruling precisely when they are being ruled, which is why the education of women is especially important and especially likely to be given too little serious attention.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe prejudices that Plato attacked have largely gone underground in modern America, while the Parisian sophistication that alarmed Rousseau has become ever more pervasive. Rousseau gave detailed reasons for his dissent from what has become the orthodoxy of our age, and for his decision to look to Plato as a guide in promoting a better education for that half of the human race that governs the other.\n\nIf more people were to think carefully about the arguments of both Plato and Rousseau, fewer minds would be imprisoned by politically correct pieties enforced by intolerant proponents of strident feminism, of unrestrained sexual license, and of redefining marriage and even sexual identity itself.\n\nLiberating our minds from these fashionable pieties cannot tell us exactly how we should manage relations between the sexes in circumstances that differ significantly from ancient Greece and 18th-century Geneva. Plato and Rousseau can help us to think more clearly about that question than we otherwise might, but they cannot do our thinking for us.
Dear Carolyn: My husband has three siblings and we are the youngest couple, and the only people without kids. My nieces and nephews are 6, 5, 3 and a baby. I have a really small family and no experience with little kids, and my friends haven't had kids yet.\n\nWhen we all get together, the schedule my brothers- and sisters-in-law impose seems really strict. The kids have to eat and go to bed at specific times, and everything we do is centered on this.\n\nWhen we are with them, it feels extremely rigid and it really dampens my enjoyment of spending time together.\n\nMy husband thinks we should just continue to go along with it. I think we shouldn't be expected to all the time, and it's reasonable that the occasional outing or event isn't quite so rigid. Next time we all see each other I want to suggest going with the flow a little more.\n\nMy husband said if I really wanted to say something I should, but he is on record that it's a bad idea. I don't see what's so bad about mixing styles of outings; I don't think their having little kids means they get to dictate the way the entire thing goes for everybody.\n\nShould I bring this up? If so, is there a good way to do it? I just think it would be fun to relax a little more.\n\nScheduled\n\nScheduled: If your definition of fun includes young children who are overtired, overstimulated and hungry, and brothers- and sisters-in-law who, try as they might, will never forget the day their sibling-by-marriage with zero kid experience tried to tell them how to raise their kids, then, yes, you should go for it.\n\nTrust me. How you phrase it won't matter.\n\nI'm a youngest, too, was an auntie for years before I had kids, and spent vacations and holidays under the thumb of 40-pound dictators. It's confining, yes.\n\nBut tight schedules are really, really important for keeping young kids from shrieking the benevolence out of those dictatorships. If you think eating dinner at 5:30 p.m. puts a damper on things, then try enjoying your adulty twilight dinner against the backdrop of a tantrum in three-part disharmony. Alone, as parents calm down their kids.\n\nIf you haven't yet, then you might have those so-rigid parents to thank for it.\n\nWhere you're completely correct is in recognizing that your schedule needn't be centered on the kids'. If you want to eat later or sightsee through nap time, then do so — independently. You're tethered to their schedule, yes, but only at times you agree to be tethered to the rest of the group.\n\nHug your husband, too. Wise man.\n\nDear Carolyn: When we got married 20 years ago, we decided not to invite small children to our wedding. One couple who had a small child at the time made quite the ordeal of how offended they were that they couldn't bring the child to the wedding. They did not attend.\n\nThis summer that child, all grown up, is getting married and we're invited to the wedding. Are we obligated to go considering how we were treated before our wedding?\n\nWedding Whiners?\n\nWedding Whiners?: You're not obligated to go even if they personally harvested the rose petals tossed beneath your silk-slippered feet.\n\nThat's the nature of invitations. To accept is strictly your choice.\n\nIf you like this couple and/or their child and you want to celebrate the marriage, then accept the invitation. If you don't, then don't.\n\nThe fuss they made two decades ago was rude and myopic. As you decide whether to focus on the myopic or the two decades ago, keep in mind: Grudges make lousy decisions.\n\nDear Carolyn: Yesterday I drove past a single-motorist motorcycle accident. The driver was missing. Several people had already stopped to look for the motorcyclist. I also pulled over.\n\nWe found him down the embankment. Two women reached him first. One seemed to have medical training. She took his pulse and kept telling him to keep talking to her. I gave them a blanket from my car so he could stay somewhat warm. I left shortly after that and passed the police on their way.\n\nI learned this morning that he passed away at the scene. The article gave his name and address. I am considering sending a condolence note to the family to let them know he was not alone; that people cared enough to stop, look for him and keep him comfortable until the paramedics arrived.\n\nI'm not sure if that would give them comfort or cause them more pain. What do you think?\n\nWitness to Last Moments\n\nWitness to Last Moments: What a beautiful thought after a terrible experience. I hope you're okay; you must be shaken yourself.\n\nGrief is so personal it's impossible to say how loved ones would feel about such a note. I will say, though, that if I were the one learning of strangers' kindness to my dying child or sibling or parent, I would be grateful to you beyond words.
It was cold and snowy when the roof fell. A record-breaking snowstorm was winding down after dumping 28 inches of snow. Despite snow-clogged roads, over 200 people traveled to the Knickerbocker Theatre by foot to watch a silent film. Saturday was comedy night at the theater, and it was the most well-attended night of the week.\n\nAt 9 p.m., the featured film, Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford, began to roll, and the theater's orchestra struck up a lively tune. A few latecomers were still entering the theater's auditorium and finding seats. The opening scene quickly produced laughter in the audience.\n\nWithin a few minutes after the start of the movie, a loud hissing noise was heard above the music of the orchestra. Some survivors described the noise as the sound of ripping of sheets. The Knickerbocker Theatre's roof, burdened by the weight of the heavy snow, was splitting down the middle.\n\nA small dust cloud began to spew from a crack that formed in the ceiling above the stage, and the dust slowly descended to the ground. Most of the people in the audience didn't know what was happening, and they stayed in their seats and continued to watch the film. The orchestra played on and didn't miss a beat.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSuddenly, the theater's entire roof broke free from the brick walls and fell as one piece toward the audience below. As the roof fell, it collapsed the theater's large balcony and pulled down chunks of the brick walls.\n\nThe falling roof and balcony impacted the floor of the theater with such speed and force that the windows and doors of the Knickerbocker Theatre were blown out by the compressed air inside the auditorium.\n\nThe gust of wind from the falling roof was strong enough to lift several people off the ground and blow them out of the windows and doors. The blown-out victims were the lucky ones. They survived. The rest of the people inside the theater were buried under a mass of concrete, plaster, bricks and twisted steel beams. The death count was 98, with 133 injured.\n\nThe weight of the snow was initially blamed for the roof collapse, but it was later determined that there were design and construction flaws with the Knickerbocker Theatre's roof and how the roof was attached to the walls. The courts, however, were unable to determine who was liable. The families of Knickerbocker victims never received a cent of compensation for their losses despite many lawsuits.\n\nFive years ago, I wrote The Knickerbocker Snowstorm, which was published by Arcadia. I was surprised that Knickerbocker families contacted me with their stories after hearing about my book. It had been 90 years since the Knickerbocker disaster occurred, and the stories continued to circulate through the families, mostly by word-of-mouth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI have recorded the various stories, and hope to publish a Knickerbocker Stories book soon, or at least by the 100th anniversary of the crash five years from now.\n\nFor a preview of the stories I have compiled, here are 10 story snippets. It will give a glimpse into what happened to some of the people associated with the Knickerbocker tragedy on that dreadful and snowy night of Jan. 28, 1922. Be forewarned, most of the story snippets are quite sad.\n\nAgnes Mellon had seen her share of tragedy during childhood. Mellon's mother died six months after she was born, and her father died when Mellon was only 7 years old. Mellon bounced between family members while growing up and when she turned 18, she moved to D.C. She found a job at the National Geographic Society and, a year later, was engaged to be married to a man named James Hoffman. Her life was going well.\n\nOn the night of Jan. 28, 1922, Mellon and Hoffman decided to see a movie at the Knickerbocker Theatre. On the way to the movie, they stopped to visit Mellon's sister, Grace Madert. Mellon asked if she could take Madert's 5-year-old son to the movies. Madert declined, saying the weather was too bad. Mellon, running late for the movie, rushed to the theater with Hoffman. They entered the theater at the moment of the roof collapse. Mellon was crushed to death, but Hoffman was blown into the lobby by the gust of wind from the falling roof. Hoffman didn't have a scratch. He would visit Mellon and her family for many months after the roof while he grieved. The story from the Madert family was that he never married.\n\nHelen Hopkins was a young Girl Scout leader in D.C. She had a lover's spat with her longtime boyfriend, Victor Zelov, and went on a date with another man to the Knickerbocker Theatre on the night of Jan 28, 1922. The collapse of the roof killed her date, and Hopkins was trapped under piles of concrete and four large steel beams. She used her strong singing voice to call for help and to guide the rescue teams to her location. Hopkins was rescued, but her back was badly injured. Four months later, on May 18, 1922, she married Zelov.\n\nOn June 3, 1922, Lou Henry Hoover, the wife of President Herbert Hoover, presented Hopkins with the Girl Scout's Bronze Cross along with a bouquet of roses in the White House Rose Garden for her courage in the Knickerbocker Theatre. Hopkins was wearing her Girl Scout uniform, and her troop attended the ceremony with her.\n\nDavid Lyman, Jr. was the pride and joy of his family. David had excellent grades at Western High School in D.C. and was a star athlete on his baseball and basketball teams. During Saturday evenings, after ballgames, the boys from his team would often meet at the Knickerbocker Theatre to relax, hang out and watch silent films. It was their Saturday evening routine.\n\nOn the night of the Knickerbocker Theatre disaster, most of his teammates could not make it to the theater because of the snowstorm. Only three boys made it to the theater that evening, including David. When the roof collapsed, David and his best friend, Kirkland Duke, were killed. David's father died a year later, and they were buried side-by-side in Congressional Cemetery.\n\nErnesto Natiello was one of the top band leaders in the nation and was recruited to lead the orchestra of the Knickerbocker Theatre three months before the Knickerbocker Disaster. On the night of Jan. 28, 1922, he brought his wife, Mary, and his best friend's 9-year-old son to watch the performance. Natiello was killed instantly when the roof fell, the boy died later that night from his injuries, and Mary survived with only minor injuries.\n\nHospital workers, however, incorrectly reported Natiello survived the disaster. He was reported to be alive at Emergency Hospital in D.C. The next day, Mary walked two miles through the snow to visit her husband. When Mary arrived at the hospital and learned the sad news that her husband was dead, and there was a mix-up with the names, she collapsed on the ground in grief. The Washington Herald reported, She was shocked to prostration.\n\nRaymond Hart played saxophone and clarinet for the Knickerbocker Theatre Orchestra and lived across the street from the theater. On the night of Jan. 28, 1922, Hart refused to play. Hart's wife had just given birth to a baby girl the previous day, on Jan. 27, and he wanted to take some time off. He held firm to his decision and refused to play despite pleas from bandleader, Ernesto Natiello.\n\nHart's choice to stay with family that night saved his life. He went on to achieve fame as a musician, bandleader and band director of Catholic University. He lived to be 77.\n\nOreste Natiello was a violin player and the brother of bandleader Ernesto Natiello. Oreste Natiello lost an arm when the roof crashed down on the orchestra. In the hospital, he pleaded with doctors to save his arm because his career as a musician depended on it. He didn't know his arm was missing, still buried under the rubble in the Knickerbocker Theatre.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 1924, a group of vaudeville entertainers held a show in Louisville called the Natiello Benefit Performance. The goal of the show was to raise money to help Oreste Natiello become financially established within the community so he could start a new life and career without his violin and the music he loved to play. Oreste Natiello became a doorman at a hotel in Louisville. He lived to be 78 years old.\n\nGeorge S. Patton was a major in the U.S. Army stationed at Fort Meyer on the night the Knickerbocker roof collapsed. He was sick in bed from an allergic reaction to seafood when he received a phone call from Gen. Harry Hill Bandholtz that summoned him to join the Knickerbocker Theatre rescue effort. Patton led a group of men from Fort Meyer to the Knickerbocker Theatre but their Army trucks become stuck in the snow. Patton sent an officer back to Fort Meyer to bring mule teams to pull their trucks to the theater.\n\nThe Army arrived at the theater well after the Marines, who had traveled by foot. Patton's men were given the job of dismantling the balcony rubble and removing bodies. The Marines had already made many rescues of victims who survived and were given the accolades in the newspapers the following day. Patton, slightly bitter at only finding about a dozen corpses, described to his father that the bodies were purple and squished to a dimension of about four inches thick. Patton was also reprimanded by his wife, Bee, for being too graphic in his description of a headless woman pulled from the rubble to their young children.\n\nJohn Jay Daly was a writer and reporter at The Washington Post. He had been promoted from sports writer to movie critic in a period of time that spanned about 10 years. He was assigned to the Knickerbocker Theatre on the night of Jan. 28, 1922, to report on the newly released movie, Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford.\n\nDaly was sitting next to the lobby door when the roof started to split open down the middle and with a few quick steps he escaped the crash of the roof into the theater's lobby. Since he was on-site at the disaster and witnessed what happened, he took the lead role at The Washington Post to report the story. He wrote a 5,000 word article about the tragedy that ran in The Post the following day. His article was read across the country, and the Knickerbocker roof crash became his story. He received national recognition and accepted a job writing for Newsweek in New York City. He later wrote for the news syndicate North American Newspaper Alliance and traveled to Europe to document Hitler's rise to power. He lived to be 88 years old.\n\nCharles Lyman III was not allowed by his parents to go to the movie until he finished his homework. It was the night of Jan. 28, 1922, and he feverishly tried to finish his homework so he could join his cousin, David, at the Knickerbocker Theatre. When he finished his homework, he rushed through the deep snow to the theater. When he was one block away from the Knickerbocker Theatre, he heard the loud crash of the roof hitting the ground.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Lyman would talk about the homework assignment that saved his life. Lyman attended the Naval Academy and became a rear admiral in the U.S. Navy. In World War II, Lyman was given command of the destroyer USS Lewis Hancock with 327 officers and men. In 1945, Lyman was given command of Destroyer Division 10 and became assistant chief of staff for operations of Amphibious Group Three, Pacific Fleet. Lyman lived to be 69 years old.\n\nJoseph Beal arrived home from his honeymoon on Jan. 27, 1922. The honeymoon was short; he and his bride, Margaret, had been married four days earlier.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeal started his musical career with the U.S. Navy band but was later recruited to be a violin player for the Knickerbocker Theatre's orchestra. On the night of Jan. 28, the band leader, Ernesto Natiello, talked Beal into playing despite his recent trip and marriage. Margaret was not happy and stayed home. Shortly after 9 p.m. that night, Joseph was crushed and killed by the theater's falling roof. When Margaret heard the news the next morning, she was inconsolable.\n\nOn Feb. 4, 1922, Beal's father, Ben, stood next to his wife at Arlington National Cemetery. Ben Beal had been a violin player earlier in life and had devoted much of his time to raising Joseph Beal and teaching him music. Tears streamed down Ben Beal's face as he watched the coffin of his son carried through the snow-covered cemetery.\n\nThe rest of the story\n\nAD\n\nAD

I believed that each generation should produce its own statement of problems and priorities, and that I had no special authority or vocation to speak on behalf of women of any but my own age, class, background and education. For 30 years, I have done my best to champion all the styles of feminism that came to public attention. Though I disagreed with some of the strategies and was troubled by some of the more fundamental conflicts, it was not until feminists of my own generation began to assert with apparent seriousness that feminism had gone too far that the fire flared up in my belly. When the lifestyle feminists chimed in that feminism had gone just far enough in giving them the right to have it all—i.e., money, sex and fashion—it would have been inexcusable to remain silent. In 1970, the movement was called women's liberation or, contemptuously, Women's Lib. When the name libbers was dropped for feminists, we were all relieved. What none of us noticed was that the ideal of liberation was fading out with the word. We were settling for equality. Liberation struggles are not about assimilation, but about asserting difference, endowing that difference with dignity and prestige, and insisting on it as a condition of self-definition and self-determination. Women's liberation did not see the female's potential in terms of the male's actual; the visionary feminists of the late sixties and early seventies knew that women could never find freedom by agreeing to live the lives of unfree men. Seekers after equality clamoured to be admitted to smoke-filled male haunts. Liberationists sought the world over for clues to what women's lives could be like if they were free to define their own values, order their own priorities and decide their own fate. The Female Eunuch was one feminist text that did not argue for equality. At a debate in Oxford, one William J. Clinton heard me arguing that equality legislation could not give me the right to have broad hips or hairy thighs, to be at ease in my woman's body. Thirty years on, femininity is still compulsory for women—and has become an option for men—while genuine femaleness remains grotesque to the point of obscenity. Meanwhile, the price of the small advances we have made towards sexual equality has been the denial of femaleness as any kind of a distinguishing character. In the last 30 years, women have come a long, long way; our lives are nobler and richer than they were, but they are also fiendishly difficult. The career woman does not know if she is to do her job like a man, or like herself. Is she supposed to change the organisation, or knuckle under to it? Is she supposed to endure harassment, or kick ass and take names? Is motherhood a privilege or a punishment? It is now understood that women can do anything that men can do: anyone who tries to stop them will be breaking the law. Even the President of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, can be called to account by a female nobody who accuses him of asking her to fellate him. Power indeed! The future is female, we are told. Feminism has served its purpose and should now eff off. Feminism was long hair, dungarees and dangling earrings; post-feminism was business suits, big hair and lipstick; post-post-feminism was ostentatious sluttishness and disorderly behaviour. We all agree that women should have equal pay for equal work, be equal before the law, do no more housework than men do, spend no more time with children than men do. Or do we? If the future is men and women dwelling as images of each other in a world unchanged, it is a nightmare. In The Female Eunuch, I argued that every girl child is conceived as a whole woman but, from the time of her birth to her death, she is progressively disabled. A woman's first duty to herself is to survive this process, then to recognise it, then to take measures to defend herself against it. For years after The Female Eunuch was written, I travelled the earth to see if I could glimpse a surviving whole woman. She would be a woman who did not exist to embody male sexual fantasies or rely upon a man to endow her with identity and social status; a woman who did not have to be beautiful, who could be clever, who would grow in authority as she aged. I gazed at women in segregated societies and found them in many ways stronger than women who would not go into a theatre or a restaurant without a man. Osage women in Oklahoma, and Anmatyerre and Pitjantjatara women in Central Australia, taught me about survival. No sooner had I caught sight of the whole woman than western marketing came blaring down upon her with its vast panoply of spectacular effects, strutting and trumpeting the highly seductive gospel of salvation according to hipless, wombless, hard-titted Barbie. My strong women thrust their muscular feet into high heels and learned to totter; they stuffed their useful breasts into brassieres and, instead of mothers' milk, fed commercial formulae made up with dirty water to their children; they spent their tiny store of cash on lipstick and nail varnish, and were made modern. While western feminists were valiantly contending for a key to the executive washroom, the feminine stereotype was completing her conquest of the world. This insidious process was floated on the lie of the sexual revolution. Along with spurious equality and flirty femininity, we were sold sexual freedom. One man's sexual freedom is another man's—or woman's or child's—sexual thraldom. In February 1997, a National Opinion Poll found that nearly seven out of 10 women feel political parties do not pay sufficient attention to issues of importance to women. These women would not answer to the description of feminist, but if feminism is the consciousness of women's oppression, they were not afraid to display it. Even now, women may enter political institutions only after those institutions have formed them in the institutional mould; the more female politicians a parliament may boast, the less likely it is to address women's issues. Prime Minister Blair has less trouble keeping his party under an unprecedented degree of central control because so many of the Labour MPs are inexperienced, young and female. A male Labour MP called them the Stepford Wives with a chip inserted in their brain to keep them on message; the media call them Blair's babes. Few of the silly rituals of the House have been abolished, nor has the parliamentary timetable been modified. After a year in the rowdy bear-garden that is the British House of Commons, and many weeks without seeing their families for more than a few minutes at a time, the new women MPs were reporting levels of stress approaching the unbearable. Changes in British legislation have been slow and tentative, commitment to the economic enfranchisement of women more apparent than real. A woman is now slightly more likely to find a job than a man, entirely because of the restructuring of the job market in the employer's favour. The workers who will accept a zero-hours contract, which means that they are only called upon if business is brisk and then paid an hourly rate, who will carry pagers and mobile phones and be at the employer's beck and call 24 hours a day, who take work home every night, who have no job protection or guarantee of safe and hygienic conditions or insurance against work-related injury, are women. Prestige and power have seeped out of professions as women joined them. Teaching is already rock-bottom; medicine is sliding fast. Though they are close to parity in numbers, the total earned by British women is only 60 percent of what men earn; their pay hour by hour is 79 pence for every pound earned by a man. The differential between women's pay and men's pay has now been enshrined. A woman who brings a case before an employment tribunal will wait for years before a decision will be reached; a decision in a single case is simply that. British equal pay legislation is legislation meant to be ineffective, designed to be ineffective. Women are discriminated against by building societies, who treat maternity leave as long-term sick leave and will not lend to couples with both partners in work if the woman is pregnant. Women pay 50 percent more for medical insurance. Women are the stomping ground of medical technology, routinely monitored, screened and tortured, to no purpose except the enactment of control. They have been punished for their acquisition of a modicum of economic independence by being left with virtually total responsibility for the welfare of children, while gangs of professionals perpetually assess and record their inadequacies. Idealisation of the mother has been driven out by criminalisation of the mother. Our culture is far more masculinist than it was thirty years ago. Movies deal with male obsessions. Soccer is Britain's most significant cultural activity. Computer use is spreading into every home, but more than 80 percent of Internet users are male. Women are ignored by manufacturers of video games, which are mostly war games of one sort or another. Popular music is split as never before; the consumers of commercial pop are female; the rock music that appeals to men is deliberately, unbelievably and outrageously misogynist. While women were struggling to live as responsible dignified adults, men have retreated into extravagantly masculinist fantasies and behaviours. Every day, terrible revenges are enacted on women who have dared to use their new privileges. Female military recruits are sexually abused and harassed, young policewomen subjected to degrading ordeals, and hideous brutality inflicted on women apparently simply because they are female. On every side, we see women troubled, exhausted, lonely, guilty, mocked by the headlined success of the few. The reality of women's lives is work—most of it unpaid and, what is worse, unappreciated. Every day, we hear of women abused; every day, we hear of new kinds of atrocities perpetrated on the minds and bodies of women; yet every day, we are told that there is nothing left to fight for. Even if it had been real, equality would have been a poor substitute for liberation; fake equality is leading women into double jeopardy. The rhetoric of equality is being used in the name of political correctness to mask the hammering that women are taking. When The Female Eunuch was written, our daughters were not cutting or starving themselves. On every side, speechless women endure endless hardship, grief and pain, in a world system that creates billions of losers for every handful of winners. It's time to get angry again.\n\nGreer on Adultery It seems there is never any shortage of women who will commit adultery with married men, and that even women who call themselves feminist are perfectly willing to marry a man who has already rendered a wife or two acutely miserable. Women are all too ready still to accept a man's view of his relations with women, and to understand men whose wives, with much longer and closer experience, don't understand them. When women are ready to believe that a man's saying My wife doesn't understand me means I behave unreasonably towards my wife, feminism will have got to first base. One wife is all any man deserves.\n\nGreer on the Tyranny of Housework By the millennium, housework should have been abolished. In a sane world, meaningless repetition of non-productive activity would be seen to be a variety of obsessive-compulsive disorder. People who said that they enjoyed doing housework, or needed to do it, or that doing it made them feel good would be known as addicts. Once the word got out that a person was cleaning her toilet every day, therapists would come to her house and reclaim her for rationality and the pleasure principle. Instead, we have Professor Jean-Claude Kaufman of the Sorbonne telling us that housework is a deeply sensual experience—for women, that is, not for himself. Women do menial work because it turns them on; it doesn't turn men on, therefore they should not be expected to do it. Strange, isn't it, how much men know about sensations they have never had? Kaufman knows a woman in whom dish-washing produces explosions of joy. According to him, rhythmic, repetitive, mindless tasks function as sexual anticipation, building up pleasurable tension until it climaxes in conjugal relations. Faking it in bed has clearly not been enough; now women are having to fake sexual arousal even when they are cleaning the toilet. These days, housework doesn't just use people; it requires a gang of machines: vacuum cleaners, washing machines, dishwashers, driers, food processors, microwave ovens, refrigerators and freezers, immense quantities of water, power and detergent to feed into them, and an army of technicians who treat them when they malfunction—and charge more than doctors do for a home visit. Though the houseworker doesn't now scrub and polish floors or pound clothes on a washboard or put aside an evening for ironing, she is equally busy Hoovering, spraying-and-wiping and stuffing clothes in washing machines. As more and more home appliances have appeared in more and more homes, they have brought anything but increased leisure for the houseworker (who probably also has to earn the money to pay for them). Changing standards and notions of cleanliness have made cleaning more time-consuming than ever before. Kitchen worktops need to be constantly wiped; kitchen floors need to be mopped whenever a footprint or a pawprint appears; the bath has to be cleaned between baths; once a day is not often enough for the toilet. Every few minutes, a television commercial illustrates the standard and shows a way of achieving it, tightening the headlock on the housewife. A recent television commercial for Bold laundry detergent opened with a mid-shot of a slender, good-looking, but not too good-looking, woman. A door opens behind her and a schoolboy rushes in. Hi, Darren, she says. He does not answer. She answers herself, Hi, Mum. Darren enters bedroom, looks surprised. She says, Thanks for tidying my room, Mum. He rips off his school shirt, grabs a fresh shirt from neatly folded pile (the inference being that he is immediately going out again). As the neatly ironed shirt billows out, a special effect signifies the effects of Bold. Mum says, Thanks for washing my shirt, Mum. No response. Then she says, I know you appreciate me, really. Darren smirks at himself in mirror, like any snotnose git with a doormat mother. This commercial would have been shown to a focus group of housewives at the story-board stage, and again before it was transmitted. They must have responded positively to this version of doting motherhood as the training of a tyrant, or the commercial would never have gone to air. Even as feminism is trying to transform attitudes, marketing is obliterating its traces. In commercial after commercial, the performer of mindless routine tasks is an inanely smiling woman, unless some inanely smiling man pops up to demonstrate a new and better way of using even more of the product by dint of making her look a complete fool. A mythical battle has to be waged by the houseworker against germs, depicted as intelligent beings of deviant appearance lurking under the rim of the toilet ready to infect helpless kiddies if the houseworker should be so remiss as to allow a single one to survive. There are more germs in her mouth and under her fingernails and in her hair than there are under the rim of the toilet, but the houseworker is not told this. Her vocation is to rid the world of germs with the aid of a knight in shining armour, a genie in a bottle, a white tornado. This is housework as heroic exploit. The houseworker can only know that she has done her duty when she has squirted bleach-based agents into every nook and cranny of her house, even down the drains. Houses no longer smell of cooking; they smell of cleaning. Yet kitchens are not operating theatres and antisepsis in kitchens is as undesirable as it is impossible, because it can only be achieved by huge overuse of powerful chemicals. Millennial food preparation takes less time than the old methods; the time spent getting food on and off the table has shrunk by a third, but it must not be thought the houseworker has more leisure time as a result. Housework expands to fill the time available. Time not spent doing one task will be taken up by another. Washing used to be done on a single day of the week, usually Monday. When washing machines became cheap enough to be owned by the majority, washing came gradually to be done on any day of the week, and then on every day of the week. Laundry is nowadays done several times a day. Television commercials show beaming women snatching a single soiled garment from the back of husband or child, and producing it blazing clean minutes later, having been through the whole washing and drying process aided by a horde of sophisticated bio-digesters, enzymes and whitening agents as well as immense amounts of power and water, all squandered on a single garment. Kids won't wear their jeans and T-shirts for more than a few hours each before into the machine they go. The person who does all this work is usually female. Advertisers and market researchers who tried to buck the stereotype and show men spraying Harpic under the rim of the toilet very soon realised their mistake. Nowadays, it is always a woman who pops the meal in the microwave, whips off her apron, uncorks the wine, lights the candles and waits. There is no magazine called Man and Home. The 23 percent of men who will consent to cook when they have a woman in the house do so on special occasions with great song and dance, leaving the clearing up to be done by her. Men who clean and wash are presumed to have a wife in hospital. The few men who do a hand's turn around the house expect gratitude and recognition, so sure are they that, though it is their dirt, it is not their job. Work around the house is as gendered as ever it was. Men have not agreed to do a share, let alone a fair share, of domestic work, because they have never agreed on the amount of work that needs to be done. It is difficult to know how they could, because most of the work done in the home does not need to be done. The men who leave ziggurats of dirty dishes festering in the sink are actually involved in a power play which they have no intention of losing. All they need to do is to exploit inertia, and wait it out. Sooner or later, the woman will give in, because the squalor is not held against the menfolk but against her. A man who is slovenly and untidy is considered normal; the woman who is, either a slut or a slommack or a sloven or a slag. The external attribute becomes a moral quality, as it does not for a man. This works both ways; a house-proud woman equates her spotless house with her virtuous self and derives her sense of self-worth from the orderliness of her cupboards, rather than qualities of her mind or soul. The only way to escape this tyranny of housework is to abandon the house. You can live with nomads or hunter-gatherers, maybe, or become a nun with nothing but a cell to distract you from the day-long excitement of prayer. Or maybe you can make a vow that no more than an hour in any day may be spent on housework—and keep it. This really would be the end of civilisation as we know it.\n\nGreer on Marriage Some of the briefest marriages are those that follow a long period of cohabitation. Nobody quite knows why this is so, but the theory is that unforced cohabitation is less oppressive than sanctioned cohabitation. Marriage does make a difference; even when the marriage service does not contain the bride's pledge to love, honour and obey, it acts in the interest of a husband rather than a wife. Though the bride herself may not feel that she has left the family of her father and been taken into the family of her husband, the ancient dynamic still prevails. His friends will now be her friends, but her friends are unlikely to become his; even if her parents are not entirely displaced by his, his will take precedence. The dynamic of mutual accommodation that propelled a couple's informal cohabitation is unnecessary once marriage has confined them. As both are bound, the power will come to be concentrated in the person best prepared to take advantage of the situation, and that person is the male partner. Having been so lucky as to acquire a wife, he begins to take the liberties that husbands have traditionally taken, comes and goes as he pleases, spends more time outside the connubial home, spends more money on himself, leaves off the share of the housework that he may have formerly done. She sees her job as making him happy; he feels that in marrying her, he has done all that is necessary to make her happy. The less she expected it, the more generous he feels for having done it. To her anxious question Do you love me? he has an easy answer. Of course. I married you, didn't I? The interesting thing about this particular con is that men need marriage more than women do. A man without a wife is fragile; prisons are full of men who never married and unmarried men are more likely to die violently. A wife, whose first duty is to stand by her man, reassure him, build up his confidence and attend to his creature comforts, is an asset to any man; performing such a role is not necessarily advantageous to the performer. Yet marriage is represented to women rather than men as a sign of success so effectively that failure in a woman's pair-bonding will neutralise success in any other field. Success which might put pressure on her pair-bond is success too dearly bought. Magazine after magazine offers young women advice on how to get their man to commit himself; there is nothing comparable in men's literature. Men buy literature about men's toys and pastimes; women buy magazines about men and relationships. Though young men have searing anxieties of their own about relationships, relationships are not represented to them as the only things of value in their lives. This fundamental asymmetry distorts all youthful male-female interaction: the girls put too much into their sexual relationships and set too much store by them, making demands that immature males cannot afford to recognise.\n\nGreer on Sex and the Singly Woman Out of 3.8 million British women in their thirties, almost a million are single or divorced. Not only are many women not at present half of a couple, and not likely to become so, but they are also sexually inactive, which is a dereliction of their duty to themselves and the body politic. There is very little they can do about this, bar spending a fortune on body, clothes, face and hair, because, though they can signal availability in a dozen ways, they cannot actually make themselves attractive. The power to make an object attractive lies with the beholder of the object, not the object itself. As a woman grows older, her chances of mating on any but humiliating terms grow less and less. The constant pressure to be sexually active, which has replaced the old pressure to reproduce, actually places unmated women in jeopardy, and fills them with anxiety and the sense of failure. It is the greater pity then that so many feminists accept and perpetuate the notion that people who are not sexually active are of no account. So let this feminist say it again: No sex is better than bad sex. Bad sex is bad for you. Looking for sex can be humiliating, disappointing and dangerous. Making yourself available can mean putting yourself in jeopardy. No sex does you no harm at all. As many a sole woman out there knows, being single and free is bliss compared to the misery inflicted by an unfair partner, good though the sex may have been. Besides, the things you want don't tend to turn up until you have given over looking for them.\n\nGreer on Body Image Show me a woman who loves her body Every woman knows that, regardless of all her other achievements, she is a failure if she is not beautiful. She also knows that whatever beauty she has is leaving her, stealthily, day by day. Even if she is as freakishly beautiful as the supermodels whose images she sees replicated all around her until they are more familiar than the features of her own mother, she cannot be beautiful enough. There must be bits of her that will not do: her knees, her feet, her buttocks, her breasts. However much body hair she has, it is too much. However little and sweetly she sweats, it is too much. Left to her own devices, she is sure to smell bad. If her body is thin enough, her breasts are sad. If her breasts are full, her arse is surely too big. What is pathological behaviour in a man is required of a woman. A bald man who wears a wig is a ridiculous figure; a bald woman who refuses to wear a wig is being stroppy and confrontational. Women with too much (i.e., any) body hair are expected to struggle daily with depilatories of all kinds in order to appear hairless. Scientists call abnormal preoccupation with a perceived defect in one's appearance Body Dysmorphic Disorder, or BDD. Yet no one would say that the woman who puts herself through the agonising ordeal of hot-waxing her bikini-line must be suffering from BDD. Such insecurity has been instilled into women over generations; we have made not the least headway in the struggle to dispel it. Every issue of every woman's magazine exploits women's anxiety about unwanted hair. Even if you escape hairiness, you will fall foul of cellulite. When The Female Eunuch has written, cellulite was a French disease. The English word should by rights be cellulitis, but, as British pharmaceutical companies jumped on a bandwagon set off by sales campaigns for French products, they adopted the French word. Cellulite is subcutaneous fat, pure and simple. It keeps women warm and softens the contours of their bodies and, if it builds up, it often dimples. Whether or not your fat dimples is a matter of genetic endowment; some women have tight smooth fat and some women have softer fat, which droops and dimples, even on their knees, invariably on their bottoms. The characteristic orange-peel appearance can be seen even in the bottoms of babies who have not eaten chocolate, drunk coffee or alcohol or smoked, or committed any other of the sins that are punishable by cellulite. Once upon a time, men and women both admired dimply fat; it took 20th-century marketing to render it disgusting. Most of what is written about globular fat cells, poor lymphatic drainage and toxins that have solidified is cynical tosh. Dimply fat will only disappear if it is starved off; no amount of pounding or vibrating or massaging will have any effect on it whatsoever. No cream, whether made of placenta or the brains of aborted fetuses or ground glass, will break down cellulite. Your cellulite is you, and will be with you till death or liposuction, which is expensive and extremely painful and sometimes more disfiguring than the dimply fat itself. As fat distribution is hormonally regulated, the fat will probably build up again gradually after liposuction. As cellulite will neither kill you nor go away, it is a goldmine for doctors, nutritionists, naturopaths, aromatherapists, fitness experts and lifestyle managers. The manufacturers of creams, exercise equipment, skin brushes and dietary supplements all make a bundle out of women's carefully cultivated disgust with their own bodies, scarfed about as they are by unsightly fat cells. Criminalising cellulite is just another way of demonising fat, any fat, anywhere. As a way of inducing them to buy products of no use or value, women have been deliberately infected with BDD. Conditions that practically all women suffer from are spoken of as unsightly and abnormal, to make women feel that parts of their bodies, perhaps their whole bodies, are defective and should be worked on, even surgically altered. Most women think that their hair is not good enough and dye it or bleach it or perm it. Most women feel that their legs are not long enough, that their thighs are too heavy or not firm enough. Most women are unhappy about their bottoms, which are either too flat, too low-slung, too fat or too broad. Preoccupation about her appearance goes some way towards ruining some part of every women's day. Multi-million-dollar industries exploit both her need for reassurance and her need to do something about the way she looks. Thirty years ago, it was enough to look beautiful; now a woman has to have a tight, toned body, including her buttocks and thighs, so that she is good to touch, all over. Remember, she will be told, beauty starts from within, so she keeps her bowels open with plenty of fibre and her kidneys flushed with lots of pure water. Being beautiful from within takes even more time than slapping beauty on from without. Demi Moore is said to work out for four hours a day, beginning with a cardiovascular aerobic workout, then working her legs and buttocks with pliés, standing lunges and thigh lifts, her upper body with shoulder and punching exercises, and toning her abdominal muscles. She also eats only non-processed, pesticide-free, totally vegetarian foods. The result—taut abs, a rock-hard butt and twanging musculature—was still not enough to save her marriage. Whatever a woman does, she must not look her age. The fitness regime is lifelong, to go with the lifelong sexual activity that is nowadays obligatory. The UK beauty industry takes ú8-9 billion a year out of women's pockets. Magazines financed by the beauty industry teach little girls that they need make-up and train them to use it, so establishing their lifelong reliance on beauty products. Not content with showing pre-teens how to use foundations, powders, concealers, blushers, eye-shadows, eye-liners, lip-liners, lipstick and lip gloss, the magazines identify problems of dryness, flakiness, blackheads, shininess, dullness, blemishes, puffiness, oiliness, spots, greasiness, that little girls are meant to treat with moisturisers, fresheners, masks, packs, washes, lotions, cleansers, toners, scrubs, astringents—none of which will make the slightest difference and all of which would cost money the child does not have. Pre-teen cosmetics are relatively cheap but, within a few years, more sophisticated marketing will have persuaded the most level-headed young woman to throw money away on alchemical preparations containing anything from silk to cashmere, pearls, proteins, royal jelly, placenta extracts, ceramides, biotin, collagen, phytotensers, bisabolol, jojoba, hydra-captors, serine, fruit hydroxy-acids, oleospheres, corneospheres, nanovectors, glycerol—anything real or phony that might fend off her imminent collapse into hideous decrepitude. Yet consumer research regularly reports that nothing applied to the surface of the skin can affect the underlying structures or prevent aging, and still the anti-aging products sell. Every day, hospitals put placenta into special freezers to be collected once a week by unmarked vans and sold to face-cream manufacturers. So desperate are some women to stave off aging that they are prepared to submit to injections of botulin toxin to freeze their facial muscles and prevent wrinkles. What is truly depressing about the false dawn of feminism is that, as we have been congratulating ourselves on largely imaginary victories, BDD has become a global pandemic. Women who were unselfconscious and unmade-up 30 years ago, who walked at a natural pace and worked alongside men in the fields and the factories, are now infected. In provincial cities in China, hanging up over shop doorways, you can see boards with padded brassieres pinned all over them, and trays of cheap lacquer and lipstick under fly-spotted glass, so that women who are naturally small-breasted can assume the new shape. Beauty salons crimp and curl shining hair with a fall like silk into shapeless frizz. The two billion people worldwide who regularly view Baywatch are all recognising a single, tawdry, synthetic kind of skinnied-down, pumped-up, bleached and depilated female beauty. Real girls tell me that when they run along the beach, their male companions make fun of their real breasts that bounce up and down—unlike the rigid half-tennis-ball boobs of the Baywatch babes. Who cares that Pamela Anderson, who has been put together out of all the movable parts of male and female fetishism, has been abused by her husband? We are selling fantasy here.\n\nGreer on Barbie It seemed, a quarter of a century ago, that the days of the Barbie doll were numbered. Barbie was descended from a swimsuit-clad German porno-toy called Lilli—a 12-inch peroxided nymph with a sidelong glance, designed to be sold to men in tobacconists' shops. At her American debut in the spring of 1959, Barbie was the first toy to be directly marketed to three- to 11-year-old girls on Saturday morning television. American girls now own eight Barbies apiece, British girls six. With her non-functional body, boasting a nipple-free bosom more than twice the circumference of her minute waist, legs twice as long as her torso, and feet so tiny that she cannot stand on them, Barbie is unlikely to have been very effective in her career roles as astronaut, vet or stewardess. Every year, Barbie gets 120 new outfits, including a range of sexy underwear, and a new career. She has 35 pets, as well as a kitchen, a bathroom and a patio. She is put together by 11,000 Chinese peasant women in two factories in Guangdong Province; 23p of the total price of a Barbie doll is payment for their labour. Sales last year topped $1.2 billion. More than one billion Barbies have been sold since 1959; she is brand leader in every one of the 140 countries where she is sold. In 1998, a makeover was announced; the millennial Barbie is to stand on flat feet, her bosom and hips are to be slightly reduced and her waist slightly enlarged, but she will still be a far cry from Action Woman. Even so, a U.S. columnist objected, Why not just give her a moustache, cellulite and varicose veins too? The further from the natural a female form, the more attractive it becomes. The further from the natural a female form, the more feminine it is. Barbie has been instrumental in teaching broad-shouldered women, short-legged women, wide-bodied women, real women the world over, to despise their bodies as we do, so that they pay out money that could be put towards the cost of books or computers or bicycles, for cheaply produced, expensively packaged beauty products.\n\nGreer in Abortion Feminism is supposed to be pro-abortion. There are some who fancy that feminists used to march shouting, What do we want? Abortion! When do we want it? We want it now! Those same people think that, for once, marching and shouting were effective. Reluctant authorities gave in to the women's screaming, and allowed a tide of feticide to sweep the world. This is not what happened. In the United States, the crucial factor was a decision in the Supreme Court in the case of Roe v. Wade, which upheld the principle that, as the law had no part to play in what passed between a woman and her doctor, intervention by the state to prevent an abortion was a breach of the patient's privacy. Jane Roe or Norma McCorvey, a sometime carnival barker and druggie who was pregnant for the third time, was the stooge selected by a young Texas lawyer. She has subsequently been born again and now repudiates her part in the decision that legalised abortion in the U.S. The decision in Roe v. Wade did nothing to confront, let alone resolve, the deep moral conflicts surrounding the issue of abortion. Pregnancy is unlike other patient-doctor relations in that there are two other individuals involved—the father-to-be and the child-to-be. Every time a fetus is recognised as a party to other litigation, the safety of the decision in the case of Roe v. Wade is called into question. What women won was the right to undergo invasive procedures in order to terminate unwanted pregnancies—unwanted not just by them but by their parents, their sexual partners, the governments who would not support mothers, the employers who would not employ mothers, the landlords who would not accept tenants with children, the schools that would not accept students with children. Historically, the only thing pro-abortion agitation achieved was to make an illiberal establishment look far more feminist than it was. The abortionists who went to prison in the run-up to legalisation for helping girls in trouble were all male. All saw themselves as champions of women and defenders of women's rights. They were repaid with the love and loyalty of women, who were grateful for the right to expiate their sexual activity in pain and grief. The goal was every child a wanted child; it should also have been every abortion a wanted abortion, but the two sides of the phony debate were never to meet. Any feminist who saw abortion as an assault on women and agitated for a concomitant right to bear children without being condemned to poverty, misery and failure was suspected of being a crypto-right-to-lifer. In 1997, Cardinal Winning [leader of Scotland's 750,000 Catholics] took the first step in the direction of providing a genuine alternative to abortion by offering support in the form of an unspecified lump sum of money to women who would otherwise have an abortion because they could not afford to have a baby. The outcry was immediate; the money was called a bribe that would lure women away from what was best for them—i.e., childlessness. Nevertheless, donations poured into Cardinal Winning's fund until, at the time of writing, £180,000 had been donated, half of which had been paid out. Two hundred women had applied for assistance, 50 of whom had borne children, with 50 more on the way. Cardinal Winning no doubt hopes that government will take over his responsibility and offer support to every child conceived. Feminists should share his hope, but the media has locked feminists into a position which they define as pro-abortion. Feminism is pro-woman rather than pro-abortion; we have always argued for freedom of reproductive choice. But a choice is only possible if there are genuine alternatives. In Britain, the anti-abortion lobby in the House of Commons brings Private Members' Bills year after year, apparently unaware that the medical establishment has no intention of allowing any curb on its right to dispose of blastocysts, fetuses and embryos as, when and how it sees fit. Feminists react to each successive attack on the availability of abortion with grave concern, fighting a battle on behalf of the richest and most powerful organisations in the world. The pharmaceutical multi-nationals will not allow any wholesale revision of abortion rights, in case the mode of operation of their so-called contraceptives should be called in question. In the British elections of 1997, the pro-Life alliance hoped to field 50 candidates, thus qualifying for a party political broadcast in which to alert the unconscious public to the horrors of pregnancy termination—but they were fighting a rearguard action. A poll conducted by a Sunday newspaper found that, even after a series of pregnancy-related scandals, 81 percent of people still thought that a woman had the right to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy. Another poll, carried out by MORI, showed that abortion was no longer a minority issue; 45 percent of the sample knew close friends or members of the family who had had abortions, compared with 27 percent in 1980. The people polled were asked if they thought that abortion should be available for all who wanted it and 64 percent answered in the affirmative; of the 11 percent of the people polled who were Catholics, half agreed with what 30 years ago would have been considered an extreme position. People also showed the beginnings of a retreat from the notion of eugenic abortion in cases where mental or physical handicap was suspected, which was supported by 84 percent of people in 1980 and by only 66 percent in 1997. In the contest between the doctor's right to choose versus the woman's right to choose whether to deliver a handicapped baby, the woman appears to be gaining ground. There can be no gainsaying that women cannot manage their own lives if access to abortion is to be denied, but the need for abortion is itself the consequence of oppression. If we accept every instance of abortion as the outcome of unwanted and easily avoided pregnancy, we have to ask ourselves how it is that women are still exposing themselves to this risk. A woman who is unable to protect her cervix from exposure to male hyperfertility is certainly not calling the shots. The man is most likely to have initiated the episode of intercourse, to have chosen the place and the time; the woman is probably still dancing backwards. If the child is unwanted, whether by her or her partner or her parents, it will be her duty to undergo an invasive procedure and an emotional trauma, and so sort the situation out. The crowning insult is that this ordeal is represented to her as some kind of a privilege: her sad and onerous duty is garbed in the rhetoric of a civil right. She is confronted with other people who know better than she what she ought to do. She will be required to undergo investigations of her pregnancy for which there is no treatment but termination, whether she would countenance a termination or not. If she undergoes the tests, say for Down's Syndrome, and refuses the termination, she will be asked why she had the test in the first place. And she will probably be talked into the termination. Her agony of mind is increased by the regular publication of results of research to establish whether and when human fetuses become aware, feel pain, can learn. In March 1998, we learned that fetuses are alert and can learn at 20 weeks gestation, before the formation of a cerebral cortex. The evidence was unconvincing, in that reaction was being construed as consciousness, but it had the desired effect—which was to worry women. Feminists have argued that delaying abortion is immoral, but all measures to put in place speedy and non-traumatic abortion procedures, which would be embryologically identical with what passes for contraception, have been blocked by the same authorities who regularly produce evidence about the developing sensibilities of the fetus. A woman who is granted an abortion does not get to choose between abortions: abortion is presented to her as a single entity, when there is a bewildering array of options. Non-surgical, do-it-yourself abortion has been possible for 20 years or more, but the health establishment rations and controls access to it. In the United States, the so-called morning-after pill is unavailable. In Britain, it is not usually made available until the client has endured a sermon on reliable contraception. (One of the best-kept secrets in gynecology is the use of methotrexate and other cytotoxics for non-surgical abortion.) In the United States, surgical abortion is usually a 10-minute procedure—vacuum aspiration with local anaesthetic; in Canada, a cumbersome two-stage procedure, involving the insertion of a laminaria tent, and dilatation and curette under general anaesthetic 24 hours later, is preferred; in Russia, which has the highest abortion rate in the world, no anaesthesia is used; in Britain, vacuum aspiration under general anaesthetic is usual. Recently, the use of better pregnancy testing and smaller cannulas has made possible the surgical removal of the fertilised ovum as early as eight to 10 days after conception, when it is no bigger than a pinhead—at much the same point that it would be shed by the women using the contraceptive pill or an intrauterine device. At the time of writing, only about 20 of the clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood are using the method—and only in the United States. To be pregnant against your will is to see your life swerve out of control. To become a mother without wanting to is to live like a slave or a domestic animal. Like any other adult, a woman would wish to be infertile and fertile when appropriate: she is led to believe that contraception is her duty and that the available techniques are easy to use and completely effective. If she were totally in control of the manner in which she is sexually active, she might insist that her male partner control his excessive fertility rather than delegating to her the responsibility for inhibiting his power to fecundate. Though vasectomy is available, it is culturally invisible. Men don't get pregnant, therefore men don't bother about contraception. Men do get sexually transmitted diseases so they do use condoms, sometimes, but nowhere near as often as they should. These days, contraception is abortion, because the third-generation Pills cannot be shown to prevent sperm fertilising an ovum. Yet no one feels so strongly against abortion at any stage that they picket the factories where birth control pills are produced. IUDs are clearly abortifacient: these devices work by creating inflammation of the uterus, often accompanied by infection. Women who accept them as contraceptive devices are actually being equipped with a do-it-yourself abortionist's tool. The outcome is frequent occult abortion, heavy bleeding and pelvic inflammatory disease, with the accompanying elevated risk of ectopic pregnancy. Whether you feel that the creation and wastage of so many embryos is an important issue or not, you must see that the cynical deception of millions of women by selling abortifacients as if they were contraceptives is incompatible with the respect due to women as human beings. You must also see that expecting women to be grateful for the opportunity to have inserted into their bodies instruments for sucking and scraping out the products of avoidable conception shows them as much contempt. Fake contraceptive technology manipulates women in ways that we are coming to condemn when they are practised on members of other species. What women don't know does hurt them. If we ask ourselves whether we would have any hope of imposing upon men the duty to protect women's fertility and their health, and avoid the abortions that occur in their uncounted millions every day, we will see in a blinding light how unfree women are. Women, from the youngest to the oldest, are aware that to impose conditions on intimacy would be to be accorded even less of it than they get already. The women who refuses to enter the gynecological abattoir, which extends into every bathroom in the country, must be prepared to do without male approval and attention.

I'm not sure I entirely blame the president on this one, Ben, Mrs. Graham says. Would you want Judith [Martin] to cover your daughter's wedding? . . . Her pen is so sharp. . . . She compared Tricia Nixon to a vanilla ice-cream cone.\n\nBradlee chuckles. She did, yeah.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI just — are you sure we're striking the right tone here, Ben?\n\nOh, we're gonna do this again?\n\nThe new Style section, she groans. (Styyyle.) Sometimes that stiletto party coverage can be a little mean . . .\n\nI'm handling it, Bradlee says. I'm looking for a new editor.\n\nYes, are you? Because I know I've talked to you about this before. You are losing female readership, you know, and I think you might want to focus more on what women . . .\n\nKatharine, Bradlee says, turning serious. Keep your finger out of my eye.\n\nShe kept her finger out of his eye, and the Style section persisted — then and now, changing as journalism itself changed, adapting to a digital media landscape that nearly laid waste to the ancient art of feature writing. Style debuted in the paper 50 years ago this week (on Monday, Jan. 6, 1969), replacing a section called For and About Women. Decades later, Style has evolved (or devolved, some will hasten to note) as the home to some of the most memorable journalism The Post has ever published.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWere the pens really that sharp?\n\nAt the time, it certainly seemed so: Sally Quinn, a socialite turned novice reporter, became Style's first breakout star — thanks to a gimlet eye and deadline party coverage that left in the juicy stuff. Quinn had a talent for overhearing or witnessing or getting others to tattle on powerful people who spoke or behaved just a smidgen beyond the pale: Julie Nixon remarking to another woman at a White House lawn event in 1970 that Princess Margaret (and just about everyone else) looks fat in midi-length skirts; then-White House adviser Hamilton Jordan at Barbara Walters's dinner party in 1977, comparing the ample cleavage of the Egyptian ambassador's wife to the Great Pyramids.\n\nImagine Twitter long before there was Twitter. People used to save their best quips for Style's roving reporters.\n\nLater, as Style flourished, some of the section's writers traded the stage-whispering for more direct uses of the scalpel: Henry Allen, the section's smartest and most elegant observer of American culture, wrote a 1988 campaign dispatch that called the state of New Hampshire [A] fraud. . . . From the air, at primary time, the hills of New Hampshire look like the forehead of Frankenstein's monster. . . . They sell the rest of the country maple syrup, lottery tickets and Yankee sagacity the way Indians on reservations sell moccasins, bingo and environmental wisdom. They never shut up about how closemouthed they are.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd Stephanie Mansfield, who profiled movie stars in an era before publicists ruined all the fun, wrote that Kirk Douglas, in person, resembled an underripe California nectarine. (Lauren Bacall: The voice sounds like someone trying to wax 'n' buff a gravel pit. Tom Selleck: His shoes are suede, his face is suede, his mustache is suede. Cher: [P]orcelain skin dusted with Gold Medal flour and her lips a pale lavender. The embalmed look . . . the bored, blank stare of a heavy-metal prom queen.)\n\nTom Shales, TV critic nonpareil, was so harsh on Kathie Lee Gifford's Christmas specials — Please, one might have prayed, in the name of all that's holy: Let it stop, let it stop, let it stop — that she eventually gave up making them. Robin Givhan, who arrived in the mid-'90s and redefined fashion criticism, translated the disdain that greeted Florida Secretary of State's Katherine Harris's garish use of the mascara wand (a side debacle in the 2000 election debacle) and Dick Cheney's callous choice of heavy outerwear at a solemn, snowy 2005 remembrance of the liberation of Auschwitz.\n\nBradlee wrote in his 1995 memoir A Good Life, that the For and About Women section seemed, to him, out of sync with the times.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWomen were treated exclusively as shoppers, partygoers, cooks, hostesses and mothers, and men were ignored, he wrote. We began thinking of a section that would deal with how men and women lived — together and apart — what they liked and what they were like. . . . We wanted to look at the culture of America as it was changing in front of our eyes. The sexual revolution, the drug culture, the women's movement. And we wanted it to be interesting, exciting, different.\n\nThen, as now, a good Style piece should be unpredictable and edgy. Bradlee wanted more voice in the stories, with the reporting to back it up. New Journalism was in the air — and in magazines such as Esquire, New York and Rolling Stone — but the form had yet to catch on in the daily papers, which preferred to play it straight.\n\nBradlee's editors worked on several prototypes throughout 1968. The Vietnam War, Hair, the Chicago convention riots, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy assassinations — all of it had to have been thrumming in the subconscious as they thought their way through possible concepts. They fiddled with it until it started to make sense on the page; a section with a knack for making the town seem more vital and less drab: Who we are, how we look, where we go, what we do, what we talk about (whisper about, giggle about), how it feels to be in the middle of it — of all this. Watergate, the Reagan Revolution, the Clinton years, the 9/11 era, the Obama elegance, the Trumpian chaos.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOnce they had it, what would they name it? Bradlee recalled his disdain for the passive suggestions, such as Living, Scene or Trends: I liked the word 'Style,'  he wrote. I like people with style, with flair, with signature qualities. . . . And so, three weeks before kickoff, Style it was.\n\nThere is no such thing as a casual dip into Style's 50-year archives — and no way to get a complete sense of its hits and misses. One can log in to look up something specific and wind up reading a dozen other articles, losing the afternoon. Perusing the first decade of Style, one can also see why other newspapers rushed to replicate it, coming up with their own groovy, New Journalism feature sections.\n\nAsk Post staffers or longtime readers to recall their favorite Style pieces, and the hall of fame immediately threatens to collapse under the weight of so many nominees, some as recent as last week. It's like walking into someone's house and finding every inch of wall covered in dusty, framed examples of past glories. That's fine, except when you're caught up in the 24-7 mania of digital-first journalism. Talking about the old Style section can seem like a sure way to get left behind in the past.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStill, the writers! It's astonishing, the talent and the names. The women whose reporting and writing defined so much of what the section would become. The gentleman poets on the staff. The science geeks, the weirdos. The patient, small group of Style writers and editors who, over a generation or more, helped the section see a world beyond white, status-quo Beltway narratives. The fabulous babes of Style's heyday (not always female) who prowled the parties and came back with the real dirt. The critics — conspicuously erudite or always humble, buttoned-down or reliably slobby.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe nervous but rollicking feel of the place. Back in the old building, Style occupied a swath of territory next to the main newsroom, a few stair-steps down, sort of like entering the rec room of a split-level home. There, per legend, writers' egos grew to disproportionate diva status, voices raised over the slightest edits. On computers that were the comparable size of convection ovens, one editor's story suggestion to a reporter was met (according to Style lore) with this icily messaged reply: assignment declined.\n\nA comprehensive in-house study in the late '80s fretted that Style had grown predictable and petulant; flabby with stories that were too long and writing that was too mean or too self-indulgent. At another point, in late 2000, then-Style boss Eugene Robinson (who now writes a column for the op-ed pages) sent an important memo that reminded and reinvigorated his staff: The worst Style can do, he said, is become boring.\n\nMrs. Graham died in 2001, and 13 years later, Bradlee died, too. Style moved to another floor and became part of a combined, more efficient features department. In 2015, the department migrated to K Street with the rest of the newsroom.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe reconfigured, reconceptualized and most of all reacted — as the rest of the world does — to the Internet. The action now always starts with something that has just been seen or said online.\n\nThe Internet is great, except when it ruins everything you love: bookstores, showbiz, radio stations, shopping, local newspapers, presidential elections. Finding our path in a digital future hasn't been easy. A decade ago, the Style department endured waves of anxiety, worry, staff reductions and flared tempers. The paper's future seemed precarious — until, one afternoon in summer 2013, it suddenly didn't.\n\nIn one of those great American acts of irony, Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos bought The Post from the Graham family. With some stellar nerd engineering and a lot of hard work, the Internet wasn't as scary anymore. Finally, The Post had turned a page.\n\nWhy isn't Style more like it used to be? Back in 1973, say, or back in 1979, or back in 1988? Back in 1994, or in 2005? Back when everybody liked it better.\n\nThe best reply to this is always the same: Why isn't anything like it used to be?\n\nStyle is still very much around — six days a week in print, combined with the Arts section on Sundays — and readers near and far still ask: What is Style anyhow? A fashion section with politics in it? A lifestyle section with a creepy fixation on the power class? A culture section obsessed with lewks and feels? A place to thoughtfully parse last night's Dancing With the Stars, Kanye West's meltdowns and Beyoncé's latest transmissions?\n\nReaders question Style's identity most when they are especially drawn to a hard-hitting piece on media or #MeToo or politics (Ben Terris getting an inside look at the marriage of George and Kellyanne Conway, for one recent example). It appears online with the label Style on it, which is a word they equate with softness and frivolity.\n\nIt's a valid concern: When our media critic (Margaret Sullivan), gender columnist (Monica Hesse) and chief film critic (Ann Hornaday) so routinely interpret the day's most salient talking points, does the heading Style somehow ghettoize their efforts in readers' minds? When we break news of sexual harassment by prominent male chefs and network news anchors, are we sending out the wrong message by categorizing it under Style? Has Bradlee's name for his vibrant, infinitely topical features section outlived its original meaning?\n\nIn moments like this, it can seem as though we've made the long orbit all the way back around to For and About Women — only it's evolved into a better and more inclusive concept: For and About Anyone, Everyone. That's what we ask readers to see when they see the word Style.\n\nAre you sure we're striking the right tone here, Ben?\n\nThat debate continues, day in and day out, with some magical thinking that Mrs. Graham and Bradlee and all the others might possibly be watching. Even when the tone seems like it's all over the place, after 18,263 Style sections (approximately), we click publish, and hope the answer is yes.\n\nHank Stuever, who is also 50, joined The Post as a Style reporter in 1999.

AD\n\nStill, as recently as two months ago, I thought there was consensus around some interpretations — for instance, that nothing in the Constitution permitted anyone to single-handedly overturn the results of a presidential election. The white nationalists who stormed the Capitol to reject that interpretation left me questioning how long the document will survive.\n\nAD\n\nYet as surprised as I was, I had to share a difficult truth with my students: This has all been a continuation of — not an aberration from — America's constitutional tradition.\n\nA striking photo from the insurrection depicts a man holding a Confederate flag outside the Senate chamber. Behind him, on permanent display, is a portrait of John C. Calhoun. Calhoun roamed the Capitol shortly after its construction by enslaved workers. He boldly protected the system of racialized violence that oppressed these workers — as did the Constitution.\n\nAD\n\nOne of those protections was the method the Constitution prescribed for presidential elections. It allowed Calhoun's state of South Carolina to count three-fifths of its enslaved residents as if they supported the state's choice for president. As the Constitution authorized, the legislature itself allocated the state's electoral votes, sent Calhoun to the Senate and malapportioned its own seats to ensure the political domination of wealthy slaveowners.\n\nAD\n\nSimilar protections of racial subordination pervade the Constitution. The taxing clause was structured to prevent the federal taxation of enslaved property. The commerce clause was interpreted to prevent Congress from regulating commerce in enslaved people. The fugitive slave clause authorized agents to raid and deport northern Black people into slave states.\n\nThe Civil War brought with it a decade of constitutional renewal. The 13th, 14th and 15th amendments abolished slavery, guaranteed the equal citizenship of Black people and enfranchised Black men. Federal civil rights laws permitted multiracial democracy to exist in this country for the first time.\n\nAD\n\nBut the moment was fleeting. Terrorists clad in white hoods and red shirts lynched Black voters. The Supreme Court declared that Congress had no power to stop this violence. The court warned that Congress was running the slavery argument into the ground when it passed anti-discrimination laws, and it was time for Black people to cease to be the special favorite of the laws. White Americans gleefully responded by inaugurating a system of racial apartheid.\n\nAD\n\nThe Supreme Court condoned this system, interpreting the 14th Amendment to protect corporations but not people of color; to permit disenfranchisement but not redistribution; to allow lynch mobs but not labor protections. Only after the Great Depression did the court reevaluate its precedents and permit Congress to reshape the constitutional order the court had sustained. Demonstrators spent the next century marching to resurrect the nation's fragile commitment to multiracial democracy. Yet they encountered massive resistance, persisting to this day, from Confederate-flag-waving opponents.\n\nI wrote all this to my students to explain why this past year's violence reads like the unexpected page of a familiar story.\n\nAD\n\nYet I also wrote that this story need not end in tragedy. The Constitution has done far more than tolerate profound injustice. The clauses that once permitted the exclusion of Chinese laborers forged a country whose liberties attracted immigrants from around the world. The articles that sanctioned the dispossession of Native tribes have evolved to stand for democratic self-rule. The same words that invalidated minimum-wage laws now guarantee reproductive freedom, marriage equality and religious liberty. An antiquated document that enabled so much that was wrong has also protected so much that is right.\n\nAD\n\nWhat I want my students to learn is that the difference between a just and unjust interpretation of the Constitution — between a peaceful transfer of power and an armed insurrection — is not an objective question of linguistics. It is a subjective matter of moral principle. What has made the Constitution good is not courts reflecting back the flawed principles of their own societies. It has been rising generations like my students who demand that new principles are necessary for the Constitution to live up to its own words and establish Justice.\n\nI told them, in short, that they don't need to like how the Constitution has been interpreted. But they do need to understand how it should be interpreted. The Constitution provides the vocabulary by which this country debates what is just.\n\nAD\n\nAs the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. observed at the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, If we are wrong, the Constitution of the United States is wrong. He did not think the Constitution was wrong. Neither do I.
The company hired Charles E. Barry and Henry Simpson to design the homes, according to Robert S. Pohl, an author of books on Capitol Hill who writes for the blog The Hill Is Home. Barry & Simpson designed many buildings throughout the city, including ones for Georgetown University and Gonzaga College High School and the addition to the American Security and Trust Co.

Holland wrote in her 1987 book Old Homes and Families of Howard County, Maryland. The 67-acre horse farm in Highland, Md., is listed at $9 million. (HomeVisit)\n\nThe architectural firm chose the Richardsonian Romanesque style for its design of the homes, a style of Romanesque Revival architecture named after architect Henry Hobson Richardson. Most of Richardson's designs used stone to evoke a sense of permanence. According to local lore, the gray stones used for these homes were the same as those used for the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress.\n\nAlvaro F. Gibbens and his wife, Mary Barr Warfield Gibbens, were the first owners of the home. Gibbens was an author, a poet, a newspaper editor, a clerk in the U.S. Treasury Department, postmaster of Charleston, W.Va., and twice president of the West Virginia Historical Society.\n\nHis first wife, Bessie Egan, died in 1890. A year later, he married Mary Barr Warfield, who was a descendant of Capt. Joseph Burgess of Maryland. Gibbens was her third husband. Her first husband was a nephew of President Andrew Jackson's wife; her second husband was the great-grandson of Lord William Butterworth Bayley. She died shortly after her marriage to Gibbens.\n\nGeorge W. Esterly, who came to Washington from Wisconsin to be the deputy auditor for State and other departments, lived in the home shortly after the Gibbenses. Esterley's father invented a farm implement that rivaled the McCormick reaper. Esterly worked for his father's company before coming to Washington.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe current owners, who bought the four-level home in 2008, hired architect Steve Lawlor to renovate it and bring it into the modern day while maintaining its historic integrity.\n\nMost of the house was gutted, Lawlor said. We brought it back, keeping some of the DNA of the house.\n\nLawlor redid the kitchen in 2008, installing statuary marble countertops and Affinity cabinetry. A built-in banquet provides a cozy seating area. Glass doors lead to a bright and airy screened porch. The kitchen was given two design awards — the National Association of the Remodeling Industry's Coty award and Qualified Remodeler's Chrysalis award.\n\nThe top-floor master suite, which includes an office space, also was redone by Lawlor.\n\nAD\n\nThe seven-bedroom, three-bathroom, 3,994-square-foot house is listed at $2,175,000.

We sat up top in the back of the theater and, as I watched the performance, I was in complete awe, Harris said in an email to The Washington Post. To this day, I know the lyrics to nearly every Bob Marley song.\n\nThe experience was meant to be more than musical. Her father, a prominent Jamaican economics professor teaching at Stanford, was trying to imbue his two American-born girls with a sense of pride in their roots. Like the Harrises, Marley was from a parish on the north coast of the island called St. Ann.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMy father, like so many Jamaicans, has immense pride in our Jamaican heritage and instilled that same pride in my sister and me, Harris wrote. We love Jamaica. He taught us the history of where we're from, the struggles and beauty of the Jamaican people, and the richness of the culture.\n\nMost of the time Kamala Harris and her sister, Maya, spent growing up was with their mother, the consequence of a bitter divorce and tough custody battle. Shyamala Gopalan, a cancer researcher who grew up in India, had taken a job at McGill University a little over a year before the concert.\n\nThree seasons a year, the girls lived in Montreal. Summers included bonding time with their father.\n\nAD\n\nThroughout Kamala Harris's historical political career — a zenith of which will be her swearing-in as the country's first female, first Black and first Asian vice president — Donald Harris has chosen to be in the background. The two are on good terms, friends and relatives of Donald Harris say. But at 82, he has little desire for the attention or celebrity that comes with his daughter's ascent.\n\nAD\n\nThe only major comment he made about her political campaign came after Harris jokingly cited her Jamaican heritage on a radio show in 2019 when asked if she ever smoked marijuana.\n\nSpeaking for myself and my immediate Jamaican family, we wish to categorically dissociate ourselves from this travesty, Donald Harris wrote in a column for Jamaica Global Online. After that comment, Harris has repeatedly told reporters that he wanted to stay out of politics.\n\nAD\n\nFor years, he has lived near his daughter's condo in Washington's West End, but Kamala Harris's transition team is not sure he will be part of any inauguration festivities. Her father did not respond to several requests seeking comment.\n\nHarris has noted her late mother was the most formative parent in her life. Gopalan took her daughters to her hometown of Chennai in southern India and dressed them in Indian jewelry. Tamil Americans have been delighted to hear Kamala Harris use the word chitti — a term of endearment for the younger sister of one's mother — in high-profile speeches.\n\nAD\n\nGopalan was also a student of the civil rights movement and knew society would see her daughters as Black Americans. So she also introduced them to Aretha Franklin, sent them to a Black church and a preschool with Harriet Tubman posters on the wall, steeping them in the African American experience.\n\nBut there was a third culture that influenced Kamala Harris, and that came from her father, who wanted to make sure his children understood his homeland of Jamaica. This contribution is perhaps the most singular impression he made on the identity of the senator from California.\n\nAD\n\nDonald Harris deemed those lessons both a patriotic and a paternal duty.\n\nIn a 2018 essay published via Jamaica Global Online, Harris described that duty as the continuation of a philosophy bestowed upon him all his life, from his youth in a rural island town to his career teaching at some of the most respected universities in the world. The philosophy was often delivered in the Jamaican patois: member whe yu cum fram. Remember where you come from.\n\nThe matriarch\n\nHarris's Jamaican family comes from Brown's Town, so named after enslaver Hamilton Brown. It remains a rural area that bustles with markets, where merchants sell meat, spices and other goods.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHarris's great-grandmother, Christiana Brown, is thought to be both a descendant of Brown and enslaved Jamaicans, according to Latoya Harris, 39, who is also a great-grandchild of Brown, a stern businesswoman everyone called Miss Chrishy.\n\nBrown had children with Joseph Harris, a landowner of European ancestry who raised cattle and planted fields of pimento berries, also known as allspice. Miss Chrishy owned a small store along the town's main street.\n\nThe family has since given up operating the store, but the structure remains. The store sold everyday goods and featured a large brick oven that was used to make its famous bulla cakes, flavorful flat pastries made with flour, ginger and molasses. This was a family of merchants, a legacy that continued with Kamala Harris's grandfather and Donald Harris's father, Oscar.\n\nIn his 2018 essay, Donald Harris wrote he would go to Miss Chrishy's store after school so she could drive him home. It was Miss Chrishy's love of discussing business and politics — as well as his experience spending summers on his maternal grandparents' sugar cane farm — that shaped a curiosity about labor economics that became his life passion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe generations-long Harris tradition, according to Latoya Harris, had been to always try to do the most. She recalled elders waking her to redo class assignments if they thought she hadn't worked hard enough on them. And her Uncle Donald — their brilliant relative who taught in the United States — was often held up as a prime example.\n\nDonald Harris's love of economics took him to the University of the West Indies and then to Berkeley, where he received his PhD in 1966. Harris was then embroiled in what was known as the Cambridge Controversy — so named because it featured academic sparring between professors publishing from the two Cambridges, Massachusetts and England — about theories of economic growth.\n\nIn the late 1970s, American University professor Robert Blecker was an undergraduate at Yale, eager to learn about these theories at a lecture from a visiting professor. When Don Harris — as he is known in academic circles — walked into the room, Blecker was surprised.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI had heard his name and I may have seen his articles, but none had discussed his race, Blecker said. The name didn't resonate in any identifying way. And in came this Black guy. And not just a Black guy, but one with a Jamaican accent — and a very erudite Jamaican accent.\n\nAt that point, Blecker said, there were hardly any other Black professors or women in the department. This was all very different, he said. He was so inspired by Harris that he went on to pursue a graduate degree in economics under his tutelage at Stanford.\n\nIn the United States, Harris's brand of economics was seen as a part of the academic counterculture. He questioned the mathematical presumptions of supply and demand that depended on the theoretical rational man to understand economic growth.\n\nAD\n\nInstead, he incorporated the philosophies of economic thinkers such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx, questioned the relationship between production and profits, and discussed the importance of income distribution.\n\nAD\n\nHis premise, though, wasn't simply based on those who had written books. It came from watching Miss Chrishy discuss the meaning of work at the family store and hearing workers in sugar cane fields discuss wages.\n\nAt Stanford, he became the first Black economics professor to receive tenure. His students joked about the way he frequently arrived for class about 10 minutes late — some attributed it to his easygoing Caribbean demeanor. His high-minded theories, though, were no joke. By the end of one of his lectures, the chalkboard would be dusty from his scribbling of matrix equations and linear curves.\n\nThe students who were interested in the alternate approach to economics, however, tended not to be so fond of math, according to Steve Fazzari, another one of Harris's students who now teaches at the Washington University in St. Louis. Harris gained a reputation in his department for being a prolific author and engaging speaker who was not always accessible. In his colleague Duncan Foley's autobiography, the economist referred to Don Harris as a brilliant man who had a tendency to overcommitment.\n\nAD\n\nThere's something about the incoming vice president that reminds Don Harris's students of their old graduate adviser. Even while they could become annoyed by his hands-off approach, they admired his incisive questioning of graduate students and visitors giving presentations to the department.\n\nHe had a way of getting to the heart of the matter, said Tracy Mott, a former student who is now a professor at the University of Denver. And I loved watching Kamala grill people at the Judiciary Committee hearings. I'd hear her and say, 'She's smart like Don.' \n\nHarris also took an interest in the civil rights movement. He and Gopalan were part of a social circle that read, debated and theorized on the best ways to achieve Black liberation, according to Aubrey LaBrie, an old family friend.\n\nHarris was one of the more reserved people in the group, friends recall, eager to have long discussions about philosophy and policy but less at home standing on campus soapboxes and addressing large crowds. Never forgetting his life back home, he even wrote pieces in Jamaican newspapers describing the importance of Malcolm X to the United States.\n\nHe and Gopalan fell in love protesting, and Kamala Harris often speaks about accompanying them to demonstrations while she was in a stroller. But their marriage did not last. In Kamala Harris's memoir, The Truths We Hold, she wrote that the two stopped being kind to each other by the time she was 5.\n\nWhen Don Harris took a visiting professorship at the University of Wisconsin, Gopalan stayed behind with the girls. In 1971, when Kamala was 7, the two divorced. The relationship became so tense, Kamala Harris wrote in her memoir, that she worried her mother would not even show up at her high school graduation if her father was there. (He attended, and so did she.)\n\nIt was hard on both of them, Kamala Harris wrote in the book. I think, for my mother, the divorce represented a kind of failure she had never considered.\n\nBrown's Town summers\n\nAfter the marital split, Kamala Harris's weekends and summers were with her father. He watched the pet hamster and took the girls to Disneyland. But the most memorable trips were the ones back to Jamaica.\n\nOn the island, they visited the markets of Brown's Town where her great-grandmother had the family store and her great-grandfather is buried in the Anglican Church graveyard. The sisters ran through the old family properties and the sugar cane fields.\n\nThey'd attend get-togethers in the hills, where an uncle would be making a big pot of curry goat outside, and relatives prepared signature Jamaican dishes: rice and peas, jerk chicken, beef patties.\n\nWhen someone comes back home, we roll out the red carpet for them, said Latoya Harris, her second cousin, who works in educational philanthropy. That's just who we are.\n\nKamala and Maya would bite into sugar cane on front porches, buy fruit at the markets and cruise around with their Uncle Chris, a racecar driver.\n\nI remember him calling speed bumps 'sleeping policemen,' '' Harris told The Post. That's where I got my love of driving a little too fast.\n\nWhen Kamala Harris got a little older, her father introduced her to Marley and Jimmy Cliff. She picked up some patois, the distinct Jamaican dialect that blends English with African languages.\n\nBut he also tried to shape an understanding of the culture that went beyond food and music. He taught his daughters about the history of the Jamaican Maroons, kidnapped Africans who rebelled from their captors and escaped to the mountains. The elder Harris taught her about the vast gulf between the wealthy and the poor in Jamaica, and the challenges to economic growth — blending his experience with his expertise.\n\nThose challenges still consume Donald Harris.\n\nAfter retiring from Stanford in 1998, he moved to D.C. to consult with agencies such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank on economic issues in the Caribbean. Harris's prescriptions have included limiting government intervention in exchange rates, the creation of credit bureaus and tax reform, according to Gerry Johnson, a former general manager of the Caribbean Country Department at the IADB.\n\nThese changes have basically created the possibility of Jamaica to start increasing its productivity and stop being a poor country and have a brighter future, Johnson said. The country has received accolades for its growth. And that's a tribute to the type of policies that Don Harris has been promoting.\n\nIt is also a part of his philosophy of remembering where he came from.\n\nHis daughter says she tries to do the same. Even as she prepares for the transition to the vice-presidential residence at One Observatory Circle, she wrote that she still has frozen Juici patties in her fridge and a recipe for oxtail that she is longing to perfect.\n\nHer fluency in the culture still tends to surprise some. In 2018, months before she would announce her own presidential campaign, a group of prominent Jamaicans and Jamaican Americans in South Florida gathered to greet her at a private fundraiser for then-Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) in downtown Miami. They had all admired her political career, but they still had questions about her comfort with the culture. The word Jamaica isn't even cited as a keyword in the index of her memoir.\n\nAt the end of the fundraiser, the group gathered to ask questions. Harris told them her family came from Brown's Town and that she has relatives in St. Ann's Bay.\n\nWinston Barnes, a city commissioner from Miramar, thickened his Jamaican accent to see if she could keep up.\n\nWhat you know about St. Ann? he recalled asking her.\n\nTo his surprise, Harris switched into a patois inflection.\n\nHow you mean? she responded. I know there from growin' up.\n\nAnd then she began to tell the stories about her adventures with her father.\n\nThat's what I needed to hear, Barnes reflected. She is one of us.
This really does remind me that the most dangerous period in an abusive marriage is when you leave, the New Yorker's Emily Nussbaum tweeted, and this seemed an eerily apt metaphor for President Trump's behavior. But I get the sense that some on the left are taking the analogy too far — applying it to Trump's voters, not just the man himself. And, of course, there's no way to leave them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI have not yet heard anyone on the left outline a credible vision for what happens after we impeach the president and, one hopes, convict him and bar our insurrectionist in chief from ever holding office again. I would like to know that there is one, and not just a fond hope that the backlash for Jan. 6 will break the Republican Party once and for all. The Democrats have wasted the better part of two decades on deterministic assumptions that, one day, demographic destiny or some other deus ex machina will do its work, Republicans will obligingly die off, and the woke will inherit the Earth.\n\nTry assuming instead that they will be a political force to be reckoned with — and negotiated with — for the rest of everyone's life.\n\nBut this is a reasonable and benign fantasy compared to the one Republicans indulged in Wednesday: that if they were willing to condemn the Capitol insurrection as the work of a few bad apples, Democrats should admit their part in stoking our increasingly bitter divides, and we should all move on. It will only serve to further divide a nation that is calling out for healing, said Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) as the House took up impeachment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis was such an incredible suggestion that I did its authors the credit of assuming that none of them actually meant it. It was, I thought, the sort of well-I-had-to-try-didn't-I? absurdity that politicians are sometimes forced to utter. But it quickly became clear that, no, there are people who seriously thought that this was not just a reasonable thing to ask, but a plausible one, after the events of last week.\n\nThis was beyond a fantasy. To circle back to our earlier metaphor: Republicans who humored Trump's seditious lies as he made a serious run at overturning the results of a democratic election need to understand that their party is the abusive spouse in this scenario. It doesn't matter what the other party did first. What matters is that a Republican president brought an angry mob to Washington, told it there was a crime happening on Capitol Hill, and then urged it to do something about it.\n\nIf this family can ever be put back together, it will start with more Republicans acting as though they understood this was almost unforgivable. Making up lies about a stolen election is wrong in itself, and when those lies end up with five people dead, everyone who helped spread them is responsible, particularly if they knew better — as everyone in Washington politics either did or should have.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe cheapest and easiest way for Republicans to make the necessary atonement is to cut Trump loose, completely. Vote to remove him from office and bar him from running again. Let the man who brought this down upon his country languish unlamented in electronic exile. This will make it clear to voters that they understand what a grave thing happened, and that they are determined not just to make amends, but also to ensure that nothing like it ever happens again.\n\nWhat's that, you say, your base will punish you? It's not realistic to expect anyone to do something so politically costly?\n\nWell, yes, of course, it is going to be costly; cheaper and easier is not the same as cheap and easy. But you cannot restore a broken relationship with perfunctory gestures and empty words. What's needed is a demonstration that you are willing to pay any price to fix what is broken and to undo as much as possible the damage you have done.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf Republicans cannot do this, then the wounds that they allegedly want to heal will only deepen and fester, especially within their own party. They might purchase a little temporary peace by catering to the mob-friendly base. But doing so will drive off the moderates who want no part of what happened last Wednesday — and further empower a mob that has already terrorized their party into submission, and would like to do the same to the rest of us.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAD
That doesn't mean the ERA is now in force. In 1972, when Congress originally sent the ERA to the states to be ratified, it set a deadline of 1979 for ratification, a deadline that was extended to 1982 — at which time only 35 states had ratified the measure. For that and other reasons, three state attorneys general recently filed a federal suit aiming to block adoption of the amendment. On Jan. 7, ERA advocates filed suit in Massachusetts arguing that the deadline is not binding because it was not in the text of the original amendment. That will take time to work its way through the courts.\n\nBut what if the ERA had been ratified way back in 1982? Let's consider what it would — and would not — have done.\n\nWould an ERA have pushed forward women's rights dramatically?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMany observers believe that an Equal Rights Amendment would provide ironclad, irreversible guarantees of women's rights. That's what Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) suggested in a statement after the Virginia vote: A constitutional amendment is forever. It cannot be repealed, rolled back or expire. It is not subject to the whims of who controls Congress, a statehouse, or the White House. Advocates believe it would strengthen legislation on issues ranging from pregnancy discrimination to equal pay to violence against women. Opponents fear it would be used to overturn abortion restrictions.\n\nMy research suggests the impact would be less dramatic. First, the ERA would probably affect Supreme Court decisions indirectly, by raising sex equality to the status of a fundamental right and increasing the standard that the Supreme Court would apply in determining whether a law that discriminates on the basis of sex violates the Constitution. That would make it more likely that courts would favor those who sought gender equality. Second, the ERA would not constitutionally protect women in most cases of violence against women. I'll explain below.\n\nWhat can we learn from the 25 states that have state-level equal rights amendments?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo assess the potential effect of a federal ERA, we can examine the impact of state-level equal rights amendments, which half the states have. California passed the first one in 1879, prohibiting workplace-based sex discrimination; Delaware is the most recent, having adopted such an amendment just last year. Maine, Minnesota and New York may be getting close.\n\nPolitical scientists Lee Epstein, Andrew D. Martin and I examined all state-level constitutional sex-discrimination cases that reached states' top courts between 1960 and 1999, looking at both the legal standards the courts applied and how the cases were decided. We find no evidence that simply having an ERA directly affects how sex discrimination cases are decided — but it affects those decisions indirectly. In the United States, courts can choose the standard they will use to determine whether a law is constitutional. If a law violates a fundamental right, such as free speech or the 14th Amendment, it will apply the highest standard of review, known as strict scrutiny. Our research shows that having a state-level ERA significantly increases the likelihood that judges will apply a higher standard of law in sex discrimination cases. That leads state-level courts to rule more often in favor of the person claiming sex discrimination.\n\nThat was true even when controlling for other factors that might influence justices, including ideology, the percentage of women on the bench, whether a state ratified the federal ERA, and the kinds of litigation being considered. Of course, these results need updating. But if we rely on these findings, we would expect that a national ERA would increase the likelihood that Supreme Court justices would apply a higher level of scrutiny to sex discrimination cases and would eradicate all sex-based classifications — treating sex the way that race is treated now.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat about registration for the military draft, abortion, same-sex marriage and gender-neutral bathrooms, issues that have been on the agenda since the ERA battle began in the 1970s? Again, any effect would likely be indirect, with the court applying the strict scrutiny standard. But an ERA may not be necessary to expand rights protections in those areas. The Supreme Court didn't need an ERA to invalidate state laws that prohibit same-sex marriage, for example. And the Supreme Court will soon announce its decisions on two cases — Altitude Express v. Zarda and Bostock v. Clayton County — that hinge on the question of whether the on the basis of sex language in the Civil Rights Act necessarily includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\nDon't expect the ERA to change case law about gender-based violence\n\nWith the #MeToo movement, support for the ERA surged. Some observers hope ratification would strengthen legal protections against violence against women. This is unlikely. The Constitution — and the rights and equality that it guarantees — applies only to what the government does, not to private actors. Laws that discriminate against women are unconstitutional, but the Constitution does not protect citizens from harms committed by private individuals or organizations. And in most domestic and sexual violence, individuals' wrongs are the main concern. As I argue in Defying Convention: U.S. Resistance to the U.N. Treaty on Women's Rights, this means that an ERA would not provide a constitutional right to protection against intimate-partner violence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConsider Supreme Court decisions in domestic violence cases, especially the 2005 decision in Castle Rock v. Gonzales. In that case, Jessica Gonzales's husband violated a restraining order she had against him and brutally murdered their three daughters. The court maintained that the police in Castle Rock, Colo., could exercise discretion in deciding whether to enforce a protective order — and that Gonzales had no constitutional right to that protection. An ERA would likely have little effect here.
Why the sudden interest in transgender youth in predominantly Republican states? And what will the consequences be for transgender people across the United States?\n\nHere's what my research shows.\n\nHow I did my research\n\nIn a recent article, I analyzed legislative measures that would prohibit transgender people from accessing sex-segregated areas such as public restrooms and school locker rooms. Using a variety of data sources, including the Human Rights Campaign's State Equality Index archives and the National Center for Transgender Equality's State Action Center archives, I identified 71 bills introduced in state legislatures between Jan. 1, 2014, and Feb. 7, 2018, that included the word transgender.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2015, legislatures suddenly began paying a great deal of attention to transgender issues. Although lawmakers introduced only two bills using the word transgender in 2014, that increased to nine in 2015, 22 in 2016, 26 in 2017, and 15 in 2018. The vast majority of these bills outlined some kind of ban against transgender people using sex-segregated public facilities, primarily bathrooms. For instance, North Carolina's controversial HB2 overturned local transgender rights ordinances and banned transgender-identified people from using public restrooms corresponding to their gender identification unless their birth certificates were updated.\n\nAlthough my analysis ended just a few months into 2018, to date none of those bills have been signed into law. Further, in 2017, North Carolina lawmakers repealed the bathroom provision of HB2 in 2017.\n\nContent analysis shows most of these measures use the words sex and gender interchangeably and define both as strictly biological, determined by chromosomes and based on physical anatomy at the time of birth. This contrasts with more contemporary understandings detaching gender — determined by social and legal norms — from biology, or sex. Collapsing sex and gender together thus allows opponents of transgender rights to assert biology determines gender.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court expanded marriage rights, socially conservative forces shifted to a slightly different target\n\nLegal advocate Shannon Minter argues that after the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which opened legal marriage rights to same-sex couples across the 50 states, anti-gay activists switched their focus to transgender issues. Minter explains that conservative groups argued that marriage is, by definition, a reproductive union that ought to produce children — a theory of marriage that treats it as biologically determined rather than as a social or personal union. In the same way, he argues, this new legislation reifies a biological theory of binary sex to obscure the way these bills authorize discrimination against transgender people. In this view, the uptick in anti-trans legislation is a continuation of conservative strategies aimed at rolling back the rights of LGBTQ people based on the conservative idea that there are two sexes with different, biologically determined roles.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo conservatives shifted from blocking marriage equality to blocking restroom access for transgender people in 2016. Having lost that round, they've shifted to protecting young people from gender-confirmation treatment, still grounded in the same theories of sex and gender as biologically determined.\n\nFor example, in 2019, the socially conservative Minnesota Family Council published a 66-page document titled Responding to the Transgender Issue in conjunction with the Heritage Foundation, the anti-LGBTQ group Alliance Defending Freedom, groups of radical feminist essentialists such as Women's Liberation Front, or WOLF, and the newly minted Kelsey Coalition, composed of parents and medical professionals who do not believe children and adolescents are capable of identifying as transgender.\n\nThe guide recommends several policy steps. One requires schools to notify parents if their child expresses a different identity at school — a vague directive that aims at the fact students often come out as transgender, lesbian or gay to school counselors before they tell their families. Another suggests girls' physical safety and athletic opportunities can only be ensured if teams are separated by sex rather than gender identity. The latter argues for limiting participation in sports on the basis of sex assigned at birth, which would formally exclude transgender boys and girls from school sports.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMost of this year's state legislative bills limiting young people from accessing transition-related health care and participation in sports teams echo these talking points, which might not be coincidental. Earlier this month, NBC News reported Jenny Pizer of Lambda Legal identified an organization called Project Blitz, a coalition of evangelical Christian organizations, as the driving force behind model legislation that targets transgender youth.\n\nAdverse consequences of targeting transgender youth\n\nIn 2016, the National Center for Transgender Equality published a survey of transgender adults. Of those who reported they identified as or were perceived as transgender or gender-nonconforming during their K-12 school years, 77 percent said they had been harassed or mistreated in some way; just over half reported being harassed verbally for their gender identity; a quarter indicated they'd been physically attacked, and about a tenth said they'd been sexually assaulted. Seventeen percent said they left school before they graduated because of the harassment and violence they endured. Just over half of those who reported negative experiences in schools said they had considered suicide, which is higher than the third of transgender-identified youth who had not been harassed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCritics of legislation banning gender-affirming medical treatment point to statistics like these to argue that such legislation can actively harm transgender and gender-nonconforming youth, both physically and emotionally. Pediatricians who care for gender-nonconforming or transgender-identified children and adolescents regularly describe transition-related care as lifesaving.\n\nWe don't yet know whether any of these bills will become law. But it's likely state legislatures will continue trying to pass measures attempting to enact into law a strict definition of male and female as biologically distinct, permanently so.
by Steven Rogelberg, expected Jan. 2\n\nIf one of your New Year's resolutions is to spend less time sitting in or leading useless meetings, this book is for you. Rogelberg, a researcher who studies teamwork and meetings at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, offers evidence-based ideas for how long meetings should be (about 5 to 10 percent shorter in length than your initial estimate), how to make agendas more effective (move status updates to the end) and how to improve idea generation (consider a silent reading period for workers to consider a new proposal and then have a discussion rather than listen to a long presentation).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby Cal Newport, expected Feb. 5\n\nA follow-up to Newport's first book (Deep Work) on the digital communication distractions people experience at work, Digital Minimalism looks at the tyranny of online social media, mobile phones and technological interruptions in our personal lives. Newport, an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown University who has written several books related to work, technology and study habits, suggests that people need to take more comprehensive steps than just, say, not keeping their phones by their beds at night. Instead, they need a full-fledged philosophy of technological use, opting out of any optional online activities for 30 days and then slowly adding back the ones they need in a sustainable way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby James O'Toole, expected Feb. 26\n\nO'Toole, an emeritus professor at the University of Southern California's business school, shares the stories of more than two dozen business entrepreneurs — some famous, some little known — who tried to incorporate socially responsible business practices into how they ran their companies. Yet the result is not a hagiography lauding the careers of these enlightened capitalists, which includes everyone from chocolate magnate Milton Hershey to cosmetics and skin care founder Anita Roddick, but a cautionary look at how so many of their sustainable practices were cut short by bankruptcies, acquisitions or unwilling successors — and what other executives can learn from them. At a time when more and more consumers expect business to benefit the greater good, the book is timely. It asks big questions like whether socially virtuous business tactics are actually compatible with shareholder capitalism, and, as he writes in the preface, what may matter most: Whether in the collective judgment of corporate executives, executives actually believe it is possible — or sensible — to try to do good as they seek to do well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, expected March 12\n\nA provocative title that began life as a Harvard Business Review article — and has grown to become one of the publication's most-read stories online — this upcoming book looks at how to spot incompetent leaders and identify good ones, as well as why companies so often mix up the two. Chamorro-Premuzic, who is chief talent scientist at ManpowerGroup and teaches at University College London and Columbia University, explores our inability to distinguish between confidence and competence, how narcissism affects the gender imbalance in leadership, the advantages he says women generally have with traits like emotional intelligence and how organizations can better evaluate potential and coach and develop leaders.\n\nAD\n\nby Evan Thomas, expected March 19\n\nBusiness leaders often turn to examples from history for inspiration — bullet points from business consultants can only take people so far. For those readers, this biography of former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor — the first woman on the highest court — by journalist Evan Thomas is unlikely to disappoint. Before joining the Court, O'Connor became the first female majority leader of a state senate and then served time as a judge on the Arizona State Court of Appeals. The book's synopsis suggests that it offers inspiration for women and men who want to be leaders and be first in their own lives — who want to learn when to walk away and when to stand their ground.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby Safi Bahcall, expected March 19\n\nBahcall, a physicist and biotech entrepreneur who worked on President Barack Obama's council of science advisers in 2011, uses the science of phase transitions to explain how teams or organizations with a mission begin rejecting wild new ideas and suggests ways to better nurture those crazy notions. Stanford professor Bob Sutton said in an email recommending the book that it is sort of physics meets history meets innovation meets management and organizational design, as well as that Bahcall's argument that structure is not appreciated enough and culture is appreciated too much is, I think, right.\n\nAD\n\nby Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall, expected April 2\n\nBuckingham, the management guru whose books about finding your strengths at work have become best-sellers, and Goodall, an executive at Cisco, argue that several of the basic truths of the workplace today are not really true, but lies — or at least distorted conventions, wrong assumptions or under-analyzed habits. Prompted by a Harvard Business Review article that condemned the traditional performance review, their upcoming book busts open and calls out ingrained ideas such as people can reliably rate other people and people care which company they work for, making it a guide that could help you rethink your organization's thinking.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby Melinda Gates, expected April 23\n\nPart memoir, part call to action, part profile of women she's met through her work as co-chair of the Gates Foundation, Gates' debut book is an inspirational look at the need to empower women to make change in the world. The book is organized by issue (family planning, education for girls, child marriage, women in the workplace), and Gates weaves in personal stories of her own life and tales of women she's met along the way to describe why lifting up women is the key to lasting change. As she writes in her introduction: I quickly realized —because I was quickly told — that it wasn't enough to speak up for family planning, or even for each of the issues I've just named. I had to speak up for women. And I soon saw that if we are going to take our place as equals with men, it won't come from winning our rights one by one or step by step; we'll win our rights in waves as we become empowered.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nby David Epstein, expected May 28\n\nIn a world where expertise feels less and less valued, it may seem heretical to suggest that generalists can win out over specialists. But Epstein, a ProPublica journalist and author of The Sports Gene, which examined the nature vs. nurture debate on athletic performance, writes that in most fields — especially complex and unpredictable ones — generalists are better positioned to excel. Relying on scientific research, Epstein examined successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists for this study of performance, a reminder that having many interests, starting late and quitting frequently can have value, too.\n\nby Ash Carter, expected June 11\n\nThis year will be full of autobiographies or books about American ideals, many of them leadership-themed, by potential presidential aspirants. Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has a book launching in February. Sen. Kamala D. Harris has a title coming this month. We didn't consider any of those for the list, but former Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter's memoir about his career and the leadership lessons from running the Pentagon seems worth a look, especially following the sudden departure of Jim Mattis from President Trump's Cabinet. Carter, who served more than 35 years in the Department of Defense, draws on his career to describe what it takes to be the chief executive officer of a department that employs millions of people and manages one of the most complex organizations on earth.
Buttigieg's decision came shortly before Super Tuesday, the biggest primary day of the year, at a time when the Democratic race shows signs of becoming a race between Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden, with Biden occupying a centrist position that Buttigieg had hoped to make his own.\n\nButtigieg struggled to win support from black voters, a key pillar of the Democratic coalition and a vulnerability that was emphasized Saturday in South Carolina, where he finished fourth.\n\nThe normally stoic Buttigieg appeared to be steadying himself throughout his farewell remarks in his hometown of South Bend, bringing to an end what was for a time an electrifying candidacy. After a year of going everywhere, meeting everyone, defying every expectation, seeking every vote, the truth is that the path has narrowed to a close for our candidacy, if not for our cause, Buttigieg said.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden celebrated his first nominating contest win in the 2020 presidential election during South Carolina's primary on Feb. 29. (The Washington Post)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe also referred to the pioneering nature of his run, saying, We sent a message to every kid out there wondering if whatever marks them out as different means they are somehow destined to be less than. [They saw] that someone who once felt that exact same way can become a leading American presidential candidate — with his husband at his side.\n\nButtigieg's departure may help add some clarity to a Democratic presidential field that at one point included more than two dozen candidates, including an array of senators and governors, but has dwindled to just a handful.\n\nAt first it seemed Buttigieg might be one of the survivors, as he won the Iowa caucuses and came in second in New Hampshire. But despite attracting enormous attention, significant support and often enthusiastic crowds, Buttigieg was not polling well in the upcoming primary states and never found a way to reverse the antipathy he generated in the black community.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEarlier Sunday, his campaign held a call with reporters in which senior adviser Michael Halle and deputy campaign manager Hari Sevugan made the case that while Buttigieg probably wouldn't win any of the 14 states that vote Tuesday, he could still accumulate enough delegates to keep Sanders's lead to a minimum.\n\nBut his campaign has also been realistic about its poll numbers, which allowed him to declare victory in Iowa before official results came in. His Sunday exit suggests his campaign's internal numbers showed Buttigieg would not be able to stay within striking distance of Sanders.\n\nAn aide to Buttigieg's campaign said Buttigieg and his advisers looked at their models after South Carolina results came in, and they discovered their path had narrowed.\n\nAD\n\nEssentially the reason he is suspending his campaign is the reason he started the campaign: His goal is to defeat the president and bring a new kind of politics to our country, a Buttigieg aide said. He thought his candidacy would be best vehicle to do that. And when it became clear his candidacy was not the most viable vehicle to do that, he stepped aside to make sure [Democrats] could still achieve those things.\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg called Biden shortly after news of his departure broke, according to two Biden aides who said the candidates exchanged voice mails but had yet to connect. Biden was in Norfolk, Va., for a rally Sunday night.\n\nButtigieg's exit leaves several unanswered questions, chief among them whether he will endorse Biden or any of the other remaining contenders, and whether his staffers will shift over to another campaign. It also leaves unanswered the question of Buttigieg's own future.\n\nAD\n\nButtigieg made history by becoming the first openly gay candidate to earn delegates for the presidential nomination in a major political party. He also broke barriers by making his marriage to his husband, Chasten, a major part of his campaign.\n\nChasten normally joins his husband onstage after rallies, but Saturday night, the Buttigiegs lingered in a noticeably longer hug than usual — a rare sign of the emotional toll the campaign was taking on Pete Buttigieg, who knew then the end was near.\n\nAD\n\nChasten was also the first onstage at Buttigieg's South Bend event Sunday, and he delivered an emotional introduction in which he told the crowd his husband had helped him believe in himself again, and that he urged him to run for president because I knew there were other kids in this country who needed to believe in themselves, too.\n\nAD\n\nYet Buttigieg did not make the trailblazing nature of his campaign central to his pitch, and it often got lost in the realities of day-to-day campaigning. Not until Buttigieg won the Iowa caucuses did interviewers begin asking him more directly about America's readiness for a gay president and what his candidacy might mean to gay Americans.\n\nBut LGBTQ leaders had no doubt Buttigieg's candidacy had widened the path for gay Americans in politics and other areas of life in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nMayor Buttigieg ran an incredible campaign that broke glass ceilings and inspired countless LGBTQ people to run for office and enter public service, Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said in a statement. His history-making, open and honest campaign gave representation to a community that has been for far too long pushed out of the spotlight.\n\nAD\n\nAlso the youngest candidate in the Democratic race, Buttigieg formally launched his campaign last April from a formerly shuttered Studebaker plant in South Bend. His pitch was that his youth and lack of Washington political experience were assets, not drawbacks — and something about that resonated.\n\nI think he felt it was the right time because of the sense of jaundice President Trump had created, said former Obama adviser David Axelrod, who was in touch with Buttigieg at various times throughout his campaign.\n\nAD\n\nHe's a positive, unifying figure, and he's as kind and thoughtful and reflective as Trump is the opposite. His whole history is so different.\n\nAD\n\nIn early interviews and campaign speeches, Buttigieg was fond of saying he was the only left-handed, Maltese-American, Episcopalian, gay millennial war veteran in the race — a tongue-in-cheek way of condensing his biography but also of introducing himself to the public.\n\nOutside of winning two terms as mayor of South Bend, his highest-profile elections had been a failed 2017 bid for the chair of the Democratic National Committee and running for Indiana state treasurer in 2010, when he lost to the Republican incumbent by more than 20 points.\n\nNevertheless, with an aggressive, no-holds-barred media exposure strategy, Buttigieg managed to rise in the public consciousness over 2019 and soon began raising more money and polling higher than many of his opponents who were governors or sitting members of Congress. Buttigieg's obvious intelligence and eloquence excited many Democratic voters looking for a powerful counter-force to President Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe promised to usher in generational change to the White House and deliberately avoided releasing detailed plans at first, though he spoke of big ideas like abolishing the electoral college and restructuring the Supreme Court.\n\nAlong the way, his use of South Bend as the backbone of his experience was both a boon to his candidacy and also a threat to undo his campaign at times. After a white police officer shot a black South Bend resident in June, Buttigieg was widely criticized for his handling of the matter — as well as his general relationship with the South Bend Police Department and the city's minority residents. The shooting set off weeks of protests, briefly taking Buttigieg off the campaign trail.\n\nStill, his profile continued to rise, and by last fall, Buttigieg had shifted to a more moderate lane as he tried to seize a middle ground between Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whom he targeted repeatedly over universal healthcare, arguing that his approach — adding a public option that he dubbed Medicare for All Who Want It — was superior because it left choice to the American people.\n\nAD\n\nThe way we think this shapes up is, if you want the most ideological, far-out candidate possible, you've got your answer. You want the most Washington candidate possible, you've got your answer, Buttigieg said in November. Everybody else, I think, can come our way. I think that's almost everybody.\n\nThe strategy initially paid off. Buttigieg went on to narrowly win the Iowa caucuses in February and came in second in New Hampshire. His troubles appealing to minority voters, however, hampered him as the race moved on to more diverse states. He came in third in Nevada and fourth in South Carolina, winning over only two percent of the state's black voters.\n\nStill, his campaign vowed to press on through Super Tuesday, arguing that Buttigieg was the best-positioned moderate candidate to challenge Sanders. Buttigieg increasingly targeted the Vermont senator, warning that nominating Sanders would be detrimental for down-ballot races.\n\nButtigieg accumulated 26 delegates in the race — the most ever for an openly gay candidate, and far more than anyone expected at the beginning of his longshot bid. After strong showings in predominantly white states, Buttigieg's results began to dimish as the race moved to more diverse electorates. Ultimately, he decided they were unlikely to improve.\n\nWe have a responsibility to consider the effect of remaining in this race any further, Buttigieg told the crowd in South Bend, adding, and so we must recognize that at this point in the race, the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideas is to step aside and help bring our party and our country together.
Ned Garver of the St. Louis Browns, right, with Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians on Opening Day at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, April 19, 1949. (Associated Press/Associated PRESS)\n\nNed Garver, who was a standout player on one of baseball's worst — and most colorful — teams, the old St. Louis Browns, and was the last major league pitcher to win 20 games in a season for a team that lost 100 games, died Feb. 26 at a hospital in Bryan, Ohio. He was 91.\n\nHe had kidney disease and died of a heart attack, said a son, Don Garver.\n\nMr. Garver spent parts of five seasons with the hapless Browns, from 1948 to 1952. During that time, the team never finished higher than sixth place in the eight-team American League.\n\nA sturdy 5-foot-10 right-hander, Mr. Garver was recognized as the Browns' best player, a jewel in a pile of rocks, sports writer Rich Westcott wrote in his book Splendor on the Diamond, and a thoroughbred among nags.\n\nIn 1950, despite a record of 13-18, Mr. Garver finished second in the American League in earned run average, behind Hall of Famer Early Wynn of the Cleveland Indians. The Browns finished in seventh place, 40 games behind the pennant-winning New York Yankees.\n\nSt. Louis Browns pitcher Ned Garver presents a trophy on behalf of his teammates to owner Bill Veeck after Veeck fired Rogers Hornsby as manager of the club in 1952. (AP/ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe next year, they were even worse. The team often drew fewer than 2,000 fans per game.\n\nThe crowd didn't dare boo you, Mr. Garver once said. The players had them outnumbered.\n\nAt the midseason break for the All Star Game, the Browns had won only 22 of their 74 games; exactly half of those victories were credited to Mr. Garver. He was named the American League's starting pitcher at the All Star Game and allowed one unearned run in three innings.\n\nIn July 1951, the Browns were bought by Bill Veeck, a renegade owner and one of baseball's greatest showmen. He promptly signed 45-year-old former Negro Leagues pitcher Satchel Paige, who became one of Mr. Garver's closest friends on the team.\n\nVeeck also offered a one-game contract to 3-foot-7 Eddie Gaedel. On Aug. 19, 1951, Gaedel came to the plate for the Browns as a pinch hitter, wearing uniform­\n\nNo. 1/8. He walked on four pitches, then trotted to first base, bowing to the roaring crowd.\n\nThe American League president condemned Veeck for making a mockery of the game, but the Gaedel episode has entered baseball lore as perhaps the most remarkable crowd-pleasing stunt of all time.\n\nThe same month, Veeck placed a newspaper advertisement for a grandstand manager and received more than 4,000 responses.\n\nOn the night of Aug. 24, 1951, with Mr. Garver on the mound against the Philadelphia Athletics, two fans donned Browns uniforms as the team's nominal managers. Zack Taylor, the regular manager, sat in a rocking chair in street clothes, smoking a pipe.\n\nThe Browns printed signs for 1,115 fans, with a green Yes on one side and a red No on the other. When the grandstand managers pondered a point of strategy, a Browns official held up a sign with a question — Infield Back? or Shall We Steal?\n\nThe fans responded with what can be called democracy in action or perhaps one of the earliest examples of crowdsourcing.\n\nIn the first inning, after Mr. Garver allowed a three-run homer, the crowd was asked, Shall We Warm Up Pitcher?\n\nOverwhelmingly, the fans held up their No cards.\n\nIt was the strangest thing I have ever seen in baseball, Mr. Garver told ESPN the Magazine in 2014. When I saw all the 'Nos,' I appreciated that.\n\nWhen Mr. Garver went on to pitch a complete-game 5-3 victory for the Browns, more than 1,000 managers could claim some credit.\n\nBy mid-September, Mr. Garver had a record of 16-12 and needed to win four more games to reach 20, a benchmark of baseball excellence.\n\nThe odds of you winning four in a row with the Browns in 1951 were damned slim, he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2001.\n\nYet he won his next three starts before taking the mound against the Chicago White Sox on the final day of the season. With the score tied 4-4 in the bottom of the fifth inning, Mr. Garver — one of his team's best hitters as well as its finest pitcher — came up to bat.\n\nAnd, son of a biscuit, he said in 2001, I hadn't hit a home run all year, but I hit a home run over the Sealy Mattress sign in left field.\n\nThe Browns won, 9-5, to secure Mr. Garver's 20th victory, which he called the greatest feeling I ever had as a player. His 24 complete games led the American League.\n\nOn a team that finished with a record of 52-102, no other pitcher won more than six games. The only other pitcher in baseball history with 20 victories for a team that lost 100 games was Irv Young of the 1905 Boston ­Beaneaters.\n\nNed Franklin Garver was born Dec. 25, 1925, in Ney, Ohio. He grew up on a farm and played baseball on semipro teams in Ohio and Indiana.\n\nHe enlisted in the Navy during World War II but was discharged because of flat feet. After four years in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut with the Browns in 1948. As a rookie, he finished fourth in the league in earned run average.\n\nIn 1952, Hall of Fame hitter Rogers Hornsby was named the Browns' manager, but he proved to be a taciturn, uncommunicative team leader. Within weeks, he had alienated his team.\n\nHe was fired by owner Veeck, who visited the players in the locker room.\n\nA happier group you've never seen, Veeck wrote in Veeck as in Wreck, his 1962 autobiography. I made a little speech in which I apologized to them for hiring Hornsby in the first place. When I finished, Ned Garver whipped out a two-foot silver loving cup and presented it to me on behalf of the club.\n\nThe inscription read: To Bill Veeck. For the greatest play since the Emancipation Proclamation, June 10, 1952. From the St. Louis Browns.\n\nBut the team continued to flounder, and Mr. Garver was traded to Detroit later that season. He went 14-11 with a 2.81 ERA for the Tigers in 1954, then pitched for the Kansas City Athletics and Los Angeles Angels before retiring in 1961 after 14 seasons. His career record was 129-157, with a 3.73 ERA.\n\nMr. Garver's highest salary as a player, his son said, was $29,000. During the offseason, he worked in factories, drove school buses and refereed basketball games. He later scouted for the Cincinnati Reds and spent 18 years as personnel director of a meatpacking company. He also served eight years as mayor of Ney (pronounced Nay) before settling in the nearby town of Bryan.\n\nHis first wife, the former Dorothy Sims, died in 1995 after 51 years of marriage.\n\nSurvivors include his wife since 2001, the former Dolores Hart of Bryan; three children from his first marriage, Don Garver and Ned. A. Garver, both of Bryan, and Cheryl Garver of Defiance, Ohio; three stepchildren; four grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.\n\nAfter the 1953 season, Veeck sold the last-place Browns, and the franchise became the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nAlthough Mr. Garver played for other teams, he always considered himself a St. Louis Brown.\n\nIt was the best time of my life, he told the Associated Press in 2002. The Browns gave me my chance. If it hadn't been for baseball, I'd have been milking cows.
My plan was to have my best friend (the very one who introduced me to my man) show my boyfriend some of the pictures I secretly posted and then let him decide.\n\nAD\n\nIs this acceptable? I would say that I don't care what he gets me, but if I'm honest, that isn't quite true. I feel that since I am going to be wearing this ring forever, I should have the most say in what it looks like. Right?\n\nAD\n\nMy boyfriend has even said he knows I'm the type of girl who cares about what her ring will look like. I want to be surprised and completely grateful, but I also don't want to be unhappy.\n\nThen stop wishing to be surprised. And as the gentleman already knows that you have definite tastes, please do not stick him with the burden of possibly guessing wrong and giving you an unpleasant surprise.\n\nThe idea that a proposal must come with a snap-open box, proffered by a kneeling suitor, has always struck Miss Manners as ridiculous. It is a cartoon version of the past, when it was considered unseemly for a lady to entertain the notion of marrying until an abjectly pleading gentleman overcame her maidenly reluctance.\n\nAD\n\nYou may be sure that such was not really the case then, and it is even more ludicrous now, when you, and other sensible couples, have had serious discussions about marriage. Nor was it the way real people acquired engagement rings before the phony theatrics of staged proposals, complete with lurking photographers, became common.\n\nAD\n\nOf course a bride has an interest in the style of a ring she will be wearing from the engagement on, and it is a rare gentleman who has given any thought to the matter before he plans to buy one.\n\nBut becoming engaged requires only a mutual agreement to marry. Miss Manners is certainly not opposed to this being the occasion for both people to state the sentiments involved, in however romantic terms they can devise, but that is more dignified — and, she would think, more significant — when done in private. Surely pledging one's life should call forth emotions more powerful than any attached to jewelry, however understandable interest in that aspect may be.\n\nAD\n\nIf a gentleman had a family ring to offer, he can bring it out then, carefully specifying that it is a choice that in no way is attached to accepting or rejecting him.\n\nAD\n\nMore commonly, one would propose a shopping trip, for her to select a ring she loves. (And if he has any sense, he will have been at the shop alone first, and asked to put aside a variety of rings in his price range.)\n\nMiss Manners assures you that this expedition is much more romantic than the phony surprise.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Also, can you please explain what the pros and cons are associated with living trusts? How much does it cost to create one and revise it, if needed? I also don't have a will and am wondering which is more important to have — a living trust or a will? How will having either be affected if I get married?\n\nBoth a will and a living trust are estate-planning documents. A will is a document that allows you to designate who will inherit your real estate and personal property along with stocks, bank accounts and other items you own.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA will, however, will require that your estate go through probate. That means that upon your death, someone must go to the probate court and deliver a copy of your will to the court. An executor of the will then is approved by the court, and the executor can then handle the distribution and sale of assets and take care of any other estate affairs under the supervision of the probate court.\n\nObtaining a will isn't difficult, and an estate attorney or other attorney experienced in drafting wills can take care of it for you. The cost can be rather basic for a simple will, or quite expensive if your financial matters are complicated. When we say that the fee can be small, you might find attorneys willing to do simple wills for less than $1,000, but keep in mind that simple means very formulaic: You don't have much in terms of real estate (other than your condo), some items of personal property (jewelry, furnishings, a car, etc.) and some bank accounts.\n\nWhen you have many different real estate holdings, stock and bank accounts, minor-age children and distribution issues, you'll find that attorneys will have to charge you more because of the additional work in handling the questions and the drafting of the document. We can't tell you how much more, as it will vary by location and the type of attorney you hire to handle the transaction.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA trust is a document that allows you to transfer the ownership of your real estate, bank account and financial holdings to a different entity. That different entity is your trust. The trust would own these items, but you would be the beneficiary of the trust and thus control the trust and be the effective owner of those items.\n\nBut, upon your death, the trust would still be the owner of your real estate, bank account and other financial holdings that were in the trust's name. You wouldn't need to go to court to have the court supervise the administration of those items. The successor trustee — you would be the initial trustee of your own trust —would handle your affairs and could sell off your real estate and stocks and close your bank accounts. Your trust could designate what you want done with your real estate holdings, your bank accounts and other holdings.\n\nThe cost of setting up a trust can be a bit higher. That's partly because you have similar document-drafting issues as with a will, but you would also have the cost of having all of your assets retitled from your name to the name of the trust. When it comes to your home, you'd have to transfer title in your home to the trust. If it's your car, you'll have to retitle the car in the name of the trust. The same would go for bank accounts and accounts with financial institutions. If you don't re-title your assets, they are not part of the trust.\n\nHere's where it starts to get complicated. Since everything you own won't go into the trust, you will likely also need a will to make sure all of your assets and property are accounted for. So if you have a bank account that never got retitled or jewelry and other personal effects that are not owned by the trust, your will would dispose of those items as you intend.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile paying for a will and a trust means a double payment, having both will cause the least pain for family members taking care of your estate after your death.\n\nIn your question, you talk about your condominium. If that is the only thing you own, a will may be sufficient for you. But a trust might be equally as good. Or both could allow you to own that now and cover other items in the future. What we are getting at is that your question is really specific to your situation, the value of your property and what you are looking to do, how to do it and how much you might be willing to spend now.\n\nFinally, one advantage a trust may have, depending on the state you live in, is protecting your premarital assets from spousal claims after marriage. However, in some states, if you live with someone long enough, your long-term partner may have similar claims. Since you are living with someone, you might want to have some agreement spelled out to address possible future ownership claims. You might even want to draw up a partnership-type document if both of you are contributing toward the condominium expenses and costs. Please talk to a local attorney for more information.
California state prison officials announced that Mr. Spector, an inmate at a prison facility in Stockton, died at an outside hospital but did not provide further details. The statement said the cause will be determined by the medical examiner in the San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office. Media reports said Mr. Spector had contracted the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn his career's twilight, Mr. Spector was found guilty of fatally shooting actress Lana Clarkson in 2003 at his sprawling neo-Gothic chateau east of Los Angeles after a night of drinking. After a mistrial, he was retried and convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 19 years to life in prison.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt was a tragic coda to a life of vast creative accomplishment that had long been shadowed by Mr. Spector's reputation for unhinged and abusive behavior. He produced 18 records that each sold more than 1 million copies and, in an industry interested principally in turning out profitable records, he had broad latitude to indulge jarring habits, which included a tendency to brandish guns in recording studios.\n\nAfter a bleak childhood marked by his father's suicide, he had emerged as one of the most precocious musical talents and pop tastemakers of his generation. He was a professional singer-songwriter in his teens, had his own music label, Philles Records, at 21 and was a millionaire by 25. Writer Tom Wolfe immortalized him in the mid-1960s as The First Tycoon of Teen.\n\nHis artistic legacy rested on what was dubbed the wall of sound, a loud, lush, multilayered musical palette that he achieved by stuffing a cramped studio with pianos, guitars and drums.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe booming but controlled effect — elaborately and minutely planned for maximum dramatic effect — influenced an array of performers, most prominent among them Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys and members of the Beatles. The Beatles coaxed Mr. Spector out of retirement to produce their final album, Let It Be, in 1969, and later the megahit debut solo albums by John Lennon and George Harrison. Lennon once called him the greatest record producer ever.\n\nHe was defined in the public imagination as the mercurial genius behind such songs as the Crystals' Da Doo Ron Ron. He also helped shape the sound of performers as varied as Tina and Ike Turner, Leonard Cohen, Dion, Cher and the Ramones.\n\nMr. Spector was a creative director more than a producer, choosing musical material, orchestrating arrangements, conducting vocalists and session musicians, and sometimes exhausting them with his heavy-handed oversight of the recording process.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen you see a Kubrick movie, you tell me how many times you immediately remember the cast, he told Melody Maker in 1977. One? Two? It's the same with Fellini, and that's what I wanted to do when I directed a recording. Singers are instruments. They are tools to be worked with.\n\nHe discovered a group of New York City high school girls, the Crystals, whose debut single, There's No Other (Like My Baby), reached No. 20 on the charts in 1962. The single He's a Rebel, also credited to the Crystals, topped the charts the same year, establishing Mr. Spector as a star-making impresario.\n\nHe was also a calculating businessman who used singers as pawns to advance his career. He's a Rebel was actually sung by a promising young vocalist named Darlene Love and her group, the Blossoms, because he wanted to rush it out before a competing version hit the airwaves, and the Crystals were unavailable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLove told the New York Times in 1993 that Mr. Spector promised her triple the union wage but no royalties and that she agreed to those terms. The song was cute, she said, but I didn't think it would be much of a hit. She said that he also promised that the Blossoms' next record, He's Sure the Boy I Love, would be credited to them. But then he released it, too, as a Crystals recording, and it climbed to No. 18 on the charts.\n\nLove's career foundered for a time, but she eventually made her way back to the studio, without Mr. Spector, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nIn 1964, Mr. Spector's label released what many music writers consider his commercial and artistic masterpiece, You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin,'  co-written by Mr. Spector, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil and sung most indelibly by the Righteous Brothers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBob Stanley, a music journalist and author, described the release as a dam-busting thing of extraordinary size and power. The vocals are angry, accusing, pleading; by the end all the flash and noise is reduced to one solitary bassline, before a final crescendo — 'bring back that lovin' feelin' ' — and a fade into depthless introspection.\n\nThe song topped the charts for weeks in the United States and England, where Cilla Black also had a huge success with the ballad.\n\nTwo years later, Mr. Spector co-wrote and produced Ike & Tina Turner's River Deep — Mountain High, whose commercial failure in the United States sent him reeling. The recording, which did very well in England, was eventually acclaimed as a watershed of pop soul.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Spector was intrigued by the new sounds emanating from England and, on a visit to London in 1964, wound up in a recording studio with the Rolling Stones playing maracas on their self-titled debut album.\n\nAD\n\nIn short order, Motown and the so-called British Invasion spearheaded by the Beatles and Stones eclipsed his wall of sound. He exited the music business for several years, explaining to the New York Times in 1966: Art is a game. If you win that game too regularly, it tends to lessen your motivation. That's why I've lost interest in the record business. If I stayed at it I would just be playing for public approval, not for what suits me.\n\nBut he returned in 1969 to produce Let it Be, followed by Harrison's All Things Must Pass (1970) and Lennon's Imagine in 1971. The Concert for Bangladesh soundtrack, which Mr. Spector co-produced and featured Harrison and Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar, among others, won a Grammy for album of the year for 1972.\n\nEven as he amassed such accolades and successes, Mr. Spector became increasingly erratic. While producing Lennon's 1975 album Rock 'n' Roll, he fired a gun into the ceiling. He threatened Cohen at gunpoint during a recording session for Death of a Ladies' Man (1977). Leonard, I love you! he reportedly said, with Cohen uttering the rejoinder, I hope you do, Phil.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Spector's first wife, Annette Merar, described him as a womanizer prone to fits of rage. His second wife, Ronnie Bennett, the lead singer of the Ronettes, claimed that he kept her a virtual prisoner in their Alhambra, Calif., mansion. She escaped in 1972 by running barefoot from the hilltop estate. Several of his children, from whom he was estranged, said he abused them.\n\nWhen Mr. Spector was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, he clambered onto the stage with burly bodyguards, spoke incoherently about the inauguration of President George H.W. Bush and quickly exited. Mr. Spector, who was inducted eight years later into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, seemed to be spiraling into ever darker places.\n\nOn Feb. 3, 2003, he was arrested in the fatal shooting of Clarkson, a 40-year-old nightclub hostess and struggling actress who had starred in the low-budget movie Barbarian Queen (1985).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Spector had met Clarkson at her workplace, the House of Blues in Hollywood, the night before her death and invited her to his mansion. She was found slumped in a chair in the foyer of his home, with a gunshot wound to her mouth.\n\nMr. Spector had come out of his house and, according to police records obtained by the Los Angeles Times, told his driver: I think I killed somebody. He posted the $1 million bail and, while awaiting trial for second-degree murder, told Esquire that Clarkson was drunk and suicidally despondent over her career. She kissed the gun, he said. I have no idea why — never knew her, never even saw her before that night. . . . There's no case. She killed herself.\n\nAuthorities alleged that Mr. Spector ordered Clarkson to sit down, pressed the barrel of the gun against her head and shot her. The shooting led to the first major televised Los Angeles celebrity trial since the O.J. Simpson murder case in 1995.\n\nThe trial began in March 2007 and ended that September in a mistrial after the jury deadlocked twice, 7 to 5 and then 10 to 2. The prosecution witnesses had included five women who testified that Mr. Spector had threatened them with firearms.\n\nMr. Spector did not take the stand. Throughout the trial, he called attention to himself by appearing in various wigs, some of which appeared to defy gravity perched atop his wispy frame.\n\nThe retrial began the next year and ended in April 2009 with Mr. Spector's conviction.\n\nWeeks before Clarkson's death, Mr. Spector sat for an interview with British journalist Mick Brown for the biography Tearing Down the Wall of Sound, published in 2007. Asked about rumors of his alcohol abuse and paranoia, Mr. Spector said he had not been well for years.\n\nI was crippled inside, he said. Insane is a hard word. . . . I take medication for schizophrenia, but I wouldn't say I'm schizophrenic. But I have a bipolar personality, which is strange. I have devils inside that fight me. And I'm my own worst enemy.\n\nObsessed with music\n\nHarvey Philip Spector was born in the Bronx on Dec. 26, 1939, according to his biographer Brown, although prison officials say he was born in 1940. His father, an ironworker, died by suicide when Mr. Spector was 9. His mother moved Phil and his older sister to Southern California in 1953 and worked as a seamstress and later a bookkeeper.\n\nAt school, he struggled to fit in. He became obsessed with music, especially rhythm-and-blues. In high school, he began writing songs and organizing singing groups among his classmates, including a trio he called the Teddy Bears.\n\nJust after graduation in 1958, he, Marshall Leib and Annette Kleinbard recorded Mr. Spector's song To Know Him Is to Love Him. The title came from a tribute etched on his father's gravestone.\n\nThe song became a million-selling hit and sat on top of the charts for 23 weeks, leading to an appearance on Dick Clark's TV dance show American Bandstand before the group folded.\n\nMr. Spector served an apprenticeship in New York with two of his boyhood idols, songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who gave Elvis Presley a string of early hits. He also had a brief tenure as the top artists and repertory man for Atlantic Records, co-wrote Ben E. King's 1961 top-10 hit Spanish Harlem and played guitar on the Drifters' 1963 release On Broadway.\n\nMr. Spector's first marriage ended during his affair with Bennett, whom he wed in 1968. They adopted three children before divorcing in 1974. With his longtime girlfriend Janis Zavala, he had twins. Their son Phillip Jr. died in 1991, at 9, of leukemia, sending Mr. Spector into a depressive tailspin.\n\nHe married actress Rachelle Short in 2006 and filed for divorce a decade later, accusing her of squandering his fortune while he was in prison. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.\n\nAmid his murder trials, Mr. Spector continued to give interviews about his life in music. Inevitably, a theme that emerged concerned the forces — liberating and sometimes troubling — behind his creativity.\n\nYou just don't know what you're doing that is so important, but you know it's different and you know it's important, and maybe that's what the word genius is, maybe that's the genie in us, the gene in us, he told an interviewer in 2008. It's the step that makes you able to see above when everybody is seeing on the same level.
The chef made his name in greater Lyon, an area once known for its meres, or mothers, who were widely respected in the early 20th century for their homestyle bistros or bouchons.\n\nAD\n\nAbsorbing the lessons of the city's mothers and other chefs who crossed his path, Mr. Bocuse helped transform Lyon into one of the most decorated culinary destinations in Europe. In the process, he became the most influential French chef of his generation.\n\nAD\n\nFor his artistry and innovations in the kitchen, he received his profession's top honors, including a Michelin three-star rating, the restaurant guide's highest, which he held for more than half a century, one of the longest runs in Michelin history. Mr. Bocuse's success earned him the nickname the Lion of Lyon, although the Christian Science Monitor noted that the chef probably cultivated the title himself by placing a life-size statue of a lion outside his restaurant.\n\nLong after his heyday in the 1960s and 1970s, when he was the world's most visible proselytizer for nouvelle cuisine, he continued to command respect. The Culinary Institute of America and the French restaurant guide Gault et Millau named him chef of the century.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike the chefs before him, Mr. Bocuse was not content to remain in the kitchen, striving to maintain the three Michelin stars that he first earned in 1965. He set out to commercialize himself in a way that scandalized traditionalists decades before cooking shows, magazines and personalized cookware turned chefs into brands.\n\nAD\n\nHe co-founded restaurants at Epcot and Disneyland Paris and was affiliated with nearly 20 others from Europe to Asia. In 1969, he helped plan the menu for the inaugural Concorde flight, perhaps the first meal ever officially dubbed nouvelle cuisine. He wrote best-selling cookbooks and appeared internationally on TV cooking shows. Wine, jam, a salmon knife and other products bore his name.\n\nMr. Bocuse helped transform a profession that for centuries had been little more than a gritty, hidebound trade in which kitchen secrets were guarded as state secrets. Mr. Bocuse famously hobnobbed with his peers, freely sharing his recipes and endearing himself to many younger chefs who would loosely form La Bande à Bocuse.\n\nAD\n\nHis outsize personality was not to everyone's taste. A relentless self-promoter, he referred to himself in the third person and was not above decorating his restaurant with portraits of himself or stationing a life-size image of himself outside the entrance.\n\nAD\n\nOften considered a phallocrat, which the French translate as male chauvinist pig, Mr. Bocuse routinely diminished a woman's role in the kitchen, despite having studied under Eugénie Brazier, the first female chef to earn three Michelin stars. He told People magazine in 1976 that women are good cooks, but they are not good chefs. Women who systematically want to do what men do just end by losing their femininity, and what I adore most of all is a feminine woman.\n\nAn unabashed hedonist, he spoke openly about two long-term mistresses and short affairs during his marriage.\n\nAD\n\nFood and sex have much in common, he told the London Daily Telegraph in 2005. We consummate a union, we devour each other's eyes, we hunger for one other. Adding that food and sexual intercourse were the essentials in life, he explained, I realize my vision is a little macho, but I am a man of my time and believe that whatever they say, women love men to be macho.\n\nAD\n\nJulia Child, the renowned American interpreter of French cuisine, once told People magazine that Mr. Bocuse was indeed very macho, fun to be with and very amusing. She said in the kitchen, he has been tremendously important.­­ . . . Most of the great chefs are grateful to him for all the publicity he gets, because they feel it has helped all of them.\n\nThe late New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne became one of his most ardent defenders. He is one of the finest ambassadors both of France and his profession, Claiborne wrote in 1974, describing Mr. Bocuse as an irrepressible clown who will dance on tables and at the climax of an evening toss champagne glasses into the air. He is also a gentleman, a highly complex human being who plays a calliope to amuse the world.\n\nAD\n\nPaul François Pierre Bocuse was born Feb. 11, 1926, in Collonges-au-Mont-d'Or to a family of innkeepers and cooks dating to 1765. His grandfather's financial carelessness had forced the family to sell its historic inn five years before Mr. Bocuse was born. For much of his youth, the Bocuses ran a smaller bistro and hotel half a mile from the inn.\n\nAD\n\nDuring World War II, he worked in the canteen and slaughterhouse of a Vichy-run youth camp. When he turned 18, he was conscripted into the Free French Forces and reportedly took gunfire to the chest. Nursed back to health at a U.S. Army hospital, where he received a blood transfusion, Mr. Bocuse showed his appreciation by flying an American flag outside his restaurant for decades.\n\nAfter the war, he apprenticed near Lyon with Brazier and with his most enduring mentor, chef and restaurateur Fernand Point. Point helped liberate many promising young chefs from the traditions of Auguste Escoffier, a chef and author whose seminal work, Le Guide Culinaire, defined haute French cuisine in the early 20th century and for decades after his death in 1935.\n\nAD\n\nEscoffier espoused rich sauces and ornate garnishes — the sort of touches that could overwhelm the freshest ingredients from the garden. Mr. Bocuse said Point taught him to guard the integrity of the raw product.\n\nAD\n\nFrench cuisine had gone through many phases over the centuries, and the general characteristics of nouvelle cuisine — farm-fresh ingredients, shorter cooking times and delicate sauces — had already crept into the cuisine by the time Mr. Bocuse gained renown in the 1960s. But Mr. Bocuse, with his talents as a chef and tireless promoter, became its most public and quotable crusader.\n\nHis mission, he said, was to render unto a chicken that which is its due, and nothing more. Another time, he likened his cooking to a slender young girl in a see-through blouse compared with the heavily corseted 1900 beauties of grand French cuisine.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Bocuse shunned the extremes of nouvelle cooking, such as the comically small portions, scarcely cooked vegetables and weirdly exotic food combinations. His dishes retained the sumptuous side of French cooking: shrimp soup with cream, butter and shallots; wild duck (that he had shot himself) in green pepper sauce; and tender pink saddle of lamb with eggplant galette.\n\nAD\n\nAfter his training with Point, Mr. Bocuse returned to his family's restaurant in 1956 and within a few years transformed the modest bistro into one of the world's most venerated restaurants, L'Auberge du Pont de Collonges, often just called Paul Bocuse.\n\nIn 1961, he earned his first Michelin star. A second star followed in 1962, then a third in 1965, indicating that the restaurant, in the guide's parlance, offers exceptional cuisine and is worth a special journey.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1975, French President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing bestowed on Mr. Bocuse the Legion of Honor. It was the first time the award had been given to a chef.\n\nThe ceremony was memorable for two reasons: Mr. Bocuse wore not a formal suit, but his chef's jacket and sky-high toque, and he used the occasion to introduce his black truffle soup under pastry shell, which would become a signature dish at his Lyonnaiserestaurant.\n\nAD\n\nWith two colleagues, Mr. Bocuse opened his first American restaurant, Les Chefs de France, at Epcot in 1982. Mr. Bocuse's son, Jérôme, now owns and runs the brasserie as well as a related upscale restaurant, Monsieur Paul, named for his father. Paul Bocuse teamed with Disney again in 2014 to open a bistro at the Paris theme park, Bistrot Chez Rémy, inspired by the animated feature film Ratatouille, about a rat who is a master chef.\n\nIn 2013, the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., renovated its formal Escoffier Restaurant and reopened it as the Bocuse Restaurant.\n\nIn 1987, Mr. Bocuse created the Bocuse d'Or, a cooking contest held every two years and featuring competing teams from 24 countries. In 1990, he opened a culinary arts school in Ecully, France.\n\nAnthony Bourdain, a chef, author and TV personality, wrote in an email: There aren't a lot of people who can be truly referred to as 'great' — as in Muhammad Ali great, Orson Welles great, Thomas Jefferson great. Paul Bocuse was great.\n\nMr. Bocuse was married for more than 70 years to Raymonde Duvert, and identified Raymone Carlut and Patricia Zizza as his mistresses of many decades. Besides his wife, survivors include a daughter from his marriage, Françoise Bernachon of Lyon; and a son from Carlut, Jérôme Bocuse of Orlando.\n\nA lot is being made about my private life, and why not? Mr. Bocuse told the Telegraph. I adore women and we live too long these days to spend a whole life with only one. I work as if I will live to be 100, and I enjoy life as if the next day will be my last.
I talked to my friend at each event and told him I thought he was moving too fast. I wanted him to realize that he was rushing into these momentous occasions and, although I support him, he should really think about it. For some of these choices, like having a kid, there is no turning back.\n\nMy friend seems happy, but they're now a couple. Whenever I text him, he and she reply to me in a group text. Whenever I want to coordinate a night to watch TV with him, she wants to pick a night where they can come over with the baby. She likes me, but I just want to hang out with my friend. She makes this impossible, and he's okay with it because he loves her and wants to include her in everything.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI know that some friendships just hit a dead end and I feel like this is the case. I've dealt with breakups when it comes to relationships, but how do I break up with a friend? Do I make one final plea that I want alone time with my friend and cause problems between all of us?\n\nCasper\n\nCasper: I'll be blunt. You have not been a supportive friend. Stopping your friend at each major life-turn to tell him he is making a series of mistakes is not supportive, or appropriate. Telling a man with a new baby that it is too late for him to turn back is selfish and rude. The fact that his wife likes you and he still wants to spend any time with you at all is a tribute to the two of them.\n\nAD\n\nThese two (and their child) are now a package deal. They are making this much abundantly clear. Many couples manage to come together and still hold robust individual friendships, but — in your case — your friend does not seem to want to do this.\n\nAD\n\nYes, you could make an individual plea to your friend: I'd like to hang out with you alone one of these days. Would that be possible? After that, you will have to accept his answer.\n\nI suspect that you are not going to have to worry about breaking up with this guy, because he seems to be breaking up with you.\n\nDear Amy: I am seeking your advice and input on my situation.\n\nThree months ago, I separated from my partner of 17 years. We were planning to marry in a few months.\n\nAD\n\nWe had a huge argument and we both said things to hurt one another.\n\nThe one thing he said that is unforgivable was that he used me during our time together. I left my home immediately and moved to another state to live with my only child and grandson.\n\nI no longer take meds for anxiety or smoke as much as I did when we were together. While in this relationship, I was emotionally, physically and verbally abused.\n\nAD\n\nPlease help me make sense of my life! I am 62, physically disabled and financially stable.\n\nWhat do I do now?\n\nAlone\n\nAlone: Leaving a long-standing relationship is very challenging — even when the relationship is toxic, because sometimes the devil you know can seem preferable to the uncertainty of being on your own. It's the way we humans are wired.\n\nAD\n\nThe stress of being in this unhealthy relationship has taken a toll on you. As hard as it was to leave, your behavior has already changed and your health will improve. What you should do now is to give yourself time to heal. Enjoy your family. Volunteer, if you are able. And engage in the slow but satisfying work of remaking your life.\n\nDear Amy: Parents in Despair had an out-of-control teen on their hands.\n\nMy husband and I struggled with this exact problem.

My gut tells me this is just an effort to preserve the comfortable life we have together, but I am tempted to accept it, because eight years feels like so many sunk costs. I have friends who complain daily about the dearth of available dating options. What to do next?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n— Sunk Costs\n\nSunk Costs: Can we time-travel backward to that conversation so you can respond this time on the spot, That's bull[something]?\n\nBecause it needed saying. Still does, but maybe in a different way now that some time has passed.\n\nThis is your life and his together. His even thinking it's up to him to control the calendar is bull. We can talk about it this year? Oh, we can, can we? Or you can stuff it somewhere really uncomfortable, how about that.\n\nAnd it's bull in the utter bloodlessness of it all. Are you emotional partners, the closest people in each other's worlds, the sole occupants in the innermost circle of intimacy? Or are you contestants in a suspenseful contest, strategizing to see whether you'll win a marriage certificate and a baby and still keep most of your personal goals intact.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI urge you to get some air here, to create an opportunity to be somewhere else, out of the shared home, to be yourself on your own terms for the first time in eight years. See for yourself who and what you have become during these crucial developmental years. Taste the foods you stopped eating because you're with him, watch the stuff you stopped watching because you're with him, wear the things you stopped wearing. I say this not as an indictment of him, but as a nod to the reality of shared living. Let yourself see clearly what you lose when he's not around, and what you lose when he is around.\n\nThat's when you'll start to see whether you even want to marry him.\n\nTime invested, by the way, as an argument for putting up with unhappiness? I just can't.\n\nAD\n\nReaders can't, either:\n\n●I waited for marriage for two years and three proposals. He said getting engaged was a goal, and accepted my proposal only after I moved out. I did NOT go back to him. I started dating someone new on New Year's. I'm excited and hopeful like I haven't been in years. Don't cling to less than you want.\n\n●Sunk costs mean you should NOT consider what you've already paid. Example: You buy an expensive food. If you hate it, then you shouldn't eat it, whether you paid $100 or $1.
As the battles continue in the courts and in legislatures, some religious-freedom advocates who would like to see a compromise have expressed fears that the country is at an impasse and that the law will ultimately favor one set of rights or the other.\n\nThe Supreme Court could clarify controversial questions when it decides later this year whether a bakery owner has the constitutional right to decline to make a cake for a same-sex wedding.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, some advocates are pointing to a case in North Carolina that they say could provide a national blueprint for compromise on the issue.\n\nIn 2014, after same-sex marriage was legalized in North Carolina, Gayle Myrick resigned from her job as a magistrate in the state because she believed that performing civil marriages for same-sex couples went against her faith.\n\nUnlike Davis, Myrick did not object to marrying any specific couple, and she did not ask other employees in the office to refuse to do so. (Davis has recently said she no longer objects to issuing licenses for same-sex couples since Kentucky changed the rules so clerks do not have to attach their names to licenses.)\n\nAD\n\nWhen Myrick, who attends a Southern Baptist church, raised her discomfort with performing a same-sex ceremony, her supervisor suggested she could remove her from the duties of performing marriages altogether. However, a higher-level supervisor said her schedule could not be adjusted to excuse her from marriage duties.\n\nAD\n\nI didn't want to stop anyone from getting married, said Myrick, who is 68 and lives in Monroe, N.C. I also knew my religious convictions would not allow me to perform those marriages personally.\n\nA federal judge ruled last year that she should have been allowed to opt out of performing marriages because of her religious beliefs. As a result, Myrick reached a settlement in January with the government to compensate her for her pay, retirement pay and attorneys' fees. She has been represented by the Becket Fund, which has taken up high-profile cases such as Hobby Lobby's Supreme Court case on insurance coverage for contraception. The opinion in her case doesn't serve as binding precedent on other district judges, but a lower court decision like this could be cited in future cases.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2015, North Carolina passed a law that allows magistrates (who work as lay judges) to opt out of performing all marriages based on a sincerely held religious objection. The law requires counties to make other magistrates available to handle marriage licenses and same-sex weddings if they have recusals.\n\nAD\n\nSome religious-freedom observers and activists see the state law and Myrick's case as a victory in the tension between LGBT rights and government workers' religious rights. A same-sex couple seeking to wed wouldn't know that a government official intends to discriminate against them, as the official would be opting out of all marriages, activists argue.\n\nNobody's entitled to the right to insult someone or deny someone to their face, said Ira Lupu, a law professor emeritus at George Washington University who specializes in the First Amendment. People have a right to be accommodated in the workplace so long as there's [no] harm to the people being served.\n\nAD\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states that employers must reasonably accommodate the religious practices of employees if that can be done without undue hardship. The problem with Davis's case was that she didn't seek just to exempt herself, said Douglas Laycock, a professor at the University of Virginia Law School. Instead, she sought to exempt the whole county. Laycock said he believes that exemptions in government offices should be narrower than those in businesses because the government must treat all citizens equally — but that Myrick's case seemed like a win-win compared with Davis's case.\n\nAD\n\n[Davis] wouldn't let anyone issue licenses, Laycock said. But the county is not an employee, the county has no religion, and exempting the county would deprive all same-sex couples of essential government services. Substituting a different [official] for Myrick doesn't deprive anyone of anything.\n\nBut others are fearful that such laws could give government workers license to discriminate.\n\nAD\n\nThe law already draws the line for ministers and religious institutions. But this is a government officials, said Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union. The question is where the law draws the line.\n\nClaims for exemptions based on religious beliefs aren't new, Melling said, and they were raised after civil rights laws were enacted to prevent racial discrimination. Bob Jones University, which previously banned interracial dating, lost a Supreme Court case when the court ruled that the First Amendment did not prevent the IRS from revoking the tax-exempt status of a religious university whose practices are contrary to compelling government interest.\n\nAD\n\nIf you say a magistrate wants exemption … the government is then licensing discrimination, Melling said.\n\nAD\n\nSeveral states have wrestled with similar cases. The Utah compromise in 2015 was hailed by some as an accommodation between Mormon leaders and LGBT activists, a signal that leaders on both sides could be open to giving a bit. The law banned employers and landlords from discriminating against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and it also protected employees from being fired for talking about religious or moral beliefs.\n\nThe North Carolina law has some similarities to the Utah law, but Utah's law didn't specifically allow government officials to opt out of performing marriages. Utah made it so that the state would perform marriages using willing clerks or others in the community authorized to marry people. And if a same-sex couple comes into the office for a license and no willing clerks are available, then the elected town clerk does the service.\n\nAD\n\nNo state anti-discrimination laws have been passed since the Utah legislation, according to Robin Fretwell Wilson, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law who worked on the Utah legislation.\n\nAD\n\nCould laws similar to those in these two states be enacted across the country? Some observers, including Laycock, believe that compromises may be difficult to find in the future and that the country could be at a stalemate.\n\nThe challenge here is to protect the rights of both sides as much as possible, and more often than not, that is entirely possible if we had just a smidgen of goodwill on both sides, Laycock said.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on the bakery case, which is expected late spring, could cause a kind of stalemate between the sides, said Charles Haynes of the Newseum's Religious Freedom Center.\n\nIn this fight, we have reached a point where both sides see this as a zero-sum game, he said.
Absolutely, I'd answer, but that's not us. We are partners. We have our own salaries. And we are both women. She'd laugh.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEventually, we arrived at an answer. We would try for a baby after a year or so of marriage, with just a few preconditions: We would keep two salaries so we could afford a two-bedroom place. Both of us would need paid leave through our jobs; we'd have to be able to afford (good!) child care, maybe even a nanny-share; and we'd need to have friends and family nearby so we wouldn't feel alone if something went wrong.\n\nThe bar was high, but we wanted to make responsible decisions about our future family.\n\nThe standard parents are held to in this country — that they should buck up and get by without the help of paid leave, subsidized child care, and continuous public health insurance, or they shouldn't have had kids — is something we've both fought against throughout our careers. We knew we could never be fully insulated from crisis, and that's an unrealistic bar to meet to responsibly have children. For our own sake, we wanted to be prepared financially and in jobs that would support us, especially through those early years.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAssuming we felt stable enough to not resent the whole thing, we agreed, we'd some day try for a baby.\n\nBy March, we'd finished all the major plans for our August 2020 wedding in a national forest outside Salt Lake City, near where I'd grown up and most of my family lives. Then covid-19 changed our lives overnight. After two weeks of working from home in our studio, we'd had enough.\n\nWe were soon on a plane with our two cats, on our way to my dad's house in Utah, for as long as the shutdown lasted. It looked like that might be May or June, so we packed a pair of shorts and a couple of tank tops in case we were still there when the weather warmed up, just in case.\n\nAD\n\nTime moved on, things got worse, and we canceled our wedding, not wanting to expose anyone to risk. And by May, we knew we couldn't move back to that tiny studio.\n\nAD\n\nSo in June, instead of spending our money on a big wedding, we bought a three-bedroom house just outside St. George, with a view of the red cliffs of Snow Canyon from our front window. With the permission of our employers — one based in D.C. and the other in New Jersey — we are working remotely for the foreseeable future. We are immensely privileged and relatively stable — with our work, our incomes and our family support.\n\nAnd yet the parenting question has opened up again. Can we really still do what we'd planned? Will we be ready to have a baby in a year? With an erratic economy and the barely existent child-care system crumbling? As a same-sex couple who just moved to the worst state when it comes to child-care deserts? And what if things get even worse? Are we sure this is what we want? (And how does one even safely obtain sperm during a pandemic?!)\n\nAD\n\nNon-parents like us are paying attention to what it's like to be a parent right now, and we don't like what we see. Families who were already on their contingency child-care plans before the pandemic, stringing together affordable care with some combination of professionals, friends and family, are now on plans B, C and D, or they're stepping back from work as a result.\n\nAD\n\nMy brother and sister-in-law divide the work day into two four-hour shifts, taking turns working with their 18-month-old baby, taking calls with him on their hips, feeding him lunch during Zoom calls, stepping away from their laptops to handle tantrums. I coo to my nephew over FaceTime, and when we hang up, I sigh with gratitude that that's not my life right now.\n\nI think I'm justified in my concern. A 2019 The New York Times/YouGov survey found that 28 percent of parents said that day care and preschool expenses were a very significant financial strain and 20 percent said they went into debt to manage those expenses. A ranking of 35 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries from least to most family-friendly put the United States in 34th place, ahead only of Mexico.\n\nAD\n\nWhen it comes to the question of whether to have a baby, affordable, high-quality child care is just the tip of the iceberg. After I proposed to the love of my life back in October, we stayed at Duke's to celebrate our engagement. Then little by little our friends and family, chosen and biological, joined us to congratulate us and wish us well. We drank champagne and ate barbecue sandwiches and grinned from ear to ear as we reminisced with our friends about how we'd met, started dating and fell in love.\n\nAD\n\nThat night represented everything we were trying to build together: a community, a family, with the best of those we were born to and those we chose. They were the ones we'd rely on as we embarked on the parenting journey some day, those who had raised us, and those who would soon be having babies we'd want to help raise, too.\n\nNow, they're across the country in a city we left, some with babies we thought we'd know beyond occasional video calls, some with babies due any day now. Even if we were there, we remind ourselves, we couldn't see them that often. We'd have to distance. We couldn't hold their new babies or let them hold ours, not yet, and not for the foreseeable future.\n\nAD\n\nWe were each other's child-care plan. All those conversations we had about whether and when to become parents revolved around a future that is no longer ours.\n\nAD\n\nNow, thanks to this pandemic, we aren't sure where we stand.\n\nHaley Swenson is a writer and researcher and the deputy director of the Better Life Lab, a work, gender, and social policy program at the nonpartisan think tank New America.\n\nJoin our discussion group here to talk about parenting and working, or sign up here for our newsletter.
El Monte police, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office and the FBI responded to the explosion and determined there was not a second device.\n\nLaw enforcement is investigating who might be behind the blast, although there is no indication that activists protesting the church were responsible for the attack, El Monte Police Chief David Reynoso told The Washington Post. Obscene messages in spray paint on the building found by responding officers were not related to the anti-LGBTQ teachings, Reynoso said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe don't have any information leading us to believe that the demonstrators in the past are in any way responsible for this, Reynoso said.\n\nThe detonation was powerful enough to break a window in a neighboring structure, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller told The Post.\n\nFederal agents are looking into a police report filed two weeks ago by the church's pastor, Bruce Mejia, about an arson threat sent on social media, Eimiller said.\n\nThe church did not answer calls Saturday.\n\nResearchers at the Southern Poverty Law Center have classified the church as one of 70 hate groups in the country that promote anti-LGBTQ sentiments.\n\nIt is part of the New Independent Fundamental Baptist Movement, fewer than two dozen churches in the United States that are associated with anti-LGBTQ pastor Steven Anderson. Anderson has been banned from 34 countries for his rhetoric that calls for the deaths of LGBTQ people, according to the civil rights group.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe church's teachings condemning same-sex marriage have attracted criticism and protests. An online petition by Keep El Monte Friendly, a group that organized the protests against First Works Baptist Church, to expel the church from El Monte has received more than 15,000 signatures.\n\nNegotiations were ongoing between local authorities, the church and protesters to mitigate tensions, Eimiller said.\n\nThose talks included the city and county, Alma Martinez, El Monte city manager, told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nEven though we don't know at this time who is involved in the crime, as a city we want to make sure that we continue to work on de-escalating the situation to promote peace, safety and respect in our community, Martinez told the newspaper. Crimes of this nature are not acceptable.\n\nAD\n\nKeep El Monte Friendly said in a statement that it did not condone the act of violence.\n\nAD\n\nOur movement was intended to bring light and awareness to the hateful rhetoric taught by this group, the activist organization said of the church. We understand that what they preach can make people upset. However, we would never promote, encourage or condone any violence or acts of harm.
The best moment: Arie's face when Bekah reveals her age\n\nThe Bachelor has been teasing this reveal for weeks now . . . the moment when doe-eyed, rock-climbing Bekah tells 36-year-old Arie that she is 22, a.k.a. nearly half his age. When they sit down for dinner on their one-on-one, they'd just had a romantic day, riding horses through the trails of Tahoe. Arie talks about how his life has slowed down since his roaring 20s; now he likes to get up with the sun, he says, sounding like a man who just joined AARP.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut he's got some burning questions for Bekah, namely: Do our lives match up? Are we in the same place? As Arie broaches the topic of whether Bekah is ready for marriage and kids, she stops him and says: Wait, do you know how old I am.\n\nWhen the answer is revealed, Arie's face says it all: Shock, doubt . . . and rationalization.\n\nI know it's possible to love deeply at that age, Arie says. My biggest fear is that I go through all this and emotionally invest in you and at the end, I'm heartbroken, adding that he's looking for a wife, not a 22-year-old girlfriend. And to be fair, he could be heartbroken at the end for any number of reasons.\n\nStill, he's willing to take a chance on baby Bekah. You are incredible and surprising and so much of what I'm looking for, Arie tells Bekah as he gives her a rose. I feel like this could be the beginning of something amazing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe two of them do seem to have more chemistry than any other match. Bekah's sense of adventure brings out the same in Arie, who's shown himself to be incredibly boring and stiff with nearly everyone else.\n\nWorst moment: Krystal's complete lack of self-awareness\n\nThe writing has been on the wall since last week, when Krystal uttered the following words: I get hated on by girls. They just get jealous … girls are really insecure around me. So this week it isn't too surprising when Krystal, the 29-year-old fitness coach who's mocked for her baby-talk voice that frequently dips into a difficult-to-decipher whisper, informs the cameras that the other girls on the group hiking date are acting desperate.\n\nAD\n\nI'm just seeing a lot of other girls here aggressively, like, seeking his attention, she sighs. Just to see so many big, bold personalities just so aggressive, fighting for his attention, it was just . . . honestly, it was — ugh. It was exhausting to watch. And I just hope that Arie sees through all the bull—-.\n\nMuch of the episode features Krystal's on-camera interviews trashing the other women who have the nerve to want to spend time with Arie. Krystal appears to think this is a ridiculous concept; she has such a strong connection with him already, he may as well hand her the Neil Lane diamond right now.\n\nAD\n\nThinking she has this competition in the bag, Krystal becomes extremely condescending toward the other contestants, who clearly dislike her. After Caroline and Tia make fun of her in the hot tub, Krystal pulls them aside to say that her feelings are hurt.\n\nAD\n\nBy us? Really, dude? Tia asks incredulously. The three bicker for a while, then making the mistake of telling Arie their respective sides of the story. This is a risky move, because there's nothing that interests the bachelor less than drama in the house.\n\nKrystal continues to criticize the other women for being insecure, while her own insecurity drives her to pull Arie aside during the rose ceremony to anxiously test out how he's feeling and ensure him that she's here for the right reasons. This move did not endear her to her exasperated housemates, who make it clear that they want her to go home already.\n\nAD\n\nBut Arie, still dazzled by Krystal, gives her a rose, along with Tia. Caroline is sent packing, in tears. And a preview of next week's episode showed that one contestant will say Krystal is becoming a bit unhinged, so we have that to look forward to.\n\nAD\n\nThe weirdest moment: Eating worms on the trail\n\nIf you've been hiking for days and haven't had anything to eat, then I can see rummaging through the dirt for a wriggly snack or two. But the wilderness guide encourages the women to eat worms — and drink their own urine — before they've even stepped onto the trail and broken a sweat. Tia and Kendall are very enthusiastic about the live snacking opportunity, which may have been a pure play for attention. But it also says a lot about their competitive instincts.
The grand jury that investigated six of Pennsylvania's eight dioceses published a massive report last August that rattled Catholics across the country. In the report, the jurors detailed allegations of abuse by 301 priests over a span of more than 70 years. Many of those priests are deceased, and the statute of limitations on child sexual abuse crimes had already run out on almost all the others. The jury only brought charges against two of the priests: Poulson and John Sweeney of the Greensburg diocese.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth pleaded guilty. Sweeney was sentenced last month to 11.5 months to five years in prison for abusing a 10-year-old boy in the early 1990s, the maximum sentence under state law, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Poulson's sentence, handed down in Jefferson County on Friday, was also a wide range: 2½ years to 14 years.\n\nJoe Grace, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office, said the 14-year upper boundary is the maximum sentence allowable under state law.\n\nOne of Poulson's victims said in a statement read in court on Friday, David Poulson affected my life in more ways than I can count. It has cost me my career and my marriage, and my daughter. Because of this man's actions, I have suffered for years from mental anguish. Another man also participated in a news conference after the sentencing with Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who has led the grand jury investigation and the subsequent push to remove the statute of limitations so that more of the priests in the report can be charged. That man said that he too was abused by Poulson, but the alleged abuse was too long ago for Poulson to face charges for it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe state legislature debated proposals last year that would have extended the statute of limitations or lifted the statute of limitations entirely on child sex crimes as numerous states have done. The proposals did not pass.
— Relocation\n\nRelocation: Just moved is a state of being that makes just about any place seem miserable. Plus, homesickness is normal after leaving a place you loved. Plus, pregnancy could be heightening your emotions and attachments. So, make the best of this by recognizing, to start, that your feelings are 1.) normal and 2.) going to change sooner rather than later.\n\nAD\n\nNote that I didn't say they'd change for the better, necessarily; a year from now you might still believe moving was a mistake. But you'll have had a year to adjust and you'll have your routines, and basics like going to the grocery store won't feel alien anymore.\n\nAD\n\nOf course, your pregnancy means you'll have other changes to adapt to, but that's a variable we can't account for yet besides never sleeping or leaving the house — I kid! — so I'll leave it out. It could make you glad you moved or regret your move even more.\n\nAnyway, the key to starting over as an adult is, in my experience, patience + effort + an open mind. Strong new roots can take years, and those years can be difficult.\n\nAD\n\nShould you decide for some reason that the new location will never be what you'd hoped and that you want to return to the old one, owning a home makes that decision complicated but not impossible. People uproot at inconvenient times — it's just a fact of life; that's why houses get rented and, even, losses get absorbed.\n\nThinking this way tends to undermine the patience-and-open-mind plan, though, so I suggest you consider it, rule it out for now and really invest in your new place. You moved for a reason, and it may still hold up — after this initial panic clears.\n\nAD\n\nRe: Stressful: They say the stressful life changes are marriage, death, divorce, babies, moving, buying a house and starting a new job. You have a few of those. And hormones. You are possibly isolated and alone because you are in a new place. Do you know anyone nearby to connect with? Can you find a new moms' group? When I had my first kid, I felt isolated, and I had lived in that city for quite some time. I had no friends with kids. I presume you have limited time and energy to socialize between work and being pregnant, but try, at least, to make the best of it, and make an informed decision after having more data.\n\nAD\n\n— Been There\n\nRe: Moving: Five years after I bought at the top of the market, I got a job on the opposite coast and the market tanked, so my home was unsellable without a massive loss. I found a manager, rented it out, and it has been great to have the income and the tax deduction. There is nothing that can't be survived.\n\n— Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Surmounted, let's say, and thanks.

Carolyn Hax is away. These letters are from April 11, 2003.\n\nDear Carolyn: I just got married to my girlfriend of 11 years (high school sweetheart). Over the past two or so years her sex drive has all but disappeared. Two weeks ago, I met a girl at a bar and slept with her that same night. I had no feelings for the girl, it was purely physical. It was a mistake in judgment and I feel awful and will never do it again (although it did feel great at the time). Should I consider telling my wife about it, or is it likely that telling will cause more problems than remaining silent?\n\nMistake\n\nMistake: The good news is, there are worse things than having an adulterous fling with a chick you picked up in a bar. The bad news is, you're guilty of one of those, too. When you married your girlfriend despite having a massive, unresolved, possibly irreparable, long-standing and therefore totally foreseeable problem in your relationship, you made a much bigger mistake. That makes this much more than a to-tell-or-not-to-tell question.\n\nAs for the possibility a confession will cause bigger problems, um, you're already unhappy enough to be prowling and you're harboring two major lies (I'm counting the marriage as one). She, meanwhile, has lost her libido, be it to boredom, stress, sickness or sickness of you. Preserving the status quo doesn't strike me as a worthy goal to pursue. Besides, inertia is what got you into this marital mess. And even though the task of getting out of it got harder when you married and herculean when you cheated, the essence of it hasn't changed: Love your wife, take her hand and look the beast in the eye together — and this time, please, don't flinch.\n\nDear Carolyn: My boyfriend is having a friendly relationship with his ex-girlfriend that he won't admit to me. I had evidence, confronted him about it, he indicated he was in touch (but did not admit being in touch as much as they actually are based on my 100 percent evidence, some of which I couldn't tell him, so he doesn't know I had it). I know he doesn't want romantic interest. He read me the riot act a year ago about no relationships with exes. What is a girl to do?\n\nAnywhere, U.S.A.\n\nAnywhere, U.S.A.: Develop higher standards. You distrust him to the point of inexcusable spying. He distrusts you to the point of withholding the truth on his ex. You don't respect yourself enough to call him on his double standards. He doesn't respect you enough to equate your behavior with his.\n\nWhat's wrong with this picture? That you don't immediately see how wrong a picture this is.\n\nTrust and respect just aren't that complicated: Find someone who treats you as well as he treats himself, and then show the same kindness to him. Ta-da. Both of you will make mistakes, but that's okay, as long as they're infrequent, unintended and remedied quickly, with care.
As a senior member of the royal family and as a high-profile campaigner before her marriage to Prince Harry, what kind of work Meghan would prioritize as a royal was a matter of intense interest in royal circles.\n\nTwo of the patronages handed to Meghan, including the National Theater, London's flagship theater, were long held by the queen herself.\n\nAD\n\nThe National Theater gig, mistakenly announced a day early, seems like a natural fit for Meghan given her previous acting career, which including a starring role in the U.S. legal drama Suits.\n\nAD\n\nShe understands about theater, being an actor herself, but also shares with us a deep conviction that theater can bring people together from very diverse communities, Lisa Burger, executive director of the National Theater, told the BBC.\n\nThe palace said that the Duchess is a strong believer in using the arts to bring people from different backgrounds and communities together. It also noted that while Meghan has spent 10 years in television, she trained in theater (and international relations) at Northwestern University.\n\nAD\n\nBut the theater gig also raised eyebrows.\n\nThe National Theater is extremely prestigious, and I'm quite surprised she was given that one. She hasn't even been a royal for a year, said Ingrid Seward, a royal biographer and author of My Husband and I.\n\nI'm surprised that the queen didn't give it to her youngest son, Seward said, referring to Prince Edward, who ran a television production company.\n\nAD\n\nBut they probably wanted her because she is so high-profile, and anything she does gets quite a lot of attention, she said.\n\nMeghan was also named patron of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, an international university network — a role the queen had for 33 years.\n\nAD\n\nThe other charities that Meghan will champion are Mayhew, an animal rescue shelter, and Smart Works, a company that supports unemployed women in entering the workforce by helping them dress for interviews and with interview coaching.\n\nThe act of a royal becoming a patron — a kind of figurehead for organizations who tries to draw attention to causes — stretches back hundreds of years. According to the British monarchy's website, the first record of a royal patronage was with King George II, who died in 1760. He lent his name to the Society of Antiquaries.\n\nAD\n\nThe tradition continues to this day, with over 3,000 organizations having a royal as a patron or president.\n\nAD\n\nThe monarchy's website says that each royal receives hundreds of requests from organizations seeking their support — and the publicity that they hope comes with a royal lending their name. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the queen receives the most requests. She is the patron of over 600 organizations.\n\nOver the past few years, the queen, 92, has slowly scaled back her workload, handing some of her duties to other members of the royal family.
Mr. Fou had obtained a visa to perform in Britain and had no intention of returning to communist China. His father, Fu Lei, a leading intellectual and celebrated translator of French literature, had been targeted in Mao Zedong's Anti-Rightist Campaign against perceived critics of the communist government. If Mr. Fou returned, he would be forced to denounce his father and was likely to suffer persecution himself.\n\nAll signs told me that I stood no chance, and I was especially scared because in this case it wasn't only myself but also my father, Mr. Fou said years later in an interview.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter arriving in London, where he lived for the rest of his life, Mr. Fou became one of the first Chinese pianists to rise to the front ranks of classical music. He never saw his father again, their contact limited to letters brimming with intellectual vigor, paternal concern and filial devotion that decades later were published in a best-selling volume in China.\n\nIn 1966, at the outset of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Mr. Fou's father and mother, Zhu Meifu, hanged themselves in Shanghai after Red Guard paramilitaries invaded their home. My anguish when I received the tragic news cannot be described, Mr. Fou once told noted piano teacher Carola Grindea.\n\nMr. Fou, who continued performing until recent years, earning renown for the sensitivity he brought to the works of Chopin, Mozart, Schubert and Debussy, died Dec. 28 at a hospital in London. He was 86. The cause was covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, said his wife, Patsy Toh.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Fou's recognition at the Chopin Competition in Warsaw — a symbolic victory for Chinese communists seeking to demonstrate their cultural achievements on an international stage — predated by three years Texan pianist Van Cliburn's triumph at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, another event with geopolitical significance that resonated far beyond the concert hall.\n\nJindong Cai, a conductor and director of the U.S.-China Music Institute at Bard College Conservatory in New York, compared Mr. Fou's defection to ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov's decision to leave the Soviet Union for the West in 1974. To Mr. Fou's admirers, he was a vital link between East and West, a performer who made them listen anew to musical works they had heard innumerable times.\n\nHis Chopin or his Mozart is very special, very different from almost all other Western pianists, Cai said in an interview. Your instinct for the music [comes] from yourself, from within. . . . What you lived, what you experienced, influences your music.\n\nFou Ts'ong was born in Shanghai on March 10, 1934. His name, he told the London Independent, meant good ear. The Chinese character for it is composed of an ear, an open window and a heart, Mr. Fou said. It's a natural and poetic way of saying, speak straight to the heart. As Mozart should. As all music should.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Fou's father had studied in France and produced Chinese translations of the works of Voltaire and Balzac, as well as the novel Jean-Christophe by Romain Rolland, based in part on the life of German composer Ludwig van Beethoven.\n\nFu Lei sought to instill in his son a profound appreciation for Western and Eastern cultural traditions and often counseled him, Mr. Fou recalled, that first you must be a person, then an artist, and then a musician, and only then can you be a pianist.\n\nMy father was an extraordinary person, a Renaissance man of great humanism; that is the way I was brought up, Mr. Fou said in an interview with Jessica Duchen, a classical music writer. This kind of classical education even in my generation is very rare, he continued. My father, when he was teaching me Lao-Tse or Confucius, would also quote Aristotle or Plato or Bertrand Russell or Voltaire.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Fou was drawn early on to Western classical music, which he heard on his family's collection of records. He began piano lessons in 1940 and studied during and after World War II with Mario Paci, an Italian pianist and conductor who led the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra.\n\nIn his teens, Mr. Fou had a youthful dalliance with communism. He described himself as making revolution all over the place, falling in and out of love all the time, drinking and playing bridge until he settled into serious study of the piano.\n\nHe was a rebellious, difficult pupil — a boy of that age, after all, does not find it easy to stick to hours of practice, his father wrote in an essay relayed in an email by Cai. But Mr. Fou's love for music was so great that I found the severest punishment for slackness was to lock the piano and forbid him to play. He would look at the instrument and cry his eyes out.\n\nIn their letters, the two men exchanged thoughts on music and on life. During his studies in Poland, he confessed to his father that he was lonely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe wrote back: 'You could never be lonely. Don't you think you are living with the greatest souls of the history of mankind all the time?'  Mr. Fou told Duchen. Now that's how I feel, always.\n\nPublished in 1981 as Fu Lei's Family Letters, the correspondence riveted Chinese readers.\n\nThese letters were no dry sermons, but were instead the sole vehicle for intimate confessions of a father and a person of integrity at a time of universal hypocrisy and extreme political pressure, Guangchen Chen, a professor at Emory University and longtime friend of Mr. Fou's, wrote in an essay published in the volume A New Literary History of Modern China.\n\nAD\n\nThe two were each other's soul mates, finding consolation in the values they both cherished.\n\nMr. Fou's first marriage, to Zamira Menuhin, a daughter of the acclaimed violinist Yehudi Menuhin, ended in divorce, as did his marriage to Hijong Hyun. In 1987, he married Toh, a piano teacher at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Besides his wife, survivors include a son from his first marriage, Lin Siao of Shanghai; a son from his third marriage, Lin Yun of London; a brother; and a grandson.\n\nAD\n\nRichard Curt Kraus, a professor emeritus at the University of Oregon and author of the book The Party and the Arty in China: The New Politics of Culture, wrote in an email that he considers Mr. Fou a tragic figure, a brilliant musician whose career was impeded by political currents and family pressures beyond his control.\n\nAD\n\nIt took two decades and massive political changes for China to forgive him [for his defection], cutting Fou off from his natural audience base, Kraus wrote. Fou avoided becoming a pawn in cold war propaganda, but his politically charged status cannot have helped his career.\n\nMr. Fou returned to China for the first time in 1979 and made more frequent trips back in the later years of his life to teach and perform. He gave his final public recital in Shanghai at age 80.\n\nOf all the composers whose works he performed, Mr. Fou said he felt closest to Chopin, who died in 1849 in Paris and was buried there at the Père Lachaise Cemetery, although, on his request, his heart was returned to Poland. He, too, was an exile, Mr. Fou told the Independent, with a feeling of longing, and anguish.
The marriage didn't last. Olga filed for divorce in 1935 and remarried in 1941. Lionel also remarried. He and Nike Anderson, who wrote a society column for the Washington Star, had a daughter, Tania Von Traeschler Anderson. Their marriage eventually ended in divorce, as well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLionel remained in the home until his death in 1966.

Anderson says he has been taking unexpected positions all his life, as an antiabortion activist in college and as a conservative at the liberal Quaker Friends School in Baltimore, where he grew up.\n\nHe was the fourth of five boys, and his parents paid for all to get the rigorous academic background Friends School provided. But they told their sons that college would be on them.\n\nAnderson paid for the part of his Princeton schooling that scholarships did not cover with the proceeds from a lawn business — Cutting Edge, he named it — started when he was an adolescent. His undergraduate degree is not in history or political science or philosophy, but in music. A percussionist, he keeps in his Washington apartment a marimba, a vibraphone, a hammered dulcimer and an electronic drum set.\n\nI always thought Ryan was going to be a musician or a composer or an entrepreneur, says his oldest brother, Christian, a professor at California Polytechnic State University.
Dear Carolyn: I have been married for over 30 years and throughout the marriage, my in-laws have made fun of my interests and certain traits of my personality under the guise of teasing. I have never spoken up and defended myself against these comments, and neither has my husband.\n\nOnly recently, I have been able to better articulate to my husband how much these comments bother me (slow learner).\n\nMy husband and I disagree on who should speak to his family about this. I have asked him to talk to them because I sense my in-laws will better accept this discussion from my husband, and because it is my husband's responsibility to protect me from this criticism. My husband believes these are my hurt feelings and that I should speak for myself.\n\nHaving My Back\n\nHaving My Back: I am long on the record that each spouse serves as marital spokesperson with their own parents. Sending a spouse instead to do the talking with in-laws usually just means the sender is dodging the folks.\n\nBut: This case is a little different, because I don't think the Big Talk With the Parents is what will serve you best right now.\n\nYour in-laws have bullied you for years. While it would be right and decent of your husband to stand up (and have stood up) for you — which I'll talk about more in a moment — the voice with the most potential impact here is your own. There's nothing more powerful than when the target of the bullying stands up and says, no. No more, not funny. I will not put up with this treatment again.\n\nSo here's the division of justice-labor I recommend: 1. Wait till your in-laws pull their usual teasing shtick. 2. Tell them you've had enough. You say you now can better articulate what's wrong with their teasing, so do it. 3. See how they respond. 4a. If you get through to them and they back down, thank them and cautiously treat this as the beginning of a beautiful, or at least not a one-sided mockery of, friendship. 4b. If they push back, then their son, your husband, needs to step in to tell them how unacceptable their behavior is now and has been for years.\n\nNot because he's their son, and not because you're his wife, but because when bystanders side decisively with the victims, that's when a bully is done.\n\nWhich brings us to the fact that your husband is, in retrospect and armed with this new information on how you interpret your in-laws' criticism, perfectly fine with his role as disengaged bystander.\n\nReally? You're finally able to put words to your decades of discomfort, and he's got nothing for you?\n\nHe chose you, and his parents have ridiculed that choice for decades. I could easily make a case that it's in his own self-interest to stand up to his parents on that — especially if they've teased him, too, into this current submission.\n\nBut he acknowledges that your feelings are hurt, and since when does any of us get to justify remaining a spectator to a loved one's mistreatment? Assuming he has a sense of self that's independent of his parents, this is exactly when he needs to use it.
War is hell. And who knows that better than George and Martha, the marital snipers who face off with such blistering panache in Edward Albee's peerless tragicomedy of connubial venom, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf??\n\nIn the persons of Gregory Linington and Holly Twyford, the Ford's Theatre revival, directed with sharpshooter's acumen by Aaron Posner, Washington audiences are getting as good as this toxically funny masterwork gives. Enhanced smartly by Danny Gavigan and Maggie Wilder as the seemingly defenseless younger couple who stumble into George and Martha's web, the three-act production glides by on a sizzlingly steady current of boozy accusation and twisted mind games. Rarely does so much malice spread so much glee.\n\nIf any impression of American life invited the jaundiced eye of Albee — who died last year at 88 — it was the illusion of blissful domesticity. (Not for nothing are the main characters named for the country's first first family.) Virginia Woolf, set in the comfy New England home of George, a history professor who's never lived up to his early promise, and Martha, the daughter of the college's legendary, longtime president, is both a biliously revealing drawing-room comedy and a corrosive tragedy about the lies that sustain a marriage through bad times, and worse.\n\nWhere's my little yum-yum? George inquires derisively about Martha at one point, expressing the sarcasm-laced duality of the play: They both love and detest each other, a paradox nourished in the contempt they feel over their own weaknesses — and the fact that each knows the other's vulnerabilities so well. It's as if they can't forgive themselves for the way things have turned out, the dissolution of youthful optimism, the neediness that has only grown more intense over the years. In their shared desolation, revolving, most bitterly, around their son, they can think of no other course than to impose their titanic sense of disappointment on each other.\n\nAnd on anyone else who drifts into their paths, the poor fools. In the early-morning hours after a faculty fete, Gavigan's Nick and Wilder's Honey become trapped by George and Martha — and by virtue of their own ambitiousness and appetites — in the older couple's psychodrama. George gives names to the vicious phases of this drunken after-party: Humiliate the Host, Hump the Hostess, Get the Guests. The games are the means by which George and Martha reveal their true gift, for turning pain into entertainment.\n\nFrom left, Gavigan, Twyford, Wilder and Linington in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? directed by Aaron Posner. (Scott Suchman)\n\nIt's because George and Martha are so electrically verbal that Virginia Woolf is hilarious, especially when there are a George and Martha who know how to work all the levers of Albee's vituperative insult machine. Twyford ascends to a level here that counts as yet another high watermark in an exemplary stage career. Wearing a hairstyle reminiscent of Elizabeth Taylor's in Mike Nichols's 1966 movie version, Twyford enters laughing, a husky cackle from her gut. Three hours later, she'll be in tears and in between will present Martha in all her seductive, destructive, childish, self-involved fury. I am the Earth Mother, and you are all flops, she declares in a thoroughly convincing haze of alcohol and self-pity.\n\nThis Martha is earthy all right: You believe in the conquest she's attempting when she shoots a come-hither gaze at Gavigan's manly Nick, a newly recruited biology professor with a wandering eye. Twyford's is a commanding and yet generous performance. The danger with Martha is that she's such a tornadic force that she can suck all the histrionic air out of the room. Nick and Honey, his giggly and neurotic wife, are simply no match for her. George, too, is potentially mere asphalt to Martha's steamroller.\n\nBut Twyford is not showboating in unleashing Martha's id. She and Posner leave ample room for Linington. He finds the formidable acerbic edge to George, the mixture of controlled rage and sense of the absurd that stokes the character's comic fire, that permits George to keep up with Martha, even earning her admiration. Something in Linington's turn here reveals an aspect of George that's rarely considered: courage. The actor exhibits it not only in George's psychological mastery of physically imposing Nick, but also in his dealing forcefully with Martha's ferocious mocking of his failures. His pugnacious George proves to be a partner for this Martha, in and out of the ring.\n\nGavigan and Wilder, two of the best young actors in town — his memorable work includes a troubled ex-soldier in Theater J's The Admission, and hers the odd gentile out in Studio Theatre's Bad Jews — contribute first-rate seriocomic performances. The design elements, ranging from Meghan Raham's realistically lived-in set to Kelsey Hunt's capri pants and low-cut blouse for Martha and pert party dress for Honey, contribute to a holistic impression of excellence, in what proves to be one of Ford's Theatre's finest hours — or in this case, three.\n\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward Albee.

Clyburn started working on civil rights before he was old enough to drive. At 12, he was the president of the local NAACP youth chapter in Sumter, S.C. He was also friends with a lot of kids in Summerton, the next town over, whose court case against school segregation became part of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case.\n\nAD\n\nAfter high school, Clyburn went on to college at South Carolina State University, a historically black school in Orangeburg. There he continued his civil rights work, including organizing the first sit-ins in the state, weeks after the first ones in Greensboro, N.C., in February 1960.\n\nAD\n\nOne of those sit-ins had more than 2,000 participants, mostly college students.\n\nThey locked up over 300 people, but the leaders got separated from the rest, Clyburn recounted on C-SPAN in 2018. So when all of the [other] people got out of jail, they kept us, the leaders.\n\nThe students who had just gotten out headed for the college cafeteria. They soon returned to the jail with food, just as Clyburn and the other leaders were being released.\n\nAD\n\nA petite, young woman approached him holding a hamburger. She was Emily England, a fellow college student from the small town of Moncks Corner.\n\nSo I reach for the hamburger; she pulled it back, broke it in half. She had half the hamburger, gave me the other half, Clyburn said. I was so grateful for that half a hamburger, I married her 18 months later.\n\nAD\n\nTheir first daughter, Mignon Clyburn, was born in 1962. The Clyburns went on to have two more daughters, Jennifer and Angela. They moved to Charleston, where he worked as a history teacher and she a school librarian.\n\nClyburn has been a member of Congress since 1993, and he has become a power broker in presidential politics. Democratic candidates flock to his world famous fish fry and vie for his endorsement in the primaries.\n\nFor the first decade of their marriage, Clyburn thought meeting Emily had been a chance encounter, an act of fate. Then, at their 10th wedding anniversary, he joked, I found out I [was] being stalked.\n\nAD\n\nThe Clyburns had invited some of their jailbird friends who had also been arrested the day they met down to Charleston to celebrate with them. As the anniversary party began to wind down, James Clyburn said to his friends,  'Guys we were very fortunate. We made such great choices for spouses.' And I'm waxing eloquently, you know, there was a little Jack Daniels contributing to that, he said.\n\nAD\n\nEmily Clyburn stood in the doorway and said, That's what you think.\n\nThen, she told me the rest of the story: One day, she was looking out of her dormitory window with her roommate and saw him walking across the campus.\n\nHe wasn't alone. He was walking with his girlfriend at the time.\n\nAD\n\nAnd she told her roommate, 'They do not make a good couple. He is going to be my husband,'  Clyburn recounted. And she laid out her plan.\n\nWeeks later, they both just happened to get arrested at the same sit-in.\n\nSo guys, no matter what you think, sit down sometime to get the real story about how you got reined in, he said, laughing.\n\nThe two were married for 58 years until Emily Clyburn's death in September.
Adapted from an online discussion.\n\nDear Carolyn: My adult niece, 40, posted a very nasty comment about me to a social-media site because of my stance that women and girls should NOT be judged on their looks. This stance was never communicated to her specifically, it is just something I occasionally reference.\n\nShe said of me: She's totally nuts. She's got a ton of money, no kids and clearly no joy in her life, either.\n\nHow do I get over the hurt, since I have no idea where the hate originated?\n\nFamily Member\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/The Washington Post)\n\nFamily Member: This sounds like the tip of the storyberg here, but, just going on what you gave me, I suggest you comment on her original nasty post so she knows you know what she wrote. Utterly without inflection, write, I'm sorry to hear you feel this way. That's it, then block her on that site.\n\nWhatever you may or may not have done to offend her, the fact that she responded this way is cowardly and completely on her. It also hints at a profoundly unhappy person, which also is about her, not you. The hate is her damage, not yours.\n\nAnd the onus is on her to rebuild a relationship with you if that's what she wants. In the meantime, heal by devoting your time and concern to people who welcome you — and civility — in their lives.\n\nDear Carolyn: My boyfriend and I have dated for two years. He's a wonderful man, but I still have doubts about whether he's the person I want to be with for the rest of my life. We're both willing to work on the problems in the relationship, but obviously we're not going to become entirely different people!\n\nHow do I know whether it makes sense to keep working or throw in the towel? Relevant factor: We're both in our mid-30s and want kids.\n\nTo Work or Not to Work?\n\nTo Work or Not to Work?: Would you stay just for his company — if neither kids nor fertility nor marriage were an issue? That's your stay or go.\n\nHi, Carolyn: I'm expecting my second child, a boy. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get over my disappointment about not having a daughter. (We'll stop at two kids.) I love our current little guy and am genuinely excited to have another boy, but I can't get over the feeling of loss, somehow, at never having a daughter and all that relationship entails. Yes, I know every kid is an individual, and there's no guarantee I'd have a good relationship with my daughter — but y'know, still.\n\nGirl Envy\n\nGirl Envy: Please know this whole issue lives in your imagination. Having a boy is real, sure, but virtually everything else is mental and emotional fiction.\n\nYour vision of life with a girl is imagined.\n\nYour vision of life with boys is imagined.\n\nYour vision that this is and will remain a big deal is imagined. Seriously.\n\nYour vision of you 10 years from now, or 20, or 30; of your kids; of your relationship with them? Imagined, imagined, imagined.\n\nSo my advice is, stop indulging it and live in the real. A wanted child. That is, without meaningful rival, The Best Position to enable delight in whoever your kids turn out to be.
Love is highly aware of the fragility of early relationships, when two people are not committed to each other but pondering it. Even in the best moments, on the best days, there can be a nagging sense of: This could end at any moment. One big revelation, one big fight, one long separation and the good feelings and momentum you've built might disappear.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMickey (Gillian Jacobs) and Gus (Paul Rust) go into their relationship knowing it's ill-advised. Mickey begins the season by telling Gus, after their first kiss, that she's a sex-and-love addict and an alcoholic, and that she was planning to spend a year not dating. (Those in Alcoholics Anonymous are often advised not to start new relationships while beginning recovery.)\n\nAnd so the central tension of the season, as Rust described it in an interview with Vulture, is not will they or won't they? but should or shouldn't they? Similarly, Lesley Arfin, Rust's real-life wife and one of the show's creators, said she was focused on what happens after the meet-cute: What does it look like when there is no romance anymore and we're on the couch in our sweats? Because I didn't know. I was figuring out how people got together and stayed together.\n\nShould or shouldn't they stay together? The healthy answer might be: They shouldn't. Mickey should work on herself and battling her addiction. Gus should go out with a well-adjusted woman who's not going to self-sabotage. But that would make for boring television.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nInstead, Mickey and Gus forge ahead. But even in their sunniest of moments — such as their day-long date that meanders from Silver Lake to Venice Beach — there's uncertainty in the air. For example, on a bridge over the Venice Canals, Mickey says to Gus: This is the best day I've had in a long time.\n\nYeah, me, too, Gus responds. It's funny, though. When something like this is going really well, I get like super-nervous, like: Oh, when is something bad going to happen and it's all going to end?\n\nMe, too, Mickey says, turning the tables by asking Gus the worst thing he has ever done. It's not that bad, and the viewer is left thinking that maybe these two will make it after all.\n\nAD\n\nIn the two months that follow, Mickey and Gus pass quite a few milestones that could have been tombstones for any other fragile early relationship. Mickey brings Gus to a work party, a situation that can be more awkward than meeting the parents. In the next episode, Gus does meet Mickey's father, and somehow everyone survives. Mickey throws a party to celebrate one of Gus's professional victories, and their friends awkwardly intermingle. They have their first fights, which get pretty brutal. After just a month of dating, Gus leaves for a three-week work trip, and they ponder how this time apart could make or break them. And while he's away, Mickey engages in behavior that, if Gus found out, certainly could break them.\n\nAD\n\nHe almost does find out. Faced with the prospect of losing Gus, Mickey commits to him. I want to be in a relationship with you, Mickey tells him. I don't want to do anymore nonexclusive b—s—. That ends today. I want to really try and work on this and be in a real adult relationship.\n\nI want that, too, Gus says. I'm in.\n\nAD\n\nIt's not as if anyone is saying I love you, moving in or proposing marriage, those traditional hallmarks of a rom-com. But today, when it's far easier to keep swiping than to commit to any one person, Mickey and Gus's stick-to-itiveness is quite romantic. In 12 episodes, they progress from like to pre-love. What's pre-love? It's what one writer has called that feeling when it's too soon for those three small words, but it feels like you're headed there.\n\nPre-love is where Josh Chan (Vincent Rodriguez III) appears to be before he commits to Rebecca Bunch (Rachel Bloom) on the second season of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, because he says those three little words almost immediately after they get back together. This in-between stage is also seen on Girls, which Arfin used to write for, when Shoshanna is dating a guy who tries to persuade her not to move to Tokyo by saying: I'm gonna be in love with you soon. (It doesn't work for him, but good try, dude.)\n\nAD\n\nIf Love is insufferable at times, and it is, that may be partly because, in the real world, the early stages of a relationship can be just as dizzyingly fun and boring and hard as they are for Mickey and Gus. Almost-couples go through the thrill of meeting someone, the intense probability of losing them, all before making a commitment. Nobody commits just because they like each other, especially today, with so many other potential partners at our fingertips. They commit because they can see themselves being in love with each other soon.
Go to Chapter One Section\n\nRush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot\n\nand Other Observations\n\nBy Al Franken\n\nChapter One\n\nAfter Delacorte asked me to write a book on politics, my very first creative act was coming up with the title, Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations. I thought the title, aside from the obvious advantage of being personally offensive to Limbaugh, would sell books. Let me explain why: It makes fun of Rush Limbaugh by pointing out that he is a big lardbutt.\n\nConfident that I was now on my way to a bestseller, I took some time off and went to Florida with my wife and kids. But when I returned and sat down to work, it became immediately apparent that the title tail was going to wag the content dog. That is to say, I'd actually have to write about Rush Limbaugh.\n\nWhich, of course, meant I'd have to listen to him on radio, read his books, and watch his TV show. How much am I getting paid for this? I asked myself.\n\nI was not, after all, totally unfamiliar with Limbaugh. He is the king of talk radio, with an estimated twenty million listeners in a given week. I had been one of those twenty million a while back, listening to him spew about feminazis and their women-as-victim ideas. Limbaugh was railing about how feminists believe that all heterosexual sex is rape, which, I admit, is a belief that's very hard to defend. The thing is, though, I know a lot of women, almost all of whom consider themselves feminists, and I know only one who actually holds this belief. And we've been married nearly twenty years.\n\nLimbaugh expanded . . . to TV a few years back, and I had seen his show a number of times. It's been a considerable success, though I think it was ultimately a terrible mistake for Limbaugh because we finally got to see his audience. During the shows I watched, Limbaugh presented, in a deliberately misleading way, disinformation that was devoured whole by a studio audience of rabid--but extraordinarily straightlaced--right-wing yahoos. These are the fans who voluntarily-hell, gleefully-call themselves dittoheads in honor of their ability to blindly and uncritically agree with everything that comes out of Limbaugh's mouth.\n\nThe first time I watched the show was in October, 1992, about a month before the election. President Bush had been on Larry King Live the night before, and during the interview Bush had said that he was bothered by Clinton's actions during the Vietnam War: Maybe I'm old-fashioned, Larry, he said. But to go to a foreign country and demonstrate against your own country, when your sons and daughters are dying halfway around the world? I'm sorry, I--I just don't like it. I think it is wrong. To anybody watching Larry King, as I happened to be, it was an attack on Clinton's patriotism, and the next day several newspapers ran headlines saying as much.\n\nSo Rush shows this headline from the New York Times that reads: BUSH ASSAILS CLINTON'S PATRIOTISM DURING VIETNAM WAR PROTEST ERA. Then he starts whining about the liberal media. He didn't assail Clinton's patriotism. . . . Now let's roll Bush on Laity King Live last night, and you be the judge. Did he attack Governor Clinton's patriotism here?\n\nThen he runs a twenty-second clip from a totally different part of the interview. Limbaugh comes back: I didn't hear one assault on patriotism. I didn't hear one word or syllable questioning Bill Clinton's patriotism. . . . We'll be back in just a moment. Cut to: a hundred and twenty idiots in bad suits applauding wildly.\n\nSubsequent viewings pretty much confirmed that the point of Rush's show is to punish you for actually knowing anything.\n\nBack to my still-unwritten book. Catchy title in hand, I braced myself for an entire season of such punishment. I would spend the summer absorbing Limbaugh-three hours a day, five day-s a week, listening to conservatism's most powerful (not to mention obnoxious) voice. I am, after all, a professional.\n\nRush Limbaugh, Radio Icon and Staunch Defender of Constitutional Rights for Neckwear\n\nSpring 1995. I go to the Wiz and buy a boom box for my office at home. I pour a fresh glass of iced tea, settle into a comfortable chair, flip on WABC, and tune in to the first installment of what will be approximately one hundred and eighty hours of listening pleasure. And at 12:15, Rush is peeved:\n\nLet me give you another example here of the press. This may be as good as an example as I could cite to show you how it is that the left has stereotypes. Now you people all know that I have introduced a new line of neckwear, commonly known as ties. And that I have, right now, we've got four styles, four designs that are out there, and we are always working on more. . . .\n\nI was about to learn that the liberal media had deliberately misrepresented his mail-order tie collection:\n\n. . . So I'm at the United Press International wire and I'm, reading the People section and there's a story there about the new Rush Limbaugh No Boundaries tie collection, and would you like to hear it described? Limbaugh's ties are as conservative as he is. Blue, white, red, and gray stripes. My friends. The last thing my ties are is conservative. That's why we're calling it No Boundaries! These are . . . the last thing in the world these ties would be described as would be conservative. There's not one stripe! On any of the ties! . . .\n\nAnd he won't stop. He's just going on and on about these ties. So I flip around the dial, catch an inning of the Mets game, and then come back to Rush. And his brutally defamed ties:\n\n. . . I mean, that is another example of the stereo types that the left, and I am including the press in this, have about conservatives. . . . It was my wife Marta who came up with the whole concept, to tell you the truth, of No Boundaries. And she said no themes on these ties, no ties to issues, no ties to politics . . . These are going to be gorgeous, beautiful ties that anybody would want to wear to make themselves look better. And they are. And there's not one stripe! Not one stripe! On any tie! . . .\n\nTime for another iced tea. I head to the kitchen, wander around the apartment a bit. Back to my office and . . . the vicious media smear campaign directed against Rush's ties:\n\n. . . They could have called me first to ask me about it. They could have called and said, Hey, we hear you got some new ties out; we'd like to see them; we're going to write a story. . . .\n\nBack to the fridge. I root around for some leftovers. Make a sandwich. Read the sports page. The Twins are having a pretty tough year. Back to the ties, which--near as I can tell--have now had t!heir civil rights violated by the hounds of attack journalism:\n\n. . . In this battle for the soul of democracy, it is more and more clear that the press, which has a designed Constitutional role, can't be trusted, cannot be counted on. My gosh, if the press, which Constitutionally is protected so as to get the truth, is this far off as often as they are, then is it any wonder that there is a new media led by me, America's truth detector? No, there's not. Quick break. Back to the phones in just a moment . . .\n\nOnly a hundred and seventy-nine hours to go. Hmmm. Maybe it would be okay if I just . . . sampled . . . the show. Every now and then.\n\nKierkegaard, Nietzsche--and Limbaugh\n\nAfter the tie episode, I sent my research assistant Geoff to Barnes and Noble, where he found a paperback of Limbaugh's bestseller See, I Told You So.\n\nPicking up a new book is always exciting to a curious person like myself, but I became especially jazzed by Rush's introduction: Prepare your mind to be challenged as it has never been challenged before. Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, now Limbaugh.\n\nBy Chapter Two, I had learned the key to Limbaugh's success. My show works because people are tired of being insulted elsewhere on the radio or TV dial. They enjoy listening to someone who respects their intelligence.\n\nFortunately, I was soon treated to an example of just how much respect Rush has for his readers' intelligence:\n\nWith the exception of the military, I defy you to name one government program that has worked and alleviated the problem it was created to solve. Hhhmmmmmmm? I'm waiting. . . . Time's up.\n\nThis got me thinking. Now, I'm no expert on government. And besides, I'm a liberal. So my naming ten or twenty of the hundreds of successful government programs isn't going to impress anyone. Hell, I think Rural Electrification worked! That's how big a dumbass liberal I am! So instead, I called a few bona fide conservatives and asked them to name a few:(*)\n\n1. George F. Will (grim-faced conservative columnist)-rural Electrification, the Interstate Highway System (the most successful public works program in the history of the world). The federal government has been tremendously successful in disseminating health and safety information, for example, about smoking and seat belts.\n\n2. Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio; boyishly rugged, straight-talking chairman of the House Budget Committee)--National Institutes of Health, Youth Summer Jobs Program.\n\n3. Rep. Bob Dornan (R-calif.; Republican candidate for president; crazy homophobe)--The F.A.A., lighthouses, federal penitentiaries (We gotta keep those guys locked up).\n\n4. Arianna Huffington (enigmatic, Greek-born, Cambridge-educated socialite; conservative commentator; fund-raiser for Newt Gingrich; wife of unsuccessful California Senate candidate Michael Huffington)--The National Park System, guaranteed student loans, aid to Greece.\n\n5. Ben Stein (conservative columnist for the American Spectator; former Nixon speechwriter; noted character actor, famous for role as the Bueller, Bueller, Bueller teacher in Ferris Bueller's Day Off)-social Security. Medicare. Head Start. Food Stamps. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is the most wildly successful government program in the history of man.\n\n6. Richard Viguerie (former publisher the Conservative Digest, archconservative direct-mail pioneer)--Public libraries, the F.B.I., the G.I. Bill.\n\nSo, is Limbaugh that out of touch with conservatives like Will, Kasich, and Dornan? Or does he just take his readers to be complete morons? Hhhmmmmmmm? I'm waiting. . . . Time's up!\n\nDidiots-Limbaugh's Legion of Fans\n\nNow, am I saying that dittoheads are ignoramuses? No. I don't need to. Listen to Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the Annenberg School for Communications at the University of Pennsylvania:\n\nWe just concluded a study of 360 people, whom we watched watch the health care reform debate for nine months. And at the end of that period, we took the people who said they relied on talk radio, and by this, we mean primarily Rush Limbaugh. . . . And we asked them how well informed they felt. . . .Of all the people we watched, they said they were the best informed. And of all the people we watched, they were the least informed.\n\nWhat a surprise, huh? Limbaugh listeners thought they were the best informed, and yet were the least informed.\n\nHow is such a thing even measured? Well, like all the other people studied, talk radio listeners were asked questions of objective fact such as: Which groups (the elderly, poor, middle class, etc. are most likely to be uninsured? The Limbaugh listeners were highly likely to give an incorrect answer such as the elderly who, of course, are all covered by Medicare.\n\nBut why would people so woefully lacking in the basic facts of an issue think they were the best informed? Social scientists call the phenomenon pseudo-certainty. I call it being a fucking moron.(*)\n\nLimbaugh and Women--A Pathetic Story\n\nIt's safe to say that most of Limbaugh's fact-challenged dittoheads are men. Limbaugh has tapped into the resentments of the angry white male, which are quite legitimate. I mean, if you think about it, what chance for advancement have white men really had in this country?\n\nLimbaugh, himself, seems to have a problem with women. He has been married three times. Personally, I am not one for psychoanalyzing public figures. I wouldn't, for example, attempt to create a psychological construct to explain why a desperately insecure man would weigh three hundred pounds and have difficulty sustaining intimate relationships. Psychobabble mumbo jumbo doesn't interest me, and I would never suggest that a difficult separation from the primary love object at an early age might cause a man to hate women and look to food as a substitute for the mother's teat. Instead I thought it might be fun (after all, that's what this is about), to juxtapose some of Rush's own words with those of people who know him. (I saw some of this stuff on Frontline.)\n\nRush: Feminism was established so that unattractive, ugly women could have easy access to the mainstream of society.\n\nMillie Limbaugh, Mother: No. He did not date in high school.\n\nRush: If you want a successful marriage, let your husband do what he wants to do.\n\nDavid Limbaugh, Brother: I don't think he would have chosen to break up either marriage. I think it was the choice of both of his ex-wives. . . . Women, especially young women, don't want guys to be sedentary.\n\nRush (Writing to a woman on E-mail): I remain in an interminable funk, no end in sight-listless, uninspired, and self-flagellating.\n\nHazel Staloff (Thee woman): I thought, What a sad thing to write, and to write to somebody you didn't even know. Later I came to realize that it was probably his way of trying to attract a woman. You know, for a woman to read, Rush has no friends and for her to respond, Let me make it better for you.
Investigative A conservative activist's behind-the-scenes campaign to remake the nation's courts Leonard Leo helped conservative nonprofits raise $250 million from mostly undisclosed donors in recent years to promote conservative judges and causes Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\n\nLeonard Leo stepped onto the stage in a darkened Florida ballroom, looked out at a gathering of some of the nation's most powerful conservative activists and told them they were on the cusp of fulfilling a long-sought dream.\n\nFor two decades, Leo has been on a mission to turn back the clock to a time before the U.S. Supreme Court routinely expanded the government's authority and endorsed new rights such as abortion and same-sex marriage. Now, as President Trump's unofficial judicial adviser, he told the audience at the closed-door event in February that they had to mobilize in very unprecedented ways to help finish the job.\n\nWe're going to have to understand that judicial confirmations these days are more like political campaigns, Leo told the members of the Council for National Policy, according to a recording of the speech obtained by The Washington Post. We're going to have to be smart as a movement.\n\nLeo's remarks: 'We stand at the threshold' The Washington Post obtained audio of Leonard Leo speaking to members of the Council for National Policy. Listen (2:03)\n\nNo one in this room has probably experienced the kind of transformation that I think we are beginning to see, Leo said.\n\nAt a time when Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are rapidly reshaping federal courts by installing conservative judges and Supreme Court justices, few people outside government have more influence over judicial appointments now than Leo.\n\nHe is widely known as a confidant to Trump and as executive vice president of the Federalist Society, an influential nonprofit organization for conservative and libertarian lawyers that has close ties to Supreme Court justices. But behind the scenes, Leo is the maestro of a network of interlocking nonprofits working on media campaigns and other initiatives to sway lawmakers by generating public support for conservative judges.\n\nThe story of Leo's rise offers an inside look into the modern machinery of political persuasion. It shows how undisclosed interests outside of government are harnessing the nation's nonprofit system to influence judicial appointments that will shape the nation for decades.\n\n\n\nDocumentary: Pathways to power Conservatives are winning the battle for America's courts, a triumph decades in the making. This is the story of the ideologues, activists and undisclosed donors who made it happen. At the center of the movement is Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, who has helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for nonprofit groups that work behind the scenes to promote conservative judges and causes. Now a private judicial adviser to President Trump, Leo has extraordinary influence over the third branch of government.\n\n(Dalton Bennett, Jorge Ribas and Jesse Mesner-Hage)\n\nEven as Leo counseled Trump on judicial picks, he and his allies were raising money for nonprofits that under IRS rules do not have to disclose their donors. Between 2014 and 2017 alone, they collected more than $250 million in such donations, sometimes known as dark money, according to a Post analysis of the most recent tax filings available. The money was used in part to support conservative policies and judges, through advertising and through funding for groups whose executives appeared as television pundits.\n\nThe groups in Leo's network often work in concert and are linked to Leo and one another by finances, shared board members, phone numbers, addresses, back-office support and other operational details, according to tax filings, incorporation records, other documents and interviews.\n\nNine of the groups hired the same conservative media relations firm, Creative Response Concepts, collectively paying it more than $10 million in contracting fees in 2016 and 2017. During that time, the firm coordinated a months-long media campaign in support of Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil M. Gorsuch, including publishing opinion essays, contributing 5,000 quotes to news stories, scheduling pundit appearances on television and posting online videos that were viewed 50 million times, according to a report on the firm's website.\n\nPresident Trump shakes hands with Judge Neil M.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIn another case, a nonprofit Leo launched in 2016, the Freedom and Opportunity Fund, gave $4 million over two years to a nonprofit called Independent Women's Voice, about half the group's revenue, tax filings show. Leaders of Independent Women's Voice last year spoke at rallies, wrote online commentary and appeared regularly on Fox News to promote another of Trump's Supreme Court nominees, Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nDuring an on-camera interview for a Post documentary, Leo called himself a leader of the conservative legal movement and said, I have no idea how many groups I've been involved with over the years.\n\nA devout Catholic, Leo said he is driven by his faith and a literal interpretation of the Constitution. He also defended the practice of taking money from donors whose identities are not publicly disclosed, comparing his effort to shape the courts to those of abolitionists, suffragists and civil rights activists.\n\n[They] were all very much fueled by very wealthy people, and oftentimes wealthy people who chose to be anonymous, Leo said.\n\nBut he refused to talk about the money behind his advocacy, saying, I'm not particularly knowledgeable about a lot of it.\n\nI have a very simple rule, which is, I'm engaged in the battle of ideas, and I care very deeply about our Constitution and the role of courts in our society, he said. And I don't waste my time on stories that involve money and politics because what I care about is ideas.\n\nLater, in response to written questions about the interlocking nonprofits, Leo described the network as an effective and highly successful judicial coalition that's organized just about the same as the Left's, except that their coalition is significantly bigger and better funded.\n\nLeo, seen on a video screen, speaks at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington in April. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nLeo, 53, wears round, horn-rimmed glasses, tailored suits and monochromatic pocket squares. His office at the Federalist Society is filled with mementos of his career, including a red Trump-campaign-style hat that reads Make The Court Great Again and a gold-framed New Yorker profile of himself. On a bookshelf is a photo of Leo and Kavanaugh in tuxedos. A nameplate on the shelf reads, The Real Boss.\n\nLeo grew up in suburban New Jersey, where his high school yearbook lists his nickname as the Moneybags kid and shows a photograph of him holding a handful of cash. He attended Cornell as an undergraduate and law student and founded an early chapter of the Federalist Society, then an all-volunteer organization focused on infusing traditional legal values into the nation's law schools.\n\nHis conservative values stood out. When a classmate protesting apartheid in South Africa threw a chocolate cream pie into the face of the university's president, Leo expressed outrage in a letter to the student newspaper. Although some will dismiss Tuesday as only a pie-throwing incident, it is representative of a more hostile form of expression that has become more common, he wrote.\n\nIn 1990, Leo became a clerk for a U.S. Court of Appeals judge in Washington, D.C., where he met Clarence Thomas, then an appellate judge. The two became close friends.\n\nAfter his clerkship, Leo joined the Federalist Society as one of its first paid employees. But he delayed the start date to help Thomas through his contentious confirmation process for the Supreme Court.\n\nAt the Federalist Society, Leo took a leading role in the conservative legal movement, part of a burgeoning effort to counter the influence of the 1960s and liberals on education, law and politics.\n\nLeo and Mother Assumpta Long of the Dominican Sisters of Mary Mother of the Eucharist watch President George W. Bush speak at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in 2007. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWith the election of George W. Bush, Leo began working as an outside adviser for the White House on initiatives related to judicial nominations. Among his allies was Kavanaugh, then White House associate counsel.\n\nIn January 2003, Leo called White House officials, including Kavanaugh, to object to a plan by Bush to weigh in on affirmative action. Bush was going to criticize the practice but praise racial diversity. Leo complained that praising diversity would disgust any conservative who thinks that this is a matter of principle, according to a previously unreported email by a White House official describing one of the calls.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later, Kavanaugh wrote back: Leonard just called me and gave me the same earful.\n\nLeo told The Post that from the accounts of the calls, it appears I was conveying the widely shared belief among conservatives that discriminating on the basis of race is always wrong and inconsistent with the dignity and worth of every person.\n\nLeo came to be known in the White House as coordinator of all outside coalition activity regarding judicial nominations, according to a 2003 email by a White House aide to Kavanaugh and others.\n\nLeo also developed a reputation as a conservative moneyman. When Kavanaugh and other Bush aides were looking for someone to pay for a press event aimed at supporting the stalled judicial nomination of Miguel Estrada, they turned to Leo.\n\nLeonard Leo will know, a White House aide wrote in an email obtained by The Post. We probably don't want the fed soc paying for it, but he might know some generous donor.\n\nLeo, center, attends the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in April. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nLeo's behind-the-scenes activism came at the same time he was helping to grow the Federalist Society, which describes itself as nonpartisan. Leo told The Post he has taken steps to avoid any conflict.\n\nI separate my advocacy from the educational work of The Federalist Society, he said in his statement. I put in a full day's work for the Society and spend a substantial amount of my personal time on the other public service work I also love.\n\nLeo told The Post he has employed techniques liberals used to derail the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court three decades ago.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Leo served as the leader of the campaigns supporting Supreme Court nominees John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr. He and other members of an advocacy coalition spent about $15 million in donations from undisclosed donors on ads, telemarketing and the mobilization of grass roots groups, Leo later told a Federalist Society chapter at the University of Virginia. They conducted polls to help craft the most persuasive messages and arranged dozens of background briefings for reporters.\n\nThe Supreme Court justices, from left: Stephen G. Breyer, Clarence Thomas, John G. Roberts Jr., Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Samuel A. Alito Jr. Back, from left: Neil M. Gorsuch, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Brett M. Kavanaugh. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nA key part of those efforts was a new nonprofit called the Judicial Confirmation Network, or JCN. Tax filings show it was based at the home of Ann and Neil Corkery, close allies of Leo who have served as board members or treasurers of organizations run by Leo and a small group of interconnected activists.\n\n[Read five takeaways from The Post's investigation.]\n\nOne radio spot paid for by JCN in Arkansas featured a local minister who warned listeners that liberals wanted to curb religious freedom, including Christmas celebrations. Now these extremist groups want our senators to vote against Judge Alito for the United States Supreme Court, the ad said.\n\nIn the interview with The Post, Leo said he took time off from the Federalist Society — a charity that says it does not endorse specific nominees — during the nomination fights in 2005 and 2006. The group's tax filings show that his compensation in those two years jumped by nearly 50 percent, to about $328,000 annually. Leo did not respond to a question about how his compensation was affected by his time off. A spokesman for the Federalist Society said Leo's pay went up — despite the time off — because of the organization's extraordinary revenue growth. Back at the Federalist Society the following year, his compensation was $419,000.\n\nDocuments show that Leo never assumed a formal position at JCN, which eventually changed its name to the Judicial Crisis Network. But he told The Post he is very supportive of the group.\n\nLeo speaks at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in April. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nThe ties between JCN and Leo are opaque. JCN's office is on the same hallway as the Federalist Society in a downtown Washington building, though JCN's website and tax filings list a mailing address at a different location, an address shared by multiple companies.\n\nJCN board director Gary Marx told The Post the two organizations share similar goals but have different boards, different missions, different functions and do very different things.\n\nWhen a Post reporter visited the JCN offices to ask questions, a security guard contacted a longtime employee of the Federalist Society to see whether anyone at JCN was available. A Federalist Society employee then escorted the reporter to JCN's office.\n\nThe group's president, Daniel Casey, has worked closely with Leo for years. Casey receives no pay from JCN or three other nonprofits in the network that he helps to lead, tax filings show. He received more than $1.5 million in fees from the Federalist Society over nine years for media training through a firm based at his home in Front Royal, Va.\n\nIn an interview with The Post, Casey declined to discuss that firm, DC Strategies. He said all of the nonprofit groups he is affiliated with followed the law. Everything is up and up, he said.\n\nLeo told The Post that Casey has been a highly skilled provider of strategic consulting services in the legal policy space for over 30 years.\n\nSupreme Court Justices Roberts, left, Thomas, Breyer and Alito attend President George W. Bush's State of the Union address in 2006. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nLeo's influence and political connections continued to expand even as President Barack Obama took over the White House.\n\nHe routinely attended galas and black-tie Federalist Society events that included justices Thomas, Alito and Antonin Scalia, as well as McConnell and other leading lawmakers, according to interviews and annual reports by the Federalist Society.\n\nHe also became more adept at managing media campaigns. In a previously undisclosed email, Leo boasted to a colleague in 2009 about his savvy at generating free publicity through the Federalist Society.\n\nI'm very familiar with the media, Leo wrote to Tom Carter, then a spokesman for the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a government agency created to promote religious liberty abroad. I spend probably close to $800,000 annually on a PR team at the Federalist Society, and we generate press that has a publicity value of approximately $146 million each year.\n\nLeo, then a commissioner, said the Federalist Society had learned to sidestep pointed questions about judicial nominees — and he urged Carter to do the same in his work for the commission. We get around these inquiries quite well, and I am sure you can find a way to do so as well, he wrote.\n\nLeo joined additional advocacy groups that expanded his influence following the Supreme Court's landmark Citizens United decision in 2010, which lifted restrictions on spending by corporations, unions and nonprofits on politically oriented advertisements and media campaigns.\n\nLeo on anonymous funding Leonard Leo helped conservative nonprofits raise more than $250 million from mostly undisclosed donors in recent years to promote conservative judges and causes. Watch The Post's documentary: Pathways to power.\n\nHis growing network was composed mostly of nonprofits called social welfare organizations, which are allowed to engage in politics as long as it's not their primary activity. It also included some public charities, which can receive tax-deductible donations and are prohibited from backing or opposing candidates for office.\n\nIn 2010, Leo served on the board of a tea party group called Liberty Central. Ginni Thomas, wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, received $120,511 as the start-up's president that year. She later stepped down following questions about possible conflicts of interest, saying the issue had become a distraction for the group.\n\nIn 2012, Leo joined the boards of the nonprofit Catholic Association and an affiliated charity, the Catholic Association Foundation. They funded campaigns to rally Catholic voters and stop states from recognizing same-sex marriage.\n\nThe two Catholic nonprofits launched a third organization called Catholic Voices. Its stated mission was to train Catholic lay members to advocate for religious and conservative causes, some of whom later wrote letters for publication in major newspapers condemning the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal.\n\nThe next year, Leo joined forces with wealthy conservative donor Rebekah Mercer and Stephen K. Bannon, then the chairman of Breitbart News, on the board of a small charity known as Reclaim New York. Mercer and Bannon would go on to play central roles in Trump's insurgent campaign, Mercer as a leading financial backer and Bannon as campaign chief.\n\nIn the year Leo joined Mercer's group, and in the two following years, the Mercer family became a leading benefactor of the Federalist Society, donating a total of nearly $6 million, tax filings show.\n\nFormer White House counsel Donald McGahn, a Federalist Society member, listens to Trump during a Cabinet meeting last year. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIn March 2016, Leo met with Trump and Federalist Society member Donald McGahn at the Washington law firm Jones Day, just as Trump was beginning to prevail in his quest to be the Republican nominee, Leo told The Post.\n\nJustice Scalia had just died, and the men were mulling the implications. McGahn had come up with the idea of generating a list of potential Supreme Court nominees that Trump could disclose to win over moderates. Leo said he briefed Trump about the current composition of the court, the ideology of the justices and the like.\n\nAs Leo tells it, Trump was open to one of his long-held goals: A federal court system dominated by conservative judges who believe the Constitution must be interpreted literally.\n\nLeo later gave the president a list of possible Supreme Court nominees. Trump released the list during the primary campaign, a gesture that helped him win the support of skeptical mainstream Republicans. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were added to the list later.\n\nJCN, the group that has office space on the same hall as the Federalist Society, launched a $7 million media campaign to bolster the Republican-controlled Senate in preventing Obama from filling the seat, according to a JCN news release at the time. Working on the campaign was Creative Response Concepts, a firm that was hired by multiple nonprofits in Leo's network, tax filings show.\n\nCRC's president, Greg Mueller, describes himself as a friend of Leo. Mueller's firm gained prominence during the presidential campaign of 2004 for helping to promote the swift boat allegations, unsubstantiated claims that Democratic candidate John F. Kerry's war record in Vietnam was exaggerated. Among its clients now is the Federalist Society.\n\nMueller said in a statement that the firm does not discuss its work for clients.\n\nAs the 2016 election campaign heated up, Leo became president of three new nonprofits whose tax filings and incorporation records illustrate how his network sometimes operates. The groups — called BH Fund, the Freedom and Opportunity Fund and America Engaged — were formed by an employee at Holtzman Vogel Josefiak Torchinsky, a Warrenton, Va., law firm with deep ties to the conservative movement. The nonprofits reported having no employees and no websites. They had virtually no public presence. Leo's role as president of all three groups was not disclosed for nearly three years because of lags in how nonprofit groups report their annual operations to the IRS.\n\nAll three hired CRC for public relations and consulting.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the three nonprofits raised about $33 million, with the BH Fund taking in $24,250,000 from a single donor whose identity is still not publicly known, documents show. BH Fund then gave a total of almost $3 million to the two other Leo groups, Freedom and Opportunity Fund and America Engaged. The Center for Responsive Politics published details about the groups' spending in February.\n\nIn 2017, America Engaged passed on almost $1 million to the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association. That same year, the NRA announced a $1 million ad campaign in support of Gorsuch. The ads targeted lawmakers in Montana, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota who had supported Obama's calls for gun control. Your freedom is on the line, the ads stated.\n\nThe media blitz coincided with yet another campaign to promote Gorsuch's nomination, by Judicial Crisis Network. JCN announced that it would spend $10 million, calling it the most robust operation in the history of confirmation battles. CRC, its media consultant on the campaign, later boasted that online videos, television ads, pundit commentary, opinion essays and other material supporting Gorsuch had been viewed 1.2 billion times.\n\nLeo's Freedom and Opportunity Fund, meanwhile, distributed $4 million to Independent Women's Voice over two years.\n\nLeonard Leo guides a network of nonprofits to promote conservative judges and causes.

They spoke at rallies, according to videos, and they bought Facebook ads that reached hundreds of thousands of users, according to a Facebook political advertising database.\n\nHeather Higgins, the group's president and chief executive, expressed doubts on Fox News about the memory of the woman accusing Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades ago. If you have a weak standard of evidence, then what you are doing is guaranteeing that future nominations will all be last-minute character assassinations and circuses, said Higgins, who records show is paid $311,000 as the leader of Independent Women's Voice.\n\nHiggins did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nShe once described her group as a weapon in the Republican conservative arsenal that caters to donors who want a high return on their investment for their political dollars, according to a video of a speech she made at the nonprofit David Horowitz Freedom Center.\n\nWe have worked hard to create a branded organization . . . that does not carry partisan baggage, Higgins said in 2015. Being branded as neutral but actually having the people who know, know that you're actually conservative puts us in a unique position.\n\nLeo's nonprofit network In 2016, Leonard Leo created three new nonprofits. All three nonprofits have no employees, no office space, no website and virtually no public profile. Watch The Post's documentary: Pathways to power.\n\nLeonard Leo's work in the nonprofit world has proved lucrative.\n\nThe Federalist Society, a charity, has regularly paid him more than $400,000 in annual compensation in recent years, tax filings show. In 2016, the Catholic Association paid him $120,000 for management consulting.\n\nLeo's only other publicly known employer is an obscure for-profit start-up called the BH Group. It was registered in Virginia on Aug. 22, 2016, by the same law firm employee who incorporated the BH Fund and the two other nonprofits Leo started earlier that year. The firm is based out of a virtual office suite used as a shared mailing address and meeting space for unrelated companies.\n\nIn the two years following its formation, the BH Group received more than $4 million from the Judicial Crisis Network, a related group called the Judicial Education Project and a third nonprofit in the network called the Wellspring Committee, all of them connected to Leo through funding, personnel and the same accountant, IRS filings show. The groups described the payments in IRS filings as consulting, research and public relations fees.\n\nLeo, who disclosed BH Group as his employer in a campaign finance filing, declined to say how much money he received from the company or provide any other details about it.\n\nBH Group is a private firm whose team of professionals, which includes Leonard Leo, provides management and consulting services to philanthropists and nonprofits, a CRC spokesman for Leo said in a statement. Like similar firms on the Left, its clients are private as are the details of the work for them.\n\nIn December 2016, while Leo worked on Trump's transition team, BH Group donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, according to a campaign finance disclosure.\n\nThe next year, Leo and his wife, Sally, were named Stewards of Saint Peter by the Papal Foundation, an honor given to those who pledge to donate $1 million or more for Vatican initiatives worldwide.\n\nThe Leos and their six children have lived in a McLean home that was purchased in 2010 for $710,000, according to real estate records. They paid off a 30-year mortgage last August and two months later bought a $3.3 million summer home with 11 bedrooms in an affluent seaside village on the coast of Maine. In a statement, Leo described the mansion as a retreat for our large family and for extending hospitality to our community of personal and professional friends and co-workers.\n\nLeo speaks to reporters at Trump Tower in New York shortly after Donald Trump's election in 2016. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nLeo's work to influence judicial nominations has made him a hero to some conservative activists. The esteem was evident in February at the closed-door meeting of the nonprofit Council for National Policy, where Leo serves on the board of governors.\n\nHe is one of us. He cares about the Constitution. He understands that elections may come and go, but judges with lifetime appointments . . . are going to be here for a long time, Rebecca Hagelin, a board member, told the assembled activists and donors.\n\nAnd this is perhaps where Donald Trump is making his greatest, longest-lasting effort. But he's doing it based on a lot of the work by Leonard Leo. And today I'm so pleased to introduce him, she said. Welcome him to the stage, and thank him for all the work that he is doing to help save America.\n\nDalton Bennett, Alice Crites and Andrew Ba Tran contributed to this report.
All around Mexico City, Frida and Diego-philes can find the couple's work at over a dozen museums and public spaces. Here are some stops on the Kahlo-Rivera trail:\n\n___\n\nCASA AZUL\n\nAD\n\nThe Frida Kahlo Museum, also known as Casa Azul or the Blue House for its cobalt blue walls, was Kahlo's birthplace and childhood home. She later lived there with Rivera for several years during their marriage. It opened as a museum in 1958 and is maintained to look as it would have in the 1950s. It's one of Mexico City's most popular museums, with about 25,000 visitors monthly. Displays include some of Kahlo's artwork, including a still life of watermelons called Viva La Vida, or Long Live Life. But the real appeal is the memorabilia and other personal items, with earthenware pots in the kitchen, and Kahlo's corsets and colorful clothing. Located at Londres 247, Colonia Del Carmen, Coyoacan.\n\nAD\n\n___\n\nDIEGO RIVERA AND FRIDA KAHLO HOUSE AND STUDIO MUSEUM\n\nAD\n\nKahlo lived on and off in another blue house in the southern neighborhood of San Angel, a smaller structure connected by a walkway bridge to a white and pink house-studio once occupied by Rivera.\n\nThe couple lived there beginning in 1934. The buildings designed by painter and architect Juan O'Gorman are surrounded by tall cactuses and located a block from the San Angel Inn, a popular restaurant. Huge papier-mache skeleton and Judas figures populate Rivera's sunlight-flooded studio. Located at Avenida Altavista and Diego Rivera, Colonia San Angel Inn.\n\n___\n\nDOLORES OLMEDO MUSEUM\n\nThis museum is the former home of a famous patron of the couple. It houses one of the most important collections of work by both artists, including some two dozen by Kahlo. Among the best known are Kahlo's The Broken Column and Self Portrait with Small Monkey. (Note that this collection of Kahlo's work is in Italy through June.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe sprawling complex of stone buildings dating to the 16th century also displays works of other Mexican artists. Luminous green and blue peacocks and hairless xoloitzcuintle dogs roam the grounds. Located at Avenida Mexico 5843, Hacienda La Noria, Xochimilco.\n\n___\n\nDIEGO RIVERA MUSEO ANAHUACALLI\n\nThis museum is a pyramid built from black volcanic rock to house some 50,000 statues and other pre-Hispanic artworks collected by Rivera. Several of his sketches for murals are also displayed. Located at Museo 150, Coyoacan.\n\n___\n\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART\n\nSeveral of the couple's works are displayed here, including The Two Fridas, one of Kahlo's most famous paintings. Located at Reforma and Gandhi, Chapultepec Park.\n\nAD\n\n__\n\nDIEGO RIVERA MURAL MUSEUM\n\nThis small museum is home to Rivera's well-known mural Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park. Initially created for a restaurant in the Hotel Prado, the mural was moved to the new museum after the hotel was nearly destroyed in the deadly 1985 earthquake. Located at Balderas and Colon, Colonia Centro.\n\nAD\n\n___\n\nFINE ARTS PALACE\n\nThe Palacio de Bellas Artes houses several Rivera murals, including Man, Controller of the Universe, which features a workman surrounded by machinery. Several other important Rivera murals can be seen inside the palace, along with works by other muralists like David Alfaro Siqueiros. Located at Juarez and Eje Central, Centro Historico.\n\nAD\n\n___\n\nNATIONAL PALACE\n\nRivera painted a series of murals on the stairway walls and corridors of the Palacio Nacional, some depicting the conquest of Mexico by Spanish conquistadors including Hernan Cortes. Other murals feature pre-Hispanic cultures including the Zapotec and Mixtec civilizations. Located at Plaza de la Constitucion, Centro Historico.\n\n____\n\nSAN IDELFONSO COLLEGE\n\nRivera's mural The Creation can be seen at this museum and cultural center, which is regarded as the birthplace of the Mexican mural movement. Works by other muralists including Jose Clemente Orozco are also displayed. Located at Justo Sierra 16, Centro Historico.\n\nAD\n\n___\n\nDOLORES SUMP\n\nAD\n\nInside a monument to Mexico City's water system called the Carcamo de Dolores, Rivera painted a little-known mural, Water, the Source of Life, in a pool. The work was designed to be viewed underwater but the pool was drained when it became clear that the work would slowly be ruined. Rivera also designed a fountain featuring the Aztec rain god Tlaloc. Located at Rodolfo Neri Vela, Second Section, Chapultepec Park.\n\n___\n\nETCETERA\n\nA restaurant named for Kahlo, La Fonda de Frida, is located in the trendy Condesa neighborhood.\n\nAdditional Rivera murals can be seen at the capital's La Raza National Medical Center and on the outdoor walls of the Education Department's downtown headquarters.\n\nAD\n\nOn Saturdays and Sundays, the Blue House sells tickets for a bus that runs between that museum and the Diego Rivera Museo Anahuacalli. The bus leaves Casa Azul at 12:30 p.m., 2:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. Tickets are 150 pesos (about $8) and include admission to both museums.
Through all this I never got her into therapy because she was uninterested at first, then later it came across more like I was threatening her with it — my super-bad.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNow she is 20 and away at school. I worry that she didn't learn proper coping mechanisms, growing up in an unhealthy emotional environment. I even worry she may have borderline personality disorder. She is a great person, and I hate that she may end up unhappy because she blows up her relationships through unhealthy behavior. I love her and feel like I failed her.\n\nWould I be overstepping if I suggested therapy? And if not, how can I suggest it so it's clear it's coming from a place of love and not a criticism of her?\n\n— Worried\n\nWorried: Have you gone to therapy yourself? You are refreshingly open about your own contribution to the unhealthy home environment, so please don't take this as slapping you down for your honesty. It's just that you now need to have an adult relationship with your daughter, which is a big transition regardless, and on top of that she might need you to be healthy for both of you, and so you could benefit from some new skills or reinforcement of old ones.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's also a lot less high-horsey to suggest therapy to someone because you've been there yourself and benefited from it.\n\nRe: Worried: My daughter was 20 when she was hitting every textbook mark for BPD as she took off for a new school. I knew she was going to crash and burn, and I was worried she would be dangerously distressed but would not take advice or help from me.\n\nShe did get worse and had to take medical leave. I drove up to get her and didn't bring any of it up, no advice, no opinion. I think she really appreciated that. Moved in with roommates, went back to the local university, made good grades. Eventually she told me she had found mental health care/medication on her own. Today, at 31, she has a stable marriage, two kids and master's. And all I did was stay out of her way.\n\nAD\n\nChances are you won't make things better by telling your daughter what is probably obvious to her. Stay in touch — a LIGHT touch — and don't say anything she might twist around to take as faultfinding. Give her a chance to take care of herself; the very act of her doing so can go a long way toward getting better.\n\nIt's scary to hold back. But if she sees herself as an adult, you have to see her that way, too.\n\n— Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Thank you.
I actually had somebody say something to me a couple months ago, saying, 'I don't understand how you can complain that you were molested, because you participated in Sports Illustrated swimsuit,'  Raisman, 23, told People Now.\n\nIt doesn't matter. I just don't understand and it really makes me — it's devastating, she continued. I can't even tell you how many people have told me that when they were raped, they were asked, 'Well, what were you wearing?' It doesn't matter what you're wearing. It's never, ever okay.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRaisman was among more than 250 girls and women to accuse Nassar of sexually abusing them over at least two decades as a team physician for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. That group includes a number of other Olympic gymnasts, including McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles, and nearly 160 girls, women and parents joined Raisman in confronting Nassar as he was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison.\n\nJoining Raisman in Sports Illustrated's In Her Words feature for its swimsuit issue were models Paulina Porizkova, Robyn Lawley and Sailor Brinkley Cook. Women do not have to be modest to be respected — Live for you!, Raisman said in an Instagram post in which she shared one of her SI photos.\n\nBefore Nassar's sentencing hearings, two of which took place in Michigan courts and one of which ended with a federal judge giving him 60 years in prison for child pornography, Raisman had emerged as a vehement critic of USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee. She has frequently accused the organizations of not doing enough to protect vulnerable young athletes and of only caring about medals, reputation, and money.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn her lengthy statement last month in a Michigan courtroom, Raisman had some sharp words for USA Gymnastics and the USOC, but she trained most of her contempt on the 54-year-old Nassar, letting him know she was no longer a victim but a survivor.\n\nImagine feeling like you have no power and no voice. Well, you know what, Larry? I have both power and voice, and I am only beginning to just use them, she said (via NBC Sports). All these brave women have power, and we will use our voices to make sure you get what you deserve: a life of suffering spent replaying the words delivered by this powerful army of survivors.\n\nMore recently, as Raisman shared photos online from her SI sessions, she has mostly gotten replies praising her beauty and resolve. However, she has fielded some critical comments, including these:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou have to be modest and be clothed to be respected and taking your clothes off sends bad example for younger girls who looks up to you.\n\nSure, you have the choice to wear whatever you feel good in, but you can't then demand others to regard you highly, regardless of how you present yourself.\n\nYou're supposed to be a role-model for women. Strong women don't do this to their bodies.\n\nAny female, who has been sexual abuse[d]. Wouldn't pose nude and have the world to see.\n\nYou can be sexy, you can be wearing a sexy bikini, you can still be smart, powerful, have a voice, Raisman told People Now. You can still be advocating for change, you can still be a good person, you can still be respected.\n\nAnd I don't know why some people think that if a woman is sexy and wearing a sexy outfit, that it's okay to abuse her, she added. You should be able to walk down the street late at night in an alleyway by yourself wearing whatever you want, and not have any risk of being attacked.
I was shocked, he said in an interview. Everybody knows that Jilmar is a U.S. citizen and a Marines vet.\n\nBecause Kessler had worked on a case to secure temporary residency for Ramos-Gomez's mother, who is originally from Guatemala, under Citizenship and Immigration Services' parole in place stipulations for parents of service members, he said he had Ramos-Gomez's proof of citizenship readily available, including the veteran's birth certificate and Social Security information.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI immediately called ICE and shouted at them, he said. And they called me back and said, kind of, 'Oops, yeah, come and get him.' They didn't say, 'Our bad,' but kind of implied that.\n\nRamos-Gomez's story rocketed to national attention on Wednesday after the American Civil Liberties Union called for the county to investigate how an American citizen and decorated veteran was taken into ICE custody.\n\nRamos-Gomez enlisted in the Marines after high school, serving between 2011 and 2014 and earning a National Defense Service Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, an Afghanistan Campaign Medal, and a combat action ribbon, according to the ACLU. But he came back suffering from severe effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, the organization said.\n\nHis family reports that he is focused on returning for his marine brothers in Afghanistan, the ACLU said in a statement. He has episodes where he disappears and when he is found again, he often has no recollection of where he has been.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Nov. 21, Ramos-Gomez was arrested by police in Grand Rapids and held at the Kent County Correctional Facility on charges of arson and malicious destruction of property after police said he gained access to a secure area at a hospital, set a fire and pulled an alarm. It was not immediately clear whether he was a patient at the hospital.\n\nRamos-Gomez pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor trespassing charge for the incident and was ordered by a judge to be released on Dec. 14 — a Friday — pending his sentencing, which would probably amount to time served, according to Kessler. But when his mother arrived to pick him up around his 4 p.m. release, she was told he had been transferred to an immigration detention center that day in Calhoun County.\n\nAt that point, the Kent County Sheriff's Department should have immediately released Mr. Ramos-Gomez, the ACLU said. Instead, the Sheriff's Department worked with ICE agents to enable his transfer to an immigration detention center in Calhoun County to start the deportation process. … It is unclear how that was possible or why the jail believed it should hand Mr. Ramos-Gomez over to ICE, rather than release him as required by the court order.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRamos-Gomez was subject to an ICE detainer, the ACLU said.\n\nA group of retired state and federal judges have urged immigration officials to stop arresting people suspected of being undocumented at courthouses. (Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)\n\nHe remained at the facility until Dec. 17, when Kessler helped secure his release. Kessler said he believes that ICE had met with Ramos-Gomez previously at the Kent County jail in November.\n\nEmailed requests to ICE for more information on the case were returned with an automatic reply that said communications officials were not working during the government shutdown.\n\nThe agency told a local reporter that Ramos-Gomez repeatedly claimed to be a foreign citizen unlawfully present in the United States.\n\nKessler said that doesn't explain why they had Ramos-Gomez on their radar in the first place — or why immigration officials didn't verify whether he was a U.S. citizen on their own.\n\nAD\n\nI think it's racial stereotyping, Kessler said. And it should have been evident that he had pretty significant mental- health issues.\n\nAD\n\nThe Kent County Sheriff's Office said that it was reviewing the case but had found no indication that it involved policy violations on its part.\n\nThe role of the Kent County Sheriff's Office in this very unfortunate situation was that of a holding facility, it said in a statement. We do not possess the authority to verify the investigative justification for detaining a person.\n\nKessler said that Ramos-Gomez was not available to comment on the case, as he is currently receiving treatment at a mental-health facility.\n\nAD\n\nSome noncitizens have been allowed to serve in the U.S. military, only to be deported years later after running into legal troubles. Miguel Perez, an Army veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan and who said he suffered from PTSD, was deported to Mexico last year after a felony drug conviction, according to CNN.
He made the final trip alone after learning that eight men remained behind, having been unable to board helicopters in the previous round. If we left them for 10 minutes, Mr. Kettles later said, they'd be POWs or dead.\n\nMr. Kettles was credited with saving the lives of 44 men and received the Distinguished Service Cross, the military's second-highest award for valor, for his actions. Nearly half a century later, the award was upgraded to the Medal of Honor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresident Barack Obama, bestowing the medal on Mr. Kettles in 2016, recalled a comrade who called Mr. Kettles our John Wayne.\n\nWith all due respect to John Wayne, the president said, he couldn't do what Chuck Kettles did.\n\nMr. Kettles, who retired from the Army in 1978 at the rank of lieutenant colonel, was 89 when he died Jan. 21 at his home in Ypsilanti, Mich. The cause was lung cancer, said his son Mike Kettles.\n\nMr. Kettles insisted that the Medal of Honor belonged not to him, but to the other men who joined him in the mission that Monday in 1967. He was their flight commander, an aviation buff since his boyhood days in Michigan experimenting on a Ford Motor Co. flight simulator.\n\nAD\n\nHe volunteered for the first flight into the river valley during the morning of May 15, braving an enemy battalion that had the advantage of tunnels and bunkers, as well as a placement on a 1,500-foot hill. Approaching the landing zone, Obama said, Mr. Kettles and the other helicopter crews should have seen a stand of green trees; instead, they saw a solid wall of green enemy tracers coming right at them. Never, Obama added, had they experienced such heavy fire.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to an Army account of the events, some soldiers arriving with Mr. Kettles were killed even before they could disembark. Napalm dropped on the surrounding hills brought little reprieve from the enemy fire. For the return trip, Mr. Kettles refused to leave until the helicopters were loaded with as many wounded as they could carry.\n\nOn his second trip, his gunner suffered wounds that would result in the amputation of his leg. Mr. Kettles flew him and other wounded back to the base, even as their aircraft was leaking fuel.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the infantry battalion commander requested the evacuation of the 40 men remaining in the valley, Mr. Kettles volunteered to go back for them, as well as four more from his unit. He was leading a group of evacuation helicopters away and believed all men to be accounted for when he received a radio communication that eight had been unable to board. He left the formation, going back alone.\n\nAD\n\nAt that point, according to the Army account, the North Vietnamese concentrated all firepower on his lone aircraft. Yet the eight men managed to board his dangerously damaged helicopter. To pick up enough speed for liftoff, Mr. Kettles bounced the craft along the ground like a jack rabbit, he later recalled.\n\nThe drama of the scene, Obama said during his remarks at the award ceremony, resembled a bad 'Rambo' movie. Mr. Kettles, for his part, told USA Today that he walked away from the helicopter believing that's what war is.\n\nAD\n\nSo be it, he said. Let's go have dinner.\n\nThe Distinguished Service Cross was awarded to Mr. Kettles in 1968. Only decades later, when he recounted his experience to an oral historian with the Library of Congress's Veterans History Project, did momentum build for him to receive the Medal of Honor.\n\nAD\n\nFormer U.S. congressman John Dingell and his wife, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, as well as U.S. Sens. Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow, all Michigan Democrats, helped enact legislation allowing the medal to be awarded after the customary five-year time limit had elapsed.\n\nWithout his courageous actions and superior flying skills, the last group of soldiers and his crew would never have made it off the battlefield, reads the citation for the medal.\n\nAD\n\nAshton B. Carter, who served as defense secretary at the time of the award, made the matter more concrete.\n\nHow many Thanksgiving tables have had an extra chair through the years because of his actions? he said in remarks honoring Mr. Kettles. How many weddings, childbirths, and graduations were made possible because Major Kettles and his crew returned again and again to the hot landing zone in the Song Tra Cau riverbed?\n\nAD\n\nCharles Seymour Kettles was born in Ypsilanti on Jan. 9, 1930. His father served in the Canadian air force during World War I and in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.\n\nMr. Kettles was attending what is now Eastern Michigan University when he was drafted into the Army in 1951. He attended Officer Candidate School, received his commission in 1953 and served stints in postwar Korea, Japan and Thailand before returning to Michigan, where he operated a Ford car dealership and served in the Army Reserve.\n\nAD\n\nHe volunteered for active duty in 1963 and served two tours in Vietnam, the first in 1967 and the second in 1969 to 1970. His decorations included the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Bronze Star Medal and multiple awards of the Air Medal and the Army Commendation Medal.\n\nAD\n\nAfter his military retirement, Mr. Kettles received a bachelor's degree in business management in 1978 from Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio and a master's degree in industrial technology from Eastern Michigan University in 1979. He taught drafting and aviation technology at EMU, also working for Chrysler Pentastar Aviation.\n\nHis first marriage, to Ann Theresa Maida, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 41 years, the former Ann Cleary Heck of Ypsilanti; six children from his first marriage, Chris Kettles and Jeanna Kettles, both of San Antonio, Margaret Gupta of Reston, Va., Mike Kettles of Dallas, Marianne Kettles of Yellow Springs, Ohio, and Carolyn Kettles of Hono­lulu; three stepchildren, Catherine Nezwek of Rockford, Mich., Patrick Heck of Lachine, Mich., and Maria Heck of Saline, Mich.; a brother; and numerous grandchildren. His stepdaughter Theresa Heck Seibert died in 2018.\n\nAD\n\nWhen he received the Medal of Honor, Mr. Kettles sought to deflect attention from what others regarded as his heroism. The bottom line on the whole thing is simply that those 44 did get out of there and are not a statistic on the wall in D.C., he said, referring to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The rest of it is rather immaterial, frankly.
Mr. President, people are dead. The Capitol is ransacked. There are 12 dangerous days for our country left. Could you please step down and let our country heal? tweeted Russell Moore, head of the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. Southern Baptists, the country's largest Protestant denomination, overwhelmingly lean conservative and voted for Trump.\n\nJason Allen, president of Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary — one of the convention's six seminaries — tweeted that Wednesday's riot was not comparable to Black Lives Matter-related disobedience last year. This was instigated, he wrote, by the president and mingled nooses and Confederate flags with crosses. God help us.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut members of Trump's advisory group, who won unprecedented evangelical access to the White House, said they didn't regret putting a Christian imprimatur on his administration.\n\nRalph Reed, a longtime Christian conservative activist who was part of the loosely organized faith group, tweeted Wednesday that the Capitol scene does not represent our movement or the cause of Christ. Asked if the president was responsible, Reed said Trump's subsequent call for peace and civil order and a peaceful transition speak for themselves.\n\nInfluential Dallas mega-preacher Robert Jeffress, one of Trump's early prominent evangelical backers and a member of his advisory group, tweeted Wednesday that disobeying and assaulting police is a sin, whether it's done by Antifa or angry Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nIn an interview Thursday, he said leaders who support Trump have a responsibility to separate and condemn the nationalistic messages that are common at Trump events. Storming the Capitol and doing so with 'Jesus Saves' signs is blasphemy. It is despicable and has nothing to do with the gospel.\n\nAD\n\nBut when asked about Trump's role in the riot, Jeffress swerved: I think there is election fraud in every election. Was there enough in this election to sway it to Biden? I don't know enough. I try to stay with what I know about.\n\nDespite the events of Wednesday, both Jeffress and Reed were unequivocal in their praise of Trump's presidency overall. Jeffress said: No conservative president has done more than Donald Trump to champion Christian values. He has done more in the pro-life, pro-religious liberty, pro-Israel with moving the Embassy — no one has been more vocal. … I don't regret for one minute supporting him.\n\nAD\n\nDid LBJ's mistakes in Vietnam delegitimize the historic civil rights achievements he made with Martin Luther King? Should King have not worked with LBJ because he was a profane man and a philanderer? I think not. King spoke truth to power and he worked with unlikely allies to advance his cause. It led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, which changed race relations more than anything since Reconstruction, Reed said in an interview Thursday. Presidents, politics and even policies will come and go. They are transitory. But the values and achievements and aspirations of a social reform movement are lasting and enduring.\n\nAD\n\nTo the White evangelicals who advised Trump, their blessing of his presidency is just part of a decades-long movement to secure social conservatism's legal place and power. Along the way, in their mind, they have dealt with flawed politicians in a system they see as inherently amoral. A transactional approach that focuses on laws and policies — rather than a broad prophetic one that includes other crucial scriptural issues such as poverty, immigration and honesty — is justified, some of them said.\n\nMost conservative evangelicals, the things they care about [when it comes to the presidency] are all things that arose in the past 50 years out of the judiciary: the legalization of abortion, the redefinition of marriage, Jeffress said. And the common element of his successes has been the promise of a conservative judiciary. We believe policies influence the direction, both moral and spiritual, of the country, and he has succeeded in fulfilling those promises.\n\nAD\n\nJeffress and Reed don't think American Christianity paid a moral cost, even as other evangelical leaders — such as Russell Moore, who was not an adviser to Trump — spoke out in unusually forceful words. The vast majority of White evangelicals voted for Trump, though no prominent faith leaders — including members of Trump's advisory group — appeared at rallies in D.C. this week for the president.\n\nAD\n\nI don't think he's done anything to change the witness of Christians. Our message has remained the same. It's not about pro-life policies, it's about the gospel, Jeffress said.\n\nReed said the advisers' wins are moral — such as Trump's creation of a team at the Department of Health and Human Services that expanded conscience exemptions for religious conservatives opposed to supporting contraception or LGBTQ equality. The advisers hope the judges Trump selected will revisit or overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nAD\n\nShould the Supreme Court revisit Roe v. Wade, it will only be because of Trump's picks, and that will be of lasting historical significance and transcends personality and politics. I'm playing the long game, as any smart social reformer does, Reed said.\n\nThe past four years have also given White evangelicals — including segments unaccustomed to political power, such as charismatic and Pentecostal figures like Paula White — credibility by placing them up and down the administration ladder, from Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and former education secretary Betsy DeVos to sub-Cabinet appointees and senior staff.\n\nAD\n\nThat may be the most substantial gain, Reed said, for a group that has been working since Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson in the 1970s to attain cultural and political influence.\n\nAD\n\nReed said: Ironically, a president without a history of working with evangelicals ended up being the vehicle to both credential and empower more conservative Christian policymakers. Those individuals are now credentialed and will be ready to serve future Republican presidents.\n\nThe attempted insurrection at the Capitol seemed to give at least one Trump faith adviser real pause — or a kind of pause. Mike Evans, an author and Zionist activist, on Friday said evangelicals are in a Dietrich Bonhoeffer moment, referring to a German Lutheran pastor and Nazi critic who was executed in the 1940s for anti-Hitler activism. Evans said he wasn't equating Trump with Hitler, but rather was thinking of the German icon who said Christianity requires speaking truth to power.\n\nAD\n\nEvans cited Bonhoeffer's famed quote: Cheap grace is the grace we bestow on ourselves. Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession.\n\nAD\n\nEvans feels Trump changed the Middle East for the better by moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and moving along detentes between Israel and Gulf states. He voted for Trump in hopes the president would help get Roe v. Wade overturned in a second term. Working with him was absolutely worth it, he said.\n\nOver the years, he said, the moral dilemmas started to become a tsunami, with Wednesday as its peak. The Capitol riot, which Evans said Trump incited through spreading untruths about election cheating, is in another category because it struck at the heart of democracy.\n\nAD\n\nWe evangelicals are in a painful predicament. On the one hand, we think the world of the president and his policies because he's been astonishingly good to us. On the other hand, we have based our own whole life on truth and the word of God, Evans said. He gave us a seat at the table. He honored us like we've never been honored, so I have nothing but gratitude for that. But [Wednesday] has put us in a moral dilemma.\n\nAD\n\nJohnnie Moore, an author and religious freedom advocate who served as the unofficial spokesman for the advisers, said the events at the Capitol were inexcusable and in some cases criminal, and that he had told the White House of my dissatisfaction with the President's role in it.\n\nHowever, Moore wrote in an email to The Post, his appreciation for Trump and his administration's achievements isn't changed.\n\nAD\n\nI think of unprecedented efforts to promote religious freedom abroad, the sanctioning of countless human rights abusers in countries like China and Iran, the First Step Act here and the Abraham Accords in the Middle East, he said.\n\nEngaging with presidents is a mixed bag, Moore wrote, but it's a responsibility — a moral duty.
Throughout his 23-year career, spent mostly with the Braves in Milwaukee and then Atlanta, Mr. Aaron was admired as a model of steady excellence on the diamond, even though he lacked the swaggering charisma of Ruth or the exuberant flair of his contemporaries Willie Mays and Roberto Clemente.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Aaron broke Ruth's record of 714 home runs in 1974 before retiring two years later with 755, which remained one of the most hallowed numbers in all of sports for more than 30 years.\n\nMr. Aaron, who was sometimes called Henry but was generally known to baseball fans as Hank or Hammerin' Hank for his long-ball power, grew up in Alabama and never forgot the jeers he received while playing in the South during the days of segregation.\n\nOn the field, few players in history were as skilled at every dimension of the game. Mr. Aaron won three Gold Gloves for his defensive play in the outfield and was deceptively fast, finishing second in stolen bases in 1963 to speedster Maury Wills.\n\nBut it was his quick, compact right-handed swing that made Mr. Aaron a superstar as he compiled one superior year after another. He led the Milwaukee Braves to the World Series championship in 1957, when he was 23, and remained a potent force at the plate into his 40s.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThrowing a fastball by Henry Aaron, an opposing pitcher, Curt Simmons, once quipped, is like trying to sneak the sun past a rooster.\n\nIn 2007, Mr. Aaron's home run record was surpassed by the San Francisco Giants' Barry Bonds, who ended his career with 762. Because of Bonds's alleged use of steroids and performance-enhancing drugs, many baseball fans and writers continued to consider Mr. Aaron the true home run champion and an unassailable symbol of fair play and integrity.\n\nI guess you can call him the people's home run king, Hall of Fame player Reggie Jackson told Sports Illustrated in 2007.\n\nMr. Aaron entered the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982, the first year he was eligible, and had a career batting average of .305 — higher than those of Mays and another notable contemporary, Mickey Mantle.\n\nA quiet force for civil rights\n\nHis lifelong inspiration, Mr. Aaron said, was Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers infielder who broke major league baseball's color barrier in 1947. When Robinson played in an exhibition game in Mr. Aaron's hometown of Mobile, Ala., it was an unforgettable moment for the 14-year-old future star. Throughout his own career, Mr. Aaron recalled the forbearance and strength Robinson showed just stepping on the field.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJackie Robinson had to be bigger than life, Mr. Aaron wrote decades later in Time. He had to be bigger than the Brooklyn teammates who got up a petition to keep him off the ballclub, bigger than the pitchers who threw at him or the base runners who dug their spikes into his shin, bigger than the bench jockeys who hollered for him to carry their bags and shine their shoes, bigger than the so-called fans who mocked him with mops on their heads and wrote him death threats.\n\nRobinson had played in the 1940s in the old Negro Leagues, a professional circuit of all-Black teams, before joining the Dodgers. Mr. Aaron played for one month in 1952 with the Indianapolis Clowns, a touring team of the Negro American League, before signing with the Braves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen Mr. Aaron began playing in the minor leagues, it marked the first time that he had shared the field with White players. When the Braves assigned him to a team in Jacksonville, Fla., in the South Atlantic (or Sally) League, he heard steady taunts from White spectators throughout the South.\n\nAfter he reached the major leagues in Milwaukee in 1954, Mr. Aaron quietly allied himself with the burgeoning civil rights movement. He campaigned for then-Sen. John F. Kennedy (D-Mass.) in Milwaukee in 1960 and was credited with helping the Democratic candidate win the Wisconsin presidential primary.\n\nIn 1966, at the height of the civil rights movement, the Braves moved to Atlanta, worrying Mr. Aaron. I have lived in the South, and I don't want to live there again, he said. We can go anywhere in Milwaukee. I don't know what would happen in Atlanta.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe was the biggest star on a team representing the heart of the Old South and became as recognizable in Atlanta as another of the city's residents, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nHenry had never considered himself as important a historical figure as Jackie Robinson, sports journalist Howard Bryant wrote in The Last Hero, a 2010 biography of Mr. Aaron, and yet by twice integrating the South — first in the Sally League and later as the first Black star on the first major league team in the South (during the apex of the civil rights movement, no less) — his road in many ways was no less lonely, and in other ways far more difficult.\n\n'It's gone! It's 715!'\n\nAfter hitting 40 home runs in 1973, Mr. Aaron had a career total of 713, one shy of Ruth's record. Each home run seemed to come at a deep personal cost.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSince 1972, the U.S. Postal Service noted at the time, Mr. Aaron had received more mail than anyone who was not a political figure. Much of it was filled with racist comments and vile language.\n\nSome of the contents were released to the public. If you come close to Babe Ruth's 714 homers, one letter said, I have a contract out on you. Over 700, and you can consider yourself punctured with a .22 shell. Another read, My gun is watching your every black move.\n\nA security team accompanied Mr. Aaron at all times, his daughter received police protection while attending college, and the FBI looked into some of the more extreme threats. Mr. Aaron kept the letters as a reminder of his lonely, dangerous pursuit.\n\nAD\n\nThe Ruth chase should have been the greatest period of my life, and it was the worst, Mr. Aaron wrote in his 1991 autobiography, I Had a Hammer. I couldn't believe there was so much hatred in people. It's something I'm still trying to get over, and maybe I never will.\n\nHenry Louis Hank Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player who broke Babe Ruth's all-time home run record, died Jan. 22 at 86. (Reuters)\n\nAt the beginning of the 1974 season, the Braves wanted to hold Mr. Aaron out of the opening three-game series in Cincinnati to allow him to break the record in Atlanta. Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn stepped in and ruled that every team should put its best players on the field and strongly suggested that the Braves comply.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Aaron wasted no time in tying the record, slugging his 714th home run in his first at-bat on Opening Day, off the Reds' Jack Billingham. He sat out the second game of the series and was held hitless in the third.\n\nAD\n\nThe Braves then went home to face the Los Angeles Dodgers, setting an attendance record of 53,775 for the first game of the series April 8, 1974.\n\nAfter drawing a walk and scoring a run in the second inning, Mr. Aaron came to bat in the fourth inning with no outs and a runner on first. The Braves trailed 3-1.\n\nThe Dodgers' pitcher was left-hander Al Downing, who wore the same uniform number as Mr. Aaron, 44. On a 1-0 count, Downing threw a slider that caught too much of the plate, and Mr. Aaron unloaded a blast that carried over the head of Dodgers left fielder Bill Buckner and into the Braves' bullpen, where it was caught by relief pitcher Tom House.\n\nFireworks exploded overhead as Mr. Aaron circled the bases, joined halfway through by a pair of 17-year-olds who hopped the fence. Braves radio announcer Milo Hamilton made the famous call: It's gone! It's 715! There's a new home run champion of all time, and it's Henry Aaron!\n\nIn the visiting radio booth, Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully put the home run in context: What a marvelous moment for baseball. What a marvelous moment for Atlanta and the state of Georgia. What a marvelous moment for the country and the world. A Black man is getting a standing ovation in the Deep South for breaking a record of an all-time baseball idol. And it is a great moment for all of us and particularly for Henry Aaron.\n\nAmong those who congratulated Mr. Aaron in a ceremony on the field after the home run was Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter, the future president. Kuhn, the baseball commissioner, was not present. Mr. Aaron never forgot the slight.\n\nShattering records\n\nHenry Louis Aaron was born in Mobile on Feb. 5, 1934, the third of eight children. His father was a laborer on the city's docks.\n\nAD\n\nAs a child, Mr. Aaron sharpened his hitting by swinging at bottle caps with a broomstick. For years he batted cross-handed, with his left hand above his right on the bat, before correcting his hand position.\n\nBy 15, he was attending school sporadically but playing baseball regularly on semiprofessional teams. He was primarily an infielder until shortly before his major league debut in Milwaukee in 1954.\n\nHe had an uneasy relationship with some of the Braves' veteran players, including pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette, and kept largely to himself off the field. But Mr. Aaron's extraordinary hitting helped make the Braves one of the strongest teams in the National League in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1957, he led the National League with 44 home runs and 132 runs batted in and was named the league's Most Valuable Player for the only time in his career. The Braves went on to win the World Series over the New York Yankees in seven games.\n\nThe two teams met again in 1958, with the Yankees capturing the title in seven games. Mr. Aaron played 18 more seasons without reaching the World Series again.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Aaron was often compared with Mays, his fellow Alabamian. Mays, who spent his career in New York and San Francisco, may have reached more spectacular heights during his career, and his outgoing say-hey flair tended to overshadow Mr. Aaron's more understated style of play. But by the time Mr. Aaron retired in 1976, he had bettered Mays in home runs, RBI, batting average and runs scored.\n\nAt one time or another, Mr. Aaron led the National League in virtually every hitting category. He won two batting titles, including a career best of .355 in 1959; he led the league in home runs and RBI four times each; runs scored, three times; and slugging percentage, four times.\n\nIn addition to his 755 home runs, Mr. Aaron was baseball's career leader in RBI (2,297), total bases (6,856) and extra-base hits (1,477). His 3,771 hits are the third most after Pete Rose and Ty Cobb, and he was named to the all-star team every year between 1955 and 1975.\n\nMr. Aaron's No. 44 was retired by the Braves and by the Milwaukee Brewers, with whom he played his final two seasons before retiring in 1976. In 1999, baseball introduced an award named in his honor, given to the top offensive player in each league.\n\nHis first marriage, to Barbara Lucas, ended in divorce. In 1973, he married Billye Williams. Besides his wife, survivors include four children from his first marriage; a stepdaughter, whom he adopted; and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nThree decades after he retired, the spotlight found Mr. Aaron again when Bonds, the San Francisco slugger, was approaching his record of 755 home runs. When Bonds hit his 756th homer against the Washington Nationals' Mike Bacsik on Aug. 7, 2007, a congratulatory video message from Mr. Aaron was played on the scoreboard in San Francisco.\n\nPrivately, according to Bryant's biography, Mr. Aaron was personally and permanently offended by Barry Bonds and his widely rumored use of performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nUntil then, Mr. Aaron had kept a low profile as one of baseball's elder statesmen. He held front-office jobs with the Braves and for a time was baseball's only Black executive. He also had various business interests, including auto dealerships and restaurants.\n\nMr. Aaron maintained a stealthy, behind-the-scenes connection to politics and civil rights. Bill Clinton said that he carried Georgia in the 1992 presidential campaign in part because of an Atlanta rally that Mr. Aaron helped organize.\n\nIn 2001, Clinton presented him with the Presidential Citizens Medal for exemplary service to the nation. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from George W. Bush the next year.\n\nMr. Aaron understood that his long march to 755 home runs, leading from Alabama to Wisconsin to Georgia, had a resonance with the civil rights leaders he admired so much. It was about more than gaining respect on the baseball field; it was about earning respect as a man.
My daughter is not running [for president]. I have told Inday not to run because I pity her that she will have to go through what I experienced, Duterte, 75, said at a public event Thursday, using a nickname for Sara, the Philippine Daily Inquirer reported.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is not for a woman, he said of the presidency, despite the fact that two of his predecessors were women. You know, the emotional setup of a woman and a man is totally different. It will drive you nuts. This is the sad story.\n\nThe remarks were in line with previous comments that Duterte has levied against women, whom he once referred to publicly as bitches. He has also made frequent jokes about rape — once appearing to admit to committing sexual assault — and suggested that soldiers target the sexual organs of female rebels, a tactic he said would render them useless as women.\n\nPresidential spokesmen have consistently played down his misogynistic remarks as harmless attempts to lighten the mood during national tragedies or serious political events.\n\nAD\n\nDuterte's vice president, Leni Robredo, is a woman. She belongs to a rival political party and has emerged as a critic of Duterte, who has targeted her in public, referring once to the length of her skirt at a commemoration for the victims of a deadly typhoon.\n\nAD\n\nMa'am Leni wore a dress that was shorter than usual. The protocol officers probably noticed I was always behind her, he said, according to the Philippine news site, Rappler. I told [Finance Secretary] Sonny Dominguez, 'You're too far, come closer. Check out her knees.' \n\nDuterte-Carpio, who has served as first lady because of her father's annulled marriage, told Reuters on Thursday that she informed her father she did not intend to run for president.\n\nAD\n\nI am not being coy nor am I doing a 'last-minute,'  Duterte-Carpio said in a text message, Reuters reported.\n\nStill, on Friday, Duterte's spokesman said in a radio interview that the president's daughter is the most qualified contender for the office, the Inquirer reported.
Adapted from an online discussion.\n\nDear Carolyn: I am ending my marriage after confirming my suspicions that my husband has been unfaithful at various points throughout our marriage.\n\nWe have two small children and this will be hard, perhaps terribly so, but the thought of staying in the marriage for longer — and then perhaps ending it when they're older and more aware — seems like the wrong thing to do.\n\nThe thing is, I am not depressed or unhappy. I had suspected the infidelity for longer than my husband knows, and I feel secure in the parts of my life that will continue to be good after the marriage ends. I am not planning to bad-mouth him or give anyone more than the need-to-know minimum about why we are splitting up.\n\nBut from even the two friends I've confided in about my plans, I am getting a whiff of, You just married him to have the two babies, and now you don't want him anymore. They are reading my calm feelings as meaning I won't grieve for our marriage. This is making me dread having to share the news with other, even less charitable people, especially my husband's family, whom I want to keep in the kids' lives.\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/The Washington Post)\n\nI should probably be taking this one step at a time, and worrying mostly about the logistics for now. But this is bothering me a lot. What do you think?\n\nSeattle\n\nSeattle: I think your friends aren't your friends. Wow.\n\nI hope you called them on the whiff so they could either confirm or correct the record: I'm hearing that you think I married him only because I wanted a sperm donor. Is that what you're saying?\n\nThis is important for two reasons: 1. If they meant it, and if there's absolutely no truth to what they're saying, and if they are accusing you of this character lapse without any basis in fact, then you want to hear them own it so you know not to count on them as your friends anymore; 2. Getting a whiff means they didn't say it, you inferred it, which means you could be completely wrong. If they absolutely don't think this about you, then you want to give them a chance to clear up the misunderstanding.\n\nI hope you're being honest with your closest friends about what really happened; part of being close is giving people a chance to understand what you're going through. I realize that opens the possibility of a leak, but that's all part of knowing who of your friends is solid. Pick the ones you feel you can trust, and then trust them. (The others are free to wonder what happened.) That's all you owe your husband as far as confidentiality. In fact, it's generous.\n\nAs for your husband's family, if you get a nasty response from them to your decision to end the marriage, keep it simple: I'm sorry to hear you think so little of me.\n\nFor what it's worth, your husband will get a second chance at showing some integrity here. Don't count on it, of course, but he does owe it to you to defend you against any accusers: She did nothing wrong — this one's completely on me.
But the news was tempered by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) announcing he would allow the 50-50 Senate to organize after it became clear Democrats didn't have the votes to eliminate the filibuster, which acts as a 60-vote supermajority for most legislation. Liberal activists have been aggressively pushing for its removal.\n\nAD\n\nJoe Manchin III (W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) — publicly reiterated their previously stated opposition to eliminating the filibuster, our Mike DeBonis McConnell on Monday said he was prepared to move forward on a [Senate power-sharing] deal 'modeled on that [2001] precedent' after two Democratic senators —(W.Va.) and(Ariz.) — publicly reiterated their previously stated opposition to eliminating the filibuster, our Mike DeBonis reports.\n\nBut President Biden shouldn't break out the champagne over a new era of bipartisan unity. Portman's decision not to seek reelection in 2022 means there will be fewer Hill Republicans willing to partner with the White House in the future. Sens. Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) and Richard Burr (N.C.) — one of a handful of Republican senators who actually talk to Democrats — are also leaving in two years.\n\nAD\n\nAnd given former president Donald Trump's grip on Republicans, it could be a staunch ally with the lead to replace Portman: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom before leaving.\n\nI'm not sure there's anybody that would beat him, said Ken Blackwell , a former Ohio secretary of state and longtime Portman ally Jim is well positioned if in fact he's ready to take that leap;, a former Ohio secretary of state and longtime Portman ally told the New York Times.\n\nThe Portman news hits really hard — his statement didn't say things are hopeless but he clearly doesn't have a lot of optimism going forward about what the Senate will look like through 2028, a senior House GOP aide told Power Up.\n\nThe source put Jordan in the camp of Republicans playing to the base, trying to generate outrage and increase and enhance your own profile going forward rather than best serving the nation.\n\nIt's a blow when you're losing serious people in government who want to focus on policy rather than running to a cable news hit and appealing to the base, the source added, noting that the upper chamber has become more like the House in recent years. It's telling about the direction of where the Republican Party might be going.\n\nMost recently, Portman was part of the bipartisan coalition that crafted and called on President Trump to sign a coronavirus relief bill. But even as far back as 2013, Portman became the first sitting Republican senator to publicly support same-sex marriage after his son told him he was gay.\n\nAD\n\nT he idea there are any 'moderates' on either side in politics in 2021 is a fallacy, a GOP strategist told Power Up. I think you'll be seeing fewer people who actually want to get things done involved in federal politics.\n\nThey're definitely a dying breed, a former senior GOP Senate aide told us of centrists. T he era of moderate senators representing solid red or solid blue states is probably nearing its end … The average senator today is more selfish, more blindly partisan, more small-minded, less intelligent, less independent and frankly less patriotic. \n\nPolitics right now is just poisonous. So it's understandable truly good people like Portman want to bounce. It's like a stationary bicycle. You're pushing and sweating and fighting but you're not moving. That's exhausting . So what's the point? It's sad for the country, really, the aide added.\n\nIt's a big blow to serious-minded people, a GOP Senate aide added of Portman's retirement.\n\nThis isn't just a theoretical debate. Biden's ambitious first-term agenda — which includes a $1.9 coronavirus relief bill — is at stake.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki has said Biden does not plan to change his views on Senate rules (that the 60-vote supermajority should stay).\n\nBlowing up the filibuster would be a disaster for the country, former Ohio governor Josh Kasich (R) told CNN's Chris Cuomo last night. Now it forces the parties to work together.\n\nBiden may yet have to turn to a partisan procedure known as budget reconciliation if he can't get Republican support (which looks unlikely) for his relief package. That would allow him to ram it through with 50 votes.\n\nAD\n\nWe cannot let all our hard work go to waste because of this racist, outdated, and undemocratic procedure, activist Liz Haskell of Yuma County Indivisible, a group that helped elect Sinema in 2018, told DeBonis. If Sen. Sinema wants to deliver for the people who pulled her across the finish line, she's got to be a strong advocate for getting rid of the filibuster in the Senate.\n\nThe Trump factor: From his perch in Palm Beach, Trump is working to oust perceived political enemies by supporting pro-Trump primary challengers to Republicans who he feels have betrayed him. With Portman's departure, Ohio is now seen as a major new opportunity for the president, according to the New York Times's Maggie Haberman and Reid Epstein.\n\nAD\n\nThat opening, along with another statewide contest next year in which Gov. Mike DeWine is expected to face at least one Trump-aligned primary challenger, is likely to make Ohio a central battleground for control of the Republican Party, and an inviting one for Mr. Trump, who held on to Ohio in the election while losing three other Northern battleground states, the Times reports.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the number three House Republican, is also on Trump's personal hit list, per Haberman and Epstein, after she became the only member of House GOP leadership to vote to impeach the former president.\n\nI t's unclear whether Mr. Trump will target her seat, or simply her leadership post in the House, but advisers said they anticipated that he would take opportunities to damage her, per Haberman and Epstein.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Cheney was censured over the weekend by the Wyoming Republican Party for supporting Trump's impeachment by Republicans in Wyoming's Carbon County . She's gotten only lukewarm suppor t fromHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\nTrump ally Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) is traveling to the Wyoming Capitol this week to accelerate her exit from Congress and talk about his vision for the GOP, the Casper Star Tribune's Nick Reynold's reports.\n\nThe Republican Party right now is in a bit of an identity crisis within the Beltway in Washington, D.C., Gaetz told Reynolds. The establishment is trying to reconstitute a lot of the power they lost in the party during the Trump era, and those of us who've embraced the energetic populism of President Trump want to be able to maintain that going forward. In Wyoming, you have the clearest example of an establishment figure who didn't like the president, who opposed many of his policies, and is doing all she can to seize power in Washington.\n\nOfficial Trump litmus tests: Plans to provide the ideological ammunition to sustain Trump's political movement after his departure from the White House are in the making by former Trump administration officials, report Axios's Hans Nichols and Lachlan Markay report:\n\nAD\n\nRuss Vought, who led [Trump's] Office of Management and Budget, plans to announce two pro-Trump organizations Tuesday, aiming to provide the ideological ammunition to sustain Trump's political movement after his departure from the White House, per Nichols and Markay.  … Vought is among those who are staying close to Trump. He's working to ensure that cultural issues that Trump ran on, from transgender rights to critical race theory, remain front and center in the Republican Party and coming elections.\n\nThe investigations\n\nIMPEACHMENT PART DEUX: The House last night formally delivered an article of impeachment charging Trump with inciting the deadly insurrection at the Capitol, as Democrats prepared to use his own words as evidence against him in his Senate trial next month, Seung Min Kim, Tom Hamburger, Josh Dawsey and Karoun Demirjian report.\n\nThe nine House managers walked the article to the Senate last night, setting in motion Trump's second impeachment trial scheduled to begin February 9th.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and McConnell must now agree to the structure of the trial, including length of arguments, motions to call witnesses, and a possible motion to dismiss the trial at its outset, Politico's Andrew Desiderio and Marianne Levine report.\n\nO ffering his most extensive comments since taking office, Biden told CNN , I think it has to happen.\n\nPresiding over the trial will be Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D-Vt .), president pro tempore of the Senate, a constitutional role given to the longest-serving lawmaker in the majority party.\n\nWhen asked if he was concerned about remaining impartial, Leahy told reporters: I have presided over hundreds of hours in my time in the Senate. I don't think anybody has ever suggested I was anything but impartial in those hundreds of hours, NPR's Susan Davis and Nina Totenberg repor t.\n\nConvicting Trump will require 17 GOP senators. A survey by the New York Times found that 27 Republican senators expressed opposition to charging Trump or otherwise holding him accountable by impeachment. Sixteen Republicans indicated they were undecided, and seven had no response.\n\nAD\n\nKey quote: There are only a handful of Republicans and shrinking who will vote against him, said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who has been advising Trump on the upcoming proceedings.\n\nImpeachment manager Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) reads the article of impeachment on Jan. 25 charging former president Donald Trump with inciting the Jan. 6 riots. (The Washington Post)\n\nJustice is served: The Justice Department's inspector general announced its office is opening an investigation into whether any current or former department official tried to improperly alter the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election, Matt Zapotosky and Robert Barnes report.\n\nAD\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of the revelation Trump considered replacing acting attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, with a different department lawyer, Jeffrey Bossert Clark, who was more amenable to wielding the department's power to help keep Trump in office.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, Trump only aborted the plan after DOJ officials threatened a mass resignation.\n\nThe transition\n\nCONFIRMATION NATION: Confirmations to Biden's Cabinet continue on the Hill as Janet Yellen was approved as the first female secretary of the Treasury Department, Jeff Stein and Rachel Siegel report.\n\nThe final vote was 84 to 15, with McConnell (R-Ky.) among those supporting Yellen.\n\nYellen, 74, will now play a key role advancing Biden's economic agenda, starting with an ambitious $1.9 trillion economic relief package that is already facing resistance from GOP lawmakers, the Wall Street Journal's Kate Davidson reports.\n\nNotable: Retired Gen. Lloyd Austin officially took the helm of the Department of Defense, with Vice President Harris (D-Calif.) swearing him in.\n\nQueued up: Other Biden picks awaiting confirmation include Antony Blinken, nominee for secretary of state, who could get a Senate vote this afternoon, the Hill's Jordain Carney reports.\n\nAD\n\nAlso hoping for a speedy confirmation this week:\n\nAlejandro Mayorkas , nominee for secretary of homeland security\n\nPete Buttigieg, nominee for secretary of transportation\n\nMerrick Garland, nominee for attorney general\n\nXavier Becerra, nominee for secretary of health and human services\n\nBiden plans to nominate California Labor Secretary Julie Su for the No. 2 position at the Labor Department, Bloomberg Law's Ben Penn reports.\n\nAt the White House\n\nTHE PANDEMIC PRESIDENT: Biden said he believes the United States will have made significant progress toward achieving herd immunity by summer and reiterated his administration is aiming to have 100 million vaccinations administered within the first 100 days of his presidency, Felicia Sonmez reports.\n\nAD\n\nKey quote: He added Americans who want to receive a vaccination should be able to do so by this spring, but cautioned it's going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we've ever tried in this country.\n\nNew strain in town: Biden's remarks come as the first case of the highly transmissible P. 1 variant, which is spreading at alarming rates in Brazil, was reported in Minnesota, Joel Achenbach reports.\n\nAD\n\nInsurance in uncertain times: Biden is scheduled to take executive actions this week to reopen federal marketplaces selling Affordable Care Act health plans and to lower barriers to joining Medicaid, Amy Goldstein reports.\n\nAD\n\nThe orders will be Biden's first steps to helping Americans gain health insurance, a prominent campaign goal that has assumed escalating significance as the pandemic has dramatized the need for affordable health care — and deprived millions of Americans coverage as they have lost jobs in the economic fallout, Amy reports.\n\nStamping out racism in his ranks: Biden is expected to disavow racism and xenophobia toward Asian Americans, specifically targeting anti-Asian animus connected to the pandemic today, CBS News's Weijia Jiang, Bo Erickson, Arden Farhi and Gabby Ake report.\n\nThe directives, which may take the form of an executive order or a presidential memo, are expected to be part of a package of executive actions focusing on 'equity,' according to two people familiar with the plans. The other administrative actions are expected to focus on Tribal governments, fair housing, and private prisons. The Biden administration has told outside groups it is also preparing measures on voting rights.\n\nAt face value: The Biden administration will resume the process to replace President Andrew Jackson's face on the $20 bill with famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman, Jacob Bogage reports.\n\nViral

I take issue with something I feel I can't talk to my husband about without him getting defensive and upset.\n\nWe are very good to his brother's family, attending the kids' games, events and birthday parties.\n\nI gave up going on vacation this year so his brother and kids could go with my husband instead of me.\n\nWe give gifts to the kids, and for Chet and his wife's birthdays. (I'm lucky to get a text message on my birthday.)\n\nAD\n\nFor Christmas, we dropped more than $200 on gifts for them.\n\nMy husband and I received nothing from them.\n\nAD\n\nI give so much throughout the year! Do we just continue to be neglected because we don't have kids?\n\nI felt like I was kicked in the gut leaving the Christmas 'gift exchange' with nothing.\n\nAm I being too sensitive, or are my feelings warranted? What is the best way to communicate this to my husband without him feeling like I'm attacking his brother/family?\n\nFlying Solo\n\nFlying Solo: It's tough to face this sort of very obvious imbalance. Of course you notice, and of course you feel bad about it!\n\nMy question is — given the imbalance that seems to exist here, why do you sign up for more? You need to take better care of yourself. You should not surrender your own vacation for this other family. Your husband is a twin, but he is married to you.\n\nAD\n\nYou should continue to give to the children. Dive in and love these children abundantly.\n\nAD\n\nIf the adults don't participate in a gift exchange (many adults don't), then you shouldn't, either. That way, you can enjoy your generosity toward the children without feeling sorry for yourself.\n\nDear Amy: I am a 30-year-old artist. I have been painting for 15 years. To avoid falling into the 'starving artist' category, I work full time in nursing to cover rent and afford art supplies.\n\nTwo years ago, I was picked up by a gallery and also got accepted into shows, festivals, etc., which was great, but got more expensive (shipping, booth fees, gallery taking a percentage of earnings, etc.). I picked up a steady stream of clients requesting commissions and was fortunate to land sales each month.\n\nAD\n\nFamily and in-laws started asking me how my business was doing. After telling them about artwork I sold, suddenly several family members wanted me to make free paintings for them.\n\nAD\n\nEvery time we get in touch, they will ask (or tease) me about the status of their paintings. I am conflicted because I feel obligated to make free art for them since they are family, but sometimes I still struggle to afford supplies, not to mention my rent.\n\nThey don't know how busy I am with other commissions, which are really time intensive. Do I tell my family to hold off indefinitely for paintings until I can take care of clients and rent first? Is there a polite way to do this?\n\nAD\n\nL, in Colorado\n\nL: If you want to create art to give to family members as gifts, then definitely do that, but that should be up to you.\n\nIf family members approach you to basically commission paintings, you could offer them a friends and family discount, but you must be paid for your work. If you don't put a value on it, no one else will.\n\nAD\n\nIt is not necessary to be polite — you must only be clear: I'm thrilled that you like my work. Here's a link for some paintings I currently have for sale. If you like one, let me know. I'd be happy to offer you a discount.\n\nDear Amy: In your response to the question from Worried, you noted your alarm that she was involved in a controlling and abusive marriage.\n\nAmen to you! I was especially impressed that you suggested that Worried should not have children. Children will trap her in the relationship. I know, because my own abusive marriage became a nightmare. I was fortunate to be able to escape, and to save my kids.\n\nEscaped\n\nEscaped: That called for some real bravery on your part. Good for you.
It's the journey, not the destination. And it's an even better journey if you can spend it hearing what Pauline Kael thinks of E.T.\n\nWhen we were first married, every night my wife and I sat up in bed while I read a three-volume biography of a 19th-century theologian. This may not sound like the most promising start to a marriage, but we've been together more than 30 years, so you can keep your judgments to yourself, thank you very much.\n\nI've been recalling those early days because Thursday is World Read Aloud Day. That's an annual event founded by LitWorld to celebrate literacy as a human right. This year, LitWorld and its co-sponsor, Scholastic, are offering a variety of online resources for teachers and parents, coordinating read-aloud events in schools and communities, and promoting the 20th anniversary of the Harry Potter series, which magically transformed the world of children's publishing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut please don't imagine that reading aloud is only for children. Indeed, one of the ways we can encourage young people to keep reading is to keep reading to each other. Yes, my favorite parenting memories involve sharing Winnie the Pooh with my daughters, but I have equally sweet recollections of reading aloud to my wife in the years leading up to the kids' arrival — and in the years since they left home.\n\nI'm willing to concede that my enthusiasm may not always have been entirely welcome. Once when I was preparing to teach a course on literary theory, I woke up my wife in the middle of the night and read her a particularly powerful chapter of Mary Daly's Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism. The irony of that moment is not lost on me now. Looking back, I know that if feminism means anything, it means the right to say, Not tonight, dear. Let's read it tomorrow.\n\nBut that, I hope, was a rare misstep, and most of our reading together has transpired in the car, which provides the perfect combination of confinement, quietude and idleness. (Some people tell me they can't read in a moving vehicle. I don't know what I would do under such an affliction. Jump out, I suppose.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the decades, my wife and I have together enjoyed dozens of books over thousands of miles. Certain trips — even the highways themselves — feel indelibly stamped with particular novels. We'll always associate Northern California with the adventures of Theodore Decker in The Goldfinch , a book long enough for even the most ambitious road trip.\n\nLast year, while driving to New York, my wife listened to me read J. Courtney Sullivan's beautiful novel Saints for All Occasions. Again and again, we'd pull off the road for a bathroom break but then sit stock-still in the McDonald's parking lot to finish a chapter.\n\nAdmittedly, there have been a few books I haven't read as well as my wife deserves. Less, by Andrew Sean Greer, sent me into such fits of laughter that she had to keep asking, What? What are you saying?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd on a trip to New Hampshire, there were times when I couldn't see clearly enough through my watering eyes to read Jim Shepard's Holocaust novel, The Book of Aron. My voice would break, and we'd just ride along for miles in silence.\n\nBut that was a special kind of communion, too.\n\nMany more of us used to know what a pleasure reading aloud could be. Last year, Abigail Williams, an Oxford University professor, published a fascinating work of history called The Social Life of Books. Williams describes the thrilling transformation in 18th-century England when literacy rates rose, publishing blossomed, and people gathered to hear books and articles read to them.\n\nAD\n\nIt's hard to imagine a return to such an idyllic pastime in an era when we can't log off social media long enough to speak to each other. But let this year's World Read Aloud Day inspire you to give it a try. Next time you're in the car together, turn off the radio, put away the iPhone and tell your driver, I'm going to read you this book.\n\nIt could be the start of something wonderful.\n\nRon Charles is the editor of Book World and host of TotallyHipVideoBookReview.com.
The description of Emma Woodhouse listed above is not the way that the character — played with effortless appeal by Anya Taylor-Joy — sees herself. Rather, Emma calls herself improper, inconsiderate, indelicate, irrational, unfeeling, vain and arrogant. Of course, it takes most of the whole movie before Emma, whose tendency for borderline meddlesome matchmaking is the engine that fuels this tale, comes to that realization.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe truth about our heroine lies somewhere in between. Yes, Emma may be handsome and rich, but it's her cleverness that's up for debate. And she may be all of those bad things too, but only momentarily. We forgive Emma, who is young, and her flaws. And, frankly, her heart is so in the right place — or close enough to it — that she deserves to be forgiven for them.\n\nThe film is bookended by two weddings. (I'll give you three guesses as to whose marriage closes out this story, and the first two don't count.) Encouraged by her success in fixing up her former governess (Gemma Whelan) with a neighbor (Rupert Graves), Emma sets about to engineer another love match for her friend Harriet (Mia Goth). Of course, Emma is single, too — and something of a catch — which only complicates things.\n\nThere are, at various points, four potential candidates in play: the handsome tenant farmer Robert Martin (Connor Swindells); the airhead local vicar Philip Elton (Josh O'Connor); the foppish ne'er-do-well Frank Churchill (Callum Turner); and the handsome, levelheaded, sigh-worthy George Knightley (Johnny Flynn). Each of these men becomes, in one way or another, entangled with the affections of either Harriet or Emma — and sometimes both — thanks in no small part to Harriet's own naivete and in large part to Emma's bad misreading of the all the romantic signs.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt's pretty obvious to us who deserves whom, just not to anyone on-screen.\n\nAnd that screen is filled with some pretty entertaining characters, including Emma's hypochondriacal father. Bill Nighy, who communicates what Mr. Woodhouse is feeling — mostly annoyance and a chill in the air — with little beyond eye rolls and tiny snorts, heads up a colorful supporting cast of British character actors that also features the wonderful Miranda Hart (Spy). To the title role, Taylor-Joy brings a spirited, slightly otherworldly charisma: part wide-eyed, 19th-century Valley Girl, and part gimlet-eyed Cupid on a mission.\n\nOf course, there is never really any doubt that all who are seeking love — or at least marriage — will find it here, in this slight but satisfying romantic roundelay, whose delights are not limited to empire-waist dresses, elaborate hats and scenes of the English countryside that appear to be straight out of an Adam Buck painting. Everyone has their level, says Mr. Elton, alluding to the subtleties of class, wealth, upbringing, intellect, taste, beauty and manners that go into picking a mate. An idiot deserves an idiot, in other words, and a heroine her hero.\n\nLove may or may not make the world go round, but Austen's trick — repeated here by de Wilde — is in making us believe, for a minute, that matters of the heart matter more than anything else on Earth.
I know he appeases the young students who have no money. Well, somebody has to pay for everything he wants, Forleo said Sunday night after watching Biden speak for 90 minutes in a high school gymnasium here. She plans to attend rallies this afternoon for Klobuchar in Exeter and Warren in Portsmouth.\n\nAD\n\nThe Democrat from Lyndeborough, who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary, remains frustrated that Sanders didn't do more to help her that fall. If Bernie leads the ticket, I don't think the American people are going to be ready for that. I don't think he can beat Donald Trump, she said. And if Donald Trump thought he could, Trump would be all over him like he is with Joe Biden.\n\nAD\n\nThe splintering among moderates like Forleo is an important part of the explanation for why Sanders, the independent senator from neighboring Vermont, is the favorite to win Tuesday's contest. This is my sixth day on the ground here, and I've watched all the Democratic contenders interact with voters. Based on dozens of interviews and public polling, there's a very fluid and incredibly tight three-way battle for third place.\n\nButtigieg has surged since the Iowa caucuses a week ago into a solid second-place position, prompting attacks from all directions that appear to have slowed his momentum a bit.\n\nAD\n\nBiden has been tanking in the polls since finishing fourth in Iowa, prompting many people who had planned to vote for him because they perceived him as the most electable option to check out others. Klobuchar has been rising, drawing her biggest crowds of the campaign this weekend and reporting her best fundraising days yet after Friday night's debate.\n\nWarren, who represents neighboring Massachusetts and led in polls of this state last summer, seems to be losing altitude here on the ground, even though she finished ahead of Klobuchar in Iowa. About a third of the people at her rally at a middle school in Concord on Sunday afternoon streamed out before she finished talking.\n\nA brew of other factors is also working to Sanders's advantage on the eve of the first-in-the-nation primary. Most Democrats don't want Sanders to be their nominee, but they cannot agree on who to rally behind instead. Despite rumbling concerns of the establishment, there's no organized Stop Sanders or Never Bernie movement. In fact, Democrats who don't support Sanders still hold largely favorable views of him. Unlike in Iowa, where he faced nearly a million dollars in attack ads, no one is on the air here with anti-Sanders commercials.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSanders expanded his lead Sunday night in the final day of the Boston Globe-WBZ-Suffolk tracking poll. He garnered 27 percent among likely Democratic presidential primary voters, up from 24 to 25 percent in the previous six polls. Buttigieg, who briefly eclipsed Sanders in the poll one day last week, got 19 percent in the latest survey, followed by Klobuchar at 14 percent. Biden and Warren tied at 12 points. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 percent.\n\nYou should take all the polling with a grain of salt because this contest is so in flux, but two other surveys published Sunday also showcased Sanders's relative strength among likely voters. A University of New Hampshire poll for CNN put Sanders at 28 percent, with Buttigieg at 21 percent, Biden at 12 percent and everyone else in single digits. Buttigieg led among voters who identify themselves as moderate or conservative, while Sanders led by more than 25 points among self-identified liberals. Asked whom they expect to win, regardless of whom they're supporting, 57 percent in the CNN picked Sanders. Interestingly, Sanders also took a seven-point lead over Biden on the question of which candidate has the best chance to defeat Trump in November, a reversal since Iowa.\n\nA YouGov poll for CBS pegged Sanders at 29 percent, up two points compared to last month, with Buttigieg at 25 percent. Most of Buttigieg's double-digit gains in that survey come at the expense of Biden, who fell to 12 percent, trailing Warren. Only 39 percent of likely voters in the CBS poll said they've definitely made their final decision, and only six in 10 said they're enthusiastic about the candidate they're leaning toward. Sanders's supporters were the most enthusiastic.\n\nThey compete for different kinds of voters, but Sanders has been attacking Buttigieg partly out of a desire to prevent him from coalescing moderate support and thereby overtaking him in this must-win state.\n\nSanders could benefit from a similar dynamic to what allowed Trump to amass an unsurpassable delegate led during the 2016 Republican primaries, even as most GOP voters opposed him. The odds, at least initially, are that all the top contenders will stay in the race beyond New Hampshire, continuing to divide up support going into the next two early states. Mike Bloomberg is waiting in the wings, spending literally hundreds of millions of dollars in states that vote on March 3, also known as Super Tuesday, when a third of all pledged delegates to the convention are awarded.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFour years ago, Sanders struggled with nonwhite voters and hit a wall because of Latinos in Nevada and African Americans in South Carolina, the next two states to vote. The senator has worked hard to make inroads with communities of color ever since, and Biden's fade could boost Sanders in the Palmetto State by dividing up the black vote.\n\nThe Sanders campaign, which has invested heavily in organization, said that volunteers knocked on more than 150,000 doors on Saturday alone. Sanders's field program is focused more on mobilization of known supporters than persuasion of the undecided, a contrast to the late-surging campaigns like Klobuchar's and Buttigieg's who are still trying to identify potential backers. The campaign said 1,981 people attended Sanders's rally last night in Keene. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) will join Sanders tonight for a massive concert the campaign is putting on in Durham, home to the University of New Hampshire, featuring The Strokes and Sunflower Bean.\n\nThe Sanders campaign slogan is Us, not me. But his stump speech increasingly sounds like Us versus Them. And the Them is the party establishment. He's added a little more pitchfork to his populist tone in the recent days. We're taking on not only the whole Republican political establishment and Trump, Sanders said this weekend. We're taking on the Democratic establishment. His supporters from four years ago remain angry at the system and feel let down by both parties. The undercurrent of anti-elite frustration that helped propel Trump still exists in 2020, despite strong top-line economic indicators.\n\nNick Landry, 27 of Somersworth, said he has tried hard to keep an open mind since supporting Sanders four years ago. He considered Warren very strongly. He heard out entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who was intriguing, but he found his plan to give everyone a thousand bucks a month kind of gimmicky. After watching the Democratic debate on Friday night, he decided he'll probably back Sanders again.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe lost in 2016 by trying to play to the middle. As a liberal, I believe we should swing for the fences. And if we're not going to win, let's at least go down pushing for progressive ideals, Landry said at a Sanders rally in the packed-to-capacity Opera House in Rochester. Biden represents the establishment, and I think Pete and Amy are part of the establishment.\n\nThe data analyst for an insurance company supports Medicare-for-all and badly wants stricter gun laws so that his kids will be safer at school. Landry said he totally understands why some Democrats fixate on electability, but he said Trump and Senate Republicans have shown themselves to be such cartoonish villains that he doesn't believe the opposition should pander to win back the kinds of voters who supported Barack Obama in 2012 but Trump in 2016. They're keeping kids in cages, Landry said. I don't want to necessarily be shaping our political platform around trying to appeal to people who aren't bothered by that.\n\nMeanwhile, moderate voters express growing concern about what they see as a collective action problem. Siobhan Brace, 62, was the first person to ask Biden a question during his town hall meeting on Sunday night. I love you a lot, but I am undecided, she said. I thought everybody did a great job in the debate, but I am afraid of that one of you cannot beat [Trump], but I think all of you could. Is there some way that you guys could put a dream team together and present that to the American people? And just say, like, Amy is going to be vice president and we'll put Andrew [Yang] in charge of Commerce?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe crowd cheered. Biden laughed. There's two ways to be on the dream team: run it or be picked, he replied. I promise that you my administration will look like the country. It will be made up of women and blacks and browns and people who represent the diversity of the country. There are at least six women I can think of at the top of my head who I wouldn't have a moment's hesitation in asking to be my vice president. I can say the same thing for at least four leading African Americans that I know.\n\nReflecting the degree to which voters still believe he's in contention, Biden was asked again half an hour later who he might pick for vice president. Biden said he didn't want to be presumptuous, but then he hinted that he might select Buttigieg. The 77-year-old said he could promise that he would not pick anyone who is older than him to be his No. 2, which would take out the 78-year-old Sanders. Biden added that he cannot imagine picking someone to be vice president who supports Medicare-for-all, a knock against Sanders. But there are at least four people running that are, in fact, simpatico with where I am, starting with Indiana, he said, a reference to Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind.\n\nBrace, who asked the first question to Biden, said in an interview afterward that she's terrified Trump will win. Bernie's too way over there, she said, pointing with her left arm to the other side of the room. The Republicans that are on the fence are going to come with a moderate. We need to get some of the Republicans who do know that Trump is crazy to come over to our side, and they're only going to do it with a moderate. So we've got to find a moderate.\n\nIndependents could have outsized influence in tomorrow's open Democratic primary because there's not a competitive race on the Republican side. Though Trump is flying up here to hold a rally in Manchester tonight, he faces no competitive GOP primary. Polls show the incumbent president getting more than 90 percent against former Massachusetts governor William Weld. New Hampshire has 416,000 unaffiliated voters, who get to pick which primary to participate in.\n\nSanders defeated Clinton by 22 points in New Hampshire four years ago, garnering 60 percent, or 152,000 votes. Polls and interviews make clear that most of the people who backed him as the anti-Clinton candidate four years ago will not support him again this time. That said, I encountered a few people at the Sanders rally in Rochester who backed Clinton in the primary four years ago and are giving Sanders a close look.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe need grass-roots change, and it may be more than some of the traditional establishment is willing to go, unfortunately, said Colleen Hartnett, 57, of Windham, a software engineer who remains undecided. I think I'm leaning more toward the progressive side rather than the moderate part of the party at this point. … Because Republicans have gone so far, the contrast is just striking. I feel like the pendulum can't just go for a moderate swing.\n\nSanders knows he needs to win this neighboring state, which is why he doesn't hesitate to confidently predict victory. There's no apparent effort to manage expectations. I am absolutely confident that, with the volunteer support we have, we are going to win in New Hampshire, Sanders said Saturday night in Manchester. He said his 2016 victory in New Hampshire was critical to winning 22 more states in the months that followed, and he said winning the primary helped put some of his ideas that were called radical four years ago into the mainstream. We need to complete the revolution we started four years ago in New Hampshire, he said.\n\nWarren losing altitude in New Hampshire also likely works to Sanders's advantage. She drew only a modest crowd Sunday afternoon to a middle school near the state capitol. Our democracy hangs in the balance, and it is up to you, Massachusetts, to decide what to do, she said at the end of her speech, after more than a hundred people had left, many to go watch other candidates.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNew Hampshire, people in the audience yelled.\n\nAnd to the people of New Hampshire, she added, correcting herself with a laugh.\n\nThe crowd applauded. Thank you, she said, appreciatively. It is a hard time.\n\nWarren brushed aside a question afterward about the people who left, calling it an enthusiastic crowd. It looks like it is going to be a long battle to the nomination, she told reporters. There are 55 more states and territories after this. … I'm in it for the long haul.\n\nOther candidates who struggle to get covered are trying more colorfully to contrast themselves with Sanders. James Carville, the Democratic strategist who helped elect Bill Clinton in 1992, stumped late Saturday afternoon for Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) in Manchester. He emphasized that Sanders would be a problem for down-ballot Democrats, especially in competitive Senate and House races. They'll run away from Bernie Sanders like the devil running away from holy water, Carville said. If Michael Bennet is the nominee, Mitch McConnell's going to look like he crapped a pineapple.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden lobbed attacks Feb. 9 at former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who returned snipes. (The Washington Post)\n\nMORE ON 2020:\n\nAD\n\n-- The Iowa Democratic Party announced last night that Buttigieg would probably receive 14 delegates to the national presidential nominating convention from the chaotic caucuses, while Sanders would receive 12. But the number may not be final. Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: Late Sunday, Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said the campaign will seek a partial recanvass — a process he said would put the senator from Vermont on top in the delegate count. Sanders won the popular vote, netting support from about 6,000 more caucus-goers on the first expression of preferences, known as an alignment, than Buttigieg. But the delegate allocation is based on projected support for each candidate at the state convention, known as state delegate equivalents or SDEs, which is traditionally the metric used to declare a winner of the caucuses. … Weaver said the campaign believes seven SDEs are at issue in the precincts they have identified, which is more than the 2.77 that separate the two Democrats. … Chris Meagher, a spokesman for Buttigieg, said, 'We're focused on New Hampshire.'\n\nThe Iowa party also said that eight delegates would go to [Warren] and six would go to [Biden]. … The update from the state party reflected its review of 55 precincts, making up about 3 percent of the total 1,765. But the review involved only rectifying discrepancies between numbers reported on math worksheets completed by caucus leaders and publicly reported data. That left untouched errors tainting the actual worksheets, where volunteer leaders had entered complex calculations based on multiple counts of caucus-night preferences — and, in some cases, made mistakes. An attorney for the state party said officials were not authorized to alter the worksheets because they represented legal documents, according to an email Troy Price, the state party chairman, sent to members of the state party's central committee.\n\n-- Democratic leaders have edged toward the brink of open war with one another in recent days, Michael Scherer and Sean Sullivan report: Advisers to the two men most responsible for overseeing the disastrous Iowa caucuses, national chairman Tom Perez and Iowa chairman Troy Price, have been privately deflecting blame onto each other, as the relationship between the two has become tense, advisers say. Price has refused to join Perez in calling for a recanvass of voting records in the state, after finding out about Perez's demand from a deputy a few minutes before it was tweeted … Price allies blame Perez for the botched caucus count, pointing to new party rules he implemented around transparency and accessibility that increased the burdens on the state. …\n\nAt the start of the campaign, Sanders advisers repeatedly praised Perez … But that tone shifted in recent weeks, as Sanders surrogates, supporters and staff have criticized Perez for changing the debate rules and for the appointees he has placed on the various convention committees … Weaver has tried to strike a less aggressive tone, saying that the Sanders campaign still believes Perez has tried to be evenhanded. 'Of course, given our experience, we are ever vigilant,' he said.\n\n-- Democrats fear a repeat of the Iowa chaos in Nevada. While some top party leaders call for the end of caucuses, top Nevada Democratic Party officials are trying to assure nervous voters that their fears are overblown. This includes former Senate majority leader Harry Reid, who has been working to soothe candidate concerns about potential caucus drama. (Holly Bailey)\n\n-- Sanders and Biden continued sparring about the role each played 18 years ago during the run-up to the Iraq War. Michael Kranish reports: In explaining their actions to voters, however, they have both left out key details that present a more complicated picture of how they handled what both now say is one of the worst foreign policy mistakes in American history. Biden not only played a key role in helping [George W.] Bush win passage of the measure, but he also privately assured the president that 'I think you're doing it the exact right way,' according to notes taken at a meeting by White House press secretary Ari Fleischer. In that meeting, Bush told Biden that though he would attempt to use diplomacy, he would use the authority to invade if he believed it was necessary, according to Fleischer's notes. Sanders, meanwhile, agreed at the time with much of what Bush said about Iraq, including the view that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\n\n-- In New Hampshire's poorest city, there are few indications of Trump's blue-collar boom. Griff Witte reports: The unemployment rate, which was touching double digits 10 years ago as Berlin weathered the collapse of its signature mill, is down to 3 percent. The local paper is stuffed with help-wanted ads. Property values are climbing as newcomers move in. But Berlin — which thrived through most of the 20th century before the bottom fell out in the early 2000s — hardly feels like a city on the mend. More than a decade into the longest economic expansion America has ever known, residents say just about the only jobs available pay minimum wage with no benefits as out-of-pocket health-care costs surge. The last elementary school shuttered last year, capping a long-term exodus of young families. The once-bustling downtown is so scarred by closures, demolitions and fires that it looks, according to the city's mayor, 'like a bomb was dropped in the middle of it.'\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nThe 2020 Academy Awards belonged to Parasite. The South Korean film won four Oscars, including the biggest prize: Best picture. (The Washington Post)\n\nABOUT LAST NIGHT:\n\n-- Parasite became the first foreign-language film to win the Oscar for best picture during last night's Academy Awards. Emily Yahr, Sonia Rao, Travis Andrews, Bethonie Butler and Elahe Izadi report: In addition to making history in the night's most prestigious category, the darkly comedic thriller is the first South Korean film to ever be nominated for an Oscar. Filmmaker Bong Joon-ho also won in the international feature and original screenplay categories, as well as best director -- triumphing over '1917' front-runner Sam Mendes, whose film didn't wind up with quite as many awards as expected. (The World War I epic, made to look like it was filmed in one shot, did land cinematographer Roger Deakins his second win.)\n\nAll four acting trophies wound up with the artists who dominated this awards season: Joaquin Phoenix and Renée Zellweger won for Joker and Judy, and supporting actors Brad Pitt and Laura Dern for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Marriage Story. In an emotional roller coaster of a speech, Phoenix called for unity. I've been thinking a lot about some of the distressing issues that we are facing collectively, and I think at times we feel or we're made to feel that we champion different causes, he said. But for me, I see commonality. I think whether we're talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we're talking about the right against injustice.\n\n-- Other notable winners included:\n\nElton John and Bernie Taupin won best original song for (I'm Gonna) Love Me Again, from Rocketman.\n\nAmerican Factory, produced by Barack and Michelle Obama, won best documentary feature.\n\nTaika Waititi won best adapted screenplay for Jojo Rabbit, becoming the first indigenous director to ever win an Oscar.\n\nFind a complete list here.\n\n-- Commentary from The Post's cultural critics:\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: I'm ready to drink tonight, said Bong, speaking English for the first time onstage that night, as he accepted the Oscar for best international feature. Later, after winning the night's top award, Bong didn't take the microphone, allowing Miky Lee, the mogul who built South Korea's first movie multiplex, to speak instead.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT REVEALS HIS PRIORITIES:\n\n-- The White House will propose a $4.8 trillion budget that would fail to eliminate the federal deficit over the next 10 years. Instead, White House officials plan to say their budget proposal would close the deficit by 2035, Jeff Stein and Erica Werner report. During President Trump's first year in office, his advisers said their budget plan would eliminate the deficit by around 2028. This new budget will mark the third consecutive time that they abandon that 10-year goal and instead suggest a 15-year target. This new trend shows how little progress the White House is making in dealing with ballooning government debt, something GOP party leaders had made a top goal during the Obama administration.\n\nTrump's first budget projected the deficit in 2021 would be $456 billion. Instead, it is projected to be more than double that amount. … As a presidential candidate, Trump said he would eliminate not just the annual federal deficit but all debt held by the United States after eight years in office. … The federal debt has already grown by about $3 trillion under Trump. … The $4.8 trillion budget for 2021 would represent a $700 billion surge over levels from 2018. … It would also propose extending tax cuts for families and individuals that are set to expire at the end of 2025. Budget experts have projected that extending those tax cuts would reduce revenue by roughly $1 trillion. …\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the budget aims to cut spending on safety-net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps … The budget is expected to propose 5 percent net cuts in domestic discretionary spending, which is expected to include cutting the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the part of CDC funding that deals with fighting the coronavirus will remain unchanged. …\n\nAt the same time, the budget will maintain Pentagon spending at around its current level, or boost it if increases in a so-called overseas contingency account are included. As in past budgets, this one will cut heavily into programs targeting low-income communities, including slashing community development block grants and home heating assistance. The Education Department will be cut by $6 billion … The proposed budgets for nondefense domestic agencies, programs that deal with housing, environmental protection and agriculture, will fall well below spending caps that lawmakers and the administration already agreed to in a bipartisan budget deal for 2021. That all but ensures the budget will face bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill.\n\n-- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said the Justice Department is vetting information that Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani delivered regarding Hunter Biden's work on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Paul Kane reports: Graham, citing an early-morning conversation with Attorney General William P. Barr, said [Giuliani] is giving his information to national security experts and that he would back off his own plans to use the Senate Judiciary Committee as a vehicle to investigate the Biden family. 'The Department of Justice is receiving information coming out of the Ukraine from Rudy to see — he told me that they have created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it's verified,' [Graham] said on CBS's 'Face the Nation.' He warned that Giuliani might be getting bad information from his trips to Ukraine as part of a disinformation campaign by Russian security experts, citing their effort to disrupt the 2016 presidential campaign. …\n\nGraham said he called Barr and Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on Sunday morning after hearing about Giuliani's interview Saturday night on Fox News's 'Watters' World.' During the interview, the former New York City mayor made various claims about the information he has cobbled together from Ukrainian sources and said Graham should use his committee to investigate the Bidens. … 'I have what I used to call when I was U.S. attorney, a smoking gun,' Giuliani said. … Then, just as 'Face the Nation' started Sunday morning, Trump sent out a tweet urging Graham to launch an undefined investigations. … Graham appeared to back away from his assertions in recent weeks that he would lead a probe into [Joe Biden's] time overseeing Ukraine policy while his son served on the board of Burisma.\n\n-- The chairman of the group that runs the Conservative Political Action Conference warned that he would be afraid for the physical safety of Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) were he to attend the annual convention. Matt Schlapp ripped the 2012 GOP nominee, who announced he was dropping out of the 2008 Republican nominating contest at CPAC. (HuffPost)\n\n-- While Romney is being vilified by Trump and his allies inside the Beltway, many of his conservative constituents back home in Utah still have his back. From NBC News: [We] spoke with dozens of voters in Utah in the days immediately following the Senate's vote to acquit the president. Most identified themselves as Republicans who had supported Romney in 2018 and said that regardless of their opinion of the president, Romney's decision to go against his party was one that they understood and respected for its honesty. Many said they would not hold it against the first-term senator when he faces re-election in 2024. … 'I feel like [Romney] stands up and says, 'This is what I think' and you have the right to accept or reject that,' said Meralee Stallings, 62, who works for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 'I think we are getting away from that, too. It's like if you don't agree with my opinion, then you're wrong.' Stallings, who voted third-party for president in 2016 and supported Romney in 2018, said she is leaning toward voting for Romney again. 'I don't agree with everything that Romney has done,' she said, 'but if you're going to be true to what you think is correct, then that's fine with me.'\n\n-- Sacred Native American burial sites are being blown up for Trump's border wall, an Arizona congressman and other advocates allege. Paulina Firozi reports: The Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is an internationally recognized biosphere reserve … It includes about 330,000 acres of designated wilderness and is home to ancestral grounds sacred to the Tohono O'odham Nation, one of at least a dozen Native American groups that claim connections to grounds within the monument. Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva (D-Ariz.), whose district includes the reservation, said crews this week began blasting through parts of Monument Hill, which includes a burial site for the Tohono O'odham Nation … Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, visited the location ahead of the construction and described the site in a video posted to social media. Monument Hill, where he said explosions are now occurring, is a site where members of the Tohono O'odham Nation have buried members of opposing tribes.\n\n-- Trump used a Philadelphia girl's story to attack public schools and promote the school-choice movement. But the girl was already studying at one of the city's most desired charters. Janiyah Davis is a student at a recently opened charter school so popular that it received 6,500 applications for 100 seats. How she landed in the audience during Trump's State of the Union – and with a scholarship to attend private school financed by Betsy DeVos – remains a bit of a mystery even to her mother, who told the Philadelphia Inquirer that she had no idea Janiyah would be mentioned during the speech.\n\n-- A gunman wounded two NYPD officers in separate attacks that police believe were attempted assassinations. Katie Mettler reports: One officer was shot in the neck and chin Saturday night when the suspected gunman fired several rounds into a marked police van and then fled, authorities said. At 7 a.m. Sunday morning, police say, the same man walked into the Bronx precinct headquarters and opened fire again, striking a lieutenant in the arm and surrendering after his 9mm handgun ran out of bullets. The man, who is in police custody but has not been identified, has a 'lengthy violent criminal history,' Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news conference on Sunday. … [Trump] weighed in, using the shootings to admonish [Mayor Bill] de Blasio and [Gov. Andrew] Cuomo, who are both Democrats and critics of the president. 'I grew up in New York City and, over many years, got to watch how GREAT NYC's 'Finest' are,' Trump tweeted. 'Now, because of weak leadership at Governor & Mayor, stand away (water thrown at them) regulations, and lack of support, our wonderful NYC police are under assault. Stop this now!'\n\n-- A man was arrested in Florida on charges of driving a van into a tent full of Trump supporters. Katie Mettler and Hannah Knowles report: The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office has arrested Gregory William Loel Timm, 27, on two counts of aggravated assault on a person older than 65 and one count each of criminal mischief and driving with a suspended license. No one was hurt in the incident. … As word spread and Republican Party leaders and elected officials weighed in, Trump issued a warning on Twitter. 'Be careful tough guys who you play with!' he wrote alongside a statement from GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. She called the incident an 'unprovoked, senseless' attack and said 'these disgusting acts will only make us work harder to win in November.'\n\nCruise ships and their passengers are being quarantined and denied entry into ports of call over fears of spreading the coronavirus further. (The Washington Post)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- The number of people infected and killed by the coronavirus continues to climb worldwide, but the vast majority are still concentrated in the original outbreak zone of Wuhan. Gerry Shih, Alex Horton and Marisa Iati report: The global death toll from the novel coronavirus reached more than 900 … after previously surpassing the 774 fatalities attributed to the outbreak of the SARS coronavirus in 2002 and 2003. Among the dead was the first American, a 60-year-old woman who died Thursday in Wuhan. … An international team lead by the World Health Organization left for China to conduct an investigation of the coronavirus. … As infections overwhelm the afflicted province, the rest of China might be seeing the effects of strict quarantine measures, Chinese health officials said Sunday. In all parts of China outside Hubei, the daily number of new infections dropped from nearly 900 on Feb. 3 to 509 on Saturday … [WHO] officials also said they had seen the number of new cases taper in recent days. … The Chinese Ambassador to the United States pushed back Sunday on the suggestion by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) that the coronavirus may have come from China's biological weapons program. Appearing on CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, Ambassador Cui Tiankai acknowledged that much about the virus remains unknown, but he said spreading unsubstantiated theories could cause panic and amplify racial discrimination.\n\n-- Infections aboard a quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan have surged, bringing to 136 the number of people who are known to have been infected on the vessel.

Shibani Mahtani reports: With coronavirus fears gripping the city, a rumor of impending shortages circulating on social media had apparently spooked consumers, and pack after pack of toilet paper was flying off the shelves. Shoppers could barely carry the number of rolls they were snatching. By evening, not a single roll was left. The panic stretched through the weekend. No more green tea-scented toilet rolls, no more quilted plush rolls, no more jumbo rolls promising 'clean comfort' and an inviting picture of a fat Labrador puppy. Such scenes have played out citywide, documented in videos showcasing the frenzy. … Some are resorting to dramatic and costly measures to procure necessities. … As one Bloomberg columnist put it: The semiautonomous financial hub, once known as a bastion of global trade and capitalism, is now showing signs of a failed state.\n\n-- A Chinese lawyer and journalist whose Wuhan dispatches offered a chilling glimpse inside the coronavirus hot spot has been missing since Thursday, his relatives said. Derek Hawkins reports: Chen Qiushi slipped into the city of 11 million on Jan. 24, just after a citywide lockdown took effect, and spent days interviewing people about the outbreak and filming what he saw. On Thursday, after several of his reports circulated around the world, Chen stopped responding to calls and messages, setting off an online campaign to track him down. The 34-year-old knew he would be a likely target for law enforcement, so he gave select friends access to his accounts, instructing them to change the passwords if they went more than 12 hours without hearing from him. According to Chen's friends, authorities told his family over the weekend that he had been forcibly quarantined in an undisclosed location. Xu Xiaodong, a well-known mixed martial artist and friend of Chen's, said in a YouTube live stream that Qingdao public security officers and state security officers told his parents he had been 'detained in the name of quarantine.'\n\n-- Afghanistan claims the Islamic State was obliterated. But fighters who managed to get away could stage a resurgence. Susannah George, Siobhán O'Grady and Sharif Hassan report: It has now become clear that military operations also scattered many fighters they aimed to defeat: The group's senior leadership fled further into the Spin Ghar mountains, crossing into Pakistan or pushing north into Konar province's more rugged terrain. Others simply went into hiding. Afghan officials estimate that hundreds of Islamic State fighters continue to operate across the country, raising the dangerous potential for a resurgence. Interviews with Afghan and U.S. officials and seven self-described Islamic State members now in Afghan custody paint a picture of a group that has a history of persevering despite territorial and leadership losses, thanks in part to a sophisticated recruitment system and the use of extreme violence to control civilian populations.\n\n-- Two U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers were killed and six U.S. troops were wounded after a gunman opened fire in an eastern Afghanistan compound this weekend. Some Afghan officials said the attacker was a member of the Afghan security forces.

She will step aside as party leader when a successor is found. Kramp-Karrenbauer, also known by her initials AKK, announced the news in a meeting with party officials on Monday morning … A protege of Merkel, AKK beat out party rivals to take over the reins of the conservative Christian Democrats in late 2018.

From Reuters: President Nayib Bukele and a group of soldiers armed with automatic weapons briefly occupied El Salvador's Congress on Sunday, stepping up a pressure campaign to force lawmakers to back a crime-fighting plan. Watched by soldiers in full battle uniform, Bukele, 38, sat in the seat reserved for the president of Congress and cupped his hands together to pray, he said, for patience with lawmakers, few of whom turned up at the special session.

(The Washington Post)\n\nSaturday Night Live spoofed the debate in its cold open:
But the Redskins, Allen said, have  obviously proposed, and we want a long-term marriage with him, and we've had some very good discussions.\n\nAD\n\nThis mirrors things Allen has said elsewhere this offseason, including in a recent interview with MMQB's Albert Breer.\n\nAD\n\nHe has gotten better the last three years, and we see him getting better in the future, and that's why we do want to sign him long-term, Allen said. We like his role as our quarterback and our leader, we just have to work that out. We talked last year; we didn't get it done long-term. We have him signed for this year, and an option for next year. But our goal is to get a long-term deal.\n\nHere's the thing: The Redskins no doubt have 100 percent consensus on signing Cousins to a long-term deal at $1 million a season. They probably don't have long-term consensus on signing Cousins to a long-term deal at $45 million a season. In between those numbers? Well, if the front office had a consensus on signing a long-term deal at Cousins's asking price, a deal would already be done. Which means one of two things: Either there's at least one person in Redskins Park who is not consenting to pay what it would take to end this thing on March 31, or Cousins wouldn't sign a long-term deal at any price.\n\nIn other words, saying the team is 100 percent committed to signing Cousins is as meaningless as saying The Washington Post's sports blogging pod has a 100 percent consensus that it would eat food cooked by Aaron Silverman. Consensus is swell, but all that really matters is the price.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis is all possibly fine. Allen said such deals take some time, and that they usually get done around the July deadline. He's been publicly confident about this for weeks. In early February, remember, he said that a long term deal isn't as complicated as everyone wants to make it, and that we'll get together with his agent and I'm sure we'll come to an agreement.\n\nStill, there is some risk in these displays of public confidence. Because if the July deadline rolls around and the sides don't reach a deal, the credibility of the team president takes a hit. He said the team was 100 percent committed, after all. He said he was sure a deal would get done.\n\nCousins, on the other hand, has been frustratingly noncommittal, but that also means he can't possibly have been misleading us.\n\nAD\n\nI don't know what's going to happen, Cousins said at one point. I really don't. I will just take it as it comes, have an open mind and try not to be surprised by anything. In this league, you never know. I'll just be open to however it plays out.\n\nAD\n\nWe had all assumed, in any case, that this would be the last offseason for us to be consumed by these debates over a Cousins deal. Allen has recently suggested we might be wrong, and he did so again in the 980 appearance, when asked if the team might again use the franchise or transition tag on Cousins if no long-term deal is reached this offseason.\n\nThe system allows for us to do that, Allen said. Really we have him under contract for this year and an option on next year. If that happens, we'll get ready for training camp, and prepare, and compete our asses off in 2017, and we'll have plenty of opportunity to talk about the future. But before we start speculating about August, let's worry about April.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nHost Kevin Sheehan then suggested that this would be a worst-case scenario for the team, handing more than $72 million to Cousins for three years of play under tags without getting any of the benefits of a long-term deal.
I have come to see that Jim just isn't cut out for commitment; I should have known, being his third wife, but live and learn, right? He's single again after yet another failed marriage and I never remarried.\n\nA few months ago, I took Jim out to dinner to thank him for throwing some business my way — we're in the same field — and one thing led to another. Long story short, we have developed a very casual relationship — for lack of a better term, friends with benefits.\n\nAD\n\nI'd like to keep this a secret from Dave as I don't want to give him the idea we might be getting back together and the real explanation is surely TMI for him. The problem is that Jim spends the night about once or twice a week and Dave is in the habit of dropping by my place frequently and always unannounced. Last Sunday morning he missed finding his father here by about 20 minutes.\n\nAD\n\nWe can't go to Jim's place since I have two dogs and a cat that can't be left overnight. Jim also refuses to take a cab or Uber over. He says if Dave finds out, we'll just deal with it then.\n\nI can't imagine a worse scenario myself. If I ask Dave to call before he comes over, I might as well say right out, I'm hiding something from you. Should we just keep our fingers crossed that Dave doesn't find out before this thing ends, or should I somehow find a way to tell him upfront?\n\nAD\n\n— Keeping a Secret From My Son\n\nKeeping a Secret From My Son: So you're a consenting, independent-living, single adult sneaking around with a consenting, independent-living, single adult to avoid upsetting . . . an adult son who lives independently.\n\nNot to sound jaded, but I can think of more scandalous scandals.\n\nYou're casually dating your ex. Okay then. You made the choice, now pick your preferred consequence: Letting your son walk in on this news, or telling him yourself.\n\nAD\n\nNot that it's mine to make, but the choice seems obvious. Just so you know, your father stays over here occasionally. I didn't want you to find out by walking in on him one day. When he asks you what's going on, you say, Nothing serious, we're just friends. Which it isn't, and you are. You don't have to explain yourself, not even to your son.\n\nAD\n\nThe getting-back-together prospect might have meant a lot 12 years ago, but surely now Dave can handle more nuance.\n\nHe may be concerned about your making things difficult for yourself, and he may be right, but you would be right to assure him he's not responsible for your choices, you are.\n\nAnd finally: It'll be weird for him, but only if he doesn't give it more than a moment's thought. You were drawn to each other once, so why not twice?
It was Vought who led the decision to allow the Internal Revenue Service to pay tax refunds during the shutdown, something that hadn't been previously allowed and that some Democrats called legally dubious. He was also involved in the effort to find money to pay food stamps in February, after it appeared that millions of Americans could lose the benefit.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump on Jan. 8 addressed the nation on border security, the topic at the crux of the partial government shutdown. (The Washington Post)\n\nVought briefed House Republicans on both decisions Tuesday night, in an attempt to encourage nervous lawmakers to stand by Trump's request for border wall funding.\n\nStill, government officials said the results of his short tenure have been mixed, underscoring the tensions that come with having a deeply ideological operative thrust into a position with complicated, often nonpartisan challenges.\n\nSeveral officials involved in the shutdown said they have had a hard time getting clear direction from the OMB about how to proceed because so many things are in flux. The OMB has approved a number of other late-stage changes, leaving agencies at the mercy of its legal opinions.\n\nAD\n\nAfter President Trump addressed the nation Jan. 8, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) responded. (The Washington Post)\n\nIt's easy to throw bombs when you're out of power, said veteran GOP strategist Mike Murphy, a Trump critic. This puts him in the painful position of having to govern.\n\nAD\n\nVought's background as a conservative warrior has given him little currency with Democrats. His three-page letter Sunday to Congress requesting $5.7 billion for a border wall was immediately dismissed by Democrats as unrealistic, reflecting the limits of a partisan fighter in the current White House.\n\nI wouldn't know him if he walked down the hall, said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nBut Vought, 42, has won plaudits within the administration for his energy, creativity and willingness to cast aside precedent. He's always kind of all-hands-on-deck, said Marc Short, former White House legislative director, who has known Vought for more than a decade.\n\nAD\n\nFederal agencies are supposed to have hard-and-fast rules about how they manage themselves during a shutdown, but the OMB — under Vought's direction — has directed agencies to make multiple changes on the fly.\n\nAD\n\nThe office has also had to deal with a number of federal officials and Cabinet secretaries who scattered for vacation after the shutdown began Dec. 22 and were slow to identify problems.\n\nSeveral OMB responses to various flash points have come after officials read media reports, reflecting a lack of communication between agency leaders and the White House's central clearinghouse for shutdown information.\n\nI feel like they are making up the rules as they go along here and are going to get themselves in trouble legally, said William Hoagland, a Republican who served as staff director on the Senate Budget Committee during a government shutdown in 1995. I'm not sure Russ's strong suit is on the legal side and the management side.\n\nAD\n\nVought spent much of his past 15 years in Washington as a political brawler, waging war against GOP leadership first as a staffer on the conservative House Republican Study Committee and later as a top official at the Heritage Foundation's political arm. This endeared him to Mike Pence, who hired Vought when the vice president was a congressman from Indiana, and later to Mick Mulvaney, who is now the White House chief of staff but previously served in the House.\n\nAD\n\nVought has argued for Trump to take the deficit and debt more seriously, without much success so far. He was key to many of the proposed budget cuts at federal agencies and clashed with Cabinet secretaries and their deputies, who argued that the cuts would hobble important government functions. He has proved to be the lead proponent of shrinking the federal government, even though he's lost many battles internally and on Capitol Hill.\n\nVought knows every penny that's everywhere; he ran the operation for Mulvaney, former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon said. He's an old-school, Heritage Foundation conservative who actually wants to cut spending.\n\nAD\n\nPence and Mulvaney were crucial to luring Vought to the White House. Vought's wife, Mary Vought, is also a longtime adviser and friend of Pence, having once served as his spokeswoman. Mulvaney has served as Trump's budget director since early 2017, and Vought was nominated later that year to be his deputy.\n\nAD\n\nBut the nomination took months and was almost derailed because of incendiary commentary Vought wrote in 2016 that Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned.\n\nThis led to a tense exchange during his confirmation hearing, when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) grilled Vought over his religious beliefs.\n\nAD\n\nI'm a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith, Vought said.\n\nSanders, and every Democrat in the Senate, unsuccessfully opposed Vought's nomination.\n\nThis nominee is really not someone who is what this country is supposed to be about, Sanders said at Vought's hearing.\n\nFriends say Vought is a dyed-in-the-wool social and fiscal conservative who proudly attends a Baptist church. But he has surprised friends by defending Trump, who is known for profane talk and frequent misstatements.\n\nAD\n\nIn a White House full of bombastic personalities, Vought isn't known for speaking much — instead carrying large binders to senior staff meetings and homing in on data inside the Executive Office Building beneath his wire-rim glasses. I never saw him blow up on anyone, said Paul Winfree, a former senior Trump administration budget official.\n\nAD\n\nIt was Vought, one former White House official said, who helped come up with the White House's initial request for $1.6 billion to fund the creation of parts of a wall along the Mexican border. This figure was included in the White House's formal budget request to Congress. Democrats would later agree to fund between $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion for border security upgrades, including replacement of existing fences, but they objected to using any of that money for the creation of a wall. Vought and the OMB argued that the federal government could spend only that much money in a year and that the government had to be careful in its spending.\n\nNow, Trump is demanding more than $5 billion — and has shut down the government because he has not gotten it.\n\nAD\n\nThe OMB endured major turnover last year. Mulvaney was spending half his time simultaneously running the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the OMB's other deputy director, Margaret Weichert, was tapped to also run the Office of Personnel Management. Then, in December, Trump announced that Mulvaney would serve as acting White House chief of staff. Vought was quickly elevated to acting OMB director, though an official announcement was never made.\n\nAD\n\nVought's personal Twitter feed reflects a range of interests and passions, from musings about marriage and fatherhood to enthusiasm for sports. But he also mixes in plenty of opinions about politics, not avoiding controversial viewpoints.\n\nThe reason the Left doesn't trust citizens with guns is because they dont trust ordinary educated people, he wrote in 2012.\n\nAD\n\nVought does not shy away from political confrontations on both sides of the aisle and has even attacked Republican leaders who sought to cut budget deals with Democrats.\n\nFor instance, he helped plan the Republican Study Committee's Operation Offset in 2005, an effort demanding that new spending to cover the damage from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita be offset by cuts in programs like Medicaid. The pitch was popular with many conservatives but infuriated House GOP leaders because it split the party. Republicans would go on to lose control of the House the following year in part because the party had splintered.\n\nAfter leaving Capitol Hill, Vought became a top official at Heritage Action in 2010, where he intensified his attacks on Republicans he felt had strayed from the party's core principles.\n\nHe was a small-government conservative that some of the moderate Republicans didn't like because when he was at Heritage Action, he held them accountable, said Short, the former legislative affairs director.\n\nIn 2011, Vought, writing for the right-wing website RedState, again infuriated House GOP leadership when he argued that conservatives in the House should push the party as far to the right as is possible and flat out oppose it when necessary.\n\nAlso that year, he attacked GOP leaders for what he said was complacency and failing to escalate fiscal fights when necessary.\n\nThey come here with their main goal being to have a tranquility with the powers-that-be that keeps them from taking the steps to change the country, he said at a panel session in 2011.\n\nVought's views made him an ally not only of Pence but of Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of the leaders of the House Freedom Caucus, a group that emerged out of the Republican Study Committee because some members did not think the party was conservative enough. Jordan is now close to Trump.\n\nHe was Mr. Freedom Caucus before the Freedom Caucus existed, said Kurt Bardella, a former House GOP staffer. He was a thorn in the side of John Boehner and Eric Cantor, the former Republican House leaders.\n\nAt the OMB, Vought played a critical role in designing a package of spending cuts that was offered to Capitol Hill amid growing GOP anxiety about the expanding budget deficit last year.\n\nThe proposal went nowhere, however. And Vought's most recent budget correspondence with Capitol Hill seems more tailored to Trump's demands than the strategy he used when he was a staffer. The letter he signed Sunday, for example, demanded $7.2 billion in new spending on immigration policy without requesting any offsetting cuts. But there will be plenty of time to seek new cuts. Vought is currently writing next year's budget request, which could come out in a few weeks.\n\nHe declined a request for an interview, but several White House officials praised his performance so far, as did allied Republicans.\n\nI've been in a lot of tough fights with him, and he doesn't wither under fire, said former Texas congressman Jeb Hensarling, who has worked closely with Vought. And he's a real committed conservative, a policy wonk with command of the budget.
Adapted from an online discussion.\n\nHi, Carolyn: At what point is it okay to forgive yourself for hiding a pregnancy from beloved family?\n\nIt is early on, and with the threat of miscarriage, my husband and I have decided to keep this news to ourselves. However, I can't help but feel sneaky as I conceal this from family members by tossing glasses of wine in the bathroom. I'm worried there may be hard feelings when we are ready to share.\n\nPregnant\n\nPregnant: Superficial answer: You can forgive yourself immediately and for good. This is your and your husband's news alone, and you don't need to tell anyone anything till you're ready.\n\nNext-layer-down answer: What's with the drama? For one, that's a rigid news embargo. I get the impulse to wait out the first trimester, since no one wants to go around issuing painful updates in the event of a miscarriage. But telling a few people is not unusual — the ones you'd lean on if you were to miscarry.\n\nAlso dramatic is the use of active deception (what did that innocent wine ever do to you!), as is the jump from these otherwise-victimless fake-outs to . . . not forgiving yourself? Yikes. It's all so much.\n\nMaybe you're just hormonal. Or maybe your family tends to drama, i.e., hard feelings vs. just sharing your joy.\n\nRegardless: Please consider, in situations such as this where your emotions are roiling, a reliance on the logic of simplicity: Given the various risks, is withholding your news easier than sharing it? And if so, is your method for withholding the news the easiest one, or are there milder options for remaining discreet?\n\nEspecially with a baby coming, I urge a realignment of your thinking toward maximized calm.\n\nStarting here: If your family does wig out at your delayed notification, then that is SO not your problem. They have no entitlement to be told till you're ready.\n\nIf you feel you always have to yell Look over there! just to buy yourself some privacy, then I suggest taking a closer look at the emotional boundaries (or lack thereof) learned in your childhood home.\n\nDear Carolyn: My parents are throwing a 50th anniversary party, and while they haven't asked me to make a speech, I should have something thought out to say. The thing is: I do see this milestone as an accomplishment, but I don't actually admire their relationship.\n\nSo I'm looking for ways to say sincerely congrats, it isn't easy, you guys made it work, without having to say that I wish I had what they have. Any thoughts?\n\nSpeech?\n\nSpeech?: You just did: Congrats, it isn't easy, you guys made it work, and scene.\n\nYou can also list the good things you've taken away from their marriage. Such as:\n\n1. You! Ha-ha.\n\n2. Appreciation for the power of committing to someone.\n\n3. An understanding that marriage shifts and grows and changes in its own ways — and if anything it's the effort you put in that gets the last word.\n\nBrainstorming your own list might even tweak the way you view your parents, an unexpected bonus.\n\nAnd if you think of it more as a toast than a speech, then a little wit will get you out without saying too much.
In pairing the two Cabinet picks, Biden balanced Raimondo, who has often been at odds with major labor unions, with Walsh, who enjoys strong support from leaders of the AFL-CIO and earned his union card in 1988 when he joined Laborers Local 223.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBefore becoming mayor, Walsh was the head of Boston's Building and Construction Trades Council.\n\nBiden is also preparing to name Isabel Guzman, director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, to take charge of the U.S. Small Business Administration, the person added. Guzman, who served as senior adviser and chief of staff in the federal agency during the Obama administration, will take over with the SBA under fire for its management of a loan program intended to help small businesses weather the pandemic.\n\nIf confirmed, Raimondo would take over a department with a roughly $8 billion budget and more than 43,000 employees, which traditionally has been the center of business influence within the federal government. She will have a voice in the administration's Buy America efforts, designed to promote domestic manufacturing, and she also will probably need to mollify corporate interests worried by Biden's promise to give organized labor and environmental groups a greater say in trade policy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden will also nominate Don Graves, who advised him on economic issues during his tenure as vice president and later served at the Treasury Department, as deputy commerce secretary, the person familiar said. Graves, who has experience managing small-business and community development financing issues, was executive vice president and head of corporate responsibility for KeyBank in Cleveland after leaving the government in 2017.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, the Commerce Department was repurposed as a central player in the president's multi-front global trade war, with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross at the helm.\n\nRoss presided over an elastic interpretation of U.S. trade law, which saw President Trump cite national security considerations to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nAD\n\nThese Section 232 tariffs — named for the provision in U.S. trade law that authorized them — were deeply controversial with trade experts and alienated major U.S. trading partners, including Canada and the European Union.\n\nAD\n\nAlong with Trump's high-profile initiatives, Commerce also ramped up the use of routine trade penalties. Under Ross, Commerce initiated 306 anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations, a 283 percent increase over the Obama administration level. The department now implements 539 import levies designed to prevent U.S. trading partners from unfairly dumping their goods in U.S. markets or subsidizing their sale.\n\nAs Trump moved to confront China, Commerce put prominent Chinese corporations such as Huawei on an export blacklist, all but severing them from critical American-made components.\n\nAD\n\nLast month, Commerce added 77 more Chinese companies to its entity list, including the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. The department said the action was a response to China's corrupt and bullying behavior and its marriage of civilian technology companies with its growing military.\n\nAD\n\nBiden's Commerce chief is likely to face early pressure to roll back the steel and aluminum tariffs. The president-elect has vowed to review the Trump tariffs, but has made no promises about early relief.\n\nTo help workers affected by globalization and automation, Biden has proposed doubling the $333 million budget of Commerce's Economic Development Administration, which Trump had begun eliminating. The president-elect wants the office to help disadvantaged communities apply for federal aid to establish new manufacturing or information technology clusters.\n\nAD\n\nUnder Raimondo, Commerce also may place renewed emphasis on promoting U.S. exports while adopting a more active stance on climate change. Biden has promised to enact a national strategy to develop a low-carbon manufacturing sector in every state.\n\nAD\n\nIf confirmed, Walsh will inherit the Labor Department in the midst of an economic crisis that has fundamentally shaken American workplaces. Tens of millions of workers have lost jobs at some point over the past year during an economic hit that has been more punishing than any since the Great Depression.\n\nAlthough the economy has rebounded faster than initially predicted, the recovery has been slowing for months. Some economists warn that the country may already be shedding jobs again, amid a resurgent coronavirus pandemic and congressional delays in providing additional aid.\n\nAD\n\nMany who have kept their jobs face complicated safety questions at work. The Labor Department has taken a largely employer- and industry-friendly approach under Trump, angering labor unions and Democrats, and inviting legal challenges.\n\nAD\n\nThe agency exempted many workers from the paid sick leave requirements in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, while restricting gig and self-employed workers' eligibility for unemployment insurance payouts.\n\nIts workplace safety division, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, has drawn ire for doing little to enforce safety standards at workplaces during the early days of the pandemic.\n\nInstead of issuing rules for workplaces, that division has issued only guidelines that cannot be enforced with penalties or violations. Fines for workplaces with some of the largest outbreaks in the country were slow to materialize — and paltry when they eventually were issued.\n\nAD\n\nLabor unions welcomed Walsh's nomination. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh will be an exceptional labor secretary for the same reason he was an outstanding mayor: he carried the tools, said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO.\n\nAD\n\nLabor leaders will be less satisfied with Biden's choice to run Commerce. As state treasurer in 2011, Raimondo spearheaded pension reforms that raised the retirement age and cut benefits for Rhode Island's public employees. Those battles have left scars, though one construction industry union, the Laborers' International, backed her.\n\nOnce in the governor's office, she took significant actions on climate change. As the chief executive of a coastal state, she is familiar with fisheries issues that the department handles.\n\nAD\n\nBiden's focus on climate change may mean an enhanced profile for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is one of the top climate science agencies in the world.\n\nUnder Trump, NOAA's relationship with the department's leadership was strained, and morale among the agency's scientists suffered in recent months as politically appointed officials who question the seriousness of global warming were placed in top NOAA jobs, including as chief scientist.\n\nAD\n\nNOAA's credibility took a hit from the 2019 Sharpiegate episode, when pressure from the White House and Ross forced NOAA to chastise the National Weather Service for its accurate forecast of Hurricane Dorian's path to justify Trump's erroneous claim that the storm had threatened Alabama.\n\nSubsequent investigations showed that NOAA and Commerce officials' actions violated the agency's scientific integrity policy. The department's inspector general also faulted senior leaders over the affair.\n\nFor the first time since it was created in 1970, NOAA went through an entire presidential term without a Senate-confirmed administrator, instead cycling through two acting administrators.
I'm no longer invited to anything friend-wise, and the few things I have been invited to were mere hours beforehand with no time to secure a sitter. My husband complains that he hates his job, he doesn't help much with our child — she's very attached to me, which is a sore point — and is irritated that I'm always tired and angry. I am always tired and usually frustrated that I have no time for myself. He tells me to ask for help and then when I ask the response is, Okay but [little one] is going to cry the whole time. I don't resent my child, but it's hard to stay positive and upbeat when I feel like only my life has changed.\n\nMy husband's answer is for me to hire a nanny or get involved with a moms' group, but that doesn't solve anything with my current circle.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n— K.\n\nK: Actually, it probably would.\n\nYour current circle problem is a specific one probably rooted in your more general problem of being out of balance at home. That's also true of the other specific problems you name: no time for yourself, lonely, always tired and angry, marriage faltering, father not bonding with child — even the husbandly chore-dodging and work-griping.\n\nYour husband's suggestion to hire help is a deceptively significant start to solving it all. Just a few weekly shifts for a part-time caregiver can give you some time to yourself, which can give you some rest, which can give you some energy, which can remind you who you still are with all the roles and requirements stripped away. Hiring help also can get this core self out the door on a date with her husband or dinner with friends or just on a long walk where your soul goes aaaaaaaaaaaa.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA better-rested, less-angry, more-you version of you can say calmly to your husband, when he complains the baby is going to cry the whole time: You're right, she will. That means we need to swap roles more, though, not less. We let things get out of whack. It'll take some time and work for both of us to fix this, but soon she'll figure out how brilliant her dad is. Commit to building his confidence with the baby and yours without.\n\nThe best way not to slide back into your current imbalance is make these standing appointments, and keep them. Pick a weekend morning where he's solo parent; a date night; an out-with-friends (or solo) weeknight.\n\nHappier people make more cooperative partners make better parents.\n\nAD\n\nAnd, employees. Few people think clearly when they're stressed, so easing home tension can ease his work tension.\n\nAD\n\nAnd just by getting out with your friends more regularly, you can develop a better understanding of their place in life — and develop expectations of them accordingly. If I gather correctly that you're the first with a baby, then I hope you'll see: A baby is so far from their reality that it's no wonder they haven't offered or shown any interest in helping! People new to babies (and a few veterans even) tend to see one as a fine reason to run the other way. It's not personal, it's just . . . alien.\n\nAnd it's okay to talk about that. Sympathetically, for best results: I realize you're not in a baby-friendly place. And, if true: I doubt I'd be myself if I didn't have one. Think of your friends individually vs. as a group, and identify the most flexible. That friend might be open to coming over, holding the baby, enjoying your company while rolling with small-kid disruptions.\n\nAD\n\nA mom group is a fine idea, too, in place of this or (ideally) in addition to. Nothing beats shared experience, laughs and child care.\n\nAD\n\nPlease note that all elements of the solution I'm proposing involve more time with others. Somewhere in our societal evolution, a stay-at-home parent stopped being communal and became an island of two, parent and child, and that's so counter to what keeps most of us healthy. Parents — whether working for pay or not — are most effective when serving as the leader of a team of people who care for and about their children, and that includes people who care for and about the parents themselves.\n\nSo even if you reject this or that suggestion I've made, or if hiring a caregiver is not workable financially, then make sure whatever steps you do take hinge on easing your isolation. Island living is wearing all of you down, and not how things need to be.
Then things got dark.\n\nHere's how an ABC news release described the final part of the episode: Two feuding females square off one last time as the recipients of a dreaded impromptu two-on-one date card. Sorry, we just have to read that again: Two feuding females. Okay, yes, that's what it said. Great! Everything's fine. Anyway, in Bachelor universe, a two-on-one is when the devious producers star of the show chooses two contestants who have been causing nonstop drama and pits them against each other on a sudden-death date. Whoever convinces the Bachelor that they are truly There For the Right Reasons gets to stay. The loser is sent packing, or sometimes just left stranded on an island or in the desert. (No, really.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn this case, it was Tammy, a 24-year-old New York house flipper, versus Mykenna, a 22-year-old Canadian fashion blogger. Earlier in the episode, Mykenna broke down when she wasn't chosen for a one-on-one date with Peter. To likely push her further over the edge, during the telenovela, the producers cast her as the maid, who initially had to stand on the sidelines and watch him make out with everyone else.\n\nHer tearful reaction set off Tammy, who said Mykenna was so immature that she doubted she would actually be ready for marriage if Peter proposed. It resulted in a shouting match between the two, in the kind of way that people never think they're going to act if they end up on reality TV, yet inevitably do.\n\nPeter overheard the yelling and was not happy. Later, both the women received an ominous card: Mykenna and Tammy, meet me at the cocktail party before everyone else arrives. Enough is enough.\n\nThus began the excruciating final 30 minutes, as the two women were shown getting ready, with close-up shots of them both applying lip gloss as if preparing for battle. Dramatic music blared as they walked silently, side by side, into a room where they waited for Peter. Mykenna used the time to give a clearly rehearsed speech: I don't know what your goal was the other night, maybe to make me feel small and weak, but the end of the day … I am a strong woman. Kindness wins. Love wins.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTammy didn't have time to respond, as Peter arrived and pulled her aside to talk first. Admittedly, Tammy made a strong opening move, accusing Mykenna of just being on the show to promote her brand — on The Bachelor, that's the worst thing you can say. She's trying to create hashtags, Tammy said sadly. I'm not here for anything else but you. She also revealed that Mykenna threatened to leave when she wasn't picked for the one-on-one date, adding, Girls like her disrupt the process.\n\nPeter was taken aback by this tidbit, and Tammy could tell. Mykenna's on borrowed time, she boasted to the camera. I'm wearing black today because it's her funeral.\n\nThen it was Mykenna's turn. When Peter admitted he was freaked out about the hashtag detail, Mykenna insisted Tammy was twisting everything around. I am speaking my truth on this, Peter, she said. I care so much about you and about us.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe moment the two women got back in the room together, they started quarreling (Tammy: It really makes me sick that people like you come in here trying to brand themselves. Mykenna: I'm not the villain of the season, honey.) until Peter wearily returned.\n\nI can't have both of you continue past tonight with me, he sighed. Mykenna, I heard you and everything you had to say today, and I trust you. Tammy — can I walk you out? Mykenna could barely hide her glee, as she grinned and started lightly clapping as Tammy was escorted out.\n\nAnd then … twist! Mykenna barely had time to gloat. Even though the chosen contestant of the two-on-one is almost always given a rose, that wasn't true this time. In a move that was simply reality TV manipulation at its peak, during the rose ceremony a few minutes later, Peter decided to cut Mykenna loose anyway.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMykenna, I'm sorry, he said. I know that you're gonna make someone so happy one day.\n\nStunned, Mykenna tried to hold it together she talked to the cameras. I just don't get what just happened, she said. If he said he wanted me here and wanted to give this a shot, then why did he keep me there? Why didn't he just send us both home?\n\nGreat question! Because the show wanted to create a moment that would get viewers talking. Because within moments, both Tammy and Mykenna were worldwide Twitter trending topics. Because after 24 seasons, Bachelor producers know exactly to manipulate a situation to make sure it's as dramatic and twisted as possible — and, sadly, that often includes two feuding females.
The woman couldn't identify the stranger to police. But following an exhaustive investigation, authorities nearly two years later were able to use DNA evidence to identify him as Cardell Torney Jr.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday in D.C. Superior Court, a judge sentenced Torney, 47, of Northwest Washington, to 39 years in prison for the attack. A jury in September found him guilty of first degree sexual abuse while armed and kidnapping while armed.\n\nIn issuing the punishment Friday, Judge Danya Dayson outlined Torney's criminal past that included eight assault convictions against him before the 2010 attack. Torney was on probation for sexually assaulting a child at the time of the assault on the woman. All of the prior charges, Dayson said, were misdemeanors.\n\nDayson called the 2010 sexual assault a particularly brutal crime. She said Torney's criminal behavior had become more violent over time and that while he was on probation for the 2008 child sexual assault, he failed to comply with sex offender treatment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis level of violence and nature of offenses escalated as he got older which goes against the statistics, she said. He does not fall into the statistical norm which makes him a danger to the community.\n\nProsecutors praised the woman, now 39, who sat in the audience of the courtroom Friday. She has since moved to Tennessee and endured years of delays in the criminal case.\n\nBefore the judge issued the sentence, the woman, standing just feet from Torney, tearfully spoke of how she thought Torney was going to kill her. She said that after the attack her marriage dissolved and said she worries about trying to make the world around her daughter a safer place. The Washington Post does not generally identify victims of sexual assault.\n\nAD\n\nI traveled from Nashville so my voice can be heard, she said, her voice trembling at times. This happened eight years ago and I am still reeling from this attack. He forever changed my life and the lives of those I love and those who loved me.\n\nAD\n\nTorney and his public defenders argued that Torney was innocent and are appealing the verdict. Torney did not speak at the sentencing. At times he wiped tears away as his 24-year-old daughter, who is now a D.C. police cadet, told the judge she did not believe her father was responsible for the brutal attack.\n\nTorney's trial was delayed repeatedly, partly because his public defenders and prosecutors argued over evidence, including the accuracy of DNA tests. Scheduling conflicts also pushed the proceeding back.\n\nAD\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Kathleen Kern said the victim had prepared herself, emotionally and physically, to testify about a dozen times only to have the proceedings postponed. The woman last year finally told her story to a jury.\n\nWe are here today because of her strength, Kern said. She had to live with the threat of HIV. She had to face the defendant and be attacked by numerous questions by his attorneys. But because of her strength and because she never gave up, this man is being held accountable.
The presidential election was a natural time stamp, and so the inauguration seemed like a natural destination. Just teleport me to Jan. 20, I heard more than one person joke. Cryogenically freeze me until it's over. In Washington, the scaffolding for the inauguration platform gradually took shape, and honestly, it looked as if it could be something from NASA: a launchpad for a rocket to anywhen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe underpinning of the time-travel fantasy was the idea that America could sort itself out if only we checked out for a little while. As if the vast and entrenched problems of pandemic illness, unemployment, death, racism, toxic nostalgia and total information warfare amounted to little more than a stress fracture that would heal in time as long as we had patience. As if it's a bumpy flight, and your big challenge is to pop an Ambien and see whether you can fall asleep soundly enough to wake up at your destination.\n\nIt became obvious that a large portion of the country — 74 million, as Donald Trump keeps reminding us — wanted to travel not forward but back: way, way, way back. Make America Great Again was always its own time machine. The phrase raised questions. Great for whom, exactly, and when? But never mind that: they wanted us to go back. To 2014, maybe, before same-sex marriage was legalized. To 1972, before women could end unwanted pregnancies, or to a pre-Voting Rights Act 1964.\n\nOr to 1814. Two weeks ago, rioters invaded the Capitol, the first time such a thing had happened since British forces tried to burn it down. They smashed windows, toppled artifacts, rifled through senators' private desks in search of evidence that would help them literally turn back the clock, negating the results of a free and fair election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe rest of us could only watch it and think: Just get me to the inauguration. Put me in an H.G. Wells novel. Find me a wrinkle in time.\n\nThe time travel fantasy is pure escapism, which is to say it's both optimistic and wholly irresponsible. It's a way of saying, I wish things were better, but also of saying, let me know when we get there, okay? A way of being a perpetual passenger, insisting you're not equipped to drive.\n\nThese kids will be a better generation than we are, is a time machine. I'm waiting for the perfect candidate, is a time machine. Longing for things to be changed without working to change them is a time machine.\n\nSo, the inauguration.\n\nAD\n\nHere we are! We made it to Jan. 20.\n\nWas it everything you imagined? Yes. In a lot of ways. It was hard not to breathe a sigh of relief when President Trump absconded off to Mar-a-Lago, when President Biden took the podium and said he would fight against white supremacy, poverty, illness and inequality — when he said, My whole soul is in this.\n\nAD\n\nThen again, for now there is still the pandemic. There is still racial injustice. There is still a desperately broken health-care system ineffectively serving desperate people.\n\nPerhaps you made it to Inauguration Day only to realize it wasn't the destination, just a connecting gate, and that the destination always ends up being a connecting gate.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps you realized that arriving at a better future doesn't happen all at once, and that you never just wake up to it.\n\nWe've come so far, Biden said. But we still have far to go.\n\nMeanwhile, there is also this: Kamala Harris became the first female and the first Black and Asian American vice president. She was sworn in on a Bible belonging to Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court justice. Administering her oath of office was Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina to serve on the Court: I, Kamala Devi Harris, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office upon which I am about to enter.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nShe stepped onto the scaffolding in front of the recently besieged U.S. Capitol and she communicated that, no, we would not be traveling back to 1814 or to anywhen else. No, because of the votes of 81 million Americans, we would be moving only forward.\n\nHere is what I think about time travel, and the longing for it: The only real time machines are our own bodies, carrying through from the past to the future. The only real way to travel through time is to move through it, day by day.\n\nAnd some days, that looks like the storming of the Capitol, and it seems as though we've all been catapulted back 200 years. And some days, that looks like Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants, standing in front of that same Capitol with her hand on a historic Bible, and it feels like we've arrived someplace new that will soon be old.\n\nIf you're going to time travel, know that the machine moves only in one direction — the future — and that the machine is you, and that it never really gets there, but you can always move forward.
Chao and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who both announced their resignations on Thursday, stayed loyal to Trump during scores of other controversies. They kept their heads down as Trump separated children from the arms of their parents at the border, pressured Ukraine's president to announce an investigation into his presidential rival Joe Biden, demanded that minority congresswomen go back to countries where they were not born and violently cleared peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square for a presidential photo op.\n\nInstead, they quietly enacted their agendas. Chao weakened greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and SUVs, held back from imposing rules on self-driving cars and made it easier for companies to experiment with airborne drones. DeVos promoted the use of taxpayer dollars to support charter schools; rolled back many civil rights initiatives from the Obama administration, including protections for transgender students; enacted a regulation giving more rights to students accused of sexual harassment and assault; and publicly defended proposed funding cuts to the Special Olympics that the White House had insisted on before they reversed course.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThirteen days before Trump will leave office, Chao announced that she will resign effective next Monday, just a week before Biden's inauguration – because of the traumatic and entirely avoidable storming of the Capitol by supporters of the President … following a rally he addressed.\n\nAs I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside, Chao wrote in an email to her staff at 1:32 p.m. Thursday.\n\nA few hours later, DeVos called the violence at the Capitol unconscionable in an open letter to Trump. There is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me, she wrote. Impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us. I believe we each have a moral obligation to exercise good judgement and model the behavior we hope they would emulate.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nResigning now feels a little like eating all but the last bite of a piece of cake at a restaurant and then asking for a refund. A directive was even emailed yesterday to all agency heads that political appointees must resign effective Jan. 20. The order was issued by Chris Liddell, the deputy White House chief of staff who has been leading transition arrangements with the Biden team, Lisa Rein and Eric Yoder report.\n\nCritics of the administration say Chao and DeVos deserve no credit. At this point you're not resigning, you're just taking the rest of your vacation days, said Bakari Sellers, a former Democratic state legislator in South Carolina. Former NFL wide receiver Donté Stallworth compared Cabinet members stepping down now to a quarterback throwing six interceptions and fumbling four times in his own territory with 5 seconds left in the game while the other team has the ball and is taking a knee to run out the clock. Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers union, issued a two-word statement: Good riddance.\n\nThat is not to say that officials are not authentically horrified by Trump's baseless claims that the election was stolen and other efforts to sow distrust in democracy. Chao is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who said – even before the pro-Trump mob took control of the chamber – that certifying Biden's victory would be the single most important vote he's cast during 37 years in office.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell, who has been estranged from the president in recent weeks, has told fellow senators and other confidants that he does not plan to speak with Trump again, Philip Rucker, Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey report.\n\nMore Trump administration officials also resigned in protest on Thursday, including Matt Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser; Tyler Goodspeed, the acting chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers; and John Costello, the deputy assistant secretary at the Commerce Department.\n\nActing homeland security secretary Chad Wolf called on Trump to denounce the violence carried out by 'some supporters' of the president. Wolf said he does not plan to quit, Anne Gearan and Mike DeBonis report. Former attorney general William P. Barr called Trump's conduct 'a betrayal of his office and supporters.' … Former homeland security secretary and Trump chief of staff John F. Kelly, now a Trump critic, urged the Cabinet to meet and discuss Trump's removal, telling CNN that he would vote for that if he were he still a Cabinet member. Former Trump national security adviser H.R. McMaster tweeted that the main reason for the attack on Congress 'is the sad reality that President Trump and other officials have repeatedly compromised our principles in pursuit of partisan advantage and personal gain.'\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter being out of sight all day, Trump posted a video on Twitter last night in which he said there will be a smooth transition. Now tempers must be cooled and calm restored, he said. He also tweeted this morning that he will not attend Biden's inauguration.\n\nWith the remaining members of the Cabinet very unlikely to invoke the 25th Amendment to put Vice President Pence in charge, many House Democrats are discussing a second attempt to impeach Trump during his final days. Rep. Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), the No. 4 in House Democratic leadership, said this morning on CNN that the chamber could vote to impeach Trump by the middle of next week. Their caucus will hold a conference call early this afternoon to discuss next steps. Donald Trump needs to be removed from office, Clark said. And we are going to proceed with every tool that we have to make sure that happens to protect our democracy.\n\nFollowing the Jan. 6 pro-Trump mob that breached the Capitol, politicians began calling for invoking the 25th Amendment or the impeachment of President Trump. (The Washington Post)\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) became the first Republican member of Congress to come out in favor of Trump's removal on Thursday, saying in a video that the time has come to end this nightmare.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), the former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told Spectrum News that he would not oppose using the 25th Amendment if it was invoked: If the Cabinet decided to do that, I would not oppose it.\n\nI hold the president responsible for sending those people to the Capitol, Rep. Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) said in a statement.\n\nEven if the House impeached Trump, though, it remains hard to imagine Senate Republicans breaking decisively with the president in his final days. Partly, that is a function of the calendar. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who opposed impeachment last year, said today that Trump has acted shamefully and that he would definitely consider any articles of impeachment approved by the House. The president had a rally hours before this happened where he is telling them to go to the Capitol and go wild, Sasse told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. The guy is addicted to division. This is a deep brokenness in his soul.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of Fox News's Trump supporters now declare his political career is done. The president's role in and reaction to the assault on the Capitol has soured Stuart Varney, Brit Hume and others who once favored him. If Mr. Trump wants to avoid a second impeachment, his best path would be to take personal responsibility and resign, writes the Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial board. This would be the cleanest solution since it would immediately turn presidential duties over to Mr. Pence. And it would give Mr. Trump agency, a la Richard Nixon, over his own fate.\n\nOn NBC's Today show this morning, former secretary of state Colin Powell called on Trump to just do what Nixon did and step down. What he is responsible for is one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen in all my years as a government employee here in the United States of America and in Washington, D.C. He should be totally ashamed of himself and he should take that shame and turn it into a resignation as quickly as possible, said Powell, who was the nation's chief diplomat under George W. Bush. Asked about Trump's access to the nuclear launch codes for the next 12 days, Powell sought to reassure: I was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I can tell you for sure if something like this ever happened, and someone suddenly said, 'We want to use the nuclear weapon,' they would never get near it.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden is in danger of having no confirmed secretaries on Day 1.\n\nDelays in Congress, caused primarily by runoff elections in Georgia for Senate seats that Democrats flipped this week and the arcane procedures needed to get the new chamber up and running, have sparked deep concern among Biden's top advisers. They are now mapping out contingency plans to install acting secretaries in most, if not all, Cabinet posts, in case Biden's nominees are unable to secure Senate backing by Jan. 20, Paul Kane, Karoun Demirjian and Anne Gearan report. For decades, Senate Republicans and Democrats have shelved their political differences to ensure a seamless transition between administrations, especially in the departments responsible for safeguarding the country against foreign and domestic threats. … [But] to date, the Senate Republican committee chairs — who will remain in control until Jan. 20 — have scheduled only one confirmation hearing for a Biden nominee: that of Lloyd J. Austin III, the president-elect's choice for defense secretary. That hearing is set for Jan. 19.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden has picked Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo to be secretary of commerce and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh (D) to be secretary of labor. In pairing the two Cabinet picks, Biden balanced Raimondo, who has often been at odds with major labor unions, with Walsh, who enjoys strong support from leaders of the AFL-CIO and earned his union card in 1988 when he joined Laborers Local 223. Before becoming mayor, Walsh was the head of Boston's Building and Construction Trades Council, David Lynch, Jeff Stein, Eli Rosenberg and Andrew Freedman report. Biden is also preparing to name Isabel Guzman, director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, to take charge of the U.S. Small Business Administration … Biden will also nominate Don Graves, who advised him on economic issues during his tenure as vice president and later served at the Treasury Department, as deputy commerce secretary.\n\nMore fallout from the insurrection\n\nCapitol Police were unable to stop a breach of the Capitol. Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig and a former Senate Sergeant at Arms describe the events. (The Washington Post)\n\nInside the U.S. Capitol, the rioters were in charge.\n\nCapitol Police had not asked other law enforcement agencies for help until their building was surrounded by a mob seeking to overturn the election results, Peter Hermann, Carol Leonnig, Aaron Davis and David Fahrenthold report. Top congressional leaders, hidden in secure rooms, were calling the governors of Maryland and Virginia directly to plead for help. At last, reinforcements arrived: D.C. police officers, who wear an image of the Capitol building on their department's official patch, but rarely enter the building itself. … Late Thursday, a Capitol Police officer died of injuries he sustained in the attack. Officer Brian D. Sicknick, a 12-year veteran on the force, was 'injured while physically engaging with protesters,' the department said in a statement, and collapsed after returning to his division headquarters. He later died at a hospital.. … Three of Congress's top security officials — Capitol Police Chief Steven A. Sund, House Sergeant at Arms Paul D. Irving and Senate Sergeant at Arms Michael C. Stenger — had resigned or were set to. …\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBy early Wednesday afternoon, Sund made an urgent plea for backup from the D.C. National Guard during a call with top Pentagon and city officials … But Defense officials balked, concerns about the 'optics' of soldiers inside the Capitol building, two District officials said. During the melee, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said he got a call from House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who was in a secure location under police protection. … But the governor said he was … repeatedly rebuffed by the Defense Department. … It wasn't until about 90 minutes later that the secretary of the Army called asking the Maryland guardsmen to 'come as soon as possible,' the governor said. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said he also got a call on his cellphone Wednesday. 'It showed up, 'Nancy Pelosi,'' he said, recalling his surprise. … 'She said, 'Ralph, there's glass being broken around me. I've heard there's been gunfire. We're just very, very concerned right now.'\n\nQuote of the day\n\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo, president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said he worries the lack of preparedness was rooted in police's perception of the crowd: They see Black Lives Matter and go 'Oh my God, we've got to be ready.' But, hey, these people have their blue lives matter flags all over the place. And that bias and that false sense of security bit them.\n\nThe man who posed at a desk in Pelosi's office said he was prepared for a violent death.\n\nLast Saturday, Richard Barnett of Gravette, Ark., criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a Facebook post for using the description 'white nationalist' as a 'derogatory term,' Jon Swaine reports. 'I am white. There is no denying that. I am a nationalist. I put my nation first. So that makes me a white nationalist,' Barnett wrote on a page he maintained under a pseudonym, before adding that people who were not nationalists should 'get the f--- out of our nation.' Just four days later, Barnett was photographed sitting with his feet up on a desk in Pelosi's office at the U.S. Capitol — an image that quickly became emblematic of the chaotic storming of the complex by a pro-Trump mob. Barnett, who is 60 and goes by the nickname 'Bigo,' identified himself as the intruder in Pelosi's office to [a] New York Times reporter … In a Dec. 28 Facebook post, … Barnett announced he would be attending Wednesday's rally and urged fellow Arkansans to make sacrifices to join him there. … In a separate post the same day, Barnett wrote that he 'came into this world kicking and screaming, covered in someone else's blood,' adding, 'I'm not afraid to go out the same way.'\n\nOne of the rioters says a Capitol Police officer gave members of the mob directions to Schumer's office. ( NYT\n\nThe Capitol Police made more arrests on each of the first three days of the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in September, 2018, than they did Wednesday, the New Yorker notes . The protesters at those hearings — most of them women, many self-identified survivors of sexual assault — were arrested for transgressions such as shouting out from the gallery, 'Kavanaugh can't be trusted!'\n\nBiden denounced the racial inequalities reflected in the lenient response to the mostly White attackers. You can't tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesters yesterday they wouldn't have been treated very differently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol, Biden said in Wilmington, Del., before beginning to hammer his fist against the lectern. We all know that is true. And it is totally unacceptable. ( Annie Linskey, Chelsea Janes and Amy Wang\n\nShattered glass still litters the Capitol's floors, as crews try to clean up the mess. ( Paul Schwartzman\n\nSeveral dozen people make their first court appearances.\n\nIn D.C. Superior Court, 40 defendants were charged with unlawful entry of public property and were notified that prosecutors are reviewing evidence of an additional charge of curfew violation, Keith Alexander, Spencer Hsu and Paul Duggan report. Most of the defendants came from outside of the Washington region — including Oregon, Florida, Wyoming, Connecticut and Pennsylvania — though some were from the District, Maryland and Virginia. One person arrested was charged with possessing a 'military style automatic weapon' and 11 molotov cocktails, prosecutors said. Another defendant was charged with assaulting a police officer with a hockey stick. Yet another, who needed a Russian interpreter, told a judge, 'I don't know what unlawful entry you are referring to.' …\n\nAs of early Thursday evening, four other people, charged with federal crimes, appeared in U.S. District Court, including a Maryland man accused of possessing a firearm after curfew on Capitol grounds just outside the Capitol Visitor Center — a 9mm handgun with a round in the firing chamber. Prosecutors said he also was carrying two fully loaded 12-round magazines, wearing a bulletproof vest, and carrying a gas mask and pocket knife in his backpack. … Meanwhile, D.C. Police Chief Robert J. Contee III vowed that his department would arrest 'each and every one of the violent mob.' … He said the department is offering a $1,000 reward for any tip leading to the arrest of a rioter. … The FBI also said that it is asking people in areas where explosive devices were found whether they would share any video recordings of surroundings with investigators. …\n\nAt a news conference, Michael R. Sherwin, the acting U.S. attorney for the District, voiced 'concern' at the relatively small number of rioters who were detained by police in the Capitol. As a result, he said, federal authorities face the daunting task of identifying, locating and obtaining arrest warrants for a large number of suspects, which he said could occupy investigators for months. … He said a large amount of government paperwork along with electronic devices and other items were stolen from congressional offices during the disturbance, which 'could have national security implications.'\n\nThe top federal prosecutor in D.C. also said Trump is not off-limits in his investigation of the events surrounding Wednesday's riot, saying all actors would be examined to determine if they broke the law, Devlin Barrett reports. Asked if federal agents and prosecutors will look at the incendiary statements made by speakers at Trump's rally shortly before the mob sacked the Capitol, Sherwin replied: Yes, we are looking at all actors here, not only the people that went into the building, but . . . were there others that maybe assisted or facilitated or played some ancillary role in this. We will look at every actor and all criminal charges. Asked if that might include Trump himself, who urged the crowd to fight like hell before the rioting began, Sherwin replied: We are looking at all actors here, and anyone that had a role, if the evidence fits the element of a crime, they're going to be charged.\n\nTrump is said to have discussed pardoning himself. In several conversations since Election Day, Mr. Trump has told advisers that he is considering giving himself a pardon and, in other instances, asked whether he should and what the effect would be on him legally and politically, the New York Times reports. No president has pardoned himself, so the legitimacy of prospective self-clemency has never been tested in the justice system, and legal scholars are divided about whether the courts would recognize it. … The questions would be whether the Justice Department under another president would honor the pardon and set aside any potential prosecution of Mr. Trump and, if he were prosecuted, whether the judicial system would ultimately decide whether the pardon insulates Mr. Trump from facing charges.\n\nActing Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen vowed that pro-Trump rioters who entered the U.S. Capitol would 'face the full consequences of their actions under the law,' and those consequences could include being charged under Trump's executive order [from this summer] authorizing up to 10 years in prison for 'injury of federal property,' Fox News reports. The order directs the Department of Justice to 'prosecute to the fullest extent permitted under federal law' those who vandalize government property.\n\nInternet sleuths are identifying scores of the rioters. As he strolled past gold-framed portraits of past Congressional leaders, one rioter who stormed the Capitol in a pro-Trump mob on Wednesday wore a red Trump hat, a commemorative sweatshirt from the president's inauguration and a lanyard around his neck. When a photo of him went viral, it didn't take Internet sleuths long to realize that the lanyard held his work badge — clearly identifying him as an employee of Navistar Direct Marketing, a printing company in Frederick, Md. On Thursday, Navistar swiftly fired him, Jaclyn Peiser reports. While police and the FBI work to identify and arrest members of the mob, online detectives are also crowdsourcing information and doxing them — exposing the rioters to criminal prosecution, but also more immediate action from their bosses.\n\nAirlines and airports in the D.C. area tighten security.

American and United increased staffing and said they were working closely with law enforcement, Ian Duncan reports.\n\nDemocratic control of the Senate – and the Capitol breach – put D.C. statehood front and center. At a Thursday news conference, Mayor Muriel E.

Josh Hawley (R-Mo.).\n\nSupporting Josh and trying so hard to get him elected to the Senate was the worst mistake I ever made in my life, former senator John Danforth (R-Mo.), who for years has been described as Hawley's biggest mentor, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nAs he walked into the Capitol on Wednesday, Hawley cheered on pro-Trump protesters gathering outside the building with a thumbs up and fist pump, the Associated Press reports. GOP state Sen. Shamed Dogan of Ballwin in suburban St. Louis, like Danforth, said late Wednesday he regretted supporting Hawley. 'I have never regretted a vote as much and as quickly as my vote for @HawleyMO in 2018,' he tweeted. … The student bar association at the University of Missouri law school, where Hawley taught, issued a statement calling for his resignation. …\n\nSimon & Schuster canceled publication of Hawley's upcoming book, 'The Tyranny of Big Tech.' The publisher said it values publishing diverse view points. 'At the same time, we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens and cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom,' it said in a statement. Hawley responded by calling the decision a 'direct assault on the First Amendment.' 'I will fight this cancel culture with everything I have.

But the social media posts of one advocated that people take up arms, and posts by another showed a belief in the false allegations of election fraud, Rebecca Tan, Steve Thompson and Antonio Olivo report. Greeson's wife, Kristi Greeson, said her husband's only goal was to show support for Trump. … Her husband, who worked as a salesman in the steel and aluminum industry, 'had a history of high blood pressure, and in the midst of the excitement, suffered a heart attack,' she added. But Greeson appeared to have an account on the right-wing social media site Parler filled with recent obscene and violent posts, fueled by misinformation spread by right-wing radio host Mark Levin, the Proud Boys and others. …\n\nAtlanta TV stations on Thursday night quoted Boyland's brother-in-law, Justin Cave, who blamed Trump for inciting a riot that led to the death of Boyland, who he described as 'very passionate about her beliefs.' A Facebook page belonging to a Rosanne Boyland in Kennesaw features several pro-Trump posts and includes a false assertion that D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) ordered hotels and other businesses to close in advance of Wednesday's rally. … Philips, the 50-year-old from Pennsylvania, was a computer programmer and an ardent Trump supporter. He had helped to organize transportation for dozens of people traveling from Pennsylvania to D.C., the Philadelphia Inquirer reported … but after arriving in the city on Wednesday, he left the group. When it was time to drive back home, people who had traveled with him said they received a call from D.C. police informing them that Philips had suffered a stroke and died at George Washington University Hospital … 'It seems like the first day of the rest of our lives,' Philips told an Inquirer reporter while traveling to D.C. on Wednesday morning. 'They should name this year Zero because something will happen.'\n\nThe coronavirus\n\nAdding insult to injury, scientists fear the riot was a superspreader event.\n\nThe coronavirus thrives indoors, particularly in crowded spaces, lingering in the air in tiny particles called aerosols. If even a few extremists were infected — likely, given the current rates of spread and the crowd size — then the virus would have had the ideal opportunity to find new victims, experts said, the Times reports. Hundreds of rioters shouting in crowded rooms and hallways for extended periods of time can infect dozens of people at once. … Infected members of Congress and law enforcement could have spread the virus to one another as they sheltered from the violence … Rep. Jake LaTurner, Republican of Kansas, announced on Twitter early Thursday morning that he had tested positive for the virus. Mr. LaTurner was cloistered in the chamber with other members of Congress for much of the day. At least a dozen of the 400 or so lawmakers and staff who were huddling in one committee room refused to wear masks even after being offered one, or wore them improperly below their chins, said Representative Susan Wild, Democrat of Pennsylvania.\n\nResearchers point to asymptomatic cases as major spreaders.\n\nAs the United States marked another grim milestone Thursday with more than 4,000 covid-19 deaths reported in a single day, federal disease trackers said research suggests that people without symptoms transmit more than half of all cases of the novel coronavirus, Brittany Shammas and Ben Guarino report. The findings, which came from a model developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, demonstrate the importance of following the agency's guidelines about wearing a mask and maintaining social distance. … In the past seven days, U.S. infections, hospitalizations and deaths have hit record highs. Cases reached a record 277,135 on Saturday. And by Thursday, more than 132,000 people were hospitalized in the nation with covid-19 …\n\nThere is no evidence that the surge is being driven by the more contagious strain, known as B117, because if it were, it would have turned up in more of the genomic sequences analyzed by researchers in recent weeks. But health officials fear the variant could make a bad situation worse … On Thursday, three states — Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Texas — reported detecting B117, joining California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia and New York. … 'We are in a race against time,' said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. … As of Thursday, more than 21 million doses of coronavirus vaccine had been distributed to states, and just under 6 million had been administered, according to CDC data.\n\nThe Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears to protect against the new variants.\n\nBoth the U.K. and South African variants contain a mutation of the spike protein that is commonly referred to as N501Y, and may be the key factor that makes both variants especially transmissible. In a study that has not yet been peer-reviewed, scientists from Pfizer and the University of Texas Medical Branch took blood samples from participants who had received the vaccine during clinical trials and found that the vaccine effectively neutralized the virus with the N501Y mutation, Antonia Farzan reports. But as the study's authors note, there are numerous other mutations found in the new variants that the vaccine has not yet been tested against. They conclude that 'continuous monitoring' is necessary, as a future mutation could prove resistant to the vaccine. Even if that is the case, it's not necessarily as alarming as it sounds. BioNTech's chief executive said in December that it would only take the company about six weeks to retool the vaccine to protect against a new strain if necessary.\n\nThe human body typically retains a robust immune response to the coronavirus for at least eight months after an infection, and potentially much longer, researchers said in a study published in the journal Science.

Against the backdrop of the American withdrawal from Syria and President Trump's musings about pulling out of NATO, it adds up to a strategic bonanza for Vladimir Putin and his vision of a revanchist Russia.\n\nWe don't know exactly how much Moscow spent supporting influence operations to impact the U.K. and U.S. elections in 2016, but it seems hard to overstate how good the Kremlin's return has been on what Western intelligence agencies believe was a relatively modest investment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRussian efforts to manipulate American voters during the last presidential campaign have been aggressively covered in this space, but the Kremlin's bid to boost Brexit was perhaps even more brazen. The Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a meaty report last year about Russian influence operations overseas, but it was largely overshadowed by bombshells stemming from special counsel Bob Mueller's investigation. The 206-page report outlines Russian disinformation campaigns across 19 countries. It highlights loopholes in U.K. campaign finance laws that might have allowed an influx of Russian money to boost the referendum. That's not to mention the propaganda from Russian-run Twitter and Facebook accounts, plus state-funded media.\n\nThe allegations that have emerged of Russian interference prior to the Brexit referendum are all the more stunning given the innate resilience within British society to the Kremlin's anti-democratic agenda, the senators concluded in their report. Never before in American history has so clear a threat to national security been so clearly ignored by a U.S. president.\n\nTrump said Monday that he has never worked for Russia.\n\nThe Post's Adam Taylor explains why British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a no-confidence vote after Parliament weighed in on her Brexit deal Jan. 15. (Sarah Parnass, Karla Adam/The Washington Post)\n\n-- May's plan to ease Britain out of the European Union went down 432 to 202 on Tuesday evening. The landslide vote was pure humiliation for a British leader who has spent the past two years trying to sell her vision of Brexit to a skeptical public, and her failure raised serious questions about how — and if — Britain will leave the E.U. as promised on March 29, William Booth, Karla Adam and Michael Birnbaum report. The political turmoil heightened fears among European leaders that Britain will crash out of the bloc in a chaotic, no-deal departure that would have harsh economic and humanitarian consequences on both sides of the English Channel.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- Putin has been especially angry with May, the leader of the Conservative Party, since she showed backbone and resolve against Moscow by stiffening sanctions after the nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury. At his year-end news conference, Putin attacked the elites in London and Washington for resisting the will of their voters by trying to delegitimize the election of Trump and back out of Brexit. They don't want to recognize his victory. That's disrespect of voters, Putin said of the American president. The same in Britain: Brexit happened, but no one wants to implement it. … She must enact the will of the people, expressed during the referendum.\n\n-- The latest Brexit breakdown followed a New York Times report earlier Tuesday that Trump has been more serious than previously understood about wanting to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Current and former officials who support the alliance said they feared Mr. Trump could return to his threat as allied military spending continued to lag behind the goals the president had set, Julian Barnes and Helene Cooper report. There are few things that [Putin] desires more than the weakening of NATO … American national security officials believe that Russia has largely focused on undermining solidarity between the United States and Europe after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Its goal was to upend NATO. … An American withdrawal from the alliance would accomplish all that Mr. Putin has been trying to put into motion, the officials said — essentially, doing the Russian leader's hardest and most critical work for him.\n\nFormer secretary of defense Jim Mattis specifically mentioned the imperative of NATO in his resignation letter, explaining that the strength of the United States is inextricably linked to our unique and comprehensive system of alliances.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- Because of their fealty to Trump, many conservative platforms have become less outspoken about the threat posed by Russia since Barack Obama left office. Fox News host Tucker Carlson devoted an entire segment on his show last night to questioning the value of NATO. He wondered aloud why the United States should commit resources to safeguard the territorial integrity of Estonia. Backing up Trump, Carlson wondered: Does the average American know we're on the hook for this?\n\n-- The former president of Estonia, now a fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution, responded by highlighting the casualties his country has suffered in support of the U.S.-led mission in Afghanistan:\n\n-- The NATO alliance depends on deterrence, and that depends on the credibility of the mutual-defense pact. If Putin doesn't think the United States will use force to defend the tiny Baltic states if he were to invade, as required under Article V, millions of freedom-loving Europeans are more likely to fall under the yoke of Putin's authoritarian rule.\n\n-- Many Republicans, especially those who have served in uniform, understand this. We got through a Cold War without firing a shot with the Russians because of the existence of NATO, Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said on MSNBC's Morning Joe. That's our frontier there. Protecting the democracies of NATO, like protecting our own elections, is extremely essential.\n\n-- In a Tuesday afternoon rebuke of the Trump administration, 11 Republican senators joined all their Democratic colleagues in voting to keep sanctions in place on companies owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, an ally of Putin. The New York Times's Ken Vogel reports: The 11 Republican votes allowed Senate Democrats to advance a measure that would reverse a decision last month by the Treasury Department to lift sanctions that it imposed last year on companies controlled by [Deripaska], including the aluminum giant Rusal. … The measure still needs to clear several more hurdles, and proponents need to attract at least two more Republican votes to win final passage in the Senate. But Tuesday's vote was a symbolic crack in the Republican Party, and came despite opposition from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a last-ditch plea by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- Meanwhile, a model whose alleged affair with Deripaska made her an unexpected player in the Russia probes, pleaded guilty Tuesday in Thailand to charges linked to a sex training seminar, setting the stage for her deportation. Anton Troianovski, Rosalind S. Helderman and Shibani Mahtani report: The self-described sex expert from Belarus, Anastasia Vashukevich, claimed that she recorded meetings between [Deripaska] and unspecified Americans in 2016 to discuss Russian interference in the U.S. election. Vashukevich posted video of Deripaska meeting with a senior Russian official on a yacht, but Deripaska has denied wrongdoing, and no evidence has emerged that she possessed any new details about the election. … Vashukevich's claims about recording Deripaska were notable because the oligarch has ties to [Putin] and used to work with President Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. … It was not immediately clear where Vashukevich, a citizen of Belarus, would be sent. A friend, Gregory Kogan, said Vashukevich was hoping to be deported somewhere other than Russia.\n\n-- Deripaska's aluminum empire … has quietly installed a new board chairman who has expressed support for the Russian aggression that got Deripaska sanctioned in the first place, the Daily Beast reports this morning: Jean-Pierre Thomas has also become a regular on Russian state TV, pushing a conspiracy theory about chemical weapons in Syria, and asserting that the Russian government couldn't have been involved in the poisoning of [Skripal]. That background … has concerned lawmakers as well as Western intelligence officials.\n\nAt a yearly news conference Dec. 20, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the world is seeing tectonic shifts in the West, but that some are denying them. (Reuters)\n\n-- Information is power: While the U.S. government has no detailed records of Trump's five face-to-face interactions with Putin over the past two years, experts agree that the Russian regime almost certainly does. The interpreters working for Soviet leaders were trained to take nearly verbatim stenographic notes, Troianovski reports. Declassified Soviet records of Cold War talks are often more detailed than official American notes on the same conversations, said Svetlana Savranskaya, the director of Russia programs at the National Security Archive at George Washington University. Savranskaya said she assumed that Putin's interpreters follow the Soviet tradition. Moscow, then, may well possess a far more detailed record of Putin's talks with Trump than does Washington — where senior officials are said to be still searching for details about what exactly the two have discussed.\n\nIn Parliament Jan. 14, British Prime Minister Theresa May said leaving the European Union without a deal would put the future of our union at risk. (Reuters)\n\n-- What's next for Brexit? Booth, Adam and Birnbaum report from London: Hardcore Brexiteers, such as former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, cheered the result as increasing the chances of Britain leaving the European Union with no deal and no compromises — or with a much, much better deal than May or E.U. leaders say is realistic. At the same time, those who want to see a second referendum on Brexit, and who want to stay in the union, think May's loss gets them closer to their goal. … Historians had to go as far back as the Victorian age to find a comparable party split and parliamentary defeat — to Prime Minister William Gladstone's support for Irish home rule in 1886, which cut the Liberal Party in two. …\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the House of Commons on Tuesday, May stood almost alone, flashing defiance and frustration, as many in her own party abandoned their leader. … She has until Monday to return with a Plan B. Her office has been tight-lipped about what alternatives she might offer. May said she would reach out to members of Parliament to find out what kind of Brexit deal, if any, they would endorse. … Jeremy Corbyn, the opposition Labour Party leader … introduced a motion of no confidence, to be debated and voted upon Wednesday. Afterward, leaders of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which props up May's minority government, announced that they would support the prime minister, thereby making her ouster unlikely.\n\n-- The president of the European Council is suggesting that Britain should just give up on Brexit:\n\n-- Widening the aperture: Brexit has been a catastrophic political failure, writes columnist Anne Applebaum. This messy, unpopular deal, the most unpopular government policy that anybody can remember, was produced by a political class that turned out to be ignorant — about Europe, Europeans, trade arrangements, institutions — and arrogant, disdaining knowledge and expertise. It was the work of leaders who favored identity politics over economics, who preferred an undefined notion of 'sovereignty' to the real institutions that gave Britain influence and power, who believed in fantasies and scorned reality. Time that could have been spent on other things — on debating defense, or poverty, or clean beaches — has been wasted on a policy that won't make Britain happier, wealthier or stronger. Instead, this long debate has produced confusion and gridlock. And after Tuesday's vote, more of that is coming.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- The bigger picture: The two most important beacons of freedom in the world are dimming. And just as the seas become more dangerous when lighthouses go dark, the same is true on the increasingly stormy world stage. Will January 2019 be remembered as the month that the West came unmoored? Previous generations had Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt. Harold Macmillan and John Kennedy. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.

It echoed a September 2013 attack by the group at the Westgate shopping mall just a mile away, in which fighters armed with automatic weapons killed 67.\n\n-- The Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide blast in Syria's U.S.-patrolled city of Manbij, marking the first such attack since Trump said American forces would be withdrawing from the country because the militant group has been defeated. Louisa Loveluck reports: A statement published by the militants' unofficial news agency, Amaq, said the attacker used an explosive vest to target coalition forces. … Photographs from the area appeared to show bodies and blood trails strewn across the ground. It was not immediately clear whether U.S. personnel were in the area at the time. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 19 people were wounded or killed in the blast.

(Wall Street Journal)\n\nAs the longest shutdown in history continues, President Trump's options for reopening the government are becoming limited. Here are a few paths he could take. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\n\nSHUTDOWN LATEST:\n\n-- Trump is recalling nearly 50,000 government employees — but won't pay them while they work — to soften the impact of the shutdown in a move that could reduce political pressure to compromise. Erica Werner reports: The nearly 50,000 furloughed federal employees are being brought back to work without pay — part of a group of about 800,000 federal workers who are not receiving paychecks during the shutdown, which is affecting dozens of federal agencies large and small. A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a bid by unions representing air traffic controllers and other federal workers to force the government to pay them if they are required to work. The efforts by the Trump administration to keep the government operating during the partial shutdown came as the White House and Congress made no progress toward resolving their underlying dispute.\n\n[Trump] extended an unusual lunch invitation to a handful of rank-and-file House Democrats in an attempt to woo them and create a divide within the Democratic camp over the shutdown. But the lawmakers rebuffed the outreach as Democratic leaders voiced concerns the meeting would prove little more than a photo opportunity bolstering Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- Senate Republicans have largely stood by Mitch McConnell as he refuses to get involved in negotiations to end the shutdown. Sean Sullivan reports: By choice, the Senate majority leader has stepped away from the talks to resolve the impasse over $5.7 billion for [Trump's] border wall, which is at the core of the dispute, while refusing to vote on House bills to reopen the government. Trump wants wall funding. Democrats don't. McConnell is leaving it to them to work it out. Still, he has retained the support of most fellow Republican senators, who appear to be largely united behind his strategy, despite some growing concerns about the impact of the lapse in government services. One after another, McConnell's top lieutenants took turns speaking after him Tuesday, blaming Democrats for the shutdown and standing in lockstep with the majority leader.\n\n-- The 2020 Senate map may provide an explanation for why Republican senators are largely sticking with Trump's demands for a wall, Paul Kane writes. Out of 22 Republican seats up in 2020, 18 are from states that Trump won by comfortable margins. Just two, Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), are running in states that Democrat Hillary Clinton won in 2016. … Two other Republicans, Sens. Thom Tillis (N.C.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), are running next year in states where Trump won by less than five percentage points. … That makes it unsurprising to see Collins, Gardner and Tillis as part of a group trying to jump-start bipartisan talks to find a resolution to the impasse, talks that so far have produced nothing tangible. But very few other Republicans feel any discernible political pressure to buckle to Democratic demands, despite national polling that shows Trump getting crushed during this [shutdown].\n\n-- In another sign of how long the shutdown could continue, both supporters and opponents of the border wall are against making concessions on the issue. The Pew Research Center reports: Nearly nine-in-ten (88%) opponents of expanding the border wall say it would not be acceptable to pass a bill that includes [Trump's] request for wall funding, if that is the only way to end the shutdown. Among the smaller group of wall supporters, 72% say a bill to end the shutdown would be unacceptable if it does not include Trump's funding request.\n\n-- The shutdown is making many federal workers reconsider their decision to work for the government. Todd C. Frankel, Taylor Telford and Danielle Paquette report: A job in the government has long been underwritten by the understanding that while you wouldn't strike it rich on the federal pay scale, you also didn't need to worry about the corporate world's mercurial whims. The focus was on serving the public, rather than pursuing profits. The pace could be frustratingly inefficient, but it also was not maddeningly chaotic. And the trade-off came with solid health and retirement benefits. That grand bargain — deployed for decades to lure talent into the government ranks — is threatened today by a bruising shutdown with no end in sight.\n\n-- The lettuce industry is demanding the FDA be allowed to return to work out of fear of another E. coli outbreak. Joel Achenbach reports: Three times in the past year, the industry has been roiled by foodborne-illness outbreaks linked to U.S.-grown romaine lettuce contaminated with a toxic strain of E. coli bacteria. … The outbreaks remain mysterious. The FDA's investigations have produced plausible theories but nothing conclusive about how, when and where the bacteria contaminated the lettuce. … That's a source of consternation for the $2 billion leafy greens industry, which desperately wants to avoid a repeat of what happened last year and is counting on the FDA for help. But because of the federal shutdown, the agency has barely been in the game.\n\n-- Flight-safety systems are feeling the strain of the shutdown, but aviation authorities insist the skies are safe. Michael Laris, Ashley Halsey III and Lori Aratani report: The Federal Aviation Administration is calling back thousands of furloughed inspectors to address safety concerns, and airport security checkpoints have been shut down and agents redeployed as the impacts of the nation's longest government shutdown intensify. Key work to improve safety has been stalled, and passengers have occasionally faced painful delays that could worsen as the shutdown continues and more workers who continue their jobs without pay decide it's no longer worthwhile to do so. While air traffic controllers say they have been keeping the nation's airspace as safe as before the shutdown, they question how long that can be sustained.\n\n-- It turns out the shutdown is having a far more pronounced effect on economic growth than previously estimated, a loss that could push the U.S. economy into a retraction. The New York Times's Jim Tankersley reports: Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said on Tuesday that the administration now calculates that the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points for every week that it lasts — the cumulative effect of lost work from contractors and furloughed federal employees who are not getting paid and who are investing and spending less as a result. That means that the economy has already lost nearly half a percentage point of growth from the four-week shutdown. …\n\nMr. Hassett said it was possible that the damage could grow. He also said much of the damage should be repaired once the shutdown ends and workers get back pay. But he acknowledged that the shutdown could permanently reduce growth expectations if businesses and markets begin to expect that Congress and the president will repeat the experience again and again. Some economists have begun to warn that such a situation is likely and that economic confidence could be undermined as businesses, consumers and investors lose faith in the ability of political leaders to find agreement on issues like raising the federal debt limit and approving trade deals. That lack of confidence could snowball into a self-inflicted economic contraction on the heels of what appears to have been the nation's strongest year of growth since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS:\n\n-- Trump's immigration agenda — which is what the shutdown is really all about — sustained another blow as a federal judge blocked his administration's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Tara Bahrampour reports: Judge Jesse M. Furman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the administration Tuesday to stop its plans to add the question to the survey. Calling Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross's decision to add the question 'arbitrary and capricious,' he blasted Ross for 'egregious' violations of the Administrative Procedure Act. The New York case is the first of three high-profile trials around the country that are challenging the question and is likely to be a road map for the others, legal experts say. … The government will probably appeal Tuesday's ruling all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n-- The decision also suggested the commerce secretary obfuscated the decision-making process behind adding the citizenship question. Fred Barbash reports: Ross told Congress that he was considering adding the question at the request of the Justice Department so it could better identify violations of the Voting Rights Act, which protects minority voting rights. … What really happened, though, was much different, according to the opinion and the accompanying exhibits and testimony. Shortly after assuming office in February 2017, Ross asked his deputy chief of staff, Earl Comstock, why there was no citizenship question on the census. … Soon after, Wilbur heard from, among others, White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Kris Kobach, then-Kansas secretary of state appointed by [Trump] to investigate voter fraud. They wanted him to add a question. … So Ross did not act 'solely' at the request of the Justice Department. The Justice Department acted at his request.\n\n-- Trump's efforts to remake the immigration system through executive power have been repeatedly thwarted by the federal courts, David Nakamura notes. This ruling extends a string of setbacks, as federal courts have halted the president's efforts to end a deferred-action program for young undocumented immigrants, bar Central Americans from seeking asylum in the United States, withhold funds from 'sanctuary cities' that do not cooperate with federal enforcement operations and separate immigrant families at the border. … More broadly, Trump's struggles have highlighted the evolution of how presidents have dealt with immigration since Congress passed the last major overhaul of the system nearly three decades ago. The collapse of efforts at comprehensive legislation during the presidencies of George W. Bush and [Barack] Obama have led to efforts to make bolder changes through executive power.\n\n-- Last night, another federal judge has temporarily halted the deportation of Roxana Orellana Santos, a Salvadoran immigrant who was first targeted for removal after Maryland sheriff's deputies unlawfully arrested her a decade ago. Arelis R. Hernández reports: The order by U.S. District Judge Catherine C. Blake will expire after 10 days but can be renewed. The government's efforts to deport Santos come as her attorneys are attempting to negotiate damages in her civil rights case against the Frederick County Sheriff's Office. Santos, a mother of four, was detained by two deputies in 2008 and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A federal court found her arrest — while she was sitting on the curb outside the restaurant where she worked as a dishwasher — violated her civil rights and said the county government was liable for damages.\n\nAttorney general nominee William P. Barr faced questions about his independence, the special counsel investigation and more at his confirmation hearing Jan. 15. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- At his confirmation hearing, attorney general nominee William Barr pledged he would allow special counsel Bob Mueller to finish his investigation, but Barr warned that Mueller's findings might not be made entirely public. Devlin Barrett, Karoun Demirjian, Matt Zapotosky and Seung Min Kim report: The remarks by Barr, who is expected to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, highlight the uncertainty surrounding how he will grapple with what many expect will be the final steps of Mueller's investigation … Barr pledged at his confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee to keep politics out of Justice Department decisions about criminal investigations. He said he would allow Mueller, whom he called a longtime friend, to finish his work, but Democrats expressed concern that, if confirmed, Barr might not follow the advice of the agency's ethics officials.\n\nThroughout the nine-hour hearing, Barr lavished praise on Mueller, noting that under the regulations he could fire the special counsel only for good cause, adding: 'Frankly, it's unimaginable to me that Bob would do anything that gave rise to good cause.' Barr, 68, said he would not 'be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong' — by Congress, the media or the president. Lawmakers repeatedly pressed him about the report Mueller is expected to produce at the end of his investigation. In a sign of potential fights to come, Barr said any report from Mueller would probably be treated like internal Justice Department prosecution memos that are kept secret. … Barr said the attorney general is responsible for notifying Congress and reporting 'certain information' once the investigation ends, and he sought to assure lawmakers that he would be as transparent as regulations allow.\n\n-- A new court filing from Mueller's prosecutors indicates they have extensive knowledge about Paul Manafort that has not been made public. Spencer S. Hsu reports: Although heavily redacted, the documents state that Manafort, Trump's former campaign chairman, claimed he was trying to get people appointed in the new presidential administration. The filing also states that in another Justice Department investigation, Manafort provided information that appears related to an event while he was with the campaign in August 2016. … Prosecutors filed a 31-page affidavit from an FBI agent, plus another 406 nearly fully blacked-out exhibits, after a federal judge last week ordered them to lay out the 'factual and evidentiary basis' for their claims that Manafort lied repeatedly after his plea deal and has breached his cooperation agreement. The filing in federal court in Washington asserts that Manafort shifted answers to questions posed by the FBI and Mueller probe investigators, prompting his lawyers to pull him aside on several occasions to review statements.\n\n-- Mueller has issued more subpoenas to associates of conservative writer Jerome Corsi, indicating the special counsel is still zeroing in on the actions of Roger Stone. ABC News's Ali Dukakis reports: Copies of those subpoenas delivered to two individuals late last year bear Mueller's name and call for the retention and producing of documents, communication logs and other records involving two people: Corsi and Stone. The two individuals, whose names have not been publicly released, also testified before Mueller's grand jury in December, according to the subpoenas and three sources who confirmed their attendance.\n\n-- Michael Cohen's congressional testimony next month will probably be highly restricted to avoid interfering with Mueller's probe. The Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus and Nicole Hong report: Mr. Cohen, who is scheduled to speak in an open hearing on Capitol Hill for the first time Feb. 7, won't be able to talk about topics that he has discussed with [Mueller], according to a person close to Mr. Cohen. He also may be limited in what he can say about the continuing Manhattan U.S. attorney's office investigation … [But] he is expected to give an explosive recounting of his experience working for Mr. Trump. His testimony is expected to focus on his life story, examining how he went from serving as one of Mr. Trump's most loyal aides for more than a decade to publicly breaking with him last year and implicating him in two federal crimes.\n\n-- Acting attorney general Matt Whitaker will publicly testify before Congress next month. Karoun Demirjian reports: Whitaker's planned Feb. 8 testimony comes after several weeks of scrabbling between the Justice Department and the [House Judiciary Committee], as House Democrats accused the acting attorney general of stalling and the Justice Department argued that the government shutdown was complicating efforts to commit to a date. Subpoenas were threatened — though Whitaker eventually agreed to the session without one being issued.\n\n-- The sentencing of Manafort's former deputy Rick Gates was once again delayed. Hsu reports: 'Defendant Gates continues to cooperate with respect to several ongoing investigations, and accordingly the parties do not believe it is appropriate to commence the sentencing process,' [Mueller's prosecutors and Gates's attorneys] wrote in a one-page update for U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District. The reference to Gates's cooperation echoed language used in November, suggesting his assistance extended beyond the testimony he gave in Manafort's August trial in Virginia.\n\n-- Conservative lawyer David French in National Review: The FBI's Counterintelligence Investigation of Trump Was Prudent and Proper.\n\nSCORE SETTLING:\n\n-- In his forthcoming book, Chris Christie trains his fire on Jared Kushner. He blames the president's son in-law for denying him the vice presidency and for the hit job that got him fired as chairman of the Trump transition team right after the 2016 election. When he was a U.S. attorney, Christie sent Jared's dad, Charles Kushner, to prison in 2005. The former New Jersey governor argues that many of Trump's biggest mistakes from the past two years were Kushner's fault because he was so far in over his head. The Guardian's Ed Pilkington and Martin Pengelly obtained an advance copy of Let Me Finish, whose publication date is Jan. 29:\n\nIn one of the most visceral passages of the book, Christie recounts for the first time how Jared Kushner badmouthed him to Trump in April 2016. … Remarkably, he did so while Christie was in the room. 'He implied I had acted unethically and inappropriately but didn't state one fact to back that up,' Christie writes. 'Just a lot of feelings — very raw feelings that had been simmering for a dozen years.' Kushner went on to tell Trump that it wasn't fair his father spent so long in prison. He insisted the sex tape and blackmailing was a family matter that should have been kept away from federal authorities: 'This was a family matter, a matter to be handled by the family or by the rabbis.' Trump, in an effort to settle the dispute, proposed a dinner between him, Jared and Charles Kushner, and Christie. Much to Christie's relief, Jared didn't acquiesce.\n\nThe article about the book lays out several previously unknown examples of Trump humiliating Christie. Remember the meatloaf incident? At his first meeting with Trump in 2002, at a dinner in the Trump International Hotel and Tower, in New York, Trump ordered his food for him. He chose scallops, to which Christie is allergic, and lamb which he has always detested. Christie recalls wondering whether Trump took him to be 'one of his chicks.' At another dinner three years later, Trump told the obese Christie he had to lose weight. Addressing him like one of the contestants in Miss Universe, Trump said 'you gotta look better to be able to win' in politics. Trump returned to the theme of girth during the 2016 presidential campaign, exhorting Christie to wear a longer tie as it would make him look thinner.\n\nChristie says Mike Pence, who became VP instead of him and then took over the transition team after he was ousted, had a thrown-together approach that led to bad hiring decisions over and over again. He calls Jeff Sessions not-ready-for-prime-time. Christie also calls Michael Flynn a train wreck from beginning to end … a slow-motion car crash, as well as the Russian lackey and future federal felon. In Christie's telling, Kushner said firing Flynn would end talk of links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Again, the president was ill served by poor advice, Christie says.\n\nChristie writes that he turned down Trump when he was offered the job of special assistant to the president in the White House: Christie would have taken chair of the Republican National Committee and seemed poised to get it, per the Guardian. But according to Christie, once again Trump's family worked against him. In a near-comic scene, Reince Priebus, the RNC chair who would become Trump's first chief of staff, offers him role after role in a frantic attempt to [fulfill] the directive from Trump to 'make Chris happy.' One by one, Christie turns down labor secretary, homeland security secretary and ambassadorships in Rome and the Vatican.\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa) on Jan. 15 said he planned to vote yes on a resolution meant to rebuke his previous comments on white nationalism and white supremacy (C-SPAN)\n\nON CAPITOL HILL:\n\n-- The House voted overwhelmingly to condemn comments from Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) questioning how terms such as white nationalist came to be considered offensive. Mike DeBonis and John Wagner report: Before the House voted 424 to 1 Tuesday to condemn the substance of King's recent remarks, a chastened but unapologetic King went to the House floor to say that he would support the resolution while continuing to say that he had been misquoted … But that explanation came too late for his own Republican colleagues, not to mention scores of Democrats who are ready to pursue more serious actions against King, including censure — the most serious House sanction short of expulsion. Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.), the third-ranking House Republican, called Tuesday for King to 'find another line of work,' a day after King earned a similar rebuke from [McConnell]. … King remained defiant later Tuesday in an interview with conservative radio host Ed Martin. 'What are they going to do next?' he said. 'After they get done telling me to resign, they'll realize that's not going to happen.'\n\n-- Some are wondering why it took Republican leadership so long to rebuke King, who has a long record of racially offensive comments. The New York Times's Jonathan Martin reports: The confluence of his closer-than-expected re-election, the devastating losses House Republicans suffered with educated and minority voters in November and the blunt-force nature of what he does not deny saying has made Mr. King toxic in his party's caucus. Yet even as it became clear that his fate may be sealed, many Democrats and, more quietly, some Republicans were wondering why he survived as long as he has given his 15-year record of making what were at a minimum racially provocative comments. Case in point: In 2013, King once said young migrants had calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\n\n-- The editorial boards of the Des Moines Register and, more importantly, the Sioux City Journal both called on King to resign. The Register's board writes: He has lost even the potential to effectively represent his Iowa constituents because of his abhorrent comments about white nationalism and white supremacy. The move by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to strip King of his committee assignments leaves Iowa without a seat on the vital House Agriculture Committee, as well as judiciary. It also leaves King with far less opportunity to work for his constituents on critically important rural development issues. … [Iowa Republicans] should encourage him to step aside for the good of the Republican Party and, more importantly, for the good of Iowa.\n\n-- If you come at the queen, you best not miss: Nancy Pelosi blocked one of her most outspoken critics, Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), from joining the House Judiciary Committee. Politico's Heather Caygle, Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan report: Pelosi lobbied for other members to join the panel over Rice, leaving the third-term New York Democrat off a list of her preferred members for the committee during a tense closed-door meeting Tuesday night, according to multiple sources. The effort came despite a full-court push from the New York delegation to secure a spot for Rice, a former prosecutor, on the panel that oversees everything from impeachment to guns to immigration. The push by Pelosi was seen as payback by many in the room after Rice was one of the main megaphones behind a campaign to block the California Democrat from becoming speaker again. … It was also the latest slight for New York members, who were still upset that another member of their delegation, freshman Rep. Anthony Brindisi, was blocked from getting on the Armed Services Committee on Monday night.\n\n-- The addition of several progressive Democrats to the influential House Financial Services Committee could pose a challenge for Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt and Heather Caygle report: Waters, a Los Angeles Democrat, is a liberal icon in her own right. But as head of the committee, she will also have to play the role of peacemaker to bring together the new members with moderates on the panel — some of whom are wary of primary threats stoked by their colleagues on the left. In addition to [Rep. Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez, attention-grabbing freshmen Reps. Katie Porter (D-Calif.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) are all expected to land spots on the committee, which oversees Wall Street and the nation's housing market.\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) announced she would run for president. Jenna Johnson reports: She told host Stephen Colbert on CBS's 'Late Show' that she believes she has 'the compassion, the courage and the fearless determination' necessary. 'The first thing I would do is restore what's been lost: the integrity and the compassion in this country,' she said. 'I would bring people together to start getting things done.' … With the announcement made, Gillibrand plans to spend time with her husband and two sons on Wednesday in Troy, N.Y., where she lives and where her campaign will be headquartered. On Friday, she will start a three-day tour of Iowa.\n\n-- The issues of paid family leave and sexual assault, which Gillibrand has focused on in the Senate, are expected to feature heavily in her campaign. Jeff Stein reports: In 2010, Gillibrand released a bill to create America's first universal paid family leave program. … Gillibrand has reintroduced the legislation in every Congress since 2010, and it was co-sponsored by about a dozen other senators last year, including at least four who are running or considered to be running for president. The plan is likely to be a prominent feature of her presidential campaign. … Gillibrand has also advanced legislation related to the #MeToo movement and issues of sexual misconduct, including a bill that passed last year to address widespread criticisms of Congress's process for handling sexual misconduct.\n\n-- Potential presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke has been highly critical of Trump's wall, but he has struggled to come up with his own ideas on to improve the immigration system — including how to deal with something like visa overstays. Jenna Johnson went down to the border with the former congressman: When it comes to many of the biggest policy issues facing the country today, O'Rourke's default stance is to call for a debate — even on issues related to the border and immigration, which he has heavily emphasized in videos posted to Facebook and Instagram over the past month. O'Rourke's approach reflects how he is likely to handle issues should he launch a presidential campaign. Beyond a few mainstream Democratic stances — including closing private immigration prisons, allowing undocumented immigrants to become citizens and modernizing the work visa system — O'Rourke insists the thorny immigration answers will come from everyday Americans. It's an approach that puts off specifics that might define him or narrow his appeal in a presidential race — but O'Rourke says he is being open-minded, as he wishes more politicians would be.\n\nJenna's kicker says it all: Throughout the two-hour interview — which was often interrupted by bystanders urging him to run for president — O'Rourke boomeranged between a bright-eyed hope that the United States will soon dramatically change its approach to a whole host of issues and a dismal suspicion that the country is now incapable of implementing sweeping change. When asked which it is, O'Rourke paused. 'I'm hesitant to answer it because I really feel like it deserves its due, and I don't want to give you a — actually, just selfishly, I don't want a sound bite of it reported, but, yeah, I think that's the question of the moment: Does this still work?' O'Rourke said. 'Can an empire like ours with military presence in over 170 countries around the globe, with trading relationships … and security agreements in every continent, can it still be managed by the same principles that were set down 230-plus years ago?' O'Rourke doesn't yet know the answer, but he's ready to discuss it.\n\n-- Another potential presidential hopeful, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), is planning visits to the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. BuzzFeed News's Henry J. Gomez reports: The Democrat's political team shared details Tuesday, and Brown made an announcement during primetime on Chris Hayes' MSNBC show, affording him an audience of the liberal and progressive voters he will need to impress to stand out in a crowded field. … Brown told Hayes that his wife, journalist Connie Schultz, would accompany him. When Hayes mentioned it sounded like the launch of a presidential campaign, Brown demurred. 'Connie and I have not made that decision,' he said. Brown will kick off what he's calling The Dignity of Work Tour in his home city of Cleveland on Jan. 30 and then go to Iowa on Jan. 31.\n\n-- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti's presidential ambitions could be hindered by the FBI's inquiries about possible corruption among city officials. The LA Times's Emily Alpert Reyes and David Zahniser report: If Garcetti runs for president, he could also face uncomfortable questions about a topic that has gripped City Hall: Why are FBI agents seeking evidence of bribes, extortion and money laundering possibly involving L.A. city officials? And why are two of his appointees — one current, one former — being scrutinized in that probe? Two months after FBI agents raided the home and offices of City Councilman Jose Huizar, no one has been arrested and no charges have been publicly filed. But as new details emerge about the probe, the investigation could nonetheless be a drag on the careers of politicians looking to keep their jobs or move up the ladder.\n\n-- Vogue profiles Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) as she moves toward a likely presidential bid. The magazine's Julia Felsenthal reports: Klobuchar's starring role in Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings … combined with her impressive midterm margins in Minnesota, an increasingly purple state that seems a microcosm of the rest of the country, has shot her name to the top of the 2020 presidential wish list, particularly among those who believe that the path to Democratic victory runs through the industrial Midwest (where Obama won and Hillary Clinton mostly lost).\n\n-- Despite their losses last year, former gubernatorial candidates Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum are being sought after by presidential candidates for endorsements. Politico's Marc Caputo and Daniel Strauss report: The pair of young, progressive African-American pols amassed so much political fame that they're a must-call for the growing roster of likely Democratic presidential contenders. They're also on some early and unofficial lists as possible vice-presidential running mates. … The attention Abrams and Gillum are receiving from presidential hopefuls is an indication of the growing pull of the party's progressive base and highlights the role each could play as gatekeepers for African-American and liberal voters. In a crowded Democratic primary, that could make them kingmakers for a candidate lucky enough to score an endorsement or, at least, anchors who keep the candidates moored to a liberal agenda.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nRepublican lawmakers do not look prepared to budge on reopening the government, per a Post reporter:\n\nOne of Trump's closest congressional allies slammed Democratic lawmakers who snubbed the president's lunch invitation to discuss the shutdown impasse:\n\nA Democratic congresswoman made this request of a far-right pundit:\n\nAnother House Democrat shared a story from one of her constituents:\n\nThe commandant of the Coast Guard recognized service members going without pay:\n\nA HuffPost editor suggested that the United States and Britain swap lawmakers:\n\nA PBS NewsHour reporter noted Barr's shifting stance on border security:\n\nDemocratic senators expressed concerns about Trump's attorney general nominee as he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee:\n\nA Post reporter compared recent filings from Mueller's prosecutors and Manafort's legal team:\n\nA New York Times reporter explained the current power structure at the White House:\n\nA House Democrat said it was an easy call to denounce Steve King:\n\nTrump's campaign manager mocked John Kasich as the president's potential primary rival became a CNN commentator:\n\nOne of Kirsten Gillibrand's staffers who worked on Hillary Clinton's campaign expressed excitement about the senator's presidential bid:\n\nObama's former U.N. ambassador compared the foreign policy agendas of Canada and the United States:\n\nThe new Democratic governor of Kansas reinstated protections for LGBT state employees:\n\nFormer Wisconsin governor Scott Walker criticized pre-Reagan tax rates:\n\nRep.

The young elite, some with government connections, flaunt their wealth on Instagram and in the streets of the capital, Tehran, sporting designer clothes and flashy cars and vacationing at posh resorts. … But few in Iran can afford such comforts as costs rise and wallets shrink. And Iranians have started speaking out against inequality and a culture of nepotism that they say favors what are called the 'aghazadeh,' or 'noble-born' children of the elite.\n\n-- T-Mobile announced a merger needing Trump administration approval. The next day, 9 executives had reservations at Trump's hotel, by Jonathan O'Connell and David Fahrenthold: Last April, telecom giant T-Mobile announced a megadeal: a $26 billion merger with rival Sprint, which would more than double T-Mobile's value and give it a huge new chunk of the cellphone market. But for T-Mobile, one hurdle remained: Its deal needed approval from the Trump administration. The next day, in Washington, staffers at the Trump International Hotel were handed a list of incoming 'VIP Arrivals.' That day's list included nine of T-Mobile's top executives — including its chief operating officer, chief technology officer, chief strategy officer, chief financial officer and its outspoken celebrity chief executive, John Legere. … T-Mobile executives have returned to President Trump's hotel repeatedly since then, according to eyewitnesses and hotel documents obtained by The Washington Post. By mid-June, seven weeks after the announcement of the merger, hotel records indicated that one T-Mobile executive was making his 10th visit to the hotel. Legere appears to have made at least four visits to the Trump hotel, walking the lobby in his T-Mobile gear.\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT: Florida official rebuked for calling Rep. Rashida Tlaib a 'danger' who may 'blow up' the Capitol, from Eli Rosenberg: A South Florida official is facing harsh criticism after she posted an Islamophobic message in which she mused whether Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, would someday 'blow up Capitol Hill.' Anabelle Lima-Taub, a commissioner in Hallandale Beach, a community of about 40,000 between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, signed a petition that circulated on the White House's crowdsourced 'We the People' site seeking to remove Tlaib from office. … The message is no longer on her Facebook page. The Sun-Sentinel reported that it was removed Monday afternoon after the newspaper asked about it. … The Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations called for Lima-Taub's resignation. HOT ON THE RIGHT: A CNN analyst called out a Fox News contributor for his white privilege. He's black, from Michael Brice-Saddler: CNN legal analyst Areva Martin thought she was talking to a white man Tuesday while appearing as a guest on David Webb's SiriusXM radio show. When Webb, a frequent Fox News contributor and host on Fox Nation, said he considered his qualifications more important than his skin color when applying to jobs in journalism, Martin accused him of exercising white privilege. But there's a problem with that sentiment, as Webb quickly pointed out: 'Areva, I hate to break it to you, but you should've been better prepped,' he responded. 'I'm black.' … Martin apologizes repeatedly for her false accusation, adding that 'her people' gave her the wrong information. ...

Laura Vozzella reports: Advocates say their cause appears to be gaining support among some conservatives, particularly when they can be convinced that a particular bill will not infringe on anyone's religious rights. A Senate bill to outlaw discrimination in housing sailed out of committee Monday — with support from a pair of conservative Republicans who had never been on board before. Some Republicans have come to see the issue as a matter of personal liberty — and perhaps political survival in an election year when the GOP is struggling to appeal to voters in once-friendly suburbs.\n\n-- The Virginia Senate voted to ratify the federal Equal Rights Amendment.

Advocates say their cause appears to be gaining support among some conservatives, particularly when they can be convinced that a particular bill will not infringe on anyone's religious rights.\n\nA Senate bill to outlaw discrimination in housing sailed out of committee Monday — with support from a pair of conservative Republicans who had never been on board before.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome Republicans have come to see the issue as a matter of personal liberty — and perhaps political survival in an election year when the GOP is struggling to appeal to voters in once-friendly suburbs.\n\nEven so, LGBT rights remain a tough sell in this Southern capital. A bill to repeal the state's already defunct ban on same-sex marriage failed in a tied committee vote last week, on the opening day of the General Assembly. On Monday, legislation to expand the state's hate-crime law to include gay and transgender people died in a Senate committee.\n\nThe Family Foundation of Virginia, a conservative advocacy group, has lobbied vigorously against such legislation, contending that it threatens religious liberty.\n\nAD\n\nWhen it comes to laws adding the concepts of 'sexual orientation' and 'gender identity,' we have seen full well by now that these laws have the direct effect of weaponizing governments with the ability to punish those with a viewpoint that runs contrary to its own when it comes to marriage and human sexuality, the foundation's president, Victoria Cobb, wrote on the group's website.\n\nAD\n\nRobinson considers herself a social moderate. In 2013, she voted for the state's first openly gay judge. But she has also supported legislation that could allow a private business owner with deeply held religious convictions — akin to the wedding-cake baker who won a narrow victory at the U.S. Supreme Court last year — to turn away gay customers.\n\nShe said she intends to stick with her case-by-case evaluation of gay rights legislation even as she advocates for her housing bill.\n\nAD\n\nI don't want people to put me in a box here, she said. I have a lot of friends who are in the LGBT community, and they just want to be living their lives. Just like someone who's heterosexual, they just want to live their lives.\n\nRobinson drew attention to her bill with an afternoon news conference organized by Equality Virginia, the LGBT rights group that is marking its 30th year. Two polls commissioned by Equality Virginia over the past year found a majority of GOP primary voters in Virginia say anti-LGBT discrimination should be outlawed in housing and public employment — results that line up with public polling on the topic nationwide.\n\nAD\n\nAppearing with Robinson were two legislators who have supported similar bills in recent years, Sen. Siobhan S. Dunnavant (R-Henrico) and Del. Glenn R. Davis Jr. (R-Virginia Beach).\n\nAD\n\nTo me, it's inherently a Republican principle — everybody should have equal opportunity, Dunnavant said. We should be a meritocracy. We shouldn't have any discrimination for any reason.\n\nFor the past three years, the full Senate has approved legislation to protect LGBT Virginians from discrimination in housing and public employment, but the bills have always died in the House.\n\nDavis predicted that the housing measure will have a good opportunity to get through [the House] this year.\n\nOn Monday, the Senate General Laws and Technology Committee passed separate housing and employment bills, sending them to the floor. Two Republicans signed on to the housing measure for the first time: Sens. Bryce E. Reeves (R-Fredericksburg) and Frank M. Ruff Jr. (R-Mecklenburg). Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun), one of the legislature's most outspoken conservatives, cast the only no vote in committee, although Reeves and Ruff joined him in opposing the employment bill.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nJames Parrish, executive director of Equality Virginia, said Robinson's sponsorship of the housing bill in the House could improve its chances for success. The GOP controls both chambers by two votes apiece. It's clearly helpful to have a member of the party in power introducing legislation, especially in election years, he said. We believe for many reasons, from the work we've done to the polling that we've seen, to the commitments that we've had from delegates on these two issues, that these bills should move forward.
I understand why he was so angry, as family and weddings are very important in his culture. He is unable to forget the disrespect she showed us.\n\nThis has caused so many arguments that I've considered leaving him. I'm ashamed to admit I sometimes wish he was just … gone.\n\nI feel like running away.\n\nCan you offer any advice for me?\n\n— A\n\nA: It is ironic that family and weddings are revered in your husband's culture, and yet he has decided to sever a relationship with his own child. That's the opposite of reverence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYour husband may have renounced his own fatherhood, but he doesn't have the right to remove your daughter from your life.\n\nThe family geometry is a straight line: Your husband on a point at one end, your daughter at the other, and you in the middle.\n\nMaybe you can manipulate this into a triangle. You are on an axis with your daughter. You communicate with her along that axis as much as you want to.\n\nYou are on an axis with your husband, communicating along that axis.\n\nThe axis between your daughter and your husband exists and is open, in case either wants to try to close it.\n\nYou have a right to have a relationship with your own daughter, on whatever terms you and she set.\n\nAD\n\nI understand that if you have this relationship openly, your husband could make your life tough, and if that is the case you will have to make a challenging decision about your own marriage.\n\nAD\n\nA therapist, clergy or an elder from your husband's culture might be able to mediate this between the two of you — or simply talk some sense into him.\n\nDear Amy: I have a very dear friend whom I have known for many years.\n\nI share things with her that I never share with anyone else.\n\nI have been trying to open a savings account with her as the beneficiary, however I need her Social Security number to do this.\n\nWith the pandemic, appointments at the bank are difficult to get.\n\nAD\n\nI opened an account with my son as the POD [payable on death] a few years ago, and he did not need to be there. He provided his Social Security number later.\n\nWhen the bank manager finished the account, I said my friend would stop by with her SS number.\n\nThe bank would not allow that.\n\nI called my friend, and she was reluctant to provide it over the phone.\n\nAD\n\nShe said she would come to the bank, so I waited, holding up other customers. My friend then went to the wrong bank.\n\nI left, really hurt!\n\nI've never once borrowed money from her. I feel like our friendship is not genuine now and feel crushed. Your thoughts?\n\n— Crushed\n\nCrushed: Naming a beneficiary to an account (a POD), is one way to leave money to someone, essentially bypassing complicated estate issues that can arise after your death.\n\nAD\n\nYour friend was wisely reluctant to provide her Social Security number, but I wonder if she realizes what a POD is and why you are attempting to do this? She may believe that you are asking her to co-sign a loan, or co-own the account.\n\nA POD has no access to the account, and no-risks regarding the account.\n\nYou seem to believe that she must agree to this arrangement to truly be your friend.\n\nAD\n\nNot true! Cool down, explain it and if she wants to do this, give it another try. You should see if your bank would let you bring the form to her to fill out and mail.\n\nDear Amy: Hanging On described her longtime partner as wearing dirty clothes, lying around all day and emotionally shut down.\n\nThis is depression! I was disappointed that you didn't suggest she see a therapist.\n\n— Disappointed\n\nDisappointed: The partner has refused counseling. I agree that she might be depressed, but Hanging On also described a 30-year relationship marked by enabling and codependency. I urged Hanging On to find ways to take better care of herself.
Mr. Laytham was a Georgetown University freshman in 1963 when he began washing dishes at the first Clyde's three months after the eatery opened near the college. He wanted only a little cash to pay for weekend dates, he later told Washingtonian magazine.\n\nBy 1968, at the age of 22, he had been named general manager by the founder of Clyde's, Stuart C. Davidson, who two years later made him a partner with a 20 percent share of the business.\n\nAD\n\nDavidson was among the first to take advantage of a change in the D.C. liquor laws when he opened the first Clyde's. The new regulation allowed restaurant-saloons to serve hard liquor to customers both at the table and at the bar. Previously, such establishments could serve hard liquor only at the table.\n\nAD\n\nIt's more fun to eat in a saloon than to drink in a restaurant, Davidson said at the time.\n\nOperating out of what had been a sawdust-on-the-floor hangout for motorcycle riders, that first Clyde's drew a new and different clientele, young and upwardly mobile, offering what it described as an American style menu in a spruced-up decor.\n\nMr. Laytham rose fast in the Clyde's pecking order. It was his idea to open on Sundays for brunch, which soon became Clyde's busiest day of the week. Clyde's expansion was largely the result of John's vision, the company said in its obituary announcement. Davidson died in 2001.\n\nAD\n\nOver the years, Clyde's expanded locations in Northern Virginia and Maryland. It also acquired the Old Ebbitt Grill in Washington at an auction and operated several other restaurants in the District, including The Tombs, 1789 Restaurant and The Hamilton.\n\nAD\n\nThe restaurants, which have a workforce of about 2,000, are similar but not the same. Menus vary according to individual chefs, and each venue is a bit different, with quirky details. The Chevy Chase Clyde's has an electric train running along a track high on the wall.\n\nJohn Gibb Laytham was born in Glen Ridge, N.J., on Nov. 12, 1944. His mother was a homemaker, and his father owned a Pennsylvania iron foundry. He came to Georgetown to prepare for a career in the Foreign Service but changed his mind after working at Clyde's.\n\nAD\n\nHis first marriage, to Janet White, ended in divorce. Their daughter, Hilary Vice, died in November.\n\nIn 1981, he married Virginia Idol. In addition to his wife, of McLean, Va., survivors include a son from his first marriage, Gibb Laytham of Chevy Chase; two brothers; two sisters; and three grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Laytham confessed to Washingtonian in 2012 that of all the Clyde's locations, he had a soft spot for the original. I still love Clyde's in Georgetown, he said, and I still like having a good cheeseburger.\n\nOf Clyde's founding pair, Mr. Laytham had the reputation as the more enthusiastic foodie. He gets excited talking about fresh squid, The Washington Post reported in 1988. While on a vacation in Nantucket, he liked a domestic Camembert so much that the company ordered 72 pieces of it the next week.\n\nAD\n\nSnappy was one Mr. Laytham's favorite expressions for something he liked, said Clyde's president Tom Meyer.\n\nHe wanted the decor of all the Clyde's restaurants to be snappy. He wanted his servers to be snappy. And he wanted the food itself to look snappy.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly reported the last name of Clyde's president Tom Meyer as Myers. The story has been revised.
Adapted from an online discussion.\n\nDear Carolyn: My little sister (late 20s) got married last year. Within months she found out her 30-year-old husband was cheating on her with a barely legal cashier at his job.\n\nThey tried to work things out, only for my sister to discover the affair was still going on and predated the wedding. She decided she was done, only now she was pregnant.\n\nI decided to invite her to live with me and my family, which involved buying a new (and much more expensive) house.\n\nNow she has decided to try to work things out with her husband, and will probably break her promise of a several years' stay in our home. I can afford the new mortgage without her financial contribution, but not without serious lifestyle changes.\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post)\n\nHow much information am I entitled to about the current status of her marriage? I try to ask in nonthreatening, supportive ways, but typically get the response of, You're meddling. I want her to be happy, but I also need to make plans for the future. Please help.\n\nNo Good Deed Goes Unpunished\n\nNo Good Deed Goes Unpunished: You need to make plans for your future, yes, so plan without her. It's not incumbent on your sister to contribute to those plans, even if it feels otherwise: You made the decision, invited her to live with you, bought the bigger house, took on the extra expenses — so you made it for her, yes, out of kindness, but the bed is still yours to lie in. I'm sorry.\n\nThat means you aren't any more entitled to information on the current status of her marriage than you would be if you weren't counting on her for cash.\n\nSo make plans on the assumption that your sister will not be contributing, because that's what would have served you best in the first place. It's risky to place a long-term bet on short-term conditions. She was never a lock to stay.\n\nThe best part is, by banking on her absence, her continued presence — and her cash — can serve as a bonus, one you save for when your sister has sunnier days.\n\nHi, Carolyn: Yesterday I had a health scare and ended up in the ER for hours. My partner drove me there and picked me back up, but when we got back home, he said he was going out for a beer with his friends.\n\nI was fine watching shows and resting, but I'm put out that he didn't even ask if I wanted him to stay with me. I'm actually thinking of ending the relationship over this; if he had been in the ER, I would have been by his side that evening even if he thought he was fine. Am I overreacting?\n\nUnsupported?\n\nUnsupported?: Nope.\n\nI'll admit my bias upfront: I had a similar experience early in a relationship. His vanishing when I was at my most vulnerable became a theme and eventually broke us up.\n\nIt's why I've watched The Wedding Singer a number of times that approaches embarrassing.\n\nSo, do with these two points what you will.\n\nYou can also decide he's simply not a good source of something you value — in itself, grounds to break up.\n\nHope you're on the mend.
Jennifer Rias, Steffanie Leigh, Christine Ebersole (center), Mary Claire King and Stephanie Jae Park in War Paint on Broadway. (Joan Marcus)\n\nThe last time Christine Ebersole was singing nightly on Broadway, it was an experience akin to an occult phenomenon — a possession.\n\nEbersole seemed to vanish whenever Edie Beale was required to emerge. The bizarre, reclusive East Hampton socialite of the musical Grey Gardens, Edie was at once hypnotizing and pitiable, such an outrageous character that Ebersole had to make extra room in her psyche eight times a week for a role she thought of as bringing out the Edie spacesuit.\n\nSomething took over, she says, as she sits in her ultra-feminine pink dressing room in the Nederlander Theatre, soft piano music wafting out of a speaker. It was like a total inhabiting. I was driving the bus, but I wasn't the only one. There was another presence performing the driving, too. So it really enters the spiritual realm in that sense, I suppose. I mean, the emotional, spiritual kind of connection that's not up in the mind.\n\nActress Christine Ebersole, photographed in New York, portrays cosmetics industry executive Elizabeth Arden in the new musical. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nFor that astonishing act of transformation (she also played Edie's mother in the first half of the 2006 show), Ebersole collected her second Tony Award as best actress in a musical. The accolade not only recognized one of the remarkable stage performances of that decade — she previously won for a 2001 revival of 42nd Street — but it also affirmed Ebersole's spot on Broadway's mantelpiece of first-rank leading ladies, alongside powerhouses such as Bernadette Peters, Betty Buckley, Elaine Paige and her current co-star, Patti LuPone. In War Paint, the new Broadway musical about warring cosmetics tycoons that had its official opening April 6, she plays Elizabeth Arden to LuPone's Helena Rubinstein, the dueling pair who ruled the beauty industry for much of the 20th century.\n\nEbersole's stage successes also gave the producers the capital to market War Paint, one of the most eagerly anticipated entries in an exceptionally crowded season for new musicals, as a bona fide ­double-barreled female star vehicle. This category of production doesn't come along as often as one imagines, especially for women of a certain age: Ebersole herself has to think back to Chita Rivera and Liza Minnelli in 1984's The Rink for a comparable teaming. (And they were considerably younger at the time.) So she is keenly aware that the chance to share top billing with another actress of her caliber, in an $11 million musical, no less, materializes in the firmament about as frequently as a major comet.\n\nIt's very rarefied air to still be in the game at my age, avers Ebersole, 64, who has three children, all in their 20s. I'm going into my fifth decade in show business, and making a living at it! But it's 11 years since I've done a musical on Broadway, and I'm not getting younger. So, well, we feel it, you know what I'm saying?\n\n[Patti LuPone on her 'painful' rise to Broadway stardom]\n\nThe hope is that potential audiences feel it, in the positive way that drives up word of mouth: what lover of musical theater wouldn't open a wallet to hear LuPone's anguished belt at play with Ebersole's lyrical coloratura? The well-defined division of temperament between the actresses is as vital to War Paint's success as are the subjects themselves of the musical, by the Grey Gardens songwriting team of Scott Frankel and Michael Korie, book writer Doug Wright and director Michael Greif. And sitting down for a spell with the elegant, upbeat Ebersole — whose effect on the backstage atmosphere LuPone compares to champagne bubbles — one gets the intimation of a contrast in personality and style tailor-made for a musical clash-of-wills.\n\n\n\nChristine Ebersole and Patti LuPone in War Paint. (Joan Marcus)\n\nBoth women are so supple, and both have such different stylistic sweet spots, and more than just one of them, says War Paint's composer, Frankel. Whereas he describes LuPone's voice as having all the power she used to have, but with more range and more ability to produce sound with shadings, Ebersole can generate effortless soprano notes, but she has also a very strong, smoky-hued chest production. And she can negotiate back and forth in a way that's seamless, Frankel adds. In 'Grey Gardens,' I tried to throw everything I could at her, comic stuff, soprano stuff, some burnished, elegiac ballads, and I found there wasn't anything she couldn't do.\n\nEven for an actress who's always felt at one with her musicality — she has recordings of herself at 3 in Winnetka, Ill, singing Jingle Bells completely on pitch — keeping up with 67-year-old LuPone has been daunting. Or as Ebersole puts it: inspiring. I can't rest on my laurels, she says with a cackle. Onstage with Patti LuPone! That's why I say to her, 'Honey, you put me to work! No slouching with you around!' \n\nChristine Ebersole in a scene from the musical Grey Gardens. (Joan Marcus/The Publicity Office via AP)\n\nEbersole is not a natural slouch. She's been the main breadwinner in her long marriage to Bill Moloney, who took care of the kids in California and later in New Jersey, where the couple now live, while she worked in TV and onstage. Some of the extended absences from the family she has regrets about, because, you know, I missed out on a lot. And so I know that they understand that, and they really appreciate what I do, and it allowed them to go to college and all that kind of stuff.\n\nWhat she gave up, though, helped her understand Arden, who grew up on a dirt farm in rural Ontario, Canada, and became an entrepreneur and businesswoman single-mindedly consumed by the makeup empire she built. The musical, based on the exhaustive book of that title by British biographer Lindy Woodhead, traces the business genius of both Arden and Rubinstein, but also the emotional emptiness both suffered in their later lives.\n\nThat's why I totally relate to Elizabeth Arden, the actress says of the show's exploration of women and work. It is an absolute myth to say you can have it all. Complete, utter myth. Because something will be sacrificed.\n\nEbersole has, in fact, always worked; she was waiting tables in New York after finishing at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts when her agent called and said: Darling, you're on Broadway! (This sentence Ebersole declaims as if the agent were a society dame in a 1940s B movie.) The play was a 1976 revival of Angel Street, which closed after just six weeks, but it wouldn't be long before she was being cast in major musical revivals, as Ado Annie in a 1979 remounting of Oklahoma! and, even more momentously, as Guenevere in a 1980 revival of Camelot opposite . . . Richard Burton.\n\nThe audition was on a bare New York stage. All of a sudden, I hear this mellifluous voice from the house and, like in slow motion, here comes Richard Burton walking down the aisle with a light blue V-neck sweater to illuminate the gorgeous blue eyes, she recalls of that first encounter. He came up on stage, he gives me a kiss on the cheek and starts reading with me. I'm, like, 25 or something, and part of me is going, 'This is normal' but the internal voice is like, 'Oh, my God, Richard Burton!' And the producer comes up and says, 'Hey, kid, can you learn the part by Friday?' \n\nShe adored Burton and, after he fell ill, sang the role for a spell with Richard Harris as King Arthur. In the following years, she would find herself in assignments she considers kaleidoscopic for their range, appearing in Milos Forman's Oscar-winning film version of Amadeus and spending the 1981-1982 season in the cast of Saturday Night Live. The show's producer, Dick Ebersol — no relation — hired her, she says, because he wanted to expand the cast to include singers. She remembers the year as very difficult. I wasn't from the world of stand-up or the world of improv, she says. I was Guenevere!\n\nThe queen in Camelot she was, and royalty on Broadway she was to be. That destiny has led her to this moment and her pink dressing room, just above LuPone's, decorated in that color because it was Arden's signature. The show is all about selling an illusion, one created by a mask of mascara, lipstick and rouge. But it is also about the illusion of how much satisfaction great wealth can buy you.\n\nI remember getting on an airplane one time and being kind of afraid that the plane was going to crash, Ebersole says. And then I saw Ted Turner come on the plane and I said, 'Oh, it's not going to crash now.' It was this really weird thing, that money was somehow going to protect us or save us, you know what I mean? It's a complete, utter illusion.\n\nSo Helena Rubinstein and Elizabeth Arden, they put all their eggs in this basket, they died, like, the richest women in the world, and they were bereft. So what do we put our value on? Is it how much money we have in the bank? Ebersole looks around her cozy dressing room, and laughs in her infectious cackle. Nope! Not the case! she adds, sounding now as though her voice were indeed made of pink champagne bubbles.
He has never asked for money and does odd jobs, so I am never paying for all of our expenses. I do probably spend more on us, but I make more, so I'm okay with that. However, once upon a time, I would not have tolerated dating someone with ambitions that didn't follow a normal path.\n\nAD\n\nWe've talked about taking the next steps for our future, including marriage, but I'm not sure how he can expect those things to happen without getting a full-time job and letting go of the music fantasy life.\n\nAD\n\nWhile I've seen a little progress, things aren't necessarily going quickly in the direction I want.\n\nAm I settling on him because he is an awesome person and treats me like a queen? Or am I being a brat by wanting more stability and growth from him?\n\nWorried Girlfriend\n\nWorried Girlfriend: What you seem to be doing is looking at your adult partner and branding him as a child because he doesn't want what you want. He wants to be a musician, and the life you describe — working temporary jobs and gigging when you can — is the musician's life.\n\nAD\n\nYou should proceed in this relationship with a clear objective for each of you to get what you want in life.\n\nIf nothing in his life changes, would you still want to be with him? Are you willing to be the steady financial backbone while he continues pursuing the life of an artist?\n\nAD\n\nAs long as you see being with someone who treats you like a queen as settling, and someone who wants to be a musician as a childish fantasy, you won't be able to accept his life choices, and this doesn't bode well for your long-term future.\n\nBoth of your paths are legitimate, and all that's left is a question of basic compatibility.\n\nDear Amy: Recently, my husband came down with the flu. During his illness, he moved into our guest bedroom, so that I could sleep without being awakened by his coughing.\n\nAD\n\nMy husband has always seemed to need less sleep than I and has always gotten up at least two hours before I do (we are both retired). But he also needs a nap in the middle of the day, something I never do.\n\nHis sleep time may be shortened due to me: I have bouts of insomnia, get up two or three times a night and, even in my sleep, I do a lot of tossing and turning. I've often said that sleeping with me must be like sleeping with a cricket.\n\nAD\n\nAmy, we love each other dearly. But since he's been sleeping in the guest bedroom, he is getting more and better sleep, even while ill, and so have I.\n\nI am torn. I love sleeping in the same bed with my husband, but currently it doesn't seem to work. Sleeping in separate rooms doesn't feel right emotionally, but I'll admit I love getting a good night's sleep.\n\nAD\n\nWhat should we do?\n\nInsomniac\n\nInsomniac: Several recent studies show how vital sleep is for a person's health. Of course, emotional closeness is also very important to your marriage.\n\nOne solution might be for you to start out together, and then for you to change beds and retire to the guest room after the first time you awaken at night. I'd welcome hearing from readers who have faced this challenge.\n\nDear Amy: Active Traveler was upset because her obese traveling companion couldn't partake of the full experiences during their international travel. And now Active was concerned because another obese friend wanted to join them!\n\nShe should bring both of these friends along on her next trip. Then the two obese women can entertain each other, and Active can enjoy her own more active choices.\n\nReader\n\nReader: Active Traveler was trying to maximize her own traveling experiences. Doubling down on this problem hardly seems like a solution to me.
Dickson also led an outreach effort that was religiously and racially diverse, while also taking aim at the same voters Trump assumed were in his camp. Even as Trump boasted on the campaign trail that the evangelicals love me, and I love them, behind the scenes, Dickson was holding private listening sessions with many faith leaders, including leaders at the National Association of Evangelicals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere's a lot more that unites us than divides us to work together under common ground, Dickson said. The 36-year-old who was driven by his evangelical faith to help persuade religious voters to choose Biden is now considered a leading contender to head the White House office of faith-based partnerships, which could play a key role in Biden's efforts to heal a bitterly divided nation.\n\nIf chosen, Dickson is likely to continue the approach he developed in 2020, which was different from that of previous Democratic presidential campaigns.\n\nWhen Mara Vanderslice Kelly did faith outreach for John F. Kerry's campaign for president in 2004, she said she faced tremendous hostility internally, with no access to the candidate or people high up in the campaign. Campaign staff thought faith outreach threatened the idea of separation of church and state, LGBT rights and abortion access, she said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, John McCarthy led the campaign's religious outreach, but he was hired to focus on courting Irish and Catholic communities. This past election season, McCarthy was Biden's deputy national political director.\n\nRalph Reed, a GOP strategist who reaches out to faith voters, said whatever the strategy was, it wasn't effective. Clinton is a lifelong Methodist who has said she does not wear her faith on her sleeve and doesn't address it often in public.\n\nI don't know if it would've mattered if St. Francis of Assisi had been running Hillary's outreach, Reed said. I'm told in private and on a personal level she's charming and funny and smart, she's comfortable with her own faith experience and is comfortable talking about it. It never seemed to come through.\n\nAD\n\nDickson had somewhat of an easier time messaging for Biden, a Catholic who attends Mass weekly, often carries a rosary and quotes scripture and saints. Dickson didn't have to force the idea that Biden was motivated by his faith.\n\nAD\n\nBiden talked about faith and goes to church regularly. That's just part of his life, Kelly said, although Biden has faced opposition within his own faith over his support for abortion and LGBTQ rights. Kelly said her husband, John Kelly, who did Catholic outreach for the Democratic National Committee, was part of a team in 2008 that would have to find Catholic churches for Biden where he would not be turned away or denied Communion by conservative priests or bishops because Biden favors abortion rights. Kelly said this was something campaign staffers had to do again in 2012. (Dickson said this was not part of his job responsibilities in the Biden campaign.)\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Dickson focused his outreach by highlighting Biden's policy positions on issues such as immigration, systemic racism and climate change that have broad support among faith leaders, including many evangelicals. He also coordinated private weekly devotions for Biden. He could sometimes get Biden or now-Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris to join Zoom calls with faith leaders, and he worked on a seven-figure advertisement buy targeting faith voters.\n\nAD\n\nJosh comes in and he gets ads, he gets access, Kelly said. He's learned from the mistakes we already made.\n\nAD\n\nAnalysts say it is too early to fully assess whether the Biden campaign chipped enough religious voters away from Trump for those votes to have swung the election. Analysts typically look at how White evangelicals and White Catholics vote, because of the size of those populations in certain battleground states.\n\nNationwide, early exit polls found that not much had changed among White evangelicals. Trump's margin of support among White evangelical Christians was 73 points this year, the same margin of votes he received in 2016. But in swing states like in Michigan and in Georgia, Trump lost some support among White evangelicals.\n\nAD\n\nPolls also found a shift concentrated among White Catholics, who supported Trump by a 24-point margin in 2016. This year, however, White Catholics favored him by 12 points nationwide.\n\nAD\n\nThe Biden administration's plans for its faith-based initiatives are not yet clear. Each president has taken a slightly different approach since George W. Bush established the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to encourage organizations to compete for social service grants. President Barack Obama appointed Joshua DuBois, Dickson's counterpart from the 2008 campaign, to lead his faith-based office a few weeks into his term. As Trump's top faith adviser, Paula White, a preacher who teaches a prosperity Gospel, helped bring in hundreds of evangelicals to the White House for group meetings on issues such as Israel and criminal justice reform. She also had a personal relationship with the Trump family and christened one of Eric Trump's children, Reed said.\n\nYou can't put a dollar on that in terms of what it means to evangelicals, Reed said. She could pick up the phone and call the president and an agency head. You've never had anybody in that role under Bush or Obama who had that relationship with the president or first family.\n\nAD\n\nIf he serves in the administration, Dickson is more likely to serve as more of a translator between two worlds. He has long had his feet firmly planted in both the Democratic world and in the evangelical world, which leans heavily Republican.\n\nAD\n\nFrom a small town outside Rochester, N.Y., Dickson grew up going to an independent Baptist church doing evangelical ministry and missions trips. He is the son, grandson and great-grandson of graduates of Moody Bible Institute, a conservative evangelical school in Chicago, though he attended the University of Michigan and received a master's in public policy from Harvard.\n\nHe campaigned for Obama in 2012 and worked in his second administration as the faith-based director in the Commerce Department and did faith outreach for the Democratic National Committee and Teach for America. At the same time, when he would talk to people in the evangelical world, Dickson could signal his bona fide credentials by dropping references to Awana, a kids' ministry popular in many evangelical churches, or talking about his involvement in the popular college campus ministry Cru (formerly known as Campus Crusade).\n\nAD\n\nMy approach to political work is based in what I learned trained in relational organizing, building coalitions and working across lines of difference, said Dickson, who now attends Denver Community Church, a large church that became LGBT-inclusive in 2017.\n\nAD\n\nAdam Phillips, a progressive evangelical pastor in Portland, Ore., said Dickson, who co-founded a group called Evangelicals for Marriage Equality in 2014, was instrumental in Phillips's decision to become an openly LGBT-inclusive pastor. Since evangelicals have become so associated with Trump, Phillips said, Dickson shows a different side to the movement that can be much more liberal.\n\nJosh knows how to reach to conservatives while being a bona fide progressive, Phillips said.\n\nAD\n\nWhen he's not running Zoom calls, Dickson is an avid outdoorsman and has run 35 ultramarathons, marathons that are more than 26.2 miles.\n\nHe has an energy that's infectious, said Derrick Harkins, director of interfaith outreach for the Democratic National Committee who worked with Dickson for six months and conducted his wedding. He runs 100 miles for the heck of it, and he brings that same focus and commitment to his work.\n\nAD\n\nWhen he lived in D.C., he met his now-wife, who is a business consultant, when they attended the District Church. He would run home and sleep in an oxygen-deprived tent to help him train for a 100-mile run in Colorado's high altitude. During the pandemic, he has traded his Washington-based policy wonk look with a trimmed beard and buzzed hair for a shaggier and scruffier look to fit a Colorado mountain man.\n\nDickson, who is working on Biden's transition team, expects the new administration will face challenges reaching conservative religious voters. Under Obama, Biden was among Democratic leaders who tried to help with sensitive issues, including mandatory coverage of contraception under the Affordable Care Act that led to several lawsuits.\n\nLooking ahead, observers expect hot-button issues to reemerge, including the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for abortions. Biden was a long supporter of the Hyde Amendment but changed his position in 2019 after Democratic outcry.\n\nAnd Biden has vowed to pass the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity and sexual orientation. Several conservative religious groups oppose the legislation because they fear it could infringe on their religious liberties.\n\nDickson said he knows there will be divisions between Democrats and conservative religious voters on issues like abortion and LGBT rights, but is hoping the new administration can find common ground on refugees, systemic racism, poverty and tackling the coronavirus.
The official launch of Obama's reelection campaign was slated for the first weekend in May 2012. First, Obama was to hold back-to-back rallies on Saturday, May 5, in the battleground states of Ohio and Virginia. Then, on Sunday, Vice President Biden was to hit the airwaves on NBC's Meet the Press.\n\nBiden, known for going off-script, had been rigorously prepped and reminded of his mission: Stay on message.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen he took his seat on the set of NBC's Washington studio, Biden projected the image of the president's lieutenant in a crisp charcoal suit, white shirt and blue-striped tie. But when host David Gregory asked about a sensitive unresolved issue hanging over the administration, Biden veered from the campaign playbook. You know, Gregory began, the president has said that his views on gay marriage, on same-sex marriage, have evolved. But he's opposed to it. You're opposed to it. Have your views … evolved?\n\nBiden acknowledged that he had indeed evolved on the issue — faster and further than the president. Several weeks earlier, Biden had admitted in a private meeting in Los Angeles with 30 advocates for gay and lesbian rights that his view differed from Obama's, and he'd told the group that he had to keep his opinion to himself. But now, on national television, he spoke from the heart.\n\nLook, Biden began. I just think — that — the good news is — he set his elbows on the table and interlaced his fingers, almost prayerlike. Same-sex marriage, he explained, came down to a simple proposition: Who do you love? He repeated it for emphasis: Who do you love? And will you be loyal to the person you love? He explained that most people believed that was what all marriages were about, whether they're marriages of lesbians or gay men or heterosexuals.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRealizing he'd strayed into controversial territory, Biden stressed he was speaking for himself personally, not for the White House. I — I — look, I am vice president of the United States of America. The president sets the policy, he observed. And he elaborated on his own view: I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another — he slowed down now to make his point perfectly clear — are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don't see much of a distinction beyond that.\n\nThe Obama team's carefully choreographed campaign kickoff had suddenly exploded: The vice president had announced, on live TV, that he favored same-sex marriage while the president, as everyone knew, lagged behind him. In their book, Double Down: Game Change 2012, Mark Halperin and John Heilemann reported the shock of David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager who was now a senior adviser to the president. When Plouffe read the transcript of Biden's Meet the Press interview, he cried: What the f---? How can this have happened?\n\nWhat made Biden so appealing — that on the public stage he was more heart than sense — also made him infuriating. In his most authentic moments, the polished senior politician was not much different from the impulsive, sometimes reckless, schoolboy he once was. Back in Scranton, Pa., at age 8 or 9, Joey accepted a dare from a friend to run under a dump truck as it moved slowly back and forth at a construction site. The friend never thought Joey would do it, but young Biden was fearless. The dump truck was loaded to the gills and backing up — not too fast — and Joey was small, wrote Richard Ben Cramer in What It Takes, his 1992 book on presidential politics, and he ran under the truck from the side, between the front and back wheels … then let the front axle pass over him. If it touched him, he was finished — marmalade — but Joey was quick. The front wheels missed him clean. In his portrait of Biden's abortive run for the presidency in 1988, Cramer saw the child in the adult: Joe Biden had balls. Lots of times, more balls than sense.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter his unequivocal declaration on same-sex marriage, Biden told Gregory about that private meeting he had had with gay advocates in Los Angeles. During the meeting's question-and-answer period, Biden recounted, one of the men wanted to know: Let me ask you, how do you feel about us?\n\nIn reply, Biden singled out a gay couple at the meeting. He had visited the two men in their home and met their two adopted children, and when he had walked into the house, the kids, ages 7 and 5, had handed Biden flowers. The vice president repeated for the national television audience what he had said to those two men at the private meeting: I wish every American could see the look of love those kids had in their eyes for you guys. And they wouldn't have any doubt about what this is about.\n\nBiden's remarks put Obama in a tough position. Plouffe feared the political repercussions of the president altering his view on gay marriage, and he had persuaded Obama to keep quiet on the issue. In Plouffe's estimation, a direct Obama statement favoring gay marriage was too risky ahead of the 2012 general election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the years Obama had shifted his stand on the issue. In Chicago in 1996, when he ran for an Illinois state Senate seat, he told a gay newspaper in a questionnaire that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. But in 2004 as a U.S. Senate candidate he asserted that marriage was something just for a man and a woman. In 2008, on the presidential campaign trail, he took an official position against a change in marriage rights, though he let it be known among his confidants that his views were evolving.\n\nBy 2011 — while in the White House — he had come around: He privately told his advisers he approved of gay marriage. But for public circulation, his aides wanted only to promote the line that he was evolving. To some liberals, Obama's reticence reflected a lack of political courage. Obama has liberal instincts and will effectuate progressive reforms, wrote Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy in his book The Persistence of the Color Line, but only if he can do so without getting uncomfortably close to what he perceives to be too high a political price.\n\nAs president, Obama demonstrated his sympathy for the rights of the gay community. He led and won the repeal of the Clinton-era don't ask, don't tell policy, which denied openly gay Americans the right to serve in the military. Obama also ended the Justice Department's legal defense of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union of a man and a woman and allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages attained in other states; the Supreme Court would rule the law unconstitutional in 2013.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nObama chafed at his own lack of authenticity on gay marriage. His wife, Michelle, and his longtime friend and adviser Valerie Jarrett told him to disregard the politics and simply declare publicly what he felt. David Axelrod, the chief strategist for both Obama presidential campaigns, and Dan Pfeiffer, a senior presidential adviser, counseled the president that voters responded better to a candidate who delivered his own unvarnished truth.\n\nBefore Biden went on Meet the Press, the White House had been considering ways for Obama to speak his mind. Aides had drawn up an elaborate strategy allowing the president to seize on gay marriage as a major civil rights issue. A blueprint for his announcement had slowly come together. The game plan had the president appearing at an LGBT event in New York on May 14 followed by a visit to ABC's daytime talk show The View to reveal his change of heart. I was just maniacal about order and planning, Plouffe explained in Obama: An Oral History 2009-2017″ by Brian Abrams. He recognized that a historic moment lay before the president. I wanted it to be the president's moment.\n\nBut the choreographed scenario Plouffe and others had put together crumbled as soon as Biden spoke honestly on Meet the Press. The media reaction was swift and overwhelming. The Associated Press declared, Obama's Vague Gay Marriage Stance Under Scrutiny. The Boston Herald warned, Veep's Marriage 'Gaffe' an Issue for Prez.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Obama's aides railed over Biden, the president was more annoyed at the appearance of White House chaos than at Biden's remarks, for he knew his sentiments were in concert with the vice president's. By Monday, the White House was losing control of the issue. Obama's advisers watched aghast as Education Secretary Arne Duncan echoed Biden's view on MSNBC's Morning Joe political talk show. When asked if he believed that same-sex men and women should be able to get legally married, Duncan promptly replied: Yes, I do.\n\nWhen asked, Have you ever said that publicly before? Duncan answered bluntly: I don't know I've ever been asked publicly.\n\nFor the interview, Duncan sat in a studio in Washington, taking the questions through an earpiece. His staff was standing by listening to his answers but couldn't hear the questions. The words same-sex marriage never came out of the education secretary's mouth. Afterward, Duncan recalled, his staff walked out with him and said, Oh, that interview went really well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuncan had no idea he'd stepped into a minefield. He hadn't watched the Sunday talk shows and missed the ensuing brouhaha. Reflecting later, Duncan said he was pleased at the way he answered the unexpected question. Like Biden, he'd spoken from the heart. I did it without thinking, he said. I was actually very relieved that I just told the truth. He didn't want to sound like a Washington politician who equivocated or dodged an issue. That's not who I wanted to be, he said.\n\nBut soon enough he realized his role in the rising storm. Now both Biden and Duncan inadvertently had pressured the president on same-sex marriage. It may have caused short-term pain, Duncan observed. But I knew where the president's heart was on this. You know, he hadn't said it publicly, but I knew down deep exactly what he thought. Frankly I think the vice president and I actually accelerated getting him to where his heart was.\n\nThe president and his aides had not yet sorted out their strategy. On Monday, press secretary Jay Carney gave an uncomfortable briefing at the White House where his reply to reporters' questions was a monotonous: I have no update on the president's personal views.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, the president's staff — realizing his silence was untenable — reached out to Robin Roberts, anchor of ABC's Good Morning America. The president, Roberts was informed, wanted to tape a one-on-one interview with her the following day — but what exactly the president wanted to say wasn't made clear.\n\nIn the Cabinet Room on Wednesday, Obama and Roberts sat in facing leather chairs. The setting evoked the grandeur of governance and important decisions: gold curtains at the white French doors, a bust of Benjamin Franklin presiding from a corner. Obama, looking presidential in a blue suit, had an American flag over his shoulder, and a view out a window showed the peaceful White House grounds.\n\nRoberts asked the question of the moment: Mr. President, are you still opposed to same-sex marriage?\n\nHis answer was so striking — coming from a sitting president — that ABC News broke into the network's afternoon programming with a special report, anchored by George Stephanopoulos and Diane Sawyer. Sawyer announced, Big breaking news from the White House. This is a historic political and cultural moment in this country, and the issue: gay marriage.\n\nThe anchors then cut to Roberts stationed after the interview in front of the White House. She provided a little background on the week then Obama came on the screen, his voice calm and reflective, quite in contrast to the hysterics of the past three days: I have to tell you, as I've said, I've — I've been going through an evolution on this issue. I've always been adamant that gay and lesbian Americans should be treated fairly and equally. … I've stood on the side of broader equality for the LGBT community. And I had hesitated on gay marriage — in part, because I thought civil unions would be sufficient. … But I have to tell you that over the course of several years, as I talk to friends and family and neighbors. When I think about members of my own staff who are incredibly committed, in monogamous relationships — same-sex relationships — who are raising kids together. When I think about those soldiers or airmen or Marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained … because they're not able to commit themselves in a marriage. At a certain point, I've just concluded that, for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.\n\nThe president's shift on same-sex marriage was promptly sucked into the journalistic maw — reported, debated, discussed in print, online and on television. NBC broke into its regular programming, running its competitor's scoop. CNN also rushed onto the air with its Breaking News logo accompanied by a sizzling sound and Wolf Blitzer crying out, Truly historic and potentially watershed moment. … With the election less than six months away, the political implications are enormous.\n\nThe next day, Good Morning America aired a clip of Roberts and the president strolling along the White House colonnade, birds chirping loudly in the background.\n\nRoberts asked about Biden's remarks the previous Sunday: Did he jump the gun a little here?\n\nObama seemed unperturbed, noting that he'd already decided to announce his position before the election. He lightly chastised his vice president, and in a way that revealed what he understood about Biden. Certainly the vice president was impetuous, but, the president knew, Joe cared deeply about the way Americans were treated.\n\nBarack said of his friend, He probably got out a little bit over his skis — out of generosity of spirit.\n\nPlouffe's consternation over the political risk to the president turned out to be unfounded. In his ingenuous way, Biden had nudged the president to fall in line with the mood of the country. A Gallup poll that week found that 50 percent of Americans said they supported legal rights for gays wishing to marry; 65 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents agreed, while 22 percent of Republicans approved.\n\nAs president, Obama now owned the issue. If Biden had stolen his thunder briefly, the vice president now receded into the background. By speaking up, Biden had thrown a sharp spotlight on the civil rights of gays. But now the accolades were all Obama's. It has always taken strong national leadership to expand equal rights in this country, the New York Times wrote, and it has long been obvious that marriage rights are no exception. President Obama offered some of that leadership on Wednesday.\n\nDuring her interview, Roberts had asked the president, So you're not upset with anybody?\n\nAcknowledging the bumps along the way, Obama said he would have preferred to have had it all evolve a little more smoothly.\n\nBut, he added, all's well that ends well.
The cause was lymphoma, said a daughter, Laura Cooper.\n\nDr. Cooper spent the bulk of his career in academia, teaching at Yale University from 1966 to 1977 and then at Harvard since 1981 with his final online class concluding the week of his death.\n\nInterested in the practical application of economic theory and research, he took occasional leaves-of-absence over the years to serve as a senior foreign policy adviser in Washington, traveled widely to study the economies of developing countries, spoke at forums addressing geopolitical issues, and lent his scholarly expertise as a consultant to the United Nations, the Rand Corp., and other organizations and policy-oriented institutions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter serving two years as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, he was Clinton's chairman of the National Intelligence Council from 1995 to 1997, a post he accepted at the behest of John M. Deutch, a fellow Boston-area academic who at that time was serving as CIA director.\n\nOn the heels of a global recession, an oil embargo and rising inflation, Dr. Cooper served in the Carter administration as undersecretary of state for economic affairs from 1977 to 1981, helping to shape the president's multinational fiscal-policy coordination objectives at the Group of Seven summits, the annual economic forums of the leading industrialized countries.\n\nHe also provided analysis on the economic effects of the Camp David Accords, the agreements establishing Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist, signed by President Jimmy Carter, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the mid-1960s, during the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson, Dr. Cooper oversaw international monetary affairs as a deputy assistant secretary of state. A few years earlier, he was, at 26, a senior staff economist on Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisers. He came to the Kennedy White House's attention while conducting research on his doctoral dissertation at the Brookings Institution.\n\nRichard Newell Cooper was born in Seattle on June 14, 1934, and grew up in Greenbelt, Md. His father, a former journalist, was a civil servant and his mother worked at the War Production Board.\n\nAfter World War II, Dr. Cooper spent four years in Frankfurt, Germany, where his father helped to establish press reforms as a political and public affairs officer with the High Commission for Occupied Germany.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Cooper later spent a couple of his summers in Alaska working as a homestead surveyor before graduating in 1956 from Oberlin College in Ohio. He received a master's degree from the London School of Economics on a Marshall scholarship in 1958 and a PhD in international economics from Harvard in 1962.\n\nAD\n\nHis first marriage, to Carolyn Cahalan, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 20 years, Jin Chen Cooper, and their two children, William and Jennifer Cooper, all of Cambridge; two children from his first marriage, Laura and Mark Cooper, both of Seattle; a brother; and a granddaughter.\n\nDr. Cooper served on the board of the Center for Naval Analyses think tank and was a member of the Trilateral Commission international think tank, the Civilian Executive Panel of the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations, the Aspen Strategy Group and the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nAD\n\nHe wrote and edited books on macroeconomic subjects. One of his earliest publications, The Economics of Interdependence: Economic Policy in the Atlantic Community (1968), led him to become a strong advocate of the concept of governments' coordinating economic policies with other countries to maximize economic gains.\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of a think tank where Dr. Cooper served on the board. It is the Center for Naval Analyses, not the Center for Naval Analysis.
I understand that these things could cause a rift. However, the rift comes in the form of my wife constantly arguing with me, putting me down, always yelling at me and having a terrible attitude toward me.\n\nI can't ask a simple question without being verbally attacked. I've talked to my wife about this, and she doesn't see it.\n\nShe makes fun of me when I say she has an attitude in her voice, telling me that I'm taking things the wrong way.\n\nAD\n\nShe was on the phone with her sister the other night and I started crying uncontrollably because of the way she spoke to her sister. She was loving and affectionate, softly encouraging and full of love.\n\nAD\n\nAmy, she hasn't spoken to me like that in months!\n\nI feel like as soon as I said, I do, all of her promises went out the window. I'm working twice as hard, she doesn't help with any household chores and I feel like her unappreciated servant.\n\nWhen I bring this up, she accuses me of being mentally ill. She says that I need to be medicated and that we need counseling.\n\nI agree with the counseling, but I do not have bipolar disorder, or any of the other mental illnesses she accuses me of having.\n\nAD\n\nHow can I make her change something she refuses to see?\n\nMarried Old Maid\n\nMarried Old Maid: You cannot force someone toward change if they refuse to recognize the need for change. However, one great thing about competent couples counseling is that a skilled counselor can coax a person toward recognizing the need for change, and can then coach a couple on ways to make these necessary changes.\n\nAD\n\nDefinitely try counseling. You need an outlet for expressing your feelings, and your wife needs a neutral party to reflect back to her how her words and behavior dents and damages the relationship — and hurts you.\n\nThe behavior you report (put-downs, verbal attacks) is abusive and needs to stop. If she continues in this vein, you should consider leaving the marriage.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: I'm a woman in my late 20s. I've only recently realized that I'm an introverted person.\n\nThis is what it feels like to be me: We all have a certain amount of battery in reserve for our social interactions, and my battery happens to drain faster than other people.\n\nLong chats or outings with friends leave me feeling exhausted and sometimes irritable.\n\nI've discussed this with close friends and loved ones, but I haven't figured out how to make this clear to acquaintances.\n\nAD\n\nFor example, my office mate is a person who can speak for very long periods of time, often with no natural gaps where I can jump in and comfortably excuse myself.\n\nDo you have any tips for politely exiting a conversation when you've simply run out of the energy to participate?\n\nAD\n\nA Burgeoning Introvert\n\nBurgeoning Introvert: You seem to feel that being trapped with your motormouth office mate wouldn't bother and deplete you so much if only you weren't an introvert.\n\nI think it's possible that it's not just you. Her behavior might bother anyone.\n\nIf you are trapped with someone who doesn't leave natural conversational gaps, you'll have to say, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I've got to get back to this task. Maybe we can catch up after work today.\n\nI hope your office mate adjusts. Ear buds (if they are permissible) might help you to block out some distractions, as well as giving your office mate a visual cue that you are not available.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlso read the groundbreaking book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, by Susan Cain (2013, Broadway Books). The insight and recognition will help you to further understand and assert your own needs.\n\nDear Amy: The Old Guy was a musician nursing a long-ago rejection. I am shocked by your advice that he should start a geezer band. The word geezer is offensive, and you shouldn't use it!\n\nOffended Reader\n\nOffended Reader: Well, my age puts me in geezer territory, and I happen to play music with other geezers, and so I feel comfortable using this term.
And then there's the biggest, scariest one: Will you be happy?\n\nAs the working mom of a 10-year-old daughter, actor and filmmaker Alysia Reiner — best known for her role as prison administrator Natalie Fig Figueroa in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black — is familiar with these questions. And as the star and co-producer of the new movie Egg, a snappy dramedy that examines the personal and societal pressures that shape how we see motherhood, Reiner hopes to make audiences think about those familiar queries in a different way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nReiner and Mad Men alum Christina Hendricks portray Tina and Karen, two former art school friends who reconnect over a casual dinner with their spouses. The reunion comes at a fortuitous moment for both women: Each is expecting a baby.\n\nAnd that's about where their commonality ends. Tina (Reiner) is an eccentric artist and a rage-against-the-patriarchy feminist who, along with her husband Wayne (Gbenga Akinnagbe), has enlisted a surrogate (Anna Camp) to carry their child as part of an art project that she smugly describes as a dismantling and restructuring of the traditional family unit. Karen (Hendricks) is six months pregnant, content to be supported by her wealthy husband, Don (David Alan Basche, Reiner's real-life husband), and quick to declare that she feels sorry for people who don't have children. The ensuing collision of their disparate worldviews is every bit as messy — and ultimately revealing — as you might expect.\n\nWe spoke with Reiner about Egg and the importance of telling different stories about motherhood. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQ: You mentioned that you first read this script many years ago, when you were still deciding whether to become a parent, and reread it years later after your daughter was born. Can you talk about the ways the story resonated with you at those different moments in your life?\n\nA: When I first read it, I thought I had never read anything that said these things, and said them in such a smart way, and explored parenthood — not just motherhood, but parenthood — from all these different sides. Personally, I was at a moment where I had known my husband more than half my life, and everyone was asking us, When are you having kids? The pressure that women feel to be a mother — I don't think most women ever ask themselves, Is this something that I really want? So when I first read the script, I felt like, I think I do want to have a kid, but I don't want to be part of this system that makes me assume that I have to want this. And then when I read it again, years later as a mother of one, I was shocked yet again by how many people had mourned for the fact that I only had one child.\n\nIn both cases, the resonance was that feeling of it's never enough. I'm not enough as a woman if I don't have children, and I'm not enough of a woman even if I only have one child. And I think there is this cultural significance about how we serve that message to women as a way to keep them down.\n\nQ: There are so many insecurities and judgments that surround parenting choices — what do you think this story tells us about how to find common ground?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA: That's another thing I loved about this script — that it's about friendship, too. How friends can make totally different choices but honor each other's choices. In the end, there is a moment where Tina does not tell Karen's secrets. And that's huge, considering who Tina is. She decides that being right is not as important as Karen living her truth, whatever that is.\n\nI remember thinking how excited I was to make a film about women who don't believe the same thing, who respectfully agree to disagree, without judgment. Well, maybe they have judgment but at least they shut their mouths about it.\n\nQ: These aren't necessarily characters that a lot of people will find relatable. Was that the idea, to make people think about their own reactions to perspectives outside their comfort zone?\n\nAD\n\nA: One hundred percent. As filmmakers, we did not want people to necessarily identify with one character or feel like, Oh my God, that's me. Our goal was to bring up some of the ways we as a society think about these things, and let people see their own beliefs and stereotypes in a new way. As an artist, I'm always curious, where are my blind spots? This story made me look more deeply at my preconceived notions about only children, being a mother of just the one and mother-daughter relationships in general. That's what this film is about: Where are your blind spots, and are you ready to go there?\n\nAD\n\nQ: In the wake of the Me Too and Time's Up movements, we're seeing a broader focus on gender inequality issues in Hollywood and beyond, and more interest and investment in telling stories that center on women. Are you hopeful that will continue?\n\nA: I would say I am hesitantly optimistic. What's so important is that it's not just talk, but how do we create a new culture, how do we create systemic change? And I'm really glad that there is a lot of brains behind that, and a lot of passion and commitment behind that.\n\nAD\n\nAll stories that portray complex women are vital, and the parenting experience is one where we have a lot of work to do in portraying deeper layers, getting beyond our stereotypes and preconceived notions. It's my hope we do that in Egg.\n\nQ: What do you hope people — parents or not — will take away from this movie?\n\nAD\n\nA: It's my hope that people take away from it that what happiness is is the courage to both be deeply curious and to commit to what makes you — personally — happy, and to not fall into any other societal norm or pressure. And that happiness is unique to every human. And also that we have no clue what makes anybody else happy. If I can bring those messages to people in a meaningful way, and maybe make them laugh a little bit, too, that would bring me outrageous joy.\n\nAD\n\nEgg, from screenwriter Risa Mickenberg and director Marianna Palka, premiered at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival and will be released in select theaters and online Jan. 18.
But already pending for the South Florida retiree is a trio of lawsuits that allege defamation, fraud and more fraud — all of which are helmed by one attorney.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI became the go-to person to sue the president, says Kaplan, 54, with considerable relish.\n\nShe is in many ways the ideal legal adversary to take on Trump. Kaplan is a brash and original strategist, with neither a gift for patience nor silence, a crusader for underdogs who has won almost every legal accolade imaginable. Kaplan, says New York Democratic Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in an email, has been indispensable in the fight against the cancer of hate and division that Trump spent four years exacerbating.\n\nBefore the presidency, Trump was often as engaged in legal tussles as he was in real estate, suing and threatening to sue his way out of financial trouble. With a return to private life, his terror is that he will no longer be protected by the office and will have to deal with these lawsuits, says his niece. Trump faces the prospect of spending considerable time in the role of defendant. Kaplan says she will seek to depose him in all three cases. Trump's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment on the cases in this article.\n\nThe Post's Shayna Jacobs explains how state and local investigations of President Trump are expanding to his tax write-offs. (The Washington Post)\n\nFor much of her career, there was little in Kaplan's professional bio to suggest she would become an attorney suing behemoths. Kaplan, known to all as Robbie, is a self-described traditionalist, in pearls, pumps and, pre-coronavirus, superior blond highlights, who long worked as a top commercial litigator at Paul, Weiss, one of the nation's preeminent firms, where the fees tend to be if-you-have-to-ask-you-surely-can't-afford-us.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut she became increasingly identified as an advocate for liberal causes and innovative legal strategies. She is a lesbian, an observant Jew and a die-hard Democrat for whom 12 hours constitutes a light workday.\n\nMy maternal grandmother always hated a bully, Kaplan says during a series of phone interviews. One really good job for going after bullies is to be a lawyer.\n\nSince launching her own firm four years ago, Kaplan has initiated a constellation of cases against powerful, often intimidating forces: white supremacists, major Hollywood players, the president of the United States. Legal writer Dahlia Lithwick calls her an attorney general for the resistance.\n\nStanford University law professor Pamela Karlan says of their frequent legal conversations: Robbie's not calling about feelings. She wants to fix it first. She's the least diffident person I've ever met. Plenty of smart people worry about failing. They worry about every little thing. Robbie doesn't worry about that. In a really disarming way, she doesn't care if people view her as hyperaggressive.\n\nIn Kaplan's third Trump case, she represents participants in ACN, a multilevel marketing company promoted on The Celebrity Apprentice. They're suing not ACN, but the former host and his three oldest children, accusing them of committing fraud in endorsing the company as a promising business opportunity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Trump billed himself as a populist, Kaplan perceived a consistent disconnect in how Trump University and other enterprises allegedly took advantage of the very people whose interests he claimed to champion.\n\nBecause of his prominence, he marketed his ability to convince unsophisticated, very poor Americans to invest, says Kaplan, who was indignant that Trump would exploit people like this to line your own pockets.\n\n(In a Business Insider story, a Trump organization spokesperson responded to the suit by saying, Before enrolling with ACN, every participant acknowledged in writing that they are 'not guaranteed any income.'  In that story, ACN co-founder Robert Stevanovski claimed the plaintiffs were told that Trump was getting paid to endorse the company. I think it's politically motivated that they're going to sue him and the family and not us, he said.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nKaplan remains most celebrated for the Edie Windsor case that, in 2013, successfully struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, paving the way with stunning alacrity for the legalization of same-sex marriage two years later to the day.\n\nAmong Kaplan's strategic moves — I don't know where I found the chutzpah to do this — was to help coax Bill Clinton to publish a Washington Post opinion piece renouncing his 1996 support of DOMA before she appeared before the nation's highest court. United States v. Windsor remains the only U.S. Supreme Court case that she has ever argued.\n\nA little girl with a big mouth. That's how Kaplan's grandmother described her, meant with affection. Growing up in Cleveland, she was a rigorous student who designed a plan. Head East to a top school (Harvard), train as a lawyer (Columbia), become a New Yorker.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFive years ago, that plan expanded to landing a top Justice Department position in Hillary Clinton's administration.\n\nSo, no.\n\nInstead, in the summer of 2017, Kaplan launched her own boutique firm, still a rarity among female corporate lawyers, creating an unusual model that combines lucrative commercial litigation with a progressive public-interest practice. Free from the agendas of risk-averse institutional clients, Kaplan and her colleagues could take on any case they believed had merit.\n\nOne week after the firm moved into its 71st-floor offices in the Empire State Building, the furniture yet to arrive, Charlottesville erupted.\n\nBelieving that Trump's Justice Department seemed unlikely to seriously investigate and prosecute the people responsible for the violence during the Unite the Right rally and counterprotest — he infamously claimed there were very fine people, on both sides — Kaplan announced, and this was her precise language to friends and colleagues: I want to sue Nazis.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBecause, why not?\n\nWithin days, Kaplan and her team flew to Virginia. The firm adopted an outside-the-box approach and sued two dozen avowed neo-Nazis, white supremacists and associated groups, invoking the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act to argue that they conspired for months to commit racially motivated violence, thereby making it more of a challenge for the organizers to adopt free speech as a defense. The case is scheduled for trial in October.\n\nIn the wake of Harvey Weinstein's sexual misconduct revelations, Kaplan co-founded the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which offers financial assistance for plaintiffs filing harassment cases, and she now serves as chair of the Time's Up organization. Many women who say they have been sexually harassed or assaulted have come to her. The actress Amber Heard sought Kaplan's representation in ex-husband Johnny Depp's $50 million case involving a 2018 Washington Post opinion piece by Heard; he alleges she defamed him by implying that he domestically abused her. (The op-ed does not explicitly name him.) In the complaint, the actor denies any abuse took place.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHeard says of Kaplan, I'm instantly drawn to the type of individual who can look upon the Goliath and say, 'I think I can take you.' That kind of energy and temerity is rare in the world, especially in the legal world.\n\nSuing the powerful has brought repeated threats. Kaplan has an apartment in Manhattan but requested that her country home's location, where she has spent the pandemic working, go unnamed.\n\nKaplan says the greatest abuse she's received on social media has come not from neo-Nazis, white supremacists or Trump's true believers, but from Depp's vehement online champions.\n\nA hallmark of Kaplan Hecker & Fink is crafting complaints in layman's language that packs a wallop. The Mary Trump brief is a doozy. For Donald J. Trump, his sister Maryanne, and their late brother Robert, fraud was not just the family business — it was a way of life, the complaint begins, before alleging three duplicitous schemes, The Grift, The Devaluing and The Squeeze-Out.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSays Mary Trump, That brief is literature.\n\nThe president's lawyers, in an effort to have the case tossed, claimed that the complaint is laden with conspiracy theories.\n\nWhen Carroll first met with Kaplan, the lawyer quickly understood her client's objective. I don't give two flying figs about an apology, Carroll says. I am dying to get him in a deposition. I want him to say that I'm not a liar. I just want him to admit that he lied and that, yes, it happened.\n\nThe last few years of Kaplan's professional life, with her firm swelling from four to 43 elite lawyers, are inextricably intertwined with Trump. Without his election, Kaplan might not have launched her own firm as quickly or filed three lawsuits against him.\n\nI'm ready. I'm excited, says Kaplan. In the Carroll case, Kaplan believes that Trump's proclivity for false and misleading statements — with more than 30,000 of them during his White House term, according to The Post — will be tested when he is under oath. During a 2007 Trump deposition, lawyers caught him making exaggerated claims 30 times, according to a 2016 Post investigation.\n\nWhen we depose you, you're not going to get away with that, Kaplan says. He had the mantle of the presidency, and that's now gone.\n\nKaplan is celebrated for her candor. She's active in LGBTQ causes, recently serving as the board chair of the Gay Men's Health Crisis. She rhapsodizes about her big gay Jewish wedding in 2005 to Rachel Lavine, a liberal activist who serves on New York's Democratic committee.\n\nYet Kaplan remained in the closet until law school graduation.\n\nRobbie is one of the most conventional radicals you'll ever meet, Lithwick says.\n\nIn 1991, Kaplan came out to her parents at age 25. It did not go well. Her mother walked up to a wall and began banging her head, repeatedly, in dismay. Which she has apologized for over and over again, Kaplan says. The family remains close.\n\nKaplan experienced a rare episode of depression, which led her to consult a therapist named Thea Spyer, who referenced her lesbian relationship in an effort to comfort Kaplan — and whose death in 2009 left a punitive estate-tax bill to her partner, Edie Windsor, because their marriage wasn't legally recognized, sparking the Supreme Court case that helped define Kaplan's career.\n\nWhy did such an outspoken person hide her true identity for so long?\n\nI'd never been a burn-down-the-ramparts sort of person. I believed in working in institutions, says Kaplan. Living a life very much on the margins didn't appeal to me. I really wanted to have kids. I really wanted to be part of the Jewish community. I really wanted to have a career. All of this would have been unavailable in the world I grew up in.\n\nShe has all of that — the marriage, a son (Jacob, now 14), a goldendoodle. On Sunday mornings, she participates in a Talmud discussion group with her rabbi and Lithwick.\n\nAlso, I knew when I met Rachel there was no way I was going to be able to be in the closet and be with Rachel, Kaplan says. Those two things were completely incompatible. Everyone in the New York gay rights movement knew Lavine. Politics, civic engagement and intellectual rigor were part of the attraction. On an early date in a romantic Chelsea bistro, the two argued at length over the comparative power of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks during the Russian Revolution.\n\nAlthough known for her fresh legal arguments, Kaplan was comfortable working in a large firm. She seemed unlikely to go out on her own. In many ways, it's the boldest professional move she's made.\n\nWhat makes a good litigator and lawyer is being a pessimist and risk-averse because you need to be looking at problems around the next corner, says Karlan, who helped prepare Kaplan for the Supreme Court argument. Robbie has been as successful as she is because she doesn't appear to be that kind of thinker. She's an optimist.\n\nThe firm's high-profile cases have attracted top legal talent, like Joshua Matz, who briefly left the firm last year to help the House Judiciary Committee draft articles of impeachment.\n\nWe've learned that, in presenting options to Robbie, she will presumptively favor the most aggressive option, Matz says. She is jaw-droppingly strategic and savvy on the one hand, and extremely bold on the other.\n\nIt's also a menschy practice. What's unusual is the sheer amount of contact she has with her clients, Karlan says. Kaplan celebrated Passover with Windsor, who died in 2017. She's available at all hours for phone consultations. Gifts of food are constant. She sent Heard a box of chicken soup, lox and bagels.\n\nCiting logistical challenges that were better served by local counsel, Kaplan's firm no longer represents Heard in the defamation case, which is scheduled for trial in May.\n\nYet Kaplan continues to offer Heard legal advice on the case and other legal matters. They speak regularly, sometimes daily. She is the bravest lawyer I have ever met. She doesn't get intimidated or scare easily, Heard says. The well-behaved woman never interested me. There's a rebellious part of Robbie. I think of her as my Jewish mother.\n\nKaplan's close friend Sharon Nelles, head of litigation at Sullivan & Cromwell, says: If you can come at the world the way she does, you are not reined in by whether there are social constructs or boundaries. You can create your own mold. Lawyers for the most part react. Robbie acts.\n\nNelles recalls a time when Kaplan called to consult on a case. She's yapping at me on the phone and then lets out a little screech.\n\nNelles asked what was wrong. Oh, I'm having a medical procedure, Kaplan said. Let me call you back when I get off the doctor's table.\n\nMary Trump hired Kaplan to sue President Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry and the estate of his late brother Robert Trump because I want justice for my daughter, and for me, and for my dad. If Donald Trump is not going to be held accountable for other things, he needs to be held accountable for this, she says, adding: Maybe that will start the dominoes to fall. Maybe other people will feel that they, too, have options and will come forward. Kaplan's firm regularly fields inquiries from potential clients who wish to sue Trump.\n\nCarroll cannot wait for her day in court with Trump. She's already picked out her outfit. Black. Armani.\n\nShe also views her lawsuit as symbolic, saying, It's for all the women in the country who have been harassed or assaulted by powerful men, and feel helpless to do anything about it.\n\nSo Carroll's doing something about it.\n\nI don't have to be brave, she says. Because Robbie Kaplan is brave for me.
Jackson Jordan, says our source, looked cool and casual at the Sunday event, posing for photos and mingling with other Washington notables, such as Fox 5's Shawn Yancy and D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's brother Marvin. But what guests didn't see and what Jackson Jordan herself might not be aware of, according to a source close to the production, is the drama already brewing beneath the surface.\n\nAD\n\nPotomac watchers might recall the shocking revelation during the show's reunion special that Jackson Jordan hadn't spoken to her estranged husband, former Wizards coach Eddie Jordan, in months? Followed by fellow castmate Gizelle Bryant's revelation that Jackson Jordan had a boyfriend? That didn't go over well. But the two friends eventually kissed and made up, say acquaintances of both women, putting the ugly cheating rumors behind them. Exhibit A: Bryant was a guest at Jackson Jordan's glitzy New Year's Eve party.\n\nBut reality TV has a way of microwaving old drama and, according to a person who got a sneak peek at the season two premiere, unbeknown to Jackson Jordan the series opens with Bryant rehashing the boyfriend rumor, spending a large chunk of the first episode blaming Jackson Jordan for the breakdown of her marriage.\n\nAD\n\nTypically reality show cast members don't see the finished product until it airs on TV. That means Jackson Jordan wasn't aware of Bryant's continued shade.
Mr. Adelson (pronounced ADD-ul-son), who fought his way up from an arduous childhood in Boston, was a vivid and polarizing character, a serial entrepreneur who transformed gambling in Las Vegas and Macao and brought the same bare-knuckled approach to the exercise of political influence.\n\nAD\n\nOne of the world's richest self-made men, he amassed an estimated fortune at one point this decade valued at $40 billion — Forbes now lists it at $35 billion — and used much of it to advance conservative causes and leaders, including a $25 million donation to help elect Donald Trump as president in 2016. He also played a sizable role in underwriting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's return to power in 2009.\n\nAD\n\nIn Jerusalem and Washington, Mr. Adelson brandished his money and influence to advance his favorite cause: a strong Israel that precludes a Palestinian state. He also started and bought newspapers in Nevada and Israel that promoted his views.\n\nLittle known outside the business world for much of his life, Mr. Adelson vaulted to the forefront of national politics in 2012, when he and his wife buoyed the faltering presidential campaign of former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) with tens of millions of dollars in donations to a political action committee.\n\nAD\n\nGingrich began calling Palestinians an invented people and playing up support for Israel's West Bank settlements as a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy. Gingrich's bid collapsed, but Mr. Adelson's jaw-dropping financial support showed that he was willing to invest heavily in politicians who shared his beliefs. He and his wife, Miriam, ended up giving an estimated $93 million in the 2012 election cycle to an alphabet soup of conservative PACs backing Republican office-seekers — not including contributions to groups that were not required to disclose their donors.\n\nThe Adelson primary\n\nAs Barack Obama's two-term presidency was ending, Mr. Adelson doubled down on the GOP's struggles to nominate a winning candidate in 2016. Dangling up to $30 million as bait, he conducted what journalists called the Adelson primary, in which aspiring presidential nominees traveled to his Venetian hotel and casino in Las Vegas to solicit his money and his blessing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe interrogated many of the 17 GOP aspirants in 2016 on their support for Israel. The process helped end the candidacy of early front-runner Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, and elevated Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) to national prominence. Ultimately, Mr. Adelson endorsed New York businessman Trump before the GOP convention. According to Open Secrets, a nonprofit website that tracks campaign contributions, he and Miriam, his second wife, gave $83 million to Republicans in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nEarly in the campaign, Trump had called himself sort of a neutral guy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Mr. Adelson's views were soon reflected in the candidate's platform. As the year wore on, Mr. Adelson earmarked $25 million for a Trump PAC and, after the election, he made a record-breaking $5 million donation to Trump's inaugural committee.\n\nIn office, Trump renounced more than five decades of U.S. foreign policy that called for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He formally recognized Jerusalem — a city that Palestinians, as well as Israelis, claim as their own — as the capital of Israel. He also moved the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv, undermining the American role as an ostensibly neutral arbiter in a region brimming with religious tension and violence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMr. Adelson, a driving force in the effort to relocate the embassy, pledged millions of dollars to the State Department to help pay for a new building. Although the legality of fulfilling that offer was dubious, it brought into sharper focus his role as a key player in the Trump administration's relationship with Israel.\n\nIn May 2018, Mr. Adelson and his wife had prime seats at the formal dedication of the new embassy in Jerusalem. Less than 50 miles away, conflict was erupting on the Gaza border, where dozens of Palestinian protesters were killed by Israeli soldiers. His Las Vegas newspaper, the Review-Journal, ran a front-page editorial, written by Miriam Adelson, with a headline proclaiming, A great day for Israel — and for America.\n\nMr. Adelson was also outspoken about his objections to Obama's diplomatic outreach to Iran — a potent regional adversary of Israel — and the multinational nuclear deal that resulted from that effort in 2015. In a 2013 speech at Yeshiva University in New York, Mr. Adelson suggested that U.S. negotiators should use the threat of a nuclear attack on Iran to bring Tehran to the table.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIf you really want peace, he said, it's very simple to send a message to your opposition.\n\nIn May 2018, Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, which the president called a giant fiction.\n\nMr. Adelson also gave generously to political causes unrelated to Israel — to campaigns against marijuana legalization, for instance, and to the fight against Internet wagering and online poker, which many in his industry viewed as an effort to safeguard his bricks-and-mortar casino empire in the guise of moral indignation. The gambling industry's main lobbying group also expressed surprise and dismay at his position.\n\nThis is not a money issue with me, Mr. Adelson told Politico in 2014. This is a moral issue. . . . When I started to imagine what would happen with legalized Internet gaming, it scared the heck out of me . . . because of what it's going to do to our society. Can you know your customer? No! Can you prevent money laundering? No! Can you prevent underage children?\n\nThe boy entrepreneur\n\nSheldon Gary Adelson was born in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood on Aug. 4, 1933. His father was a Jewish Lithuanian immigrant who worked as a cabdriver. His British-born mother ran a knitting business from the tenement where he grew up with three siblings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt 12, Mr. Adelson often recalled, he began selling newspapers, but he disliked sharing profits. So instead, he went into the business of leasing newspaper corners with the help of an uncle who lent him the money to get started. My uncle said, 'If I give you the $200, you have to show up every Tuesday with a $15 payment plus interest,'  Mr. Adelson told the Los Angeles Times. I said, 'Wait, I gotta pay this back?' He taught me about loans and about interest.\n\nAfter four years in the newspaper business, he said, he borrowed thousands of dollars from his uncle to buy a company that operated Boston-area candy-vending machines, some of which he placed in all-night gas stations catering to cabdrivers like his father.\n\nHe attended City College of New York but dropped out to train as a court reporter. After Army service, he entered into a variety of short-lived endeavors. He sold toiletry travel kits to hotels. He marketed a compound to de-ice car windows. He worked as a court reporter, a mortgage banker and a tour operator. He invested in real estate. He faced dozens of lawsuits from debt collectors. He made and lost a fortune twice.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 1979, Mr. Adelson and partners, taking note of the burgeoning personal-computer business, launched the Computer Dealers Exposition, or Comdex, in Las Vegas. The trade conference grew quickly and, after it was opened to the general public, drew hundreds of thousands of visitors to see the latest innovations in personal computers. Travel, hotel rooms, catalogues, display space on the show floor — all of it profited Mr. Adelson.\n\nThe Interface Group, the company set up to manage Comdex, was soon running a full calendar of such events, many of them at the Sands Expo and Convention Center, which Mr. Adelson opened in 1990.\n\nChanges in the computer business diminished the role of Comdex, which Mr. Adelson sold for $800 million in 1995 to Japanese mogul Masayoshi Son. A few years after the sale, Mr. Adelson's two sons from his first marriage sued him, alleging that he had understated the value of Comdex to cheat them. Mr. Adelson prevailed in 2001, but the lawsuit exposed the drug addiction that in 2005 claimed the life of his eldest son, Mitchell.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis first marriage, to the former Sandra Shapiro, ended in divorce. In 1991, he married Miriam Ochshorn, an Israeli-born internist and medical researcher who specialized in drug addiction treatment. In addition to his wife, survivors include two children from his first marriage, Gary Adelson and Shelley Adelson; and two sons from his second marriage, Adam Adelson and Matan Adelson; two stepchildren, Yasmin Lukatz and Sivan Dumont; and 11 grandchildren.\n\nInto the casino business\n\nIn 1988, Mr. Adelson and his partners bought the aging Sands Hotel and Casino, which had attained a louche appeal in the 1960s as the Las Vegas hangout of Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack. In November 1996, the Sands was demolished to make room for a Venice-themed hotel and casino to compete with Steve Wynn's Mirage, Treasure Island and (then under construction) Bellagio.\n\nAD\n\nWhen it opened in 1999, the Venetian featured high-end restaurants and shops, an indoor piazza bathed with faux Adriatic light, a reproduction of the bell tower in St. Mark's Square and an indoor waterway with singing gondoliers.\n\nNo, it's not like Venice, Mr. Adelson told New York magazine. It's better than Venice!\n\nMichael Green, a historian at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, said Mr. Adelson brought an audacious vision of everything a resort could do to make money besides gambling. Before long, they were copying it all over the world.\n\nAs he neared 70, in the early 2000s, Mr. Adelson made the most audacious move of his career — entering the casino market of Macao. The former Portuguese colony and seaport had become a special district of China a few years earlier.\n\nWhen he arrived in Macao, Mr. Adelson later said in court testimony, it was a seedy backwater of a gambling den that was prostitution-infested, crime-infested . . . everything wrong that would never happen in a state like Nevada, ever.\n\nMr. Adelson outmaneuvered several competitors to win one of two coveted slots for new casinos. Mr. Adelson's first Asian casino, Sands Macao, opened in 2004. The same year, his company, Las Vegas Sands, went public, making Mr. Adelson a billionaire several times over.\n\nBy the time he opened the extravagant, $2.4 billion Venetian Macao in 2007, Macao had surpassed Las Vegas as the world's largest gambling market. Mr. Adelson then expanded to Singapore, opening the $5.5 billion Marina Bay Sands in 2010.\n\nBut the casino business suffered during the global financial crisis, and Mr. Adelson became embroiled in legal difficulties, including allegations that underworld figures were welcome and frequent guests at his Asian properties.\n\nAccording to reports in the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Adelson's company was involved in questionable financial arrangements in Asia. Those arrangements were said to have included $50 million in payments to a Chinese businessman who helped ease the way for the Macao casinos.\n\nThe U.S. government charged Las Vegas Sands with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and in 2016 and 2017, the company paid more than $15 million in civil and criminal penalties.\n\nMr. Adelson and his family invested $1 billion to keep Las Vegas Sands afloat in the aftermath of the Great Recession, and the company went on to report a healthy recovery, thanks in large part to its casinos in Macao.\n\nManaging the image\n\nMr. Adelson's image has been burnished by many significant philanthropic contributions. He gave more than $65 million to Israeli universities and think tanks, $25 million to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and hundreds of millions to educational and cultural exchange programs.\n\nHe also used his money to launch or buy media outlets that served as a megaphone for his political causes and a means of countering criticism of his business practices.\n\nTo combat liberal influence in Israel, especially support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he started a newspaper in 2007 that blankets the nation with free copies. The Israel Hayom, which is owned through an Adelson relative, has been a consistent backer of Netanyahu's Likud coalition, an advocate of active Israeli settlement of the West Bank, and a foe of any Palestinian state.\n\nReporters and editors for the Las Vegas Review-Journal learned after the fact that Mr. Adelson had purchased their newspaper in late 2015 for $140 million, a price publishing consultants said was significantly higher than market value. The deal was arranged by Mr. Adelson's son-in-law through a holding company. Dissenting editors were soon gone, and the new team began to vet all stories alluding to Mr. Adelson and his many legal disputes.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Adelson had brought defamation suits against reporters. He drove at least one — John L. Smith, a prominent Review-Journal columnist — into bankruptcy, although the lawsuit, over errors in a book by Smith, was eventually dropped.\n\nDespite his financial and political muscle, Mr. Adelson never abandoned the persona of the scrappy underdog. He was also an aggressive micromanager, according to a New Yorker article that recounted how he once became impatient with a typist who had made a couple of errors in a letter. Adelson sat down and showed her how it was done — at ninety words a minute.\n\nHe took unabashed pride in his success, introducing himself as the richest Jew in the world, and he cultivated the image of a mercurial patron of people and causes.\n\nAn incident in 2007 exemplified Mr. Adelson's style as a power broker. For years a generous donor to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, he kicked in $10 million extra for AIPAC's posh new H Street NW headquarters in Washington. But before the building opened its doors, he took umbrage at AIPAC's support for increased financial aid to Palestinians, whose only purpose is to destroy Israel. He immediately pulled back his money, according to New York magazine.\n\nHe also was a generous donor and active member of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a pro-Israel group with access to leading members of the GOP.\n\nMr. Adelson had suffered since 2001 from a peripheral neuropathy, which made it difficult to walk, and he would appear in court riding a motorized scooter. Despite declining health, Mr. Adelson maintained active control of his business and political interests until the end. As his fortunes waxed and waned, although his preferred candidates sometimes lost elections, he seemed unruffled.\n\nEverything is cyclical, he told the publication Casino Journal in 2014. It's like gambling. Sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down.
Their two No. 1 hits — Sincerely and Sugartime — reflected the trio's sweet, earnest image. The sisters, who began singing in church in Ohio during the 1930s, had an uncanny sense of timing and close harmony matched by a perky, ever-smiling stage manner.\n\nAD\n\nThey were so close that they sometimes held hands as they sang or took their bows. Yet the spotlight seemed to shine the brightest on Phyllis McGuire, the youngest sister, who always stood in the center and sang the lead.\n\nAD\n\nMs. McGuire, who was 89 and the last surviving McGuire sister, died Dec. 29 at her home in Las Vegas. Her death was announced in a paid notice in the Las Vegas Sun newspaper. The cause was not disclosed.\n\nEven as musical tastes began to change, the McGuire Sisters kept going strong. By 1960, each of the sisters was earning more than $1 million a year.\n\nAfter a final appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1968, they parted ways. Christine and Dorothy were married and raising families. Phyllis, who had been married once in the 1950s, was single and raising eyebrows.\n\nAD\n\nRumors began circulating, and then were confirmed without apology by Ms. McGuire, that she was the girlfriend of Chicago mob boss Sam Giancana.\n\nThey had met in 1959, when Ms. McGuire and her sisters were performing at the Desert Inn, one of the Las Vegas casinos run by Giancana. Who's the one in the middle? he reportedly asked.\n\nAD\n\nMs. McGuire, who had a weakness for the blackjack tables, ran up a debt of tens of thousands of dollars at the Desert Inn. Giancana, watching from afar, told his casino boss to eat it — or forgive the debt.\n\nThus began one of the most unlikely romances in show business. Giancana, who got his start as Al Capone's driver in Chicago, was widowed, bald and in his 50s. He had been arrested dozens of times, linked to crimes from illegal gambling to murder, and had served time in prison.\n\nAD\n\nMs. McGuire was still in her 20s and had a public image as benign and carefully arranged as one of the McGuire Sisters' hit songs. Giancana sent her lavish gifts of jewelry and furs and often met her overseas, wherever the sisters were performing. Strange as it may seem, everyone who knew them agreed they were in love.\n\nAD\n\nIt's amazing that it ever took place, William F. Roemer Jr., an FBI agent who tracked Giancana for years, told the Los Angeles Times in 1995. She had everything. She had beauty. She had money. Yet, she fell in love with this gangster. I could never figure it out.\n\nIn 1961, FBI agents wiretapped their room in a Phoenix motel. Later, after being questioned about Giancana's activities, Ms. McGuire pleaded ignorance. Federal authorities asked her to cooperate, with the implicit threat that her career would be ruined if her affair with a mafia kingpin were exposed.\n\nAD\n\nShe said she would, but she never did, Roemer said. She never cooperated with us. She double-crossed us really.\n\nIn 1965, Ms. McGuire testified before a grand jury investigating Giancana for racketeering. She admitted that they had a relationship and that she was aware of his reputation but maintained she knew nothing about his life of crime.\n\nAD\n\nThe revelation really hurt our career, Ms. McGuire told the Chicago Tribune in 1989. We were blacklisted for a while on TV. . . . We were America's sweethearts, and for one of America's sweethearts to be with that man . . . \n\nGiancana went to prison for a year in 1965, then lived in Mexico and South America, where he was visited by Ms. McGuire. He later moved back to suburban Chicago and was cooking in his basement in 1975 when an assailant entered and shot him seven times in the head. The murder was never solved.\n\nAD\n\nI just knew that I liked the man, Ms. McGuire told the Los Angeles Times in 1986. He was very nice to me. And if he had done all those things they said he did, I wondered why in God's name he was on the street and not in jail.\n\nPhyllis Jean McGuire was born Feb. 14, 1931, in Middletown, Ohio, and grew up in the nearby town of Miamisburg.\n\nAD\n\nHer father was a steelworker, and her mother was a minister. Phyllis was 4 when she and her sisters began singing in their mother's church. (Christine was five years older than Phyllis, Dorothy three years older.) Before long, they were performing at weddings, revival meetings and the USO. They had a long engagement at a hotel in Dayton, Ohio, and appeared on radio and television.\n\nAD\n\nIn 1952, the McGuire Sisters moved to New York and landed an eight-week engagement on Kate Smith's radio show. They later won a talent contest and were featured on Arthur Godfrey's popular TV show. Their first Top 10 hits came in 1954, with Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight and Muskrat Ramble, and Sincerely reached No. 1 in 1955.\n\nTwo years later, they recorded Sugartime, by Charlie Phillips and Odis Echols, which climbed to No. 1 in 1958 and became the sisters' signature tune:\n\nAD\n\nSugar in the mornin'\n\nSugar in the evenin'\n\nSugar at suppertime\n\nBe my little sugar\n\nAnd love me all the time\n\nEven before the sisters broke up in 1968, Phyllis McGuire began working on her own, including an acting role in the 1963 Frank Sinatra film Come Blow Your Horn.\n\nAD\n\nBy 1985, the McGuire Sisters were ready to launch a comeback, but they struggled to re-create the instinctive harmonies they had in their youth.\n\nWe rehearsed eight hours a day, five days a week for six months, Phyllis McGuire told the Tribune in 1989. Then one day, after perspiring and toiling and worrying, we started rehearsing and all in the same instance we looked at each other and said, 'My God, thank you, that's it.' We had it back.\n\nWearing matching dresses and hairstyles, the sisters performed in nightclubs and concert venues until 2004. Dorothy McGuire died in 2012, Christine McGuire in 2018.\n\nPhyllis McGuire's early marriage to Neal Van Ells ended in divorce. After Giancana's death, she was occasionally linked to wealthy men, but she never remarried and had no immediate survivors.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA 1995 HBO film, Sugartime, starring Mary-Louise Parker and John Turturro, portrayed Ms. McGuire's life with Giancana. She denounced it as riddled with blatant inaccuracies, exaggerations and distortions.\n\nIn 1999, after Las Vegas police stopped her limousine and questioned her driver, the 68-year-old Ms. McGuire emerged from the car screaming, waving and flailing her arms and was arrested for head-butting and kicking a police officer. Charges were dropped after a plea deal.\n\nMs. McGuire was an astute investor, and it is widely believed that much of Giancana's fortune came into her hands. She had a jewelry collection said to rival those of Elizabeth Taylor and Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos.\n\nShe lived on one of the grandest estates in Las Vegas, in a house that contained, under its roof, a 40-foot replica of the Eiffel Tower and another of the Arc de Triomphe. Steel shutters could cover the bulletproof windows with the touch of a button. She had five gardeners and a pond with black swans floating by.\n\nAD\n\nI'm not ashamed of my past, she told Vanity Fair, describing everything from music to the mob. I was doing what I honestly felt.
Dear Amy: I am in my 60s, the oldest of four children. My relationship with my family was distant, but for the past 10 years, I've attended a few family events (we are now all geographically scattered), kept in touch with my two brothers and have made an effort to see my mother, who's getting older and lives alone.\n\nMy sister hasn't liked me since high school. The last time I saw or talked to her was at my brother's wedding, a dozen years ago.\n\nMy sister's son got married a few years ago. I was the only member of the immediate family who wasn't invited to the wedding. I was heartbroken.\n\nMy mother and my two brothers said nothing. They stood by and allowed her to treat me this way.\n\nMy mother's 89th birthday is coming up. My siblings are traveling to where she lives to attend the celebration. Though I want to be part of it, I don't know if I can bring myself to be there.\n\nThis situation tears me apart. If I go, everyone will assume I'm over it and all is forgiven. All is not forgiven. I'll never forgive my sister. And I harbor hurt and anger against my brothers and mother for standing by and allowing it to happen.\n\nHow do I decide whether to go? I keep thinking, To thine own self be true.\n\nSad\n\nSad: Do an accounting of the pluses and minuses of attending this event. On the plus side, you may reconnect with your mother. You may also avoid suffering from guilt later on. In the minus column, you will be in the presence of people who have hurt you.\n\nThe path toward going does involve acceptance, if not forgiveness. Acceptance means that you acknowledge the faults and failings of other people, which have had such an impact on you, and find a way to lean in toward your own truth.\n\nYour mother's birthday party is not the place to air your grievances, but it is the perfect place to celebrate your own strength in being able to rise above people who have hurt you. Understand that your mother has four children and that she cannot choose among you.\n\nIf you do go, use an escape hatch. Tell yourself that you will stay for an hour, and then make a choice about staying another hour.\n\nDear Amy: My ex-husband and I have known each other since we were kids. We are both in our 30s. We remain good friends.\n\nI had signs that I was about to make a huge mistake before getting married. After two years, I started to feel as though I was trapped.\n\nI tried counseling, and it made me realize that I needed to let him go. Now, I feel so ashamed. I hate myself for this. I stayed married to him because I was afraid of what people were going to say if I left.\n\nAfter so many failed relationships, I think maybe I'm just meant to be alone. I decided that the best thing to do is to never get involved. The thought of it makes me anxious and depressed.\n\nGod will never forgive me for this. It makes me want to lose my mind. Just thinking about getting involved with anyone ever again gives me anxiety. I don't want to fail again.\n\nI need help dealing with these feelings.\n\nHurt\n\nHurt: I don't think God judges or interferes in human relationships. Your guilt about leaving your marriage is something you must tackle and conquer before you will feel comfortable moving forward. You chose counseling to help you understand that you should leave your marriage; you should continue with the process to wrangle with the feelings you are having now. Nobody wants to fail, and yet we all do. Failing and falling are part of the human experience. Risking failure is an act of bravery, and with help, you can be brave again.\n\nDear Amy: You criticized From We to I for insisting that her boyfriend not refer to his life with his ex-wife using we.\n\nI'm in her camp. He needs to avoid phrasing responses in ways that make her think about his past. The proper question she should pose to him is whether he wants her to be thinking about him with his ex as they move forward.\n\nDisappointed\n\nDisappointed: After almost 30 years of marriage, insisting that her boyfriend basically pretend that he had been alone the whole time seemed unrealistic to me.
So now that this season is winding down, one of Peter's leading ladies, Madison, takes him aside to inform him that if you were to sleep with somebody else, it would be really hard for me to move forward with you on this. (She's a virgin but hasn't told him that yet.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn no way do I want to give you an ultimatum … but for me, actions speak louder than words, she tells him.\n\nHe's crazy about her, he says. But I don't just have one relationship, Peter says in an interview with producers, before his Fantasy Suite dates with Hannah Ann and Victoria.\n\nLet's see how this goes.\n\nHis date with Hannah Ann\n\nHannah Ann and Peter ride jet-skis on Australia's Gold Coast. Later, they have dinner. After that, they presumably have sex.\n\nHis date with Victoria\n\nVictoria and Peter ride in a helicopter over Australia's Gold Coast. Later, they have dinner. After that, they presumably have sex.\n\nHis date with Madison\n\nAs their doomed date begins, Peter tells Madison that they will be ascending a very tall building, one whose highest tiers are accessible only through a perilous-looking set of exterior stairs. Strapped to the metal railing, they take the steps slowly, Madison leading, Peter behind her, as if letting her test the way, unsure that they're really going to make it. They do.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut in another sense, they won't. I feel so safe and so secure, Madison says as they embrace at the top. She is implicitly describing her feelings for Peter, but in practice she has presumably been tricked into this feeling by all the hooks and ropes and such that are keeping her from blowing off the building should some strong breeze sweep over them.\n\nShe and Peter awkwardly kiss for the camera. They do not fall, though they apparently believe they are falling in love. I've never felt what I felt today with you, she later tells Peter of the experience, here, too, apparently conflating some alchemical admixture of vertigo and oxygen deprivation with real, deep-sprung emotion. Of course, as these things go, hers will not be the passing fancies that matter most.\n\nIt all goes as expected once they sit down for dinner: Madison doubles down on her assertion that she cannot be with Peter if he has slept with the other women on the show. Peter makes confused frowny faces. Madison extracts an uneasy confession from Peter. I'm not asking you to give me details, she tells him, already knowing what she needs to know as surely as she needs never to have known it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI'm not comfortable at all right now, says Peter. I don't want this to feel like it's all about sex, says Peter. I have been intimate, and I can't lie to you about that, says Peter.\n\nI literally can't talk to you right now, Madison says, talking.\n\nSome viewers wanted to compare Madison's expectations with those of Luke P., the villain who notoriously shamed Hannah Brown for having sex with Peter (four! times!) in the infamous windmill. That's not really fair for a few reasons. First, Madison makes it clear that the choice to walk away from the relationship is hers and that she understands that Peter has not chosen to save himself for marriage, as she has.\n\nAD\n\nSecond, she's not being overbearing about it in the way Luke was — he showed up at a rose ceremony uninvited, after Hannah had already dismissed him. Third, Luke P. is the worst.\n\nAD\n\nBut while her moral fortitude is admirable, you have to wonder what Madison thought she was getting herself into. The only two things most people knew about Peter before this season were that he was a pilot and that he was a man who had lots of sex in a windmill. Not exactly a dude known for self-restraint! Definitely a dude known for having premarital sex! So, yeah, there's a real mismatch in values here.\n\nChaste as Madison's desires may be, after her admission, the two fumble with her feelings. Madison flees the scene, into the Australian night, where two muscular kangaroos watch her from the bushes like the world's most useless fairy godmothers.\n\nAfter a moment so long it might as well have lasted the full two hours of this episode, Peter joins her, attempting to persuade her to give him a chance. He holds her face in his hands. He implores her to stay.\n\nShe does not.
Dear Amy: My former wife and I divorced after 26 years of marriage. She has refused to communicate with me.\n\nWe have twins in their late 20s — a daughter and a son. Although neither is married, each wants to eventually get married, and so I anticipate weddings.\n\nOur son graduates from law school this spring. He may feel awkward about having both his parents attend his graduation. Last year, he went through a terrible crisis — the death of one of his best friends. It was terribly hard on him, yet his mom never talked to me about how we might help him.\n\nSuch occasions — a grief-stricken child, and a grown child's life event — call for parents to come together. I want to talk with my former wife about the upcoming graduation. What do you suggest?\n\nLoves His Twins\n\nLoves His Twins: Ideally, you and your ex-wife would be able to discuss not just the huge events in your twins' lives, but you would also be capable of simply checking in from time to time. However, your former wife is not willing to communicate with you, and so your twins are consigned to do the eternal dance of children of divorce, dealing with their parents separately and discreetly, as these young adults come to dread the tension initiated by big events.\n\nIf you want to try to communicate with your ex, you could send her an email titled Graduation in the subject line. Keep your email short, neutral and factual: Tell her what your plans are and ask her if she wants to coordinate.\n\nShe may not answer. I hope you'll make a choice to simply be the easy, accommodating, warm and loving parent, regardless of your ex's behavior. Always act cordially toward and about your ex. Never criticize her to your children. Take the high road. It's not the easiest road, but it offers the best view.\n\nDear Amy: My husband and I put together a nice outside sitting area each summer. Gradually, more and more of his friends started dropping over. They don't work and live to get drunk every day. I don't like being around this, or the cigarette smoke.\n\nIt got so bad we hardly had a single day without at least one dropping over. After much wrangling, we finally agreed to one night a week for my husband to have his friends over in the nice weather. However one friend, Dave, started dropping by in the winter and would come inside to sit and drink. He has caused much trouble in the past with drunken behavior.\n\nThey both promised me that he would only come over at the designated times, but that seems to have slipped away.\n\nI know if I give an inch he will take a mile. I hate coming home from work and seeing him sitting in my living room. My dad was an alcoholic, so I have issues. My husband is free to go to Dave's house but doesn't. He doesn't think it should be a big deal if Dave comes over when I'm not home.\n\nI almost left my husband when he didn't limit his friends' visits. I feel I have to firmly hold my ground, or it will start all over again. I would like to know if I am being unfair. I feel like my husband chooses his friend's wishes over mine.\n\nUpset\n\nUpset: This is your husband's home, too. He should have the freedom to have friends over. However, if you are at work all day and he is not, he has many hours to use the home however he likes.\n\nGiven the way you describe this situation, it does not sound fair to you. I can imagine how challenging it would be to come home from work to a drunken lout (or two).\n\nYour husband and Dave should respect your reasonable request to limit Dave's visits.\n\nDear Amy: In response to Worried and her boyfriend's frequent white lies, I can relate.\n\nI grew up in a family where Never let the facts get in the way of a good story! was practically our motto. My mom told little lies in front of us kids constantly, especially on the phone to her friends and work. My husband called me out on it when we first got married. I didn't even realize I was doing it. It was learned behavior from my upbringing. I am grateful he brought it to my attention. Perhaps Worried should do the same with her boyfriend.\n\nFormer Liar\n\nFormer Liar: Good advice!
Dear Amy: My husband and I recently discovered that our closest friends (another couple) are having an open relationship. They say they are polyamorous.\n\nI am having a very hard time accepting this. They were in our wedding, and we were in theirs. In the past 10 years, I can't remember having a single disagreement with them, but I can't seem to get past this.\n\nThey didn't even tell us about it. We found out because the husband was hanging all over another woman very publicly at their annual party. My husband found out what was really going on through another longtime friend.\n\nThe couple says they are both sleeping with this other woman. It didn't look like that, though. The husband didn't pay any attention to his wife all night.\n\nThese friends of ours are expecting their first child soon and have asked us to be the child's godparents.\n\nI am struggling. I know what I am feeling is wrong and that I shouldn't care what they do.\n\nBut I do care. For some dumb reason, I feel hurt and sadly disgusted.\n\nI don't know what I should do. My husband is willing to act like nothing is going on. I don't think I can.\n\nShould I walk away from a 10-year friendship? Should I try harder to get over my own feelings and ignore it? I thought I was a better and more accepting person.\n\nConfused Friend\n\nConfused Friend: Your own feelings are the natural consequence of your closest friends' choice to confound all of your expectations about them. When you stood up with them at their wedding, you witnessed their pledge to be sexually faithful. I assume that their choice to let you learn this important detail about them from others might hurt more than your judgment about their behavior.\n\nBecause they have declared their marriage to be open, you should openly talk to them about it. Express your concerns, focusing on the impact on your long friendship.\n\nIn this case, the wife's pregnancy might have upended their connection. But this unbridled openness will make their parenting tougher, not easier.\n\nWhen you are asked to be a godparent to a child, you are being asked to help the parents provide a spiritual backdrop to the child's life. Are you willing to carry on this job of being this child's loyal and constant adult friend through life? I hope so. But this will be a tough choice.\n\nDear Amy: I'm a woman who has been dating another woman for about a month now. I see this blooming into something more serious.\n\nOver the phone, we were talking about spending the night at her place for the first time when she mentioned that her roommate was one of her ex-girlfriends.\n\nI felt blindsided. I told her why it made me uncomfortable. She said she didn't want me to think it was anything more than a rent situation, which I believe to be true. Her exes figure prominently in her social life: Two of them are in her circle of college friends and she visits another regularly out of state.\n\nWhile I don't think this is a dealbreaker, it's a new situation for me — my exes and I are on good terms, but we don't hang out. I don't know how to hash out my feelings about this.\n\nIs my gut waving a red flag?\n\nUpset\n\nUpset: Your gut is not waving a red flag. If it does, see a gastroenterologist immediately.\n\nHowever, your instincts are kicking in, and you should never diminish your own natural reactions. Your instincts are informing you about how to proceed.\n\nThere is no downside to having a serious conversation about this. You should be inquiring, transparent and honest. Your girlfriend should be, too. If she downplays your concerns or says that you are somehow wrong to feel the way you feel, then this tells you something very important about her.\n\nMany people maintain no-big-deal friendships with their exes, but you obviously don't. The best thing for you to do is to get to know all of these people, observe the dynamics and trust your gut to be your guide.\n\nDear Amy: Worried caught her boyfriend in a number of small lies. She should consider that he might even be lying to her that he is single. The future with an untrustworthy person is not an easy one.\n\nBeen There\n\nBeen There: Once you've been lied to, building back trust is a very tough lift.
Buddy Bregman, an arranger and orchestra leader, works at a piano in Hollywood, Calif., in 1956. (Richard Tolbert/AP)\n\nBuddy Bregman, a Hollywood musical arranger and conductor who worked alongside some of the top entertainers of the 1950s and 1960s and helped shape Ella Fitzgerald's landmark Song Book albums celebrating the music of American tunesmiths such as Cole Porter and Richard Rodgers, died Jan. 8 at a retirement facility in Los Angeles. He was 86.\n\nHe had Alzheimer's disease, said his son, Barry Bregman.\n\nIn a multifaceted career that included television and film production and writing a musical play, Mr. Bregman was best known for his work as a musical arranger and conductor.\n\nPrecocious and prolific, he scored a No. 1 hit for singer Gogi Grant in 1956 with his version of The Wayward Wind. Before he turned 30, Mr. Bregman had collaborated with dozens of celebrated performers, including Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Rosemary Clooney, Jerry Lewis, jazz singer Anita O'Day and bandleader Count Basie. He wrote much of the music accompanying Bob Fosse's choreography in the 1957 film The Pajama Game.\n\nAt 25, while playing tennis at the Hollywood home of Clooney and her husband, actor Jose Ferrer, Mr. Bregman met jazz impresario Norman Granz, who offered him a job with his record company. The label was known as Verve, and Mr. Bregman became something of a house arranger, creating the musical framework and writing the orchestrations for O'Day, Crosby and others.\n\nWhen Granz signed Fitzgerald to his record, he wanted to showcase in an unprecedented way and hit on the idea of a series of albums featuring a single composer or composing. He asked Mr. Bregman to help select and arrange the music, beginning with the songs of Cole Porter.\n\nI picked every single song — in the afternoon in a darkened nightclub . . . on Hollywood Boulevard — me at the piano and Ella sitting on a bar stool next to me, Mr. Bregman recalled in an undated interview with music producer Bruce Kimmel on the website HainesHisWay.com. I would sing every song and then she would sing it back to me and probably halfway through we would either nod or shake or heads — we knew. This process took about a week of 5-hour days.\n\nBarry Bregman, a composer and music producer, recalled that Fitzgerald came to their house for rehearsals with his father.\n\nIn the end, Granz and Mr. Bregman decided to record 32 songs. Depending on the demands of the tunes, the arrangements were for string orchestra, a punchy big band or a small jazz ensemble.\n\nThe two-disc album was recorded over a three-day period in February, with Mr. Bregman conducting. Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book became both a hit album and an artistic success. Six months later, they collaborated on follow-up album of songs by Richard Rodgers and lyricist Lorenz Hart. It was another triumph and helped Fitzgerald as one of the foremost interpreters of classic American song.\n\nMr. Bregman's arrangements gave her the pop edge that made the material accessible to a mass market without losing a jazz feel, critic John McDonough wrote in liner notes for a 1993 reissue of the albums.\n\nOther arrangers, including Nelson Riddle, Duke Ellington, Paul Weston and Billy May, collaborated with Fitzgerald on the remaining six albums in the project, but Mr. Bregman's bracing arrangements were the first and rank among the best.\n\nCollectively, the Fitzgerald Song Book recordings are now considered definitive renditions of hundreds of classic songs by Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Ellington, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer.\n\nLouis Isidore Bregman was born July 9, 1930, in Chicago. His father was a wealthy executive with a steel company, and his mother was the sister of renowned Broadway and Hollywood composer Jule Styne.\n\nYoung Buddy, as he was always known, learned piano and saxophone at an early age. He spent summers in Hollywood with his uncle, watching him compose music. He wrote his first orchestrations when he was 11.\n\nHe attended the University of California at Los Angeles but dropped out to focus on music. In addition to his work in the studios, Mr. Bregman became the musical director for singer Eddie Fisher's television show from 1957 to 1959. He briefly had a show of his own in 1958 and later became the music director for singer Ethel Merman.\n\nIn the 1960s, Mr. Bregman turned to directing for television, including programs for Merman, Jonathan Winters and Danny Thomas. He later spent more than a decade in London, where he became a television producer for the BBC, largely of musical programs. He wrote a musical play, Jump Jim Crow, set in the Civil War-era South, for the Royal Shakespeare Co. in 1968.\n\nMr. Bregman's first marriage, to actress Gloria Haley, ended in divorce. He was linked with many glamorous women in the 1950s and 1960s, including singer-actress Anna Maria Alberghetti, singer Peggy King and actress Mamie Van Doren. He was married to actress Suzanne Lloyd from 1961 until their divorce in 1988.\n\nSurvivors include his son from his first marriage, Barry Bregman of Valencia, Calif.; a daughter from his second marriage, Tracey Bregman, an Emmy Award-winning actress in The Young and the Restless, of Malibu, Calif.; four grandsons; and a great-grandson.\n\nAfter trying to get various TV and film projects off the ground, with mixed success, Mr. Bregman returned in later years to music, composing arrangements for several recording projects.\n\nHe was considered master raconteur of Hollywood history, recalling the stars he admired (Crosby, Astaire, Merman) and others he found more difficult.\n\nIn 1956, he arranged and conducted Rock-a-bye Your Baby With a Dixie Melody for comedian Jerry Lewis.\n\nWorking with him was a blast, Mr. Bregman said. When the record sold a million copies, Lewis said Mr. Bregman deserved a gold record, as well.\n\nSo he did get me one: a black-and-white 8-by-10 glossy picture of the gold record! Enough said.
Lopez has 9-year-old twins from a marriage to singer Marc Anthony that ended in 2014. Rodriguez has children ages 12 and 8 with his ex-wife, Cynthia Scurtis.\n\nAD\n\nLoveBScott.com reported that a source had this to say about the couple: He was with her in Vegas during this latest leg of her Planet Hollywood Vegas show. They were all coupled up behind the scenes, not public, but absolutely not hiding their relationship around close friends and family. It is definitely for real.\n\nAD\n\nThat source also told the website that Rodriguez and Lopez have been quietly dating for a couple months, after Lopez broke things off with Drake. Rodriguez, meanwhile, had most recently been dating Anne Wojcicki, the CEO of a genetic testing firm and ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin.\n\nIn the past, the 41-year-old Rodriguez has been linked to such high-profile women as Madonna, Cameron Diaz and Kate Hudson. The three-time American League MVP, fourth all-time in home runs with 696, played his final game in August and has joined Fox Sports as a full-time MLB analyst. An Instagram post he shared Wednesday about his Fox Sports gig was liked by Lopez.\n\nA Fox Sports executive offered Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch a glowing report of Rodriguez's dedication to his new craft, saying, He is a true baseball nerd. I think he gets a certain fix doing this. … He's invested. If we have a noon meeting, he's there at 11:30 a.m. He's emailing story ideas in the morning. He wants research. He's almost all-in to the point where it's annoying.
Once he started having dates with her, I told him to leave — it would be her or me. Their relationship had become too intense with constant texting, telephone calls and late-night visits.\n\nHe left, but came back to me shortly after, saying that they had a long conversation and that they should cool their relationship.\n\nAD\n\nNow, even though they have cooled, they continue to text, and he goes to the house to fix things. He says she has no friends, and he worries about her.\n\nAD\n\nI'm having a difficult time trusting them considering the hell they put me through.\n\nHe says he has no friends. I have no problem with him having a friend, but they overstepped their relationship big time. How do I handle this, since he is the landlord?\n\nLeft and Bereft\n\nLeft and Bereft: This tenant needs to find another place to live.\n\nI'm going to assume that she won't be moving, and so — because you and your husband are trying to repair your marriage, he should offer you complete transparency regarding ALL of their contact. He should not be receiving or sending friendship texts. He should show you all communication between them. And you should go on service calls with him.\n\nAD\n\nUnderstand that at the end of the day, you are not responsible for your husband's lack of friends. He really does need to make a choice to fully commit to you, and so far, he doesn't seem to have actually made it.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: A close family member, Clara, concocted a completely false, salacious accusation about me, and — unbeknown to me — spread it through the family.\n\nThis was about four years ago. Eventually, her own daughter bravely took me aside and told me about her mother's accusations.\n\nOther family members corroborated that Clara had, indeed, spread rumors.\n\nI'm really private and socially awkward. It took me a couple of years to get the nerve to bring it up, but when I did, Clara quickly deflected, telling me that the devil was filling my mind with lies and that I just needed to pray about it.\n\nAD\n\nClara never acknowledged that she was the source of the gossip.\n\nClara is a sanctimonious churchgoer and advertises herself to be a saintly senior citizen. She has never acknowledged the lies and gossip she spread, nor offered any apology.\n\nAD\n\nI was blindsided. I was so humiliated that I wouldn't even go to the grocery store in my own town. I've worked through most of the hurt, but I have not forgotten.\n\nI want to bring it up again, but I don't want to seem foolish or petty.\n\nIs there any way to address this issue with her? Or should I let it go? The gossip has been spread and I can't un-ring that bell, but I would still like to know what made her do that. I guess I'd like some kind of closure.\n\nAD\n\nSmall Town Girl\n\nSmall Town Girl: You should prepare yourself for the likelihood that Clara will never reveal her motives for inventing and spreading gossip about you.\n\nGossip is about power and social currency. The person spreading it feels powerful being in the know. She also believes that putting someone else down through malicious and muckraking gossip increases her own social standing.\n\nAD\n\nYou should state your own truth and ask her to explain her motives. Tell her you would appreciate her correcting her misinformation, as well as an apology.\n\nI hope you can do this, regardless of her reaction, because standing up for yourself is both graceful and empowering. That's how you get closure.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: Regarding the letter from Torn, I had an emotional affair with my boss many years ago. I met with a therapist after I left that job. She counseled that I never see him again.\n\nBy the time he and I met again a decade later, our ardor had cooled to the point where I wondered what I ever saw in him.\n\nTorn should consider a normalization meeting with her husband, instead of her affair partner.\n\nGlad I Know Better Now\n\nGlad I Know Better Now: Bingo!
That may be the summary description of the plot of The Dig — or at least the historical facts on which the film, and its source material, a 2007 novel by John Preston — is based. But it doesn't begin to describe what this poetic little film is really about, or what it manages to say about the human condition. Gradually, and with the methodical patience of someone unearthing buried treasure with a tiny brush, The Dig reveals itself to be a story of love and estrangement, of things lost and longed for, of life and death — of what lasts and what doesn't.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDirected by actor/filmmaker Simon Stone, from a richly allusive screenplay by Moira Buffini (Tamara Drewe), The Dig begins in a straightforward manner: Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) has just engaged the services of Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes), a local man who hides his sharp archaeological instincts behind his job description: excavator — a designation he has chosen for himself that, like the film itself, engages in misdirection.\n\nSoon Basil's discovery — that Edith's estate is a burial ground of sorts — is laid bare, and the film proceeds with the standard fare of so many prestige British dramas. The coming war threatens the project, along with inclement weather and academic snobbery, personified by a pompous archaeologist from the British Museum (Ken Stott), who attempts to bigfoot Brown, commandeering his work site and dismissing his expertise, when word of the dig leaks out.\n\nBut slowly, slyly, the film deepens, becoming so much more than a period drama with pretty costumes, plummy accents and petty melodramas. In a sense, the tale of Brown's work — while momentous both historically and personally, as a tale of stolen credit — is, like what has been dug up in the dirt, merely a vessel for larger meaning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSubplots involving Edith's health, her worries for her cousin (Johnny Flynn), who is about to go off to battle, and the unhealthy marriage of a couple hired to work on the dig (Lily James and Ben Chaplin) enrich the sidelines of the story. What might have been mere embellishments, meant to juice up a dusty narrative, are, in the hands of Buffini and Stone, by the end of the film, the whole point.\n\nAnd what is that point?\n\nOn the most superficial level, it's that archaeology — even when the practice is explicitly being undertaken in a place where a corpse has been lain — isn't about the dead, but the living. The Dig is about the yearning, so human and, yes, so elusive and so futile, to fix the past so that it can be preserved.\n\nAD\n\nOf course, it can't, in any literal sense. Even the bits of iron, bronze and gold that get saved in museums won't last forever, any more than the people who made then, or the emotions we feel, and sometimes fail to show, for a loved one.\n\nBrown's dig dispelled myths about the Dark Ages, but The Dig explodes another greater and more haunting illusion, with grace and at times exquisite sadness: that we are anything more than ghosts.
Sok An, a deputy prime minister of Cambodia who was one of Prime Minister Hun Sen's closest political and personal allies, died March 15 at a hospital in Beijing. He was 66.\n\nA government statement confirmed the death but did not provide the cause. Sok An had been absent from public life for several months while he was widely understood to be undergoing medical treatment. He suffered from diabetes and other ailments.\n\nSok An was trusted with the sensitive task of negotiating with the United Nations to hold an internationally assisted tribunal to try leaders of the Khmer Rouge for genocide and other crimes, and overseeing Cambodia's role in it.\n\nCambodia, by holding the trials, sought to placate Western aid donors essential to its economy while limiting any domestic fallout, because Hun Sen and some of his political allies had at one time belonged to the Khmer Rouge. Trials began in 2009 but so far have led to the convictions of just three defendants.\n\nSok An's closeness to Hun Sen was underlined by the marriage of one of his sons, Sok Puthyvuth, to one of the prime minister's daughters, Hun Mali. Another son, Sok Soken, is married to the daughter of Industry Minister Cham Prasidh, and late last year was appointed an undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Hun Sen has served as Cambodia's leader since 1985.\n\nOn Monday, King Norodom Sihamoni granted Sok An the relatively exclusive royal title of samdech — loosely translated as lord — for protecting democracy, building up national peace and ensuring social stability.\n\nHun Sen and his wife, Bun Rany, and other senior ruling party members also hold the honorific title. The bestowal of the title, presumably at Hun Sen's request, came as rumors circulated that Sok An was near death.\n\nIn 1990, Sok An became vice minister of foreign affairs and vice minister of the interior. He was appointed to the Central Committee of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party in 1992, and became deputy prime minister in 1998.\n\nUnlike other senior members of the Cambodian People's Party, Sok An never was seen as a possible political challenger to Hun Sen, playing more the role of an apparatchik.\n\nPosts he held included chairman of the Council for Demobilization of Armed Forces, chairman of the National Tourism Authority of Cambodia, chairman of the Council for Public Administrative Reform, chairman of the Cambodian National Petroleum Authority and vice chairman of the National Information Communication Technology Development Authority.\n\n— Associated Press
Dear Amy: My wife of 20 years surrendered her daughter, Betsy, for adoption 30 years ago.\n\nMy wife and I were reunited with Betsy 10 years ago and have become very close, although Betsy lives in a different state.\n\nBetsy and her adoptive parents have become estranged over the past few years.\n\nSo now Betsy wants to divorce her current adoptive parents because of what she feels are irreconcilable differences and for (future) legal reasons that also involve her daughter (who is 8 years old). The adoptive parents considered her their granddaughter, of course.\n\nNow Betsy is asking my wife and her biological father, who has been out of the picture for 30 years, to become her new adoptive parents.\n\nI'm very open-minded, but something doesn't feel quite right.\n\nAt first, I thought this recognition was a nice idea, but now I feel that to go before a judge and make a public statement that she and Betsy's biological father are now adoptive parents, puts me in an uncomfortable position.\n\nI really have no idea what the legal ramifications might be for me and my wife, but really, the fact that a public statement is being made between the daughter's biological parents is what makes me most uncomfortable.\n\nTo complicate the matter further, my wife and I have children together, and we each have children from a previous marriage.\n\nDo you think I am being an oversensitive territorial man?\n\nNo Prior Precedent\n\nNo Prior Precedent: You are not being oversensitive. Betsy is not being sensitive enough. As your wife's longtime husband and father to the children, you two have together (and the children you had before your marriage), you detect a challenge to these relationships.\n\nI agree that this puts you in a vulnerable spot, and you should be very honest about your reaction to it.\n\nCheck your state laws regarding adult adoption. Some states require a spouse to sign a form approving the adoption. You and your wife should see an attorney regarding all of the legal ramifications to this adoption, for you and your entire family circle (including all of your collective children, as well as her child).\n\nAdditionally, you and your wife should see a family counselor to discuss the impact on you and your children. If Betsy manipulates your wife or pressures her for the adoption to be done very quickly, you should be skeptical about her motives. Do not agree to this in haste.\n\nDear Amy: I have been married for 34 years. My husband has a thing about being interrupted when he's talking. He gets very angry and will say, I'm talking! in a very rude manner.\n\nI never intend to interrupt him, but sometimes in a conversation, it just happens.\n\nHis response, and the way he delivers it, is embarrassing and hurtful.\n\nHe has also said, Stifle! to me in the past, although I think I have gotten the message across to him that this is unacceptable.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nEmbarrassed\n\nEmbarrassed: You are not responsible for your husband's rudeness. You ARE responsible for your own rudeness. And so — the very first thing you should do is to make a more concerted effort not to interrupt people. It is a very tough habit to break, but tackling this will make you a better listener and will change the dynamic in many of your relationships.\n\nThe next time you are aware that you are interrupting him, you should put your hand on his arm, make eye contact, and say, I'm sorry for interrupting; I realize you didn't finish your thought. This is meant to model respectful behavior, which your husband needs to adopt.\n\nWhen you two discuss this issue, you should let him know that he is not Archie Bunker, and you are not Edith. Nobody needs to be told to stifle. When he embarrasses you, he really embarrasses himself.\n\nHoney, you're interrupting, or Hang on and let me finish what I was saying are sufficient corrections.\n\nDear Amy: Concerned Mom described her challenging relationship with her daughter. Both mother and daughter are bipolar.\n\nI learned a lot and was helped by the good people at the National Alliance on Mental Illness. I found a local support group, and now I don't feel so alone.\n\nBeen There\n\nBeen There: I applaud the work of NAMI in advocating for people with mental illness. They have launched an app called NAMI Air, which is a social network to help people connect with one another.
I had a full-on anxiety attack when I got the offer letter, and every time I think about it, I feel nauseous and anxious and want to throw up. I feel like I'm ruining a good thing. This new job will be tougher hours, have a commute, require professional clothing every day and be very visible politically, all things I currently enjoy not having in my life.\n\nI'm also married and hoping to start a family soon. My spouse also works from home, but at a fairly low-paying job — in a field they love — and they haven't applied for a single new job since we met. They have progressed career-wise, but aren't as motivated as they like to talk up. I'm tired of, Next year I'll get a job that pays well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI have a lot of built-up resentment. I feel like I have to take this job to pay for our rent and a child and our lifestyle. On top of all of it, I do the vast majority of chores and emotional labor, and I'm just tired of it all.\n\nI guess I'm asking, is there another perspective on all this? I think logistically I have to take the job, so how do I get over the anxiety and resentment? It could be a wonderful fit, and I could love it, too; if I decided not to take it, I'd always wonder.\n\nAnd is it a bad idea to bring a child into this? It'll all get worse, won't it?\n\n— Anonymous\n\nAnonymous: Yes, it's a bad idea to bring a child into this. (So unfair to the child.)\n\nAD\n\nIt's also a bad idea to bring a job into this.\n\nEither take the job or don't take the job because that's what you want; don't take the job because you feel cornered into it by [counting on my fingers] your spouse's inertia, your lifestyle, your family plans, your rent, your ex-adviser, your education and experience, your frustration over broken promises, that side-eye you keep getting from your cat.\n\nAD\n\nJust as these aren't good enough reasons to take on a challenging new job, anxiety flare-ups aren't good enough reasons not to take on a challenging new job. Anxiety is a reason to seek treatment for your anxiety.\n\nThat, in turn, will help you make better decisions, and act better on the decisions you make.\n\nAD\n\nSimilarly: Your spouse's inertia — and your frustration, money concerns, family planning, and domestic and emotional labor imbalances — are all reasons to turn your attention to your marriage. Clearly you need to renegotiate the division of labor; an arrangement that breeds resentment is not sustainable. And if you're upgrading your job only because your spouse won't, then that needs due airing.\n\nHowever, it's not so clear what else has to change, if anything. What happens if you both stay in these lower-paying jobs you love? Does happiness count?\n\nAD\n\nIs it possible they talk up so much only because you keep pushing them to trade up?\n\nIs earning more your only option? Are your lifestyle costs so nonnegotiable, they decide what you both do for a living? Or is spending less an option?\n\nAD\n\nI see several different problems, pressures, needs, hopes and ambitions too knotted up for you to address any of them effectively. That alone could be making you anxious. It would also explain why it's so tempting just to hope the prestigious new job fixes everything.\n\nI hope you'll slow yourself (way) down, separate the different threads and give each of them your full attention, one at a time, in a logical order. Such as: anxiety, marriage, jobs/career and then, only then, the kid question. Tease them apart, then put yourself back together.\n\nDear Carolyn: Unless a guy has more than one wife, using they to describe her makes him appear uneducated. It doesn't matter who says it is okay, because it is not. It is bad grammar, and the feelings of those who don't care that it is are no more important than the feelings of those who do care.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI will immediately stop reading anything that misuses they like that. No loss to either of us.\n\n— S.\n\nS.: A person using they as a singular pronoun does seem uneducated, yes. But language is not static, nor is culture, and I think we can both agree the arc of the moral universe doesn't bend toward grammatical precision. That's why the person harrumphing new usage quickly becomes the one sounding uneducated. An outcome you precipitate, by the way, by limiting what you read.
Abortion legalization failed in 2018. What changed?\n\nIn 2018, a similar bill was passed by Argentina's Chamber of Deputies but came up short in the Senate. By 2020, advocates for legalization had President Alberto Fernández on their side; Fernández had defeated antiabortion incumbent President Mauricio Macri in 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAs two of us (Smith and Boas) argue in a new paper, efforts to reform abortion laws, even if initially unsuccessful, bring the issue to public attention and encourage politicians and voters to take sides.\n\nAD\n\nFor years, abortion had been considered politically untouchable. But the legislative debate in 2018 made it one of the most important issues in the 2019 presidential campaign. Each candidate weighed in, and when Fernández opened the new legislative session in early 2020, he promised to introduce a bill that would legalize abortion.\n\nResearch finds that countries are more likely to lift or loosen restrictions on abortion when a programmatic left party is in power. That would include Argentina's Peronist party, the center-left anchor of its governing Frente de Todos (Everybody's Front) coalition. Many journalistic accounts documented the government's attempts to influence undecided senators, against countervailing efforts by Macri and leaders of the Catholic Church.\n\nAD\n\nBut abortion decriminalization passed in Argentina for reasons that go far beyond the president. While his coalition of supporters was more likely to support legalization than members of the opposition, the vote did not break neatly along party lines. Moreover, before 2015, Peronist governments held power for 12 years without introducing legislation regarding abortion rights.\n\nSo how did abortion only recently become a central political issue?\n\nHow a growing women's movement put reproductive rights in the spotlight\n\nIn a forthcoming paper, two of us (Daby and Moseley) explain that a powerful new feminist social movement called Ni Una Menos (Not one [woman] less) spurred the abortion debate. In 2015, after several grisly murders of young women, Ni Una Menos was organized to call attention to gender violence and inspired thousands of Argentine women to take to the streets.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLinking previously scattered social movements, Ni Una Menos forged a diverse coalition of women to challenge the status quo. After beginning as a protest against machista violence, Ni Una Menos eventually broadened its claims to encompass reproductive rights. Feminist activists argued that without legal abortion, ni una menos would always be a misnomer, because unsafe, clandestine abortions represent one of the leading causes of maternal death in Argentina.\n\nNi Una Menos framed abortion as an issue of social justice and public health — rather than the United States' framing, in which it is an individual right. Further, it emphasized that poor women in particular are likely to encounter dangerous conditions when seeking abortions; one popular chant at demonstrations has been: The rich abort, the poor die. That has changed the reproductive rights conversation.\n\nThrough persistent mobilization, female activists persuaded public officials and fellow citizens that the prohibition on abortion had failed — and that only legal access could address the serious public health crisis afflicting Argentine women, primarily those who are poor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to our analysis of public opinion data from the AmericasBarometer, citizen attitudes became more favorable toward legalization only after Ni Una Menos arrived on the scene in 2015, amid record rates of protest by women.\n\nImplications for Latin America\n\nTo be sure, the abortion debate in the Americas has hardly been put to bed. Just as Roe v. Wade inaugurated the modern era of partisan sparring over abortion in the United States, this issue, and others related to gender and sexuality, may increasingly become a political battleground throughout the region.\n\nIn a working paper analyzing AmericasBarometer and Latinobarómetro public opinion data from across the region, Smith and Boas found that when abortion or same-sex marriage dominate the headlines, abortion rights or antiabortion attitudes start to matter more on election day. Traditionally, voters mostly worry about bread-and-butter issues when they go to the polls. But as candidates stake out opposing positions on new culture war issues, elections are being transformed. Championing abortion or same-sex marriage rights can pave the way to victory, but so can conservative opposition — as happened in Brazil's 2018 election of Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nArgentina's abortion legalization could have ripple effects throughout the Americas. On other social issues, significant legislative changes have tended to sweep through the region in relatively quick succession. After Argentina recognized same-sex marriages in 2010, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay followed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, Argentina's move may galvanize abortion opponents, as well. The Christian right has been jolted by the recent wave of change. And just as Ni Una Menos inspired activists in other countries, so, too, have conservative social movements. #ConMisHijosNoTeMetas (Don't Mess With My Children), founded in Peru in 2016 to oppose feminist gender ideology in schools, has been spreading around the region, including to Argentina. In 2021, Chileans rewrite their constitution — and both leftist and rightist social movements at the convention are likely to lobby on sexuality politics.\n\nIf our research on Argentina is any indication, abortion rights advocates in other Latin American countries may have more success if they focus on the public health consequences of prohibition and its disproportionate impact on women living in poverty. Ultimately, abortion legalization in Argentina won because of the persuasive power of street activism. We expect that leftist and rightist social movements will be similarly critical in determining the future of abortion laws elsewhere in Latin America.\n\nAD\n\nAD
He finally apologized for how things ended, but it's unclear to me what he's really sorry for — the lying and getting caught, the affair itself or how he was treating me.\n\nEverything is moving so quickly. We're not compatible and maybe never were, so this will be a good thing for us. However, I do still care about him and believe his mental health issues were at least partly to blame for his behavior.\n\nAD\n\nHe has rewritten our past enough that now I'm questioning what is true and what isn't. I'm also blaming myself for not being more emotionally available (he wasn't either), not being more compassionate about his mental health issues, and just not being a good partner in general. At the same time, he told me he never opened up to me emotionally either and wasn't really what I was looking for in a partner.\n\nAD\n\nHow do I learn from my mistakes without thinking, based on what he is telling me, they were bigger than they were? How do I stop internalizing the blame he has placed on me?\n\nI'd like to stop beating myself up over things that may or may not have really happened.\n\nAD\n\n— Hindsight\n\nHindsight: That's tiring just to read, so living it will wear you out. That's normal.\n\nYou're going through plenty just with the logistics of divorce, so achieving clarity at the same time is probably asking too much.\n\nMy only advice is to stop trying to figure all of it out. In fact, don't try to figure any of it out. Just get through the mechanics of it. Attorney, yes, and a home of your own, and your own finances and home goods and all of that. These take time and attention. Make sure that attention is available by keeping your to-do list short. When the questions bubble up, let them go unanswered. Say it aloud if you have to: I'll get to that later. Or: That can wait.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen, when you're there in your own space without a marriage or a divorce to manage, listen for the silence.\n\nWhen you hear it, that's when it's time to think about all those questions. You might find, and I suspect you will, that some of them will have answered themselves in the process. The churn of an emotional transition can make issues seem more complicated than they really are. And if your husband's emotional MO is to deflect/diffuse/muddy, then the post-marital silence will be more powerful still.\n\nRe: Hindsight: Keep a journal, and don't read it until much later. It will help you know what was real.\n\n— Anonymous\n\nRe: Hindsight: There is no one perfect story to be told here, one that will explain everything, or send you off unencumbered into the future; there's just life, and plenty more to be lived, imperfectly and messily, and without any definitive explanations.\n\n— Messy
It doesn't matter that the event space is booked. Or that guests have checked into the hotel. Or that the floral arrangements are starting to wilt.\n\nThe Marriage Bureau at D.C. Superior Court is not open.\n\nEven though Congress allows the city to spend its own revenue to maintain D.C. operations during a federal shutdown, the local courts are funded by the federal government.\n\nAD\n\nAnd while court hearings are proceeding and juries are being seated, the Marriage Bureau is considered a nonessential function and has been suspended, along with bar admissions, the judicial library and a child-care center.\n\nAD\n\nClaire O'Rourke, 33, learned the hard way when she went on the D.C. Superior Court website Wednesday to print out an application for her marriage license before her Jan. 12 wedding. Instead, she saw red text blaring The Marriage Bureau is closed during the government shutdown.\n\nIt never occurred to me that this very tiny aspect would shut down right when I needed it the most, said O'Rourke, a Capitol Hill resident and lobbyist who is planning a 140-person wedding at a Chinatown hotel.\n\nIt's a surprising thing to happen in the final few weeks when you're getting ready for your wedding, said O'Rourke, who angrily texted the news to her fiance, Sam Bockenhauer, using words that can't be printed in a newspaper. Little inconveniences — and this isn't exactly a little inconvenience — are very frustrating.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWithout a license, a marriage is not legal and lacks the advantages for taxes, property ownership and hospital visitation. Officiants also need to be licensed by the D.C. Marriage Bureau, and O'Rourke is waiting to find out if the relative planning to conduct her wedding is already authorized.\n\nIn a stroke of good luck, local officials repealed penalties for holding a wedding without a license more than a decade ago. But D.C. law still requires officiants to send the court a signed marriage license within 10 days of a ceremony. Failure to do so results in a $50 fine for the officiant, not the happy couple.\n\nDanielle Geanacopoulos and Dan Pollock, who fell in love as Democratic staffers on the Hill, showed up at the locked bureau on Dec. 27, two days before their wedding. They left without a license but a determination to carry on.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe just took in stride, and it was a great party with our friends and families, said Pollock, who celebrated the unofficial nuptials with the hashtag #MyBigFakeGreekWedding.\n\nThey now plan either a civil ceremony in New York, where they've relocated, or will return to the District for a second, smaller mock wedding at a beer garden.\n\nHey, a second wedding? Can't hurt right? said Pollock, who first shared his story with BuzzFeed News.\n\nO'Rourke hopes the shutdown will end before next Saturday and that she and Bockenhauer can get a same-day marriage license. And she's trying to relax.\n\nWe'll have a lovely party with all of our family and friends and exchange vows and whenever courts open back up, we'll have a license, said O'Rourke.\n\nWith nine federal departments and several federal agencies going unfunded, here's who and what are impacted by the partial government shutdown. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\n\nBut the license isn't their only complication. The couple was planning photographs at the National Portrait Gallery, which is among the Smithsonian museums that are closed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nO'Rourke says her experience cemented her view that the District should become a state. We get no representation in Congress, but Congress is able to prevent you from getting a marriage license, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) plans to introduce emergency legislation that would allow her office to issue marriage licenses during a government shutdown. The bill is expected to come before the D.C. Council on Tuesday.
