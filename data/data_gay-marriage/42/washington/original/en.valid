Hi, Carolyn: My husband and I will be traveling to attend my mom's wedding. It's either a 13-hour drive (now that we have a child, it would probably actually eat up an entire day) or a 1½ -hour flight, plus brief transportation at each end. My husband hates to fly — mostly because he is frugal and dislikes being shuffled around by airlines, but he also has slight confinement anxiety. He has a prescription for this when he absolutely has to fly, and it works well.\n\nMeanwhile, I enjoy flying, don't mind paying for the convenience and seriously do NOT want to sign on for a gruesome road trip with a toddler who is pretty well-behaved on a plane.\n\nThis difference between us makes it hard to plan not only this trip, but also hypothetical future travel. I proposed that I fly with the toddler, which would give me more time to spend with family, and that he drive, if that's his preference. It infuriated him that I would consider abandoning him to drive alone. He seems to think the only answer is that we both do the road trip thing, which I do not think makes sense.\n\nWhat do we do in this case, and when this inevitably comes up again?\n\nSpouse\n\nSpouse: Why just deal with stubbornness and anxiety when you can have a boundary issue, too?\n\nYou have my sympathies. It's one thing to have a partner who is irrational on a particular issue — we all have our stuff, after all — but another for a furious partner to expect everyone to live in service of that irrationality.\n\nYou do have two advantages, though — time and distance. As in, this isn't a problem of culture or perception, like deciding whether gender roles are appropriate or how much one defers to Grandma. This hinges on how long it takes you to travel how far. Useful simplicity.\n\nThat means you can actually quantify what he's asking of you and draw the line where you think he's asking too much.\n\nLet's say a drive is seven hours, where flying instead would involve 30 minutes to the airport, a 90-minute cushion for parking and security, a one-hour flight and another hour on the ground at your destination — so, four hours. Call it five to be generous and allow for delays and other hassles of air travel.\n\nThat means the cost of indulging your husband is two or three hours. Are you okay with that, yes or no? You decide for yourself, of course, but that doesn't sound too awful to me.\n\nNow take the trip you're contemplating. The flight and ground transportation look to be about a four-hour commitment, compared with a 13-hour drive, which pegs your indulge-the-spouse cost at nine hours. In a car with a toddler. Instead of with family.\n\nAgain — you decide what's right for you, but if I were doing that I'd want a prescription assist of my own.\n\nSo do the math, figure out what your pain limit is for extra driving, then explain it as such to your husband. Make it clear — you will gladly accommodate him up to X hours, and after that you hope he will accommodate you by either traveling separately as you suggest, or adopting your pain limit as his absolutely has to fly threshold.\n\nYou can't make him agree to this, of course. You can, however, stick to your own limit by not agreeing to gruesome car trips, even flying solo against his wishes if you must. While it isn't ideal, it's a valid response to accusations of abandoning him, which are controlling and highly manipulative.\n\nIf that's his default and not just a flight-anxiety-specific bit of emotional slumming (his airline resistance screams control issues), then make sure good marriage counseling comes next. Do that alone, too, if you must.\n\nDear Carolyn: My husband and I are deciding whether to have kids. We live in an expensive city far away from any family. No one has visited us in the four years we've lived here.\n\nI can't imagine raising kids with no support system, it scares me! My job is highly specialized, so I don't really get to choose where I live, and we probably will never live anywhere near our families. How do I move past the fear of raising children without the village?\n\nFar Away\n\nFar Away: You remind yourself that you're human: What you don't have, you scrounge, improvise or make.\n\nThere's nothing that says you have to have kids, of course. It might just not be for you.\n\nBut if you want to be a parent, then do what countless others have done who, like you, have relocated for better opportunities — or who emigrated, or outlived their families, or cut ties after years of dysfunction. You discard preconceptions and develop a network of friends, paid caregivers, drop-in centers, schools and whatever else you need. You study your employers' leave policies. And you trust the resourcefulness that made you a specialized, big-city asset to serve you here, or in whatever challenge you take on next.
Two of them — Ya Kaka, 19, and Hauwa, 18 — are risking everything to ensure that their stories, and the stories of their fellow captives, are heard. They've spent the past two weeks meeting with U.S. and U.N. officials to recount the atrocities committed against them by Boko Haram.\n\nYa Kaka was kidnapped at 16, along with her two sisters. Hauwa was 15 when Boko Haram fighters stormed her family's thatched-roof home. Her parents were killed. She was taken. This public advocacy will make both women targets at home. Ya Kaka will have to move to a new city, where no one knows her past. She says it's worth it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe hope to let people know the true situation of what is happening, the 19-year-old said.\n\nBoko Haram has been especially destructive in northeast Nigeria, waging a brutal campaign to take control of large parts of the country. In 2017 alone, the group killed 900 people and carried out more than 900 attacks. The lawmakers who met with the girls already know those statistics. Ya Kaka and Hauwa offered a more personal account of what happened. They talked, too, about their dreams: to finish school, then go into public service. The gathering captured the emotional dichotomies of the occasion: Washington elite and survivors of sex slavery; opportunity and profound loss.\n\nTheir stories began in September 2014, when Boko Haram decimated their city, Bama, near the Cameroonian border. The assault was gruesome. Many of Bama's 350,000 residents fled. Men who couldn't escape were killed and put in mass graves. Thousands of girls and women, some as young as 8, were forced to travel on foot to camps where they became sex slaves.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHauwa and Ya Kaka were marched into the Sambisa Forest and kept in tiny huts, raped nightly by their male captors. Like many captives, Ya Kaka was married off — though that didn't protect her from near-daily rape from multiple men. Her husband would force her to walk naked through the camp. Both women — still girls at the time — became pregnant.\n\nIn 2015, Ya Kaka, Hauwa and their infants managed to escape the camps along with other captives. They walked for days to find villages with food and water. Both babies died. Many other women were freed after a months-long campaign by the Nigerian military, but some were killed during the rescue operation. Even those who escaped Boko Haram still suffered.\n\nHundreds of Boko Haram wives have been shunned by their families and neighbors, who worry that they are loyal to the group and may be violent. They are forced to live in hastily constructed camps often guarded by armed men. Though they are free, the indignities have continued. Hauwa said she has been mocked while begging for food. A store owner, she said, would yell, Don't come into my store because she was a Boko Haram wife. School and other educational opportunities are nonexistent. Most of the Boko Haram survivors are traumatized and have struggled to recover from the abuse. Today, Hauwa and Ya Kaka's former home of Bama is a ghost town. But because of NGO support, the former captives who are trying to live as free women will get another chance.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter they return home, they will start classes at a boarding school. I had no hope of going back to school, Ya Kaka said. Now, she is enrolled at Ramat Polytechnic in Maiduguri. She hopes to study international relations, and to someday represent her home state of Borno. These opportunities, they know, are rare.\n\nThough the Nigerian government declared victory over Boko Haram, the group regularly stages attacks around the country. Many schools — common targets of Boko Haram — are still not secure. There are no soldiers or police at any school, Ya Kaka says. Just last month, 110 schoolgirls were kidnapped from Dapchi, Nigeria. And the women who have been freed from Boko Haram need help and counseling. To Ya Kaka, though, those challenges are opportunities. I want to help my society, she says.\n\nMore on In Sight:\n\nAD\n\nAD
A common point of friction is the topic of vacations: She's an extremely disorganized person who never plans her own time, but wants me to commit months in advance to my family to visiting her over any/all vacations. (She'll start pressuring me about Christmas in October.)\n\nWe have been generous with our time, but my husband and I both have demanding jobs. We don't want to spend every Christmas holiday sitting on my mother's couch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI'm at a loss. Conversations with her often end in her feeling attacked and/or abandoned. Attempts to politely refuse invitations or set boundaries have been fruitless at best, and can result in toxic rant-fests in which our parenting/life skills are called into question.\n\nAt least once a month, I'm faced with the decision to fulfill a perceived obligation to bring my kids to her, or face an extreme guilt trip for choosing not to do so. I can't ever have a weekend with my family, guilt-free. How can I take this pressure off my marriage and family without deeply hurting my mother?\n\nEmotionally Exhausted\n\nEmotionally Exhausted: You wonder how you can get what you need without deeply hurting your mother. Short answer: You can't, because she's not going to let you.\n\nAD\n\nYour mother's emotional manipulations have affected you so profoundly that you continue to basically put her (perceived) needs before your own. Stop that.\n\nAD\n\nYou should assume that — for any boundary you draw, your mother will always perceive it as a deep wound and will act out.\n\nBut it is her job to figure out how to feel better about her own life. You do you.\n\nTurn your focus toward strategies for deflecting your mother's control and guilt, knowing how she will retaliate to any change in your behavior.\n\nJump the gun and email her a rough outline of how you and your family plan to spend your vacations over the next 12 months, based on what you want to do.\n\nAD\n\nAs a parent, you know that you don't respond to a tantrum by giving in — you step back and let it run its course. A natural consequence for her ranting and attacking you is that you will not want to take her calls for a period of time.\n\nRespond with statements like, I'm sorry you're so unhappy without assuming responsibility.\n\nAD\n\nBoth of you could use the help of a therapist — she, especially, because of her extreme self-focus, rage and inability to cope with any disappointment. You should suggest it.\n\nDear Amy: My husband and I have been married for many years. We have grown children.\n\nSome time ago, he created a separate email address for himself. I didn't give it much thought.\n\nAD\n\nOne day he left his email open on our shared computer, and I discovered its primary purpose — to secretly communicate with another woman. She is a younger woman and happily married, so there's not a romantic relationship. However, by the tone of his messages and some of his remarks, it is obvious that he is very smitten.\n\nI don't much mind that he is communicating with her, so much as the efforts he took to keep it secret.\n\nI'm very hurt and will never again view my marriage — or my husband — in the same light.\n\nAD\n\nAm I justified in feeling a sense of betrayal?\n\nHurt\n\nHurt: Yes, your feelings are justified.\n\nNow, what are you going to do about it?\n\nI hope you will be brave enough to confront your husband. Be completely honest about how his behavior affects you. It is time for him to communicate with you about the intimacy he has been reserving for this other woman.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: Sad was a woman who'd had a devastating breakup decades ago.\n\nRecently the man who rejected her recognized her at an airport. Sad told him he was mistaken, and that she wasn't the woman he thought she was.\n\nWell, Sad is right! She is NOT the woman she was 30 years ago. I wish you'd pointed that out.\n\nBeen There\n\nBeen There: Brilliant. Thank you.
By that measure, it is welcome to have Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words, for which Thomas and his wife, Virginia, sat with filmmaker Michael Pack for more than 30 hours of interviews. Structured around this conventional talking-head footage — which covers, in easily digestible if inertly chronological fashion, Thomas's Georgia childhood, education, first marriage and career — the film reveals much, while at the same time leaving us to wonder much. A lot of this ground has been covered before, in Thomas's 2007 memoir My Grandfather's Son, from which Thomas occasionally reads aloud.\n\nOne throughline is Thomas's political evolution, beginning with an abortive stint as a Catholic seminarian — the lone black student — that ended when he withdrew after hearing a racist remark. That was followed by his self-described leftward radicalization, subsequently abandoned, along with his anger, when he became what he calls a lazy libertarian at Yale Law School, then a left-leaning registered Democrat and, years later, a reliable member of the conservative wing of the Supreme Court. As common as such transitions may be in the life of any 71-year-old, Created Equal doesn't offer many insights, at least not in a deeply satisfying way, as to how and why he has changed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs it inevitably must, the film eventually works its way back to the confirmation hearings, during which sometimes-lurid allegations of sexual harassment were made by attorney Anita Hill, who once worked with Thomas. And Thomas again refers to the proceedings as a high-tech lynching, orchestrated because he was the wrong kind of black guy, as he characterizes his opponents' views.\n\nThis part of the film is the most interesting — and, depending on your predisposition, potentially poignant — segment. But Created Equal is, by design, a lopsided affair, with Pack — a conservative filmmaker and former president of the right-leaning think tank the Claremont Institute — clearly sympathetic to Thomas's self-characterizations. Pack makes no attempt, for example, to present arguments that might counterbalance the claim of a lynching, however metaphorical. The comparison is drawn, somewhat absurdly, between Thomas's treatment and the treatment of Tom Robinson, the character falsely accused — and convicted — of rape in To Kill a Mockingbird.\n\nThere is no mention, for instance, of other women who might have corroborated Hill's claims.\n\nBut Created Equal isn't that kind of documentary. Rather, it's meant as an opportunity for Thomas to have his full say, without challenge. At one point, he talks about how he prefers to vacation in RV parks instead of, say, resorts. He explains that he prefers the company of what he calls regular people, leading one to wonder, among many other questions left unasked and unanswered: Does that mean that travelers who stay in hotels are, despite the film's title, less regular than others?
AD\n\nAD\n\nNaturally, the possible breakup of one of our culture's highest-profile couples caused shock waves through the celebrity press — although the tabloids have been on high alert since the summer, when West kicked off his campaign for president with a controversial speech that left Kardashian reportedly furious after he told the crowd they considered terminating her pregnancy when she was expecting their first child. In now-deleted tweets, West claimed Kardashian was trying to get a doctor to lock [him] up and said he had wanted to divorce her for months.\n\nBut shortly after Page Six's report lit up social media, TMZ weighed in with its own exclusive: Not so fast! Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have been in marriage counseling, and we've learned the subject of divorce was looming for much of 2020, but they haven't given up, the site explained under the headline KIM AND KANYE in Marriage Counseling … DIVORCE ON THE TABLE. The article also noted that West has been living at his ranch in Wyoming and Kardashian is staying in California with their four children. We're told no final decision has been made.\n\nAn avalanche of competing information ensued and became a perfect encapsulation of what happens when a big Hollywood story breaks: Every other tabloid scrambles to post stories with their own takes and their own anonymous sources, and it quickly becomes very confusing. How does anyone decipher what is actually going on? (Representatives for Kardashian and West did not return requests for comment.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the case of the Kardashians, it's more clear-cut than you might expect. The most reliable source of information for the Kardashians is E!, which has been the home of their reality TV empire for 13 years. And when we say reliable, we don't mean necessarily 100 percent true — the network essentially operates as state media, and it's where the family can shape the story. So when you want to see the narrative framing that will probably show up on a future season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians (coincidentally or not, the final season is scheduled to air early this year), you can check out E! and its online offshoots.\n\nNearly two hours after Page Six's story hit the Web, E! Online published its offering: Why Kim Kardashian Hasn't Officially Filed for Divorce From Kanye West, the headline read. The story confirmed that the pair is effectively going their separate ways after a six-year marriage, though an unnamed source explained that Kardashian is still waiting before she makes anything official because she wants to make sure she's making the right decision for the kids.\n\nSince then, E! has posted a flurry of stories from every angle imaginable as it attempts to truly corner the market on everything Kardashian: the hopeful (the couple is in marriage counseling trying to work things out); the ominous (Kardashian spotted not wearing her wedding ring); the wistful (a romance rewind and the couple's cutest moments with their kids); and even combing her Instagram for clues (Kim Kardashian Shares How She's Getting Her 'Mind and Body Right' Amid Kanye West Divorce Speculation.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd if you're wondering why this is all coming from the Kardashian perspective, there's a reason for that: Behind the scenes, the family and their team have a reputation for trying to control all aspects of stories about their personal lives. Kris Jenner's Christian name is Multiple Sources, one popular tweet about Kardashian's mother read on Tuesday, succinctly capturing how the family operates.\n\nPeople and Us Weekly — also known to have symbiotic relationships with the family — ran their own versions of the story that echoed the same details: Kardashian and West are living apart, nothing is official, a split appears inevitable. Then, in one mildly unexpected place, the Today show also published a confirmation of their separation, noting that the couple is in marriage counseling, crediting a source close to the family.\n\nOf course, the Today show chiming in shouldn't be too surprising: The show is under the NBC News umbrella, which is owned by NBCUniversal — which, as you might know, also owns E!.
While I'm away, readers give the advice.\n\nOn becoming a better person for your child:\n\nWhen my son was born (he's 24 now), I was very socially awkward and frightened by social interactions. I would become so nervous that my head and neck would visibly tremble. Fortunately, I knew I needed to fix this for my son's sake.\n\nAnd did. In fact, now no one would ever guess at how stifled and frightened I felt in social situations.\n\nIt became a lifelong lesson for me: For your child, you fix things in yourself that you wouldn't address for you. It is my favorite unintended consequence of parenting — getting back much more than I gave.\n\nA.\n\n(Nick Galifianakis/The Washington Post)\n\nOn getting to know people who make themselves hard to know:\n\nBest practice is to start with the outermost circle of their lives, and allow feelings to reveal themselves.\n\nAsk about how their town has changed, where else they have lived, what grocery stores were like when they were little, what team sports they played, what the worst weather event was that they can remember, stuff like that. Once they get going on a topic that is comfortable for them, they may reveal far more than if they are asked directly to articulate their feelings.\n\nAdmire the things they have created, the choices they have made, ask about the history of their community. Talk about actions and things, offer them an opportunity to brag about their lives, and don't make them nervous about being judged.\n\nSometimes, actions speak louder than words.\n\nJ.\n\nOn marriage after infidelity:\n\nMy husband and I have traveled the long, hard road back from infidelity. Although very painful, this path was also achingly tender and deeply humbling. Did I mention long?\n\nBut it is the best thing we ever did; it is our warrior secret. So I guess I want to say, don't give up. It's messy. Sometimes morbidly funny. It takes time. But the regrowth of gladness, spontaneity and trust IS possible. Happiness is possible.\n\nAnonymous\n\nOn planning on intending to expect to get married:\n\nIf people want to live together, it's no skin off my nose, but what makes me crazy are the people who say we're planning on getting married. Unless you've picked a date and started making arrangements, you are not.\n\nAnd I'm NOT saying people should rush into it, but they should own up to their truth. Nothing wrong with saying you're not ready to make that decision yet.\n\n26 Down and Eternity to Go\n\nOn needing help with a partner who needs help:\n\nA while back, I went through a series of ordeals — depression was but one of the results. And yes, I worked with a psychologist and a psychiatrist.\n\nWhile my wife didn't have to endure what I did, she had to soldier on for the household and its stability. My deepest regret from that period is that I didn't realize just how much she had to go through.\n\nI wish more people had recognized that it was just as hard on her. Love is a beautiful but dangerous thing because it makes us invest of ourselves in others. When they suffer, so do we. When we suffer, so do they.\n\nBeen There, So Has My Wife
Dear Amy: I am a nurse. I started dating a police officer seven months ago.\n\nWe like each other and are getting along. We are both working full time and going to school.\n\nHe lives two hours away from me. While we talk on the phone daily, he only wants to see me once every six or seven weeks.\n\nI asked him if we could see each other once every four weeks (because I know he is busy), but he doesn't want that. He says, This is the only way the relationship works.\n\nI complained a few times and asked him if we could see each other more often.\n\nHe suggested that I should find a new guy. I am offended. I like him so much, but I am lonely. I feel like he has more fun being alone rather than being with me.\n\nDoes this man even want to be in a relationship? Am I forcing myself on him?\n\nConfused Girl\n\nConfused: Your question prompted me to do some reading on the whole nurse-police officer dating nexus, and my casual research reveals that, yes, nurses and cops can make great partners. Both professions seem to draw plucky, hard-working people who are drawn toward service, and can tolerate challenging shift work.\n\nYou don't realize it but you are lucky. Why? Because you have clarity.\n\nYour officer-friend is telling you exactly where he stands. He is saying, This is what works for me. If it doesn't work for you, you should find someone else. If he was more into you, he would probably beat a path to your door, no matter the distance. But — he is not.\n\nYou are saying, But this doesn't work for me.\n\nBoom. You have your answer.\n\nDear Amy: I agreed to be the maid of honor at a friend's wedding — six months from now. She has been with the guy for just over a year.\n\nThe bride admitted to a mutual friend that she knows she's the groom's rebound girl and is only marrying him because he asked. I feel like I should tell the groom this — just in case the marriage doesn't last.\n\nI feel that she isn't getting married for the right reasons.\n\nNot only is she expecting me and my boyfriend to pay gobs of money to attend the destination wedding that she can't afford, but she has also been messaging my boyfriend behind my back (my boyfriend is showing me the messages), saying how she can't wait for the wedding — so my boyfriend can see her in a bikini.\n\nI'm to the point now where I want to drop out of the wedding party, but I have already paid for my trip. What do I do? I've tried confronting her, but she denies it all.\n\nDon't Know What to Do\n\nDon't Know: This sort of frenemy drama is how I'm getting through the winter. So — thanks for that.\n\nYou quite obviously don't like this bride. You don't like the way she is behaving and you don't intend to honor your maid of honor duties.\n\nYou seem to want to turn the bride in to her fiance to retaliate because she is messaging your boyfriend. Your boyfriend could easily stop the messaging, so it seems that the two of you might be enjoying it (on some level).\n\nThe worst, most ridiculous bride in the world deserves to have a maid of honor who believes in what she is doing — or is at least willing to put her blinders on and go along with it.\n\nYou are not that person.\n\nYou've already spent money to go to this destination wedding, but attending the wedding when you obviously can't stand the bride is like eating a hot fudge sundae when you don't want to, just because it came with the meal. You should turn in your maid of honor badge. Tell the bride, I'm very sorry, but I can't perform these duties for you. We also won't be able to attend the wedding. You staying home would be better for everyone.\n\nDear Amy: Dismissed Wife talked about the lack of emotional support her husband offered her. You picked up on the detail that she had lost a child. Many years after our son died, my marriage started to fall apart. I now realize it was delayed stress from our terrible grief.

Such unions are prohibited by Methodist doctrine, but church trials over same-sex marriage have become increasingly controversial in recent years, with a growing number of congregations and individuals supportive of both same-sex marriage and LGBTQ clergy.\n\nIn early January, leaders in the United Methodist Church tentatively agreed to spin off a traditionalist Methodist denomination that would continue to oppose same-sex marriage and decline ordination to LGBT clergy — allowing the remaining portion of the United Methodist Church to permit same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy for the first time in its history. The plan will be voted on at the church's denomination-wide conference in May.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe proposal between Methodist leaders outlining a future split suggested that clergy who conduct same-sex marriages should remain in good standing and that any judicial processes should be put on hold as of Jan. 1.\n\nBut in a Jan. 17 letter, Bishop Sharma Lewis of the Virginia Conference announced that she would continue to process complaints — including against Ensz — until the church's rule book, the Book of Discipline, is changed. The book says, The practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.\n\nThe letter was first reported by DCist.\n\nEnsz said he was asked to officiate the wedding by one of the grooms, whom he had confirmed and was a youth minister to. He declined to provide more details about the wedding to protect the couple's privacy.\n\nAD\n\nI knew it was a risk, he said. I couldn't sit by and not do something when this couple had invited me to officiate their wedding.\n\nHe said he is surprised his disciplinary case is still open while others have been put on pause.\n\nBishop Sharma Lewis is bound by oaths she took as both a pastor and a Bishop to uphold the Book of Discipline and she processed both complaints, Paul Steidler, a spokesman for the bishop, said in a statement.\n\nAD\n\nMethodist church trials over same-sex marriage have been controversial since 2013, when a Pennsylvania pastor was defrocked after officiating at his son's marriage to another man. Other pastors have gone through mediation with their accusers after performing a same-sex ceremony.\n\nThe denomination uses an internal judicial system with judges and trials led by clergy. In 2019, the church adopted new penalties, effective Jan. 1: The mandatory penalty for officiating a same-sex marriage would be a year's suspension without pay, and a second conviction would mean a pastor would be defrocked.\n\nEnsz, whose ministry at George Mason is ecumenical, said that because this was his first offense, he doesn't expect his credentials to be pulled. If they were, Ensz might be able to seek credentials from a different conference. Because his ministry is ecumenical, it would probably still keep him on staff, he said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut his ties to the UMC are deep, and it's the denomination he grew up in.\n\nIt would be incredibly hard to leave, he said. This is my spiritual home and what I've known.\n\nTwo complaints were filed against Ensz after he conducted the wedding, including from the Rev. Amanda Miller Garber, pastor of Rise Church in Harrisonburg, Va., who herself had conducted a same-sex ceremony in 2014 (she was suspended without pay for a month). Disciplinary actions are worked out at the local level, and Miller said that she thought if she filed a friendly complaint, Ensz might be dealt with less harshly.\n\nI had a different bishop. I hoped the system might respond differently, she said.\n\nAD\n\nThe second complaint was not what you would call friendly, Miller said. Neither she nor Ensz would say who submitted the complaint, citing an ongoing process.\n\nAD\n\nSteve Brown, chancellor for the Virginia Conference, said that the names of the complainants are confidential. He said that there is no way to predict the speed of the process or whether anything will be decided before the denominational meeting in May.\n\nJohn Lomperis, a United Methodist who advocates with the traditionalist Protestant group Institute on Religion and Democracy, said that the bishop and Ensz might agree to a just resolution, which is like an out-of-court settlement.
Priefer's stint with the Vikings is also noteworthy for a two-game suspension in 2014, after an outside investigation determined that there was credibility to a former player's accusation that he once said, We should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows.\n\nAD\n\nThat accusation was made by ex-punter Chris Kluwe in a January 2014 essay he wrote for Deadspin in which he claimed that his advocacy for same-sex marriage probably led to his release the previous year by Minnesota after eight seasons with the team. Kluwe wrote that, in addition to the nuke comment, Priefer's other remarks on the topic included: disgust at the thought of two men kissing; belittling any idea of acceptance or tolerance; and claiming more than once that the punter would wind up burning in hell with the gays.\n\nAD\n\nHours after Kluwe's essay was published, Priefer issued a statement in which he vehemently denied the allegations.\n\nI want to be clear that I do not tolerate discrimination of any type and am respectful of all individuals. I personally have gay family members who I love and support just as I do any family member, Priefer said in his statement. The primary reason I entered coaching was to affect people in a positive way. As a coach, I have always created an accepting environment for my players, including Chris, and have looked to support them both on and off the field.\n\nAD\n\nThe Vikings hired a pair of attorneys to investigate Kluwe's allegations about Priefer's comments and the reasons for the punter's release. In a July 2014 report they noted that the team's long snapper at the time, Cullen Loeffler, told them he also heard Priefer talk about putting all the gays on an island and nuking it. For the attorneys, that provided an important piece of corroboration, although they wrote that no other witnesses they interviewed recalled hearing any remarks of that nature by Priefer.\n\nAD\n\nThe report also stated that the special teams coach initially denied to investigators that he made any inappropriate remarks about the LGBTQ community or marriage equality, and that he categorically denied making the nuke comment. However, when presented with Loeffler's recollection, Priefer said he was not going to disagree with it.\n\nAt that point, per the report, Priefer told investigators, It was a joke between three people, three men.\n\nAD\n\nIn announcing a three-game suspension for Priefer, the Vikings said their organization does not accept, condone or tolerate any type of insensitive or disparaging remarks. Priefer expressed regret at the time, and he added, I am extremely sorry, but I will learn from this situation and will work on educating others to create more tolerance and respect.\n\nAD\n\nThe Vikings also noted then that the ban could be reduced to two games if Priefer attended sensitivity training, and when he was reinstated after the first two weeks of the 2014 season, the team said it was informed that he had been fully and thoughtfully engaged throughout the process and successfully completed the [training] program.\n\nAt his introductory news conference with the Browns in February 2019, Priefer addressed his suspension, telling reporters (via cleveland.com), A situation occurred in Minnesota where I made a comment I shouldn't have made. I apologized for that comment.\n\nAD\n\nAnd I learned a lot from it, he continued. What I learned is that you can't say hurtful things about people, period. No matter where you are or who you are talking to.\n\nPriefer, who was born in Cleveland, noted at that news conference that he grew up in Northeast Ohio. He went on to attend the U.S. Naval Academy, where he began his coaching career after serving as an officer for six years, including tours of duty in the Persian Gulf and in the Mediterranean Sea. According to his team bio, he also earned a master's degree from the University of Maryland.\n\nAD\n\nAfter cutting his teeth as a graduate assistant with Navy, Priefer's first coaching jobs were at the college level, including a brief stint at Virginia Military Institute, before he was hired in 2002 by the Jacksonville Jaguars to assist with their special teams. He held the same role with the New York Giants the following three years, then oversaw special teams for the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos.\n\nAD\n\nNow Priefer has been tasked with leading the Browns to a victory on the road in their first postseason appearance in 18 years. The team hasn't won a playoff game since 1995, when then-head coach Bill Belichick defeated Bill Parcells and the New England Patriots.
Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Alan Oakes as a government IT manager and Veronica Branch as a government procurement expert. Oakes is a government procurement expert and Branch is a government IT manager. This story has been updated.\n\n\n\nVeronica Branch, 56, government IT manager, and Alan Oakes, 59, government procurement expert. (Photo courtesy of daters)\n\ninterviews by Debra Bruno\n\nVeronica Branch, 56, a government IT manager, describes her dream date as an educated man who has traveled some, has his own means and wants a companion who is his equal. Alan Oakes, 59, a government procurement expert, is looking for someone who laughs easily and is intelligent but not too engrossed in their work. The pair agreed on everything necessary to make a great long-term relationship, and that this thing called sparks is for crazy youngsters. Or is it? If not sparks, then what would it take for them to make a romantic connection? We sent them to Ophelia's Fish House on Barracks Row to find out.\n\nVeronica: I got there early. I'm always early. He was just a little late, and he said that time management was one of his issues.\n\nAlan: She was a charming, attractive lady. There wasn't a love connection, that's for sure, however, and I say that because the type of lady I'm attracted to is someone who is fairly active.\n\nVeronica : He was well-dressed and looked friendly.\n\nAlan: She was a widow. Fortunately for her, she had been in a very good marriage and lost him about three years ago. We talked a lot about that. It was still very obvious that the pain of losing her spouse was present.\n\nVeronica : I could see why we were set up. We had a lot of things in common. He's a government worker, and so am I. He's financially responsible, and so am I. He has children and I have children.\n\nAlan: She's originally from Philly, and my ex was originally from Philly.\n\nVeronica : He said he was a Catholic, and I'm a Christian. I go to a nondenominational church.\n\nAlan: We were together about two hours, and for probably the first hour we discussed our past relations. I had been married about 15 years and divorced about 12, but I said my ex and I are friends. We occasionally — this is true — meet and do things together.\n\nVeronica: I told him I'm a widow. It's been only three years. But I'm good. God is good. I've worked on becoming a full person. And with grief support for a couple of years, it really helped, spiritually, physically, mentally. It's not a difficult conversation now.\n\nAlan: It didn't bother me. I wanted her to feel comfortable and relaxed, and I didn't mind talking about it. That was a large part of her conversation — her husband, who she said was her best friend. I complimented her and her marriage, and that she was in such a satisfying marriage.\n\nVeronica : He talked about his ex, that they have a great relationship, and he talked about his daughter. He's a proud father. There weren't any lulls in the conversation.\n\nAlan: Once she mentioned how close and how satisfying her marriage was, I wanted her to know that there wasn't any current angst between me and my ex. That sort of cleared the air, that there was no lingering anger over any past relationships.\n\nAlan: I've been dating more than she had. She said I was her first date in three years. She asked candidly how she could spot a man who was, for example, not sincere in dating.\n\nVeronica : We also talked about the politics of the day. We both have a little anxiety about our country right now.\n\nAlan: I asked her about her definition of the chemistry thing. I told her with the women I have met it seems like ladies want bells and whistles on the first date. I told her that's basically not true of men. Even though we are visual creatures and our eyes can light up, men aren't into that instant chemistry.\n\nVeronica : I feel that only crazy young people can have that kind of craziness. Not that I think you can't find love, or that it's not romantic, but it's a little bit more evolved.\n\nAlan: We're mature people who are, I guess, out in the singles dating world, so we agreed, based upon our situation, that we don't need to beat around the bush.\n\nVeronica: Were there sparks? That is so young. I would say we were in the friend zone.\n\nAlan: I think neither of us felt the wow factor. But she's a gracious lady. She asked to stay in touch, and we swapped numbers.\n\nVeronica: I called a friend of mine to come and get me. You can't be too safe, and you just don't know if people are crazy.\n\nAlan: Her escort was already there. We went outside and he honked, and she introduced me to him. We shook hands, it was all very gracious, and I gave her a hug, and off to the vehicle she went.\n\nVeronica: I could have driven, but if things go south, now you know where I live and know what my car is.\n\nAlan: I've dated ladies in their 50s who are angry at their ex-spouse and angry at the dating scene. This was not like that at all. It was a nice, friendly date.\n\nVeronica : He brought me a flower and a valentine card. A good date is a good date.\n\nRate the date\n\nVeronica: I would give it a 3 [out of 5]. Like I said, we were more in the friend zone.\n\nAlan: I'd say a 4, in terms of friendliness, relaxation and respect for her.\n\nUpdate\n\nThe two have not been in touch since their date.
With one side selling products online and the other delivering goods and people, the natural symbiosis would appear to be through logistics in a sprawling country that spans 5,100 kilometers (3,200 miles) across about 18,000 islands. That's the kind of end-to-end infrastructure that companies like Amazon.com Inc. dream about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYet the killer combo comes on the back end in the fintech realm. Both companies, along with Gojek rival Grab Holdings Inc., are keen to expand beyond their founding business models into services such as payments, banking, insurance and loans. Ride-hailing provider Gojek has over 190 million app downloads across the region, with its core market among Indonesia's 267 million people. Fintech will be the next growth driver. More than half the nation's adults don't even have a bank account, it said recently.\n\nWhen consumers and businesses are using your apps to buy and sell products, as well as book and deliver transport, you've suddenly got access to millions of customers at multiple touch points. This boosts sales and marketing opportunities exponentially, and provides a depth of data that few rivals can compete with.\n\nThrow in the required regulatory licenses, and the possibility of creating a financial powerhouse is right there. But so too is the potential to mess it up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMergers rarely go smoothly, and unicorn marriages are even more unusual. While now may be the perfect time to hook up, since the growth of their core businesses was already set to slow even before Covid-19 hit the broader economy, the mechanics and internal friction from a deal could threaten their momentum. Any shakeup of management, job losses, integration of systems, or clashes over direction could distract from the larger challenges of transitioning into a giant company that's really ready for public scrutiny.\n\nThat's not to say they shouldn't try. As the world's fourth-most-populous nation, Indonesia deserves a glorious unicorn wedding. But don't be surprised if the couple discovers that married life isn't always blissful.\n\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\n\nTim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering technology.

At home in San Antonio for more than a month now, Reschman is the kind of wife and mother who takes pride in keeping it all together. Every little thing, I'd solve it, she said. But she's running out of problems to solve in a situation controlled by microscopic, unseen forces.\n\nEven for those who have not fallen ill with the novel coronavirus, this is a time when many Americans don't feel in control, a time of loneliness, a time when home is more a cage than a refuge, a symbol of a world flipped upside-down.\n\nAcross the country, the homebound are finding ways to cope, creative sources of joy, or just mindless pursuits to make the days go by. They are also bickering with the kids, missing their parents, counting the Oreos left in the bag, counting the hours.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Vermont, tension over what the virus has done to daily life is revealed in Josh Manheimer's house as repeated tiffs over the dinner dishes. I can't get my family to stack the dishwasher correctly, despite individualized in-person training, PowerPoint presentations, and graphic comics, quipped Manheimer, an advertising copywriter who has long worked from home — but not with his whole family there all day, every day.\n\nIn Redmond, Wash., Vanessa Kritzer and Trevor Willett have been working from home for more than a month, but the hard part didn't begin until their 15-month-old daughter Fiona's day care closed two weeks ago. Now, Kritzer, who works in marketing for Microsoft and serves on her city's council, and Willett, a researcher for a consulting firm, pass Fiona back and forth between conference calls, depending on who has the more urgent meeting, Kritzer said.\n\nI'm on teams for calls, like, eight or nine times a day, Willett said. You end up thinking about the level of priority of the calls, to figure out which ones we can have the baby in the background screaming during the call, and which ones we can't.\n\nThe constant togetherness of the new life within four walls can feel like confinement , or a second honeymoon — or both, in the same afternoon. The extended home stay is a novel experience for most people, and they are casting about for comparisons, for something to make this seem a touch more normal.\n\nReschman, 57, was trapped in an anxiety dream the other night. She was screaming but she didn't know it. Her husband, Noel, 61, shook her awake. Esther got a glass of water and, at 3 a.m., started her day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHer mind wouldn't rest. She took stock of every minute, searching for meaning in the meaningless. Her mind wandered to Noel's grandmother, and how, after living through the Great Depression, she stored canned food and clothes in every room of her house. Esther used to laugh at the hoarding.\n\nNow she understands: The old woman was worried it would happen again and that she would have nothing, again.\n\nEsther recalled an old co-worker she used to think was crazy for washing her hands obsessively. The woman had lived through a tuberculosis outbreak decades earlier. The woman had explained to Esther that they had to wash everything they touched. And now, Esther thought, a thousand Americans die of the coronavirus in one day. Some days more.\n\nAD\n\nThe memories bounce around in her head. Sometimes, she and Noel talk about the situation. But after four decades of marriage, they've found their equilibrium. When they get on each other's nerves, they just stop talking.\n\nAD\n\nWhat do you want for lunch? Esther yells through the back door.\n\nSilence.\n\nWhat do you want for lunch? she tries again, louder.\n\nI don't know, he yells back. How about a burrito?\n\nWell, you have a choice between a sandwich and rice.\n\nWhy do you ask if I don't really have a choice?\n\nReschman has not left her South San Antonio home except to pick up groceries curbside or try to clear her head with a slow drive down Roosevelt Avenue. She has found relief in art. Noel fixed up the living room with a desk where she keeps her paint and other materials; she embosses and paints aluminum from old beer cans, making sacred hearts, roses and other pop art. She had always wanted to make her own clothes, so she watches YouTube and recalls her mother's design patterns, sewing dresses, blouses and purses made of old blue jeans.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo lift her spirits in the evening, she has started dressing for dinner. She puts on the earrings she once bought in Mexico but never got around to wearing. Then the finishing touch: a flower in her hair.\n\nOn her birthday on March 29, there were lemon cakes. Her husband grilled steaks and she watched her grandbabies play in the waning afternoon sunshine. Then they sang to her.\n\nThat was a good day.\n\n'Incredibly difficult'\n\nAlex Lohman likes to sing. Stuart Rimland, her husband, likes to rap. These days, they're combining their talents for an audience of each other.\n\nThey watch Westworld together. They talk about their day and their dog. And sometimes about how very alone they are, because husband and wife are 2,700 miles apart, stuck on opposite coasts.\n\nAD\n\nTheir movie nights are parallel viewings on Netflix; they share their comments on the flick via FaceTime or text. That's as close as they'll get to each other for as long as this virus keeps everyone inside.\n\nAD\n\nSometimes we'll just have to pause it, and say, 'I've had a really rough day,'  Lohman said.\n\nRimland, 29, is a lawyer who clerks for a federal judge in South Florida. Lohman, a lawyer as well, took a six-month job with a firm in Los Angeles to learn about representing clients in human trafficking cases.\n\nShe planned to be home in May. They had it all set, in terms of how many times we would visit each other, and we'd be texting and all that fun stuff, said Lohman, 31.\n\nAD\n\nNow, instead, We'll be on the phone, and there are times when we'll both sit in silence, she said. It's tough for us.\n\nShe's living with relatives in Los Angeles, but Rimland is by himself at their place in Palm Beach County. He likes to be around people, likes to talk, likes to make people laugh.\n\nBut I have bronchitis and I realized I should start staying at home, he said. So it's just him, his work, and the couple's rescue dog, Albie. Other than walking the mix of Maltese, Shih Tzu and poodle, he's left the house four times since March 2, mainly to pick up takeout food.\n\nAD\n\nAfter 10 days without an in-person conversation with anyone, he visited the Falafel House in Boynton Beach. The falafel guy was blessedly friendly.\n\nWe chatted back and forth, Rimland said. It was like a bonding experience. He used hand sanitizer before he gave me my food. We stayed several feet apart. But . . . it gave me a sense of normalcy. I miss that.\n\nAside from the takeout ventures, Rimland, not much of a cook, is living on leftovers and supplies he and his wife had squirreled away ahead of last year's hurricane season.\n\nAD\n\nStuff that's almost expiring, he said. Ritz Bits cracker sandwiches, applesauce, instant mashed potatoes. There's Almond Silk.\n\nHe isn't worried about running out of food, but I've noticed that, almost subconsciously, I've been rationing a little, he said.\n\nRimland has been playing lots of NBA2K on Xbox. Being able to hang out with people in that virtual world is helping me, he said. We're on the phone or FaceTime or headsets, so we're together. He also plays online trivia daily at 9 p.m. with friends he's known since high school.\n\nAD\n\nRimland and Lohman say they have no regrets about the decision that has kept them apart.\n\nBut I don't think I've struggled as much with anxiety as I am now, she said. This is incredibly difficult.\n\nAD\n\nOne night last week, after a solid 14 days by himself, Rimland gave himself a present — a visit in person with his sister and her family, who had also been home for 14 days.\n\nI felt so normal, he said. We had conversations like we'd normally have.\n\nBut after that taste of the old life — and after his sister sent him home with Cheerios, Oreos and hummus — the isolation of the following days was all the more stark.\n\nNow that I've seen them, I think I'm going to miss them that much more, Rimland said. But I'm good at compartmentalization. I'm going to stay focused on work, and bonding with my dog. It's not the pinnacle of living. But I can be happy. I'm day-to-day happy for now.\n\nA portrait\n\nAs isolating as the directives to stay home can be for some, the situation has brought others together in new ways. Paul Moscatt's life as a painter usually depends on the models who pose for him — the nudes and the musicians who would play for him as he painted them.\n\nAD\n\nNow, the models are gone, replaced by a new, more intimate, opportunity — his wife of 56 years, Carlene. In his student days, she was an early muse and occasional model. A quick painting he did of her in a colleague's illustration class remains among his best works.\n\nBut I haven't really focused on her as much as I should have, said Moscatt, 88, a figure painter and portrait artist. He still leaves home most days to drive eight minutes to his creative home, a third-floor studio in Baltimore's retro-chic Cork Factory building. But now his subject is the woman he would ordinarily come home to each evening.\n\nThis is a lovely time to get into a real official portrait of Carlene, Moscatt said.\n\nArt has always been Moscatt's escape, his therapy session. Now, it is his wife's, too. Carlene, 85, has also lost her community, her classes at the Renaissance Institute, a group of over-50s committed to learning for its own sake, and the tai chi sessions the couple did together.\n\nBut the change has been okay. Paul has kept the virus out of his art, refusing to let it dominate their conversations. I'm not painting the covid-19 into this painting, he said. Then he paused to consider his wife's expression. Maybe the virus had made its way into the image: She looks a little like she is angry about it.\n\nThe Brown Volcano\n\nGordon Wood was about to start a software venture in March, and then he had to go home and stay home. He's a real estate broker, and most everyone is staying home, not buying homes. His daughter Allison, a student at Virginia Tech, was on her dream semester abroad in Switzerland — she had saved up for three years to make it happen — and then she, too, had to come home.\n\nAllie was supposed to spend her 21st birthday with friends on the Greek island of Santorini, and her father was going to make a surprise appearance.\n\nSo when the birthday rolled around last week, Allison was feeling sorry for herself, her father said, and he and his wife decided that would not do. He found a recipe for a Greek cocktail, the Brown Volcano, made with brandy, orange juice and Vinsanto, a dessert wine from Santorini. He drove by a carryout in Alexandria, Va., and got the ingredients. He set up a bar in the garage — Gordon's Pub — invited Allie to order her ritual first legal drink, and then carded her.\n\nHe wasn't about to cut her a break because she's his kid. He sent her to her room to fetch a second form of ID. She went.\n\nWe had three or four hours where we weren't focused on the news, Gordon said.\n\nThey posted the whole thing on social media and it went mini-viral, extending the entertainment into the next few days.\n\nIt's been a strange few weeks. Stranger than after the 9/11 attacks, when the girls were little and the fear, though rattling, dissipated pretty quickly. Now, by day at the Wood house, everyone finds a place to work or study. Then they come together after 5 p.m., taking a walk, working out, playing Scrabble, watching movies. With three of his four daughters at home, Wood has grown accustomed to watching chick flicks. I got to the point where 'This Is Us' really struck a nerve, he said.\n\nThings can get a little tense with everyone in the house all the time.\n\nGirls can say things that are really hurtful, Wood said. But we're getting along pretty well. You don't always know what's going through their minds, and I don't pretend to have the answers, but I try to listen and see what's really worrying them.\n\nEvery night, before going to sleep, my last prayer has always been: 'Thanks for all my kids being safe,'  he said. And now, it's also: 'Man, are we really?' \n\nAltered days\n\nManheimer, the advertising writer in Vermont, has lived and worked in his farmhouse for three decades, going days without talking to too many people, he said, doing chores and feeding the draft horses.\n\nThe virus, though, has sharply altered his days. His wife Renee, a middle-school teacher, conducts class from the family's home gym, between the elliptical and the Concept II rower. She works now under a microscope, her online instruction watched by school administrators, and by parents, who have their own opinions of each teacher's work.\n\nHis daughter Mia, a high school senior, studies online in the kitchen, then jumps in her car to meet friends and walk — six feet apart. But Manheimer found himself pushing back when she made a quick run to the store to buy chocolate.\n\nI went ballistic, he said. An unnecessary extra trip — for what? And when her boyfriend brought over a tray of food he made to celebrate their two-month anniversary, I went into lecture mode, droning about how long the virus can last on surfaces, Manheimer said. Is it paranoia if you are on high alert about whose air your child might breathe?\n\nBut his fear of letting in a deadly germ wanes as he walks miles of dirt roads near his house.\n\nEach step feels precious, he said. Each wave to each passing car seems important. Each small discussion with neighbors about compost and maple syrup seems to add ballast, so the world won't sink under its misery.\n\nIn San Antonio, Noel ​Reschman had the radio on, and Alan Jackson's Remember When reminded Esther of better days. Remember when I was young, and so were you, the song begins. Remember when we vowed the vows.\n\nEsther found different lyrics drifting into her imagination. Remember when we could go outside the house? Remember when we could see our sons and friends?\n\nThis was not a good day. Esther needed to get out.\n\nShe and Noel got in her Jeep and went to see their city. They passed the shuttered businesses, the empty lot at Don Pedro's Mexican restaurant. It was real peaceful and real quiet, she said. But it was shocking and sad. How many things are going to change.\n\nShe remembered how her sons told her not to worry, that they'd all be together again by Thanksgiving.\n\nEsther turned to her husband: We keep saying we will all see each other again soon. But we don't know if that's going to happen.\n\nYou know, Noel replied, I've already thought of that.
WHEREAS, the American Federation of Teachers has spent more than a year engaging members and affiliates in the most intensive, inclusive, transparent and engaging presidential endorsement process in our history and has seen unprecedented engagement by members; and\n\nWHEREAS, the AFT's endorsement decision in the presidential primary has been guided by three essential criteria: a candidate who shares our values, a candidate who has the support of our members, and a candidate who can defeat President Trump. And in the more than 300,000 conversations we have had, our members believed when the time came, we would unify as a national union behind one candidate; and\n\nWHEREAS, in February, the AFT's executive council concluded that three candidates shared our values and had a path to winning the nomination—Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren—and encouraged our members to actively support any or all of them; and\n\nWHEREAS, since that point, our members, like Democrats across the nation, have coalesced around Biden, who now has clear majority support of our members across all constituencies; and\n\nWHEREAS, with nearly 60 percent of the delegates allocated, Biden has a sizable lead and has proven he has the ability to attract voters and build a coalition to win not just the primary but also the general election; and\n\nWHEREAS, this election has taken on an increasing urgency since the actual voting has begun. The world, including the United States, is facing a global pandemic threatening the health, well-being and economic security of our members, our communities and our nation. The dire need for personal protective equipment for our essential personnel is a case in point, which is why now more than ever we need to unite behind a strong, effective, empathic leader who can help families and lead a fractured nation. A leader who offers a stark contrast to the incompetent, ineffective and narcissistic actions of Trump, who even in these times of crisis continues to only focus on what is good for himself at the expense of the American people; and\n\nWHEREAS, the economic harm caused by COVID-19 will be particularly devastating to working families. Even before the pandemic hit, nearly 40 percent of Americans said they couldn't cover a $400 emergency expense. Just as Franklin D. Roosevelt after Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression and Barack Obama and Biden after George W. Bush and the Great Recession, this moment calls for a Democratic president who has the competence and compassion to not just bring us out of the depths of economic ruin but also rewrite the rules so working families thrive and heal our nation:\n\nRESOLVED, that the American Federation of Teachers endorses Joe Biden to be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States as the candidate who shares our values, has the support of our members and has the path to the nomination and to the presidency. Biden has proven he is best able to bring the necessary coalition of Americans together to defeat Trump, handle this pandemic and its aftermath, and create a better life and future for all Americans; and\n\nRESOLVED, that AFT members have a long history with Biden and know him as someone whose life experiences crafted a resilient, competent, compassionate and honest leader with an unbending optimism and commitment to working people. Biden has spent his entire career championing the values of strong public schools and higher education; healthcare and college as rights not privileges; and labor and civil rights. He believes in the dignity of every person and the importance of the labor movement. He was a trusted vice president, at home and abroad, and he, with President Obama, helped America get through a terrible recession. He is the leader we need in this moment; and\n\nRESOLVED, that Biden's proposals demonstrate his deep belief in the promise and purpose of public education, higher education and the labor movement. He understands healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and was instrumental in the passage of the Affordable Care Act. He championed the Violence Against Women Act and led the administration's fight for marriage equality. Biden's healthcare plans will make healthcare more affordable by offering a public option for families and reigning in drug companies to make medicine affordable. He will fight to make it easier for workers who choose to unionize to do so and has adopted plans to reform bankruptcy laws for struggling families. He will strengthen and invest in public schools, including by tripling funding for Title I, fully funding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, expanding community schools, investing in school infrastructure and doubling the number of psychologists, guidance counselors, nurses, social workers and other health professionals in our schools; limit testing; support educators; and invest in higher education and make college affordable, including by establishing a Title I for postsecondary education, investing in public colleges and universities and historically black colleges and universities, strengthening Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-based repayment, and making public colleges and universities free for most families. These plans stand in stark contrast to the Betsy DeVos agenda to defund and destroy public education. Biden's education plans are informed by his wife, Jill, who has been a teacher her entire career, even while Biden served as vice president; and\n\nRESOLVED, that the AFT will use our endorsement, our appointment to the platform committee, and our relationship with the Biden campaign to strengthen both the national Democratic platform and the policy positions of the eventual Democratic nominee in the way AFT members envision; and\n\nRESOLVED, that the AFT commits to continuing our unprecedented level of engagement to ensure nobody is on the sidelines in the November elections and that we do everything in our power to help Biden win the democratic nomination and then elect him president.\n\n(2020)\n\nPlease note that a newer resolution, or portion of a resolution, may have superseded an earlier resolution on the same subject.
I'm concerned that she and I have fundamentally different attitudes toward money, and also that we have fundamentally different attitudes toward communication, as I think she should have spoken up when I first proposed splitting 50-50, not waited until after the vacation was over.\n\nDo you think this is a major problem? We have talked about marriage, and now I'm starting to think we're not as compatible as I thought we were.\n\nAD\n\n— First Vacationer\n\nFirst Vacationer: I'm definitely with you on the communication problem. Yes, it would have helped for her to say something beforehand — if in fact she had doubts then. But even if she wasn't sure till she actually saw what you meant by 50-50, then speaking up on the spot would have been the more productive thing to do: Hey, when you said 50-50, I thought you meant we'd share expenses — but I wasn't expecting that we'd split every meal down to the loose change.\n\nAD\n\nYou can have widely varying attitudes on money or faith or nutrition or whatever else, but it's hard to get by contentedly unless you're able to talk to each other when you're bothered by something.\n\nAD\n\nShe did eventually speak up, though, so you have that. Use it by responding honestly with your concerns. Say you wish she had said something as soon as this bothered her, and ask if there's a reason she didn't.\n\nAnd ask how she would have preferred to handle the money. Maybe she was fine with splitting but wished it had been less rigid — say, she buys dinner tonight, and you pick up the tab tomorrow, and so on. There's trust-centered splitting and nitpicky splitting and a vast range in between.\n\nMaybe talking about it will confirm your new suspicions of a significant difference in attitude, which is a good, if painful, thing to do early. However, a frank discussion might also reveal that she has some ideas good enough to change your mind. People bring all kinds of differences to a relationship, and while it's important to keep your essential self intact, it's also a chance to learn other ways to do things and even incorporate a few upgrades into your world view and routine.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDear Carolyn: What is your opinion of someone who goes to lunch with a friend and says nothing as the friend grabs the check and pays the bill? No offer to pay, no Thank you, no words spoken at all.\n\n— Paid for Lunch\n\nPaid for Lunch: My opinion of any non-extreme weirdness, once, is that it's always possible the person felt awkward and froze.\n\nIf it happens multiple times, then my opinion becomes that the recipient of your generosity is either an ingrate or highly socially awkward. And then you face a decision: Is this person's company worth the price you have to pay for it, literally and figuratively?\n\nActually, that's always the question, but it can be helpful to walk ourselves up to it.
Dad, a White man, knew the power of grievance politics, what he believed to be a sustaining element of Trumpism, better than most. It didn't come just from his fascination with the Civil War; my own family fractured over one woman's prejudice even before I was born. His mother's rejection of his marriage to a Black woman, my mother, and the fallout that ensued, didn't define him. His work ethic and kindness did that. But it shaped his understanding of the origins of bigotry and the power of forgiveness.\n\nIn his study, my father kept figurines of Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee standing atop wall-mounted displays. As a half-Black, half-White child, I had trouble understanding his reverence for both sides. He told me he was captivated by this period of time when the American experiment nearly failed. And he loved learning about the characters of the war and the multitudes they led, scores of poor White men who stood little to gain from the abolishment or continuation of slavery, yet for varying reasons were willing to die for their side's cause. Alex wondered what side he would've ended up on, having grown up in Virginia. He couldn't rule out the Confederacy. Big, sweeping political movements influence people to make decisions in spite of their moral compasses, he reasoned. You can only fight so hard against the tide.\n\nThe earliest tide in my father's life was his mother, Antonia, and it carried dark currents. During World War II she made her way from Ukraine to Berlin as a refugee, and when the war ended, she worked in a military hospital operated by the Allies. There she met an officer from the American Midwest and conceived my father, who was born in Heidelberg after his father shipped home. Five years later, my grandfather sponsored her and their son's emigration to the United States on the condition that they never contact him. She settled in Virginia, married, had another son, divorced and kept dating. Antonia was prone to fits of anger and verbal abuse. In one episode my dad recalls, she took the large tin can of his collected marbles and dumped them in a sewer drain in front of him when he was 12.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe joined the Navy after high school and served in Vietnam. After he returned home, he worked as a mover, started a moving company and bought his mother a townhouse in Alexandria, Va. He met a young veterinarian at the University of Maryland. Antonia was thrilled that my father was dating a doctor. At first, he concealed her race. One day, several months into the relationship with my mom, Antonia phoned her son to let him know she'd be dropping by his house to pick something up. That's great, he told her. You can meet my girlfriend, who's Black.\n\nShe paused. Fuck you, she said after a moment. Then she hung up and didn't speak to her son for five years.\n\nWhen my parents married in 1987, Antonia gathered most of my father's childhood pictures and destroyed them. With what few she didn't burn, she scrawled NIGGER LOVER in black marker over each image, put them in an envelope and mailed them to my parents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAntonia was the daughter of a respected man in Poltava, Ukraine, who navigated through a devastating famine in 1933 only to see his family and community torn apart with the Nazi invasion in 1941. Her arrival in the United States must have been an instant blow to her pride: She worked as a maid, cleaning the homes of rich, White families while living with them. She relied on government assistance in a foreign country. My father suspected she dated mostly for financial reasons; she had two young boys to support and no hope for them to attend college without a partner's income or help from the government.\n\nBut despite her poverty, she could still cling to one vanity: She was a White woman in a segregated world, a member of the protected class. In her mind, she was better than at least one group of Americans, and so were her sons.\n\nMy father never explained to me how he had eluded his mother's thinking on race, and I never asked. It's a strange thing for a Black son to ask his White father: Why aren't you a racist? He met Black men in the Navy and while working as an office mover, and at some point simply decided that his mother was wrong about Black people. He avoided the romance of the Lost Cause, relying instead on what he saw in the real world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFive years after Antonia defaced the photos, she asked to come back into my dad's life. She was no longer collecting an income and was in danger of losing her home. Dad saved the house. Still, she declined to apologize for her actions, and when he brought up the destroyed photos in later years, lamenting that he had no record of his childhood, she pretended not to know what he was talking about. She told him she pitied my brothers and me for being Black but didn't blame us. For the rest of her life, Alex visited her on Sundays, a secret he kept from me until I was a teenager. He didn't bother trying to reconcile his mother and brother and his wife, who tolerated his loyalty to blood. (My mom could have easily poisoned us against our grandmother and prevented us from ever seeing her, but I believe she wanted us to see for ourselves who and what Antonia was.)\n\nAntonia and Alex shared this binding experience, the gravity of which I can scarcely fathom: They got on a boat and together made a life in this foreign land. For that bond, he decided he could coexist with this unapologetic racist. He decided he could move forward.\n\nI met my White grandmother for the first time at 17, in 2004, 13 years before she died, in the townhouse my father bought. My mom had given her grudging approval. I hugged her that day out of a sense of obligation. She was a small, blonde woman, hunched over and shuffling in a threadbare navy-blue robe. Makeup covered the blemishes and liver spots on her face, though not the ones on her neck and chest. She was 83. Antonia stared at me with blue eyes, smiled and touched my cheeks with wonder. I had been a grinning picture on the wall for 17 years, and now I was sitting in her living room.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHere was a woman who had tried to poison her son and failed, who felt so desperate in her inadequacies that she'd effortlessly added American anti-Black racism to the European anti-Semitism she brought over. She called my mother the n-word, in writing, and I still couldn't hate her. There was some hate there, sure, but the overwhelming emotions were pity and heartbreak. She had done something extraordinary in rescuing my father from postwar Europe, instilled in him a tremendous work ethic and — even if it was by accident — a sense of fairness. Yet as a consequence of her hate, she didn't get to be a part of the world she helped create for him, and for me.\n\nMy mom thought she had the answer to that sort of bigotry. When my grandmother died in 2017, a dozen of her friends and family members came to her funeral: her two sons, women who knew her from the hair salon and other forays into town, her caretakers and neighbors — all White. My two brothers were there too, and my mom's brother and his new bride, all Black. I chose not to attend.\n\nThey made a point of introducing themselves, shaking hands or hugging, and smiling sympathetically as they did. They stood somberly as Antonia was lowered into the ground. They held my father's hand as they walked to his car. We wanted those people to know we weren't the monsters she must've told them we were, my mom told me later. Even if they couldn't change any minds, they declined to use the event to exorcise their frustrations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn Thursday, my dad was cremated; his ashes will be interred at Arlington National Cemetery, on the former grounds of Robert E. Lee's plantation. He'll rest alongside thousands of men who, like him, had ideas about what this country ought to stand for and were willing to die for that vision, however flawed.\n\nI don't have to wonder what my dad would've said about the men who brought the Confederate flag into the Capitol, and violence with it, in a failed effort to overturn the results of a democratic election. He would want them and those who inspired and organized the riot to be held responsible, just as my grandmother lost precious years with her grandchildren. He would want them prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. And ultimately, he would want these men and women in the grips of a dark tide — his siblings in this American experiment — to be forgiven.
About three months ago my wife told me she was unsure about our relationship. She said the reason she fell in love with me was because I would make a good father, but since kids aren't immediately on the horizon, she feels I don't give her enough energy as a couple, and that, while she loves me, she has felt more in love with previous boyfriends. This would have been great to hear before we got married.\n\nI'll be the first to admit I'm an introvert and probably not the most exciting person to hang out with, but I treat her well, and we have fun.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe're in therapy, but it's been very hard for her to come to grips with her emotions. I can't help feeling like she married a concept instead of me. I also think part of the difficulty is her coming to terms with not being able to have a child as quickly and easily as she wanted.\n\nWhile I love her and want to continue the relationship, I can't help but think the foundation of our marriage isn't solid enough to last, and I'm getting deeply hurt in the process. How much is enough? Is this worth trying to salvage, or should I try to minimize the damage to both of us and move on?\n\n— Frustrated and Confused\n\nFrustrated and Confused: Uuuugh. I'm so sorry.\n\nAD\n\nAnd of course you're hurt. You thought she married you for love, and you just found out she hired you for a job.\n\nWhat is enough, you ask? That. That is enough.\n\nAD\n\nBut first, please know this, because it's important: It doesn't mean you're not the most exciting person to hang out with. Your wife's unhappiness is not rooted in your failure to provide what she needed. It's rooted in her decision to marry someone who didn't provide what she needed — to think she could set those misalignments aside for the purpose of getting the family she wanted. (Not uncommon — even with wonderful people.)\n\nThis matters because what you provide is what somebody wants, needs, finds exciting. Someone else. Maybe you haven't met her yet, and I won't give you empty assurances that you will, but it's a no-brainer that there are women more in love with an introverted, respectful, fun, he'd-make-a-good-father style.\n\nAD\n\nWhich is why this wretched thing might be good for you. When your wife married you for the wrong reasons — I take her word for all this, I should emphasize, and draw no conclusions of my own — she stopped your search for that woman.\n\nAD\n\nSo step away from your marriage, for now if not permanently, and think it all over, and heal. Maybe then you'll see what you were denied by this marriage, that more in love feeling, and you'll grow ready to look again. We all deserve people who feel lucky to have us.\n\nIt's a long shot, but maybe, too, it'll help her see you differently. Good news for you either way, if painfully achieved.
All in all, life is perfect.\n\nAD\n\nBut. I've been offered my dream job 12 hours away. During our divorce we agreed our child has a say in his living situation should I move. I'm pretty confident he will choose to stay in his hometown, but hopeful he will choose to move with me.\n\nAD\n\nI've made peace with it. The logistics aren't that hard to manage. But I feel guilty. Society judges absent mothers so harshly. I'm worried about him having the support and compassion he needs.\n\nI'm worried I'm abandoning him and he will end up with weird issues.\n\nI feel justified after so many years of abuse and sacrifice that I deserve to chase my own dreams.\n\nBut am I being selfish? A bad mother?\n\n— Woman on Hold\n\nAD\n\nWoman on Hold: Tempting.\n\nBut first: Seriously?\n\nYou have an amazing job and loving friends and found family and your child is thriving and you're in love and you're a . . . Woman on Hold?\n\nThey're your feelings to feel, of course, but I see room — as in, pristine acres of rolling landscape — for you to reframe your view of your life, if you really wanted to do that.\n\nAs you did just a few paragraphs prior, with perfect.\n\nAD\n\nI also don't think it's possible to make peace with it and feel guilty and be worried, all about the same move.\n\nAnd you won't get a you-go-girl (or, alas, a bad-mother) answer from me, because to treat this as an issue of society and judgments — and misogyny, if that's what you're implying — sounds like a cynical dodge.\n\nAD\n\nJust facts: The price you pay for a bad decision here won't be charged to your public-image account — it'll come straight from your kid's emotional health. And he didn't choose to be born or move anywhere or marry badly.\n\nYet, as you yourself describe your decision, it will take either his mother or his father out of your son's day-to-day life, because I deserve to chase my own dreams.\n\nHow is this not selfish?\n\nThat's not a rhetorical question; my advice for you is to answer it.\n\nAD\n\nEspecially since the nature of the dream matters. Parents live away from minor children plenty, for reasons society accepts and even applauds. Military deployments; diplomatic or political positions; humanitarian aid work; career necessity (astronauts, journalists, mountaineers, ship captains); economic pressure — anything from a job transfer to emigration from an impoverished country.\n\nAD\n\nThese have in common some combination of necessity and a higher purpose — and typically an end date. That's still often wrenching for kids, however, I wanted to be with you, but I had to protect the world/lead the world/save the world/conquer space/keep us all from starving?** At least it feels important.\n\nIf you really are just talking about dream-fulfillment beyond your current perfection, then your decision feels heavily optional. Like, second-cherry-on-a-sundae optional. I'd say this about any dad or mom who has viable and non-soul-crushing local employment options and whose affected child is just 12.\n\nAD\n\nThe chances you'll have other dreamy career opportunities, especially if you're brilliant at it: excellent.\n\nAD\n\nThe chances your child will have another crack at childhood: zero.\n\nAnd I can't believe I'm only now getting to this (the issue is deceptively complex): You're also dumping a horrific choice on your child. Who, presumably, has just found stability after being put through a wringer by his parents' abusive marriage and divorce. So, which parent can you do without? Take your time, Honey. Seriously.\n\nAnd, you're doing this just as he has one foot on the threshold into adolescence, one of the most dizzying, unnerving and impressionable times of our lives.\n\nOne promising element is that you're even torn about it. You don't say so yourself, but your peace-guilt-worry pretzel does. Your asking this question does.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOf course, the only one whose vote counts is your son. So, again, my advice is to give yourself an honest, non-self-serving answer to the baseline question: Will he grow up to respect your reasons or will he look back and say, She shook my whole world? For that?\n\n**Extra credit: Read Reyna Grande's The Distance Between Us for a child's nuanced perspective on parents who leave.

A self-described mild radical in the 1950s, Dr. Glazer was part of a group of left-leaning thinkers who were mugged by reality, in journalist Irving Kristol's formulation, and turned against the social programs of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society initiative in the 1960s.\n\nAD\n\nThat group became known as the neoconservatives, a term that originated as a pejorative under socialist political theorist Michael Harrington before being embraced by Kristol and rejected by Dr. Glazer, who ultimately considered himself a centrist Democrat, according to friends. He told the Wall Street Journal last year that he voted Republican only once, in Massachusetts, to protest the fact that some Kennedy was being elected from the district again and again.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Glazer worked in the John F. Kennedy administration, in what is now the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and was a consultant to Johnson's Model Cities program. But he drew on social science research to conclude that programs designed to alleviate poverty — including Head Start, the Job Corps and Meals on Wheels — were counterproductive.\n\nStates that emphasized such programs did not always see results, he found, particularly in the realm of education. In Dr. Glazer's view, those initiatives discouraged self-sufficiency and were incapable of addressing the real issue: a deterioration of the family and other social units fundamental to American life.\n\nAD\n\nWhereas the prevailing wisdom was that social policies would make steady progress, I came to believe that although social policy had ameliorated some of the problems we had inherited, it had also given rise to other problems no less grave in their effect on human happiness, he wrote in The Limits of Social Policy (1988).\n\nAD\n\nDr. Glazer was one of the last surviving members of the New York Intellectuals, a group of sharp-elbowed writers and critics who helped drive the country's intellectual discourse in the middle of the 20th century, writing articles in the pages of small magazines such as Commentary, Partisan Review and eventually the Public Interest.\n\nFounded in 1965 by Kristol and sociologist Daniel Bell, the Public Interest became a bastion of neoconservative thought, even as Dr. Glazer tried to preserve it as a space for rigorous public policy analysis while serving as co-editor from 1973 to 2002.\n\nHe was the most inductive thinker I ever knew, and the most curious, said Mark Lilla , an intellectual historian at Columbia University who edited a book with Dr. Glazer and worked with him at the Public Interest. He was interested in looking at the evidence, rather than looking for evidence that supported whatever hypothesis he had, and was always on the lookout for evidence that he was wrong.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, Dr. Glazer's intellectual reputation was primarily that of a perennial reassessor. A New York Times profile in 1998, headlined Nathan Glazer Changes His Mind, Again, began: Nathan Glazer has had more second thoughts in his lifetime than most people have had thoughts.\n\nA longtime professor at Harvard University, Dr. Glazer was a co-author of two seminal works of social science. The first, The Lonely Crowd (1950), is sometimes cited as the most popular work of American sociology.\n\nPrimarily written by David Riesman, with contributions from Reuel Denney and Dr. Glazer, the book proposed three character types with which to divide society — other-directed, inner-directed and tradition-directed — and was widely seen as a swipe at American consumerism and conformity.\n\nAD\n\nHis other signature work, Beyond the Melting Pot (1963), was one of the first serious studies of ethnicity and assimilation. Written with Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the scholar turned U.S. senator, the book examined black, Puerto Rican, Jewish, Italian and Irish populations in New York City. America, the writers found, was less a melting pot than a mosaic, in which the identities of different racial and ethnic groups persisted generations after their arrival in the United States.\n\nSomewhat controversially, Dr. Glazer also argued that prejudice and racism alone could not explain the concentration of problems in the Negro community. Values and behavior also played a significant role, in his view, although he believed that civil rights legislation passed in the mid-1960s would effectively enable African Americans to rise up the social and economic ladder.\n\nAD\n\nWhen that advancement never came to pass, his views began to shift, perhaps most notably in the field of affirmative action. While his 1975 book Affirmative Discrimination argued that public policy must be exercised without distinction of race, color or national origin, he later championed a pragmatic approach to higher education admissions, one that employed a racial preference.\n\nAD\n\nWhile conservatives lambasted him, suggesting he had sold out in the face of pressure from liberal colleagues, Dr. Glazer insisted he was once again changing his views only in the face of shifting evidence. He had never abandoned his ideals, he said, only adjusted his thinking on how best to achieve them.\n\n[When] I look at policies that are trying to improve welfare, he said in the 1997 documentary Arguing the World, according to the magazine City Journal, I think you must keep on trying even if you have not had great success.\n\nAD\n\nThe youngest of seven children, Nathan Glazer was born in Manhattan on Feb. 25, 1923. Both parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland; his father was a sewing-machine operator, and his mother was a homemaker. A brother, Joe Glazer, became a protest singer known as labor's troubadour for his performances at picket lines and union rallies.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Glazer studied sociology at the City College of New York, where, according to Arguing the World, he argued, ate lunch and played table tennis in a cafeteria alcove with Bell, Kristol and literary critic Irving Howe. One of the characteristics of [our] group was a notion of its universal competence, he said, adding that he and his friends shot our mouths off on everything from culture to politics. Their approach, he added, stemmed from the arrogance that if you're a Marxist, you can understand anything, and it was a model that even as we gave up our Marxism we nevertheless stuck with.\n\nHe received a bachelor's degree in 1944, earned a master's degree in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania that same year, and went on to work as an editor at Commentary, Anchor Books and Random House. Dr. Glazer received his doctorate in sociology from Columbia University in 1962 and taught at the University of California at Berkeley, Bennington College in Vermont and Smith College in Northampton, Mass., before joining Harvard in 1969.\n\nAD\n\nHis first marriage, to writer Ruth Slotkin, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 57 years, the former Sulochana Raghavan of Cambridge; three daughters from his first marriage, Sophie Glazer of Stuart, Fla., and Elizabeth Glazer and Glazer Khedouri, both of Manhattan; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Glazer sometimes traced the pivotal moment in his intellectual evolution — his mugged by reality moment, as it were — to the 1960s, when he became disillusioned with the student Free Speech Movement while teaching at Berkeley. But that was just the beginning of a career spent grappling with the chief tenets of the left and the right.\n\nYou begin to break with orthodoxy, and then you see other challenges to it, he told the New York Times in 1998. They don't seem so outlandish or threatening as they once did.\n\nAD\n\nIt reminds me of the old Leninist line, he added:  'Who says A, must say B.' From saying B, you'll go on to C, D and you'll end up at Z. There's no stopping.
She moved recently and I don't have her address. If I ask her parents for her address it will raise a red flag, but I do want her to hear at least one positive voice over her engagement. If I contact her, I also risk her telling her parents, who will be mad at me. Looking for a safe road through the minefield.\n\nAD\n\n— Concerned Aunt\n\nConcerned Aunt: If you're not close enough to know how to get in touch with her, then I'm not sure you're close enough to her to be a significant source of support for her right now.\n\nAD\n\nPlus, countering her parents' message is your only motive; you know nothing of this guy; and your niece might use your support as leverage against her parents, right? Thus the red flag of just getting contact information? Scenes like this usually involve caution tape.\n\nYou can, of course, always, get in touch with your niece just to say hi and congratulations, assuming you can restrain yourself enough to stay in a listening role. For this, you can request your niece's contact info without guilt or ulterior motive.\n\nAD\n\nDear Carolyn: My first anniversary is coming up, and I haven't sent thank-you notes. I know. I know. But — I really have been busy. I lost my job a month before the wedding. I was focused on finding work and then I got a job (a temp position) and then was focused on finding a permanent job, which I did, and then was focused on keeping that one. Plus I work a second job and have a side hustle, too, for extra cash.\n\nAD\n\nI've tried several times to finish. All I managed to do was print out a form letter to send everyone (which is now out of date) and write thank-yous to five people. Should I just give up? Send them out? I literally don't have a free night or weekend for seven more weeks. My husband has offered to help, so that's not the issue. He helps with the side business, so he's just as busy.\n\nI've thanked people locally but there are others who were not local. What to do?\n\nAD\n\n— I've Tried\n\nI've Tried: Make a list of gift givers you haven't thanked, and split the list in half between you and your husband.\n\nOffered to help? Pah. The gifts were for both of you, so you both say thank you and you don't position yourself to be the social load-bearing entity in your marriage because that idea is so tired and tiring.\n\nBut: Yes. Just send them. Email if you have to, at the rate of one a week if that's all you can manage. To speed it up, use a template: We're not ungrateful, we're just late, or some such. If you need updated addresses, ask sympathetic family or friends to help.
The General Assembly convened earlier Wednesday for its 400th annual session with a little extra pomp, a potential breakthrough on the Equal Rights Amendment and disappointment for gay rights advocates.\n\nIn his speech, Northam pitched tax and budget plans that hinge on using $1.2 billion in new revenue that the state expects to collect as a result of last year's federal tax overhaul. He also urged the GOP-controlled legislature to consider his plans to address gun violence — legislation that Republicans snuffed out last year.\n\nAlthough he is backing those same bills again, including measures that call for universal background checks and an assault-weapons ban, Northam chose to highlight just a single bill in his speech — one that he said Republican legislatures in other states have adopted. The extreme risk law would make it easier for law enforcement and the courts to remove firearms from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIt shouldn't be a partisan issue to make sure that weapons are not in the hands of people who pose a threat, especially when the threat is to their own safety or their family's safety, Northam said.\n\nInvoking the Virginia Way of political compromise, Northam catalogued the accomplishments of his first year in office — including expanding Medicaid to hundreds of thousands of low-income Virginians, raising the larceny threshold and securing funding for Metro — and he urged both parties to cooperate.\n\nThe successes in this past year have come about not because I, or you legislators, did something individually — but because we worked together, he said. When we work together and help provide a strong foundation for Virginians, our families and businesses thrive.\n\nAD\n\nBut Northam's vision of a rapidly rising state flush with cash to build on its success is based on a fundamental disagreement with Republicans, who still control both houses of the legislature. The governor wants to spend some $1.2 billion that could flood state coffers because of changes to the federal tax code under the tax cuts President Trump signed last year.\n\nHe wants half of that amount tofund tax breaks forVirginian households making less than $54,000 a year, the state's median income. He would use the other half to shore up the state's reserve funds and make historic investments in schools, the environment, rural broadband and other priorities.\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans, though, want to change Virginia tax code so that much of that money goes back to taxpayers at middle- and higher- income brackets.\n\nAD\n\nRepublican leaders embraced Northam's language of cooperation before drawing a sharp line over taxes.\n\nI appreciated very much the tone that he started out with, Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City) said in the Capitol rotunda after the speech.\n\nBut Northam's spending plan seemed aimed at his Democratic base and will not pass muster with Republicans looking to cut taxes, Norment said. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Norment said he is committed to working with the governor and Democrats to overcome this impasse.\n\nHouse Speaker Kirk Cox (R-Colonial Heights) also praised Northam's tone and added that I do think there are some places we can work together. He mentioned K-12 education and teacher pay as examples.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRepublicans also said they were open to dialogue about gun safety — though House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) cautioned that Democrats must do that in the context of respecting our traditional rights.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans alike cheered and rose at a few points during Northam's 50-minute speech, such as when he called for extending broadband access to rural areas and pledged to make the state the best for business.\n\nBut with few exceptions, Republicans sat stone-faced as Northam called for dialogue about gun safety and ending the practice of suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay court costs. His call to allow early voting seemed to fall especially flat on that side of the aisle, particularly as he tied prohibitive barriers to voting to the state's history of slavery. So did his call to add language to the state code declaring that a woman has the fundamental right to make her own health-care decisions.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nVirginia's General Assembly marks its 400th anniversary this year, and there were nods to its history throughout the opening day of the legislative session.\n\nThe House of Delegates was in full history mode, with four honor guards from Jamestown in Colonial armor — red plumes on their helmets, halberds in hand. Cox, a former high school government teacher, offered lofty words about the meaning of the first gathering of representative democracy in 1619 in the New World.\n\nWhen our predecessors first assembled at Jamestown Island all those years ago, they changed everything. Those first citizen servants forged a path we continue on today, four centuries later, he said.\n\nAD\n\nCox included a nod to Del. ­Eileen Filler-Corn (D-Fairfax), whom Democrats chose as the first female caucus leader in our history, he said, to raucous applause.\n\nFor all the bipartisan niceties of opening day, political reality settled in quickly. The House Appropriations Committee wasted no time brushing off the governor's proposed amendments to the state's $117 billion biennial budget.\n\nAD\n\nIn addition to tax breaks for low-income workers, Northam wants to increase spending on teacher salaries, mental-health services and other state programs.\n\nRepublicans, however, have argued that much of that windfall should go toward tax breaks for a wider swath of Virginians. Del. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), chairman of the budget-shaping Appropriations Committee, said he will set aside all of that $1.2 billion and instead focus on smaller adjustments to the spending plan.\n\nAD\n\nThe Senate's Privileges and Elections Committee got right down to work on two proposed constitutional amendments — one related to the ERA, the other to same-sex marriage.\n\nSens. Glen H. Sturtevant Jr. (R-Chesterfield) and Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax County) proposed a measure to make Virginia the 38th and final state to ratify the federal Equal Rights Amendment. The bill died in House and Senate committees last year, although it had cleared the full Senate in previous years.\n\nOn Wednesday, the committee passed the bill on an 8-to-6 vote, with two Republicans among the yeas: the panel's chair, Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (Fauquier); and Sen. William R. DeSteph Jr. (Virginia Beach).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe committee then went on to consider a proposal from Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria) to remove the state's defunct gay-marriage ban from the state Constitution. The ban has been unconstitutional since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a right to marry nationwide. The plan from Ebbin, who in 2003 became the state's first openly gay legislator, would have put the matter to a referendum.\n\nThe measure died on a tied 7-to-7 vote, with Vogel the only Republican voting for it.
At first Hang the DJ's premise appears to be a more cheerful version of The Lobster, a dark comedy about a hotel where singles are sent to meet their match, or else. After 45 days, those who don't find a suitable mate get turned into the animal of their choosing. It took the idea of dying alone to frightening heights.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEven if the constant pairings in Hang the DJ seem like drudgery, the episode is far more optimistic than The Lobster. Even as Frank and Amy drudge through unsatisfying matches, success seems more inevitable than a lifetime of loneliness.\n\nIn fact, there are a few elements in Hang the DJ's fictional universe that, at least at first glance, might seem like improvements on the real-life Tinder slog.\n\nSingles get to meet each other right away. Are you tired of coming up with small talk with strangers over Tinder messages? Of course you are. Instead, the System pairs people instantly and picks the meetup spot.\n\nBack in 2013, OkCupid tried something like this: an app called Crazy Blind Date, where profile photos were displayed as a scrambled image. Users would input the times they had available to meet up and preferred locations. The app would then either set people up blindly or allow them to schedule with another user based on the times and locations they had on offer. It sounds like a brilliant way to do an end-run around endless predate conversing, but OkCupid got a lot of backlash over the app. Why? Well, one of the reasons people often don't want to go on dates immediately with strangers from the Internet is that they want to make sure they'll be safe — and often picking a public place isn't enough to ensure that. However, in the serene yet sanitized world Frank and Amy find themselves in, the danger seems to come not from their dates but from the security officers stalking about with stun guns.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEveryone seems to be looking for the same thing: a relationship. What a concept. In real life, not only do daters experience bad matches (someone who doesn't like you, you don't like them, or you clearly both don't like each other), but they also endure the heartbreak of good matches with bad timing (such as one person being off to a job or grad school in a different city). Not to mention online daters having to shoehorn these meetups and their relationships into their busy, stressful lives. In Hang the DJ's community of singles, everyone seems to be on the same timeline, or at least they're willfully submitting to the System's.\n\nWould devoting every waking hour to finding a partner be better than the balancing act most singles experience now? It might be more effective, but it could drive you crazy in the meantime. Do the contestants on The Bachelor, who are doing pretty much that, seem well-adjusted to you?\n\nIt gives couples certainty about how long they'll be together. Call me a cynic, but when Frank and Amy hit their System buttons on their first date and found out their relationship would last a grand total of 12 hours, I was incredibly relieved for them. They both seemed disappointed. But all I could think was: Wow, that makes it easy! No anxious thoughts about whether and when the person you're with might break up with you; no energy spent on the uncertainty of dating. Everything is decided for you. What a relief!\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut also: What a nightmare! This is basically technology-brokered arranged marriage with zero human input. The horrors of which are obvious when you see how miserable some of the Frank and Amy's other matches are.\n\nYou have lots of options, but you know you'll end up with the best. When the dangers of online dating are discussed in real life, the paradox of choice comes up. This is the idea that, faced with an abundance of choices, be it on Tinder or brands of cereal, we've become not freer and happier but more paralyzed and dissatisfied. The System aims to offer the best of both worlds: Lots of options, and at the end of it you get the best one.\n\nI won't give away the ending, but ultimately the episode becomes not an indictment of dating apps like Tinder but an endorsement of them. In a story that starts by telling its characters to hand over their free will to the supremacy of technology, it ends up melding the two. Yes, the app puts two people together, but they still have to make choices to be happy.
Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama — who starred in an Inauguration Day video playing up the democratic transfer of power — will also soon be jointly urging wary Americans to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to sources familiar with the project. The sources requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGathered to watch President Biden take the oath of office and film a message emphasizing the ceremony's importance to the republic, they also recorded a PSA [public service announcement] aimed at building confidence in the safety and efficacy of the covid vaccine, one of the sources said. That message will be released in the coming weeks, the source added. Another source said the PSA was a work in progress and confirmed the rough timetable.\n\nFormer presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton on Jan. 20 celebrated the inauguration of Joe Biden. (The Washington Post)\n\nThe idea of bringing the three former presidents together to film the handover-of-power video came from Stephanie Cutter, a veteran Democratic operative who served as an executive producer of Biden's inauguration, the sources said.\n\nCutter took a novel approach of trying to really make the program completely apolitical and patriotic and genuine in its appeal to all Americans. All the former presidents were happy to do it, one of the sources said. Plus, it helped them kill some time while they waited for the president and vice president!\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTheir view was 'because [former president Donald] Trump's not participating, how do we showcase the passage of power, and how do we visually represent the restoration of norms, another source said, noting the unusual video was weeks in planning.\n\nBiden's inaugural committee felt both for small-d democratic purposes but also aligned with Joe Biden's values and message, we are going to restore confidence in government again, or at least build some of it back, the source continued. That posed a challenge given the absence of the outgoing president, who plays a pretty starring role in Inauguration Day — the greeting at the White House — the whole nine yards.\n\nThe other flourish was the reimagining of the traditional wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery, usually a more low-key affair, to compensate for the absence of the parade that usually stretches from the Capitol to the White House after the president's swearing-in. The 2021 version, rather than just featuring the outgoing president and vice president, included Biden, Vice President Harris, Bill and Hillary Clinton, George W. and Laura Bush, and Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bipartisan bonhomie is a stark departure from Trump's approach to the coronavirus pandemic. His Health and Human Services Department crafted a never-aired $250 million campaign to defeat despair featuring celebrities like Dennis Quaid, which was criticized for being designed to boost Trump's reelection chances.\n\nTrump appointees vetted celebrities for the public health campaign based on whether they had ever criticized the president, or supported former president [Obama], gay rights or same-sex marriage, reported my colleague Yasmeen Abutaleb.\n\nIt also comes as Biden makes an all-out push to tackle to the pandemic, issuing executive orders to increase mask-wearing and implementing a national strategy to expand access to testing and vaccines.\n\nThe planned PSA aims to erode stubbornly robust American skepticism about coronavirus vaccines.\n\nForty percent of Americans say they definitely will get inoculated when they can, and another 23 percent say they probably will, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. But just one quarter of Republicans say they definitely will get vaccinated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnthony S. Fauci, the nation's most prominent infectious-disease expert, expressed concerns Thursday about public resistance to getting the vaccine.\n\nThe concern I have, and something we're working on, is getting people who have vaccine hesitancy, who don't want to get vaccinated — because many people are skeptical about that. So we really need to do a lot of good outreach for that, he said in a White House briefing.\n\nFauci told reporters If we get 70 to 85 percent of the country vaccinated — let's say by the end of the summer, middle of the summer — I believe by the time we get to the fall, we will be approaching a degree of normality.\n\nAD\n\nFormer presidents tend to come together under sad, even dire circumstances — the funeral of a prominent political figure, or a horrific natural disaster.\n\nAD\n\nTen days after the Dec. 26, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Bush enlisted Clinton and George H.W. Bush to lead what became a successful a global campaign for private donations. Five years later, it was Obama's turn to task Clinton and the younger Bush with collecting aid in the aftermath of an earthquake that devastated much of Haiti.\n\nAs the scope of the destruction became apparent, I spoke to each of these gentlemen, and they each asked the same simple question: 'How can I help?' Obama said with his two predecessors at his side in the Rose Garden. In the days ahead, they'll be asking everyone what they can do — individuals, corporations, NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] and institutions.\n\nWhat's happening now\n\nThe Senate just confirmed Lloyd Austin, 93 to 2, to become the nation's first Black defense secretary\n\nCongress waived a requirement for the defense secretary to be out of the military for seven years. Austin retired as a four-star Army general in 2016, served as head of U.S. Central Command and previously was commander of U.S. troops in Iraq, John Wagner and Karoun Demirjian report. GOP Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Josh Hawley (Mo.) were the two dissenters. He has vowed to eliminate extremism in the ranks.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead Biden's explanation for why he picked Austin.\n\nAnd about Austin's experiences with Beau Biden.\n\nImpeachment is inching ahead. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will deliver the article of impeachment against Trump on Monday. It will be a full trial, it will be a fair trial, Schumer said during remarks on the Senate floor, Wagner reports.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) argues a trial shouldn't begin until mid-February to give Trump time to mount a defense. Trump has apparently secured an attorney for the trial: Butch Bowers, a Columbia, S.C., lawyer known for his prominent role in litigating political and election matters for North and South Carolina Republicans.\n\nWalmart, Starbucks and Microsoft are teaming up to get more coronavirus vaccines into American arms. Walmart is prepping next week to make inoculations available through its stores in seven states, plus Chicago and Puerto Rico. Walmart expects to deliver 10 million to 13 million doses a month, Taylor Telford reports. And Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee (D) plans to partner with home-grown brands Microsoft and Starbucks to efficiently distribute the vaccines there.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Justice Department inspector general is examining the abrupt departure earlier this month of U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak, who departed after Trump complained that Georgia officials weren't doing enough to find election fraud, Matt Zapotosky reports. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation appears to be in its early stages.\n\nAt least hundreds of National Guard troops were forced to sleep in parking garages after being booted Thursday from the U.S. Capitol complex following their job to secure Biden's inauguration in the wake of the Jan. 6 riots. I've never in my entire career felt like I've been booted onto the curb and told, 'Figure it out on your own,'  said one of the soldiers, who said he served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some troops are headed home, while others have apparently been returned to the Capitol complex, after an uproar on social media.\n\nVideo obtained by The Washington Post appears to show National Guard troops in a parking garage and indoor tennis court near the U.S. Capitol.

It is essential for residents of the City of St. Louis and our state to have confidence in their leaders, she said. They must know that the Office of the Circuit Attorney will hold public officials accountable in the same manner as any other resident of our city. Both parties and the people of St. Louis deserve a thorough investigation of these allegations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe alleged actions, which have been denied by Greitens' lawyer, stem from a report by KMOV in St. Louis which featured a surreptitious recording purportedly of the woman with whom Greitens acknowledges having an affair in 2015. She describes Greitens inviting her to his home and taking pictures of her naked and then threatening to use them against her if she ever mentioned their relationship.\n\nGreitens (R), responding to media reports, acknowledged Wednesday night that he was unfaithful to his wife a few years ago before being elected. But his lawyer denied the blackmail allegation.\n\nThe lawyer, James F. Bennett, responded to the prosecutor's statement Thursday, saying the governor is very confident he will be cleared in any investigation, according to the St. Louis Post Dispatch. This is a three-year-old personal matter that presents no matters of public or legal interest. The facts will prove that fully.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe woman, who has not been named publicly, was Greitens's hair stylist, according to media reports confirmed by The Washington Post with a source familiar with the situation.\n\nA joint statement posted Wednesday night by Greitens and his wife, Sheena, said in part that a few years ago . . . there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage. This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately.\n\nGreitens, 43, is a relatively new star in the Republican Party who boasts an extraordinary résumé: Former Navy SEAL and Lt. Commander, attended Duke University on scholarship; Rhodes scholar at Oxford; PhD, author and White House Fellow during the administration of President George W. Bush. He is the author of Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life and, according to a profile in St. Louis Magazine, has had presidential aspirations since he was a young man. His wife, Sheena Chestnut Greitens, is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Missouri, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Center for East Asian Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\nA Democrat-turned-Republican, Greitens was elected governor in November 2016 after a campaign that emphasized his status as a family man. Greitens and his wife have two children. I'm Eric Greitens, he said during the campaign. I'm a Navy SEAL, native Missourian and most importantly, a proud husband and father.\n\nMissouri Gov. Eric Greitens (R) ran a television commercial featuring him with an assault rifle during the 2016 campaign. (Eric Greitens)\n\nThe governor had just delivered his state-of-the-state address Wednesday when KMOV in St. Louis broke the story about his affair with his former hairdresser in 2015.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe extramarital relationship itself, however, may have been the least explosive part of the story.\n\nMore unusual was what she purportedly said in a recording made surreptitiously by the woman's jealous ex-husband, which the station played.\n\nIn it, she can be heard telling how Greitens invited her to his home in 2015. Once she arrived, he told her he would show her how to do pullups, taped her hands to exercise rings and blindfolded her, all with her consent.\n\nThen, to her shock, she alleged, he snapped photographs of her naked and threatened to distribute the pictures if she revealed the relationship.\n\nOn what was supposed to be a banner evening for Greitens, he then was forced to issue the statement with his wife confirming the affair. His wife also issued her own statement:\n\nAD\n\nWe have a loving marriage and an awesome family; anything beyond that is between us and God. I want the media and those who wish to peddle gossip to stay away from me and my children.\n\nNeither the governor or his wife said anything about the reported photo shoot or the alleged blackmail threat.\n\nAD\n\nThat came in a separate statement by the couple's attorney, Bennett, who denied the blackmail claim. There was no 'blackmail,'  lawyer Bennett said in a written statement, and that claim is false . . . The outrageous claims of improper contact regarding these almost three-year-ago events are a lie.\n\nThe whole story, which had been the stuff of wild rumors for weeks, originated with the spurned ex-husband, who told KMOV that the relationship between Greitens and the man's then-wife had led to the breakup of their marriage.\n\nAfterward, the ex-husband went on social media calling Greitens a homewrecker, according to KMOV. He then tried to go public with his story and with the recording, speaking with both of Missouri's major newspapers.\n\nAD\n\nThe St. Louis Post Dispatch and the Kansas City Star reported that they too had possession of a transcript of the surreptitious recording and had interviewed the ex-husband. Both papers said they had decided against writing a story because the woman declined to be interviewed. Once the governor released a public statement the papers pushed ahead with their stories.\n\nAD\n\nKMOV decided otherwise. Although it said it had no on-the-record-comment from the woman, it went with the story Wednesday night under the headline Blackmail alleged as Governor Greitens admits to extramarital affair and took credit for prompting Greitens's statement.\n\nI am not after anything, the ex-husband, who was also unnamed, told KMOV. I am not a part of politics. I am not a part of anything. I just want to move on with my life.\n\nAD\n\nHe claimed to have been contacted by law enforcement authorities as well as members of the media.\n\nBennett, Greitens's lawyer, said in his statement that there was nothing about the relationship that has generated or should generate law enforcement interest.\n\nGreitens has received mixed reviews in as governor. While campaigning on a platform of cleaning up government, he admitted to the Missouri Ethics Commission that he had violated campaign finance law, according to the Kansas City Star. He was fined $1,000. He and his senior staff have also come under fire for using an app that deletes text messages after they've been read, raising concerns about trying to subvert Missouri open records law.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nComments posted on Greitens's Facebook page reflected a mixed reaction to the Wednesday's revelations.\n\nThis was March of 2015, wrote one woman, most likely when your wife was pregnant or had a new baby. There are transcripts. What is so fraudulent is that Eric Greitens ran as a 'family man.' \n\nThere are many in Missouri who stand behind you as governor, wrote another, and support your family . . . Lead on and God Bless!\n\nHere is the full statement, as posted on Facebook, by Greitens and his wife and the couple's lawyer:\n\nI wanted to share with you some statements that are important in light of news you may have seen tonight. A statement from James F. Bennett, our attorney: The Governor has now seen the TV report that ran tonight. The station declined to provide the tape or transcript in advance of running their story, which contained multiple false allegations. The claim that this nearly three-year old story has generated or should generate law enforcement interest is completely false. There was no 'blackmail,' and that claim is false. This personal matter has been addressed by the Governor and Mrs. Greitens privately years ago when it happened. The outrageous claims of improper conduct regarding these almost three-year-ago events are a lie. Joint statement from Sheena and I: A few years ago, before Eric was elected governor, there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage. This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately. While we never would have wished for this pain in our marriage, or the pain that this has caused others, with God's mercy Sheena has forgiven and we have emerged stronger. We understand that there will be some people who cannot forgive — but for those who can find it in your heart, Eric asks for your forgiveness, and we are grateful for your love, your compassion, and your prayers.\n\nThis story has been updated.
Dear Amy: I recently started working for a new company in a pretty heavily male-dominated field.\n\nOn certain emails sent to large groups of co-workers, I've noticed that my colleagues address the email to Gentlemen.\n\nThere are at least two females cc'd on most of these emails.\n\nI feel as though the emails are not addressed to me with this greeting; I believe that it is old-fashioned and offensive.

I am very attracted to him and I have sensed all this time that the feeling is mutual; there's clearly a connection between us.\n\nAD\n\nBesides the fact that he is my supervisor, we are also both married. For four years I have attempted to push down, ignore, cover up, rationalize and in every other way remove my feelings from my heart and mind. Obviously there is no future for us, and I can't figure out why I can't just accept the attraction and move on.\n\nAD\n\nI'm in my mid-40s; too old for this! Sometimes it feels like I'm keeping a secret that has power over me, and if I could just share the secret with him it would diffuse the power. But I realize that would endanger my job and my reputation, so I immediately put that thought out of my mind.\n\nHow can I work out these feelings? Honestly, it's become exhausting. Is leaving my job the only way?\n\nAD\n\nMy husband is a good man. He is hard-working, smart and he loves me deeply. I hope you can provide some insight into how to control my mind and feelings while working for this wonderful man whom I admire and adore.\n\nConflicted\n\nConflicted: Having a great spouse doesn't make you blind. And most people continue to feel attractions to people other than their partners throughout their lives. Mainly, this is relatively benign and even life-affirming. But the key to how you are feeling now is to be found in your marriage and your inner life. You are at a midlife transition and you can grow through it.\n\nAD\n\nI give you credit for not blaming your husband for this or inventing faults to justify your feelings. This is an opportunity, really, to reassess your life (personal and professional).\n\nAD\n\nPlease, find a counselor to share this with before you do anything drastic. I agree with you that sharing this secret may diminish its power, but you need to share it with the right person.\n\nFor insight, read The Breaking Point: How Female Midlife Crisis Is Transforming Today's Women, by Sue Shellenbarger (2005, Henry Holt and Co.). — April 2013

With this deal, both sides also achieved their secondary mission. For LeMahieu, 32, that meant securing a guaranteed figure — $90 million — that represents by far the largest in baseball this offseason (though Trevor Bauer, George Springer or J.T. Realmuto eventually could exceed it) and one that comes close to the $92 million third baseman Josh Donaldson (over four years) received from the Minnesota Twins a year ago. The latter was thought to be LeMahieu's target at the start of the free agent signing period.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the Yankees, the secondary mission was keeping LeMahieu's average annual value — $15 million, as it turns out — low enough to allow room for the addition of a starting pitcher while still keeping their 2021 payroll below the luxury tax threshold of $210 million. The Yankees may have made their move later Friday, when they reportedly agreed to a one-year contract with right-hander Corey Kluber, a two-time AL Cy Young winner. The trendy phrase of this offseason is financial flexibility, and the Yankees — despite being on the hook for more than a half a billion dollars to Giancarlo Stanton and Gerrit Cole through 2028 — achieved a measure of it with the LeMahieu deal.\n\nBut consider the significant concessions each side had to make to keep the marriage together. LeMahieu, coming off an MVP-caliber season in which he hit .364 with a 1.011 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, receives an average annual salary that probably won't rank among the top 60 in the game in 2021. It is lower, in fact, than the MLB-wide qualifying offer of $18.9 million that teams could offer their free agents this offseason to stay for another year — and that all but two players rejected.\n\nIt is a solid bet LeMahieu could have made more on a per-year basis elsewhere — with the Toronto Blue Jays believed to have been the most aggressive suitor — had he opted for that over the larger guarantee. But it is also possible he encountered a free agent market that had been depressed somewhat by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Yankees' concession was related to LeMahieu's age. He turns 33 in July, which means the team will be paying him an average of $15 million annually through the end of 2026, by which point he will be 38.\n\nOf course, if LeMahieu becomes unproductive in the late stages of his career, the Yankees, with their vast resources, can afford to carry him — particularly at such a relatively low salary. But it is still jarring, in the age of financial flexibility, to see a team overextend in terms of years to sign a player who is soon entering his mid-30s, and it is a safe assumption that, all other things considered, the Yankees would have preferred a shorter deal. Just as LeMahieu chose guaranteed dollars over AAV, the Yankees chose the opposite.
Dear Amy: I am a 33-year-old woman who has kept a secret since I was in junior high school.\n\nA relative who is a few years older than me, Steve, did some sexually inappropriate things to me. It didn't involve nudity, and I'd rather not get into detail, but it was very inappropriate and made me quite uncomfortable.\n\nI never told anyone about this. Our parents were close, and I never wanted to cause any hardship between them.\n\nAD\n\nIt has not mattered before because we would see that part of the family so infrequently that I was able to avoid him.\n\nAD\n\nI have mostly forgotten about the incident except for occasional flashbacks that I quickly repress.\n\nWe were recently sent a save the date announcement for Steve's wedding.\n\nI have no desire to celebrate him in any way, much less be forced to go to his wedding.\n\nMy mother takes these occasions very seriously and has not responded well to my initial attempts to tell her that I do not want to attend.\n\nI don't think any excuse (except telling her the truth) will get me out of this and still be in her good graces.\n\nI don't want to tell the truth now because our mothers are very close, and I don't want to upset that relationship.\n\nAD\n\n— Worried\n\nWorried: If you try hard enough, you can always find a good reason for not revealing the truth — to protect your mother's relationships, for instance.\n\nShedding light on this secret might be the best thing for you, and I could well imagine that your mother would want to know (most loyal mothers would).\n\nAD\n\nYou should get used to the idea that your mother is going to be upset, regardless of what you choose to do.\n\nYou could try to hedge by saying, Mom, I really don't like 'Steve.' I haven't liked him since we were kids. I don't want to go to his wedding.\n\nThat might be enough of an explanation for your mother, but you should ask yourself if this is really right for you.\n\nAD\n\nAugust 2020\n\nDear Amy: I'm getting married in September and have been planning my wedding for quite a while. My mom and I have been paying for everything related to the wedding, and my father and stepmother haven't offered any money.\n\nThey've been telling me about financial hardships that they've been having, but I notice they have been buying high-ticket items for their three girls.\n\nHow can I ask them to contribute when they claim to have no money?\n\nAD\n\nMy fiance's family also hasn't offered to contribute.\n\nHow do I broach that subject with them — I know his mom doesn't like me, but I'd appreciate the support.\n\n— Fed Up\n\nFed Up: You and your fiance (not you and your mother) should be in charge of paying for and financing your wedding.\n\nAD\n\nConsider this the first test of your marriage. If you and your fiance tackle this together, you will have the benefit of each other's assistance when trying to raise the money for your nuptials. If your mother isn't in the mix, your father may be more inclined to contribute, and if your future husband takes the lead in approaching his family, they may pony up. The best way to do this is respectfully — and in person.\n\nYou should take your discomfort as a sign that you should be judicious and realistic when asking people to open their wallets.\n\nAD\n\nYou two should plan only the wedding you know you can afford.\n\nJanuary 2010\n\nDear Amy: Responding to the question of what to do with your wedding gown (after you've used it), I got married in a Jessica McClintock ensemble of white lace jodhpurs, a black silk jacket and a lace jabot.\n\nAD\n\nThis Halloween for our neighborhood pet costume contest I made my cat, Roscoe, a wedding dress and used my lace jabot as his veil.\n\nRoscoe won best in show!\n\nOf course, my jabot went back in the cedar chest afterward.\n\n— Proud Cat Owner\n\nProud Cat Owner: And people say that cat owners are a little eccentric! I'm imagining your costumed cat, as well as the next use for your lace jabot.\n\nNovember 2010
Six days earlier, Cheney was in the House chamber, urging that Republicans reject efforts pushed by Trump and many others in her party to challenge the electoral college results that determined Trump had lost his reelection bid. She did not know she was being attacked by Trump, who was delivering the speech that would incite a mob to storm the Capitol, until her father reached her by phone in the House cloakroom.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nConstitutional law professor Jared Carter of Vermont Law School outlines the lasting legal ramifications of impeaching President Trump for a second time. (The Washington Post)\n\nWe got to get rid of the weak congresspeople, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world, Trump said in the speech, singling her out as he urged the mob to march to the Capitol.\n\nAfter being informed of the president's tirade by her father, Cheney walked out on the House floor, still hoping to stop the effort backed by Trump to overturn the electoral college votes. Then she heard a mob banging on the chamber's doors and a shot fired, and realized that an attempted insurrection was underway. She hustled to a secure location and later called Fox News.\n\nThere is no question that the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob, Cheney told the network where she once worked and whose pundits had long supported Trump. He lit the flame.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPresident Trump addressed supporters near the White House on Jan. 6, shortly before members of the group stormed the U.S. Capitol. (The Washington Post)\n\nThe dramatic moments, recounted by a source familiar with them, led her to back impeachment.\n\nThe president could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence, Cheney said in the statement. He did not.\n\nThe decision marked an extraordinary denouement for Cheney and her potentially precarious perch in the party's leadership. She had feuded for months with Trump and lately had been at odds with the majority of her caucus, even as speculation mounts about whether she might one day seek the speakership. The move was applauded by those in the party who have urged a clean break with Trump.\n\nIt is a remarkable statement that sets a new bar for leadership in the House, said Brendan Buck, a former aide to House Speaker John A. Boehner. She is turning the page on Donald Trump. I think she is doing the right thing in her mind, and when you do the right thing for the right reasons you have to hope the politics work out for you.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, he said, the decision will prompt Republicans who disagree with her decision to consider whether there should be political consequences for her internally.\n\nTuesday night, Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) called for Cheney to step down as the chair of the House Republican Conference. She is weakening our conference at a key moment for personal political gain and is unfit to lead, he said in a statement.\n\nLiz Cheney, 54, has been a member of the House of Representatives for only four years, coinciding with Trump's presidency. But she rose in meteoric fashion to the top ranks of GOP leadership after just one term representing Wyoming, leaving admirers and enemies in her wake.\n\nAD\n\nLiz Cheney declined to comment. Richard Cheney did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nShe and her father have had an up-and-down relationship with Trump that turned toxic. As she heard Trump and many of her colleagues declare several weeks ago that Congress should seek to challenge the electoral college results, she sat down to write a 21-page memo warning Republicans against the effort.\n\nAD\n\nBy objecting to electoral slates, members are unavoidably asserting that Congress has the authority to overturn elections and overrule state and federal courts, she wrote in the memo, which she released last week. Such objections set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states' explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the President and bestowing it instead on Congress. This is directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans.\n\nAD\n\nCheney's memo was hailed by Democrats. But the advice was not heeded by the vast majority of those in Cheney's caucus, as 139 out of 211 House Republicans voted to challenge electoral college votes from Arizona, Pennsylvania or both.\n\nAmong those supporting the effort to challenge the results was Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), a potential rival to Cheney for the speakership if Republicans regain the House in two years. McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks said Republicans welcome differing views and said the leadership team is united.\n\nAD\n\nOn Monday night, in a conference call with Republicans, McCarthy said he opposed impeachment, while Cheney declined to reveal her view, other than to say, This is going to be a vote of conscience.\n\nAttacking Democrats\n\nCheney served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs during the administration of her father's first term as vice president. She then played a crucial role in the 2004 Bush-Cheney reelection campaign, after which she returned to her post at the State Department and later served a stint as a Fox News pundit.\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, Cheney sought Wyoming's lone U.S. House seat, which her father had once held. After winning the seat, Cheney's ambition was to become one of the most powerful women on Capitol Hill.\n\nAfter winning reelection in 2018, a year in which Republicans lost control of the House, enabling Nancy Pelosi to become speaker, Cheney ran for a post traditionally sought by longtime members: leadership of the House Republican Conference Committee.\n\n\n\nAD\n\nShe won the post by arguing that Republicans needed to change their messaging and be more aggressive. Soon she was launching all-out assaults, saying in March 2019 on NBC's Meet the Press that Democrats were the party of anti-Semitism, the party of infanticide, the party of socialism.\n\nAD\n\nModerator Chuck Todd responded by asking Cheney, Do you feel comfortable that President Trump has done enough to tamp down this right-wing fringe anti-Semitism that has been rising up?\n\nCheney did not directly answer the question, which foreshadowed elements of the attack on the Capitol. Look, I don't believe this is right or left, she said. I think this is an issue on which all of us should come together.\n\nTrump had feuded with Cheney's father, saying in 2011 that I didn't like Cheney when he was a vice president. Here's a guy that did a rotten job as vice president. Nobody liked him.\n\nAD\n\nRichard Cheney, meanwhile, said in February 2016 that Trump sounded like a liberal Democrat and that he would not endorse him. But two months later, CNN reported that Cheney was breaking with the two former Bush presidents, who did not support Trump, and endorsed him at a time when the candidate had all but wrapped up the nomination.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the election, with Liz Cheney winning a House seat at the same time Trump captured the presidency, Trump baldly tried to win the Cheney family's goodwill. He pardoned the elder Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis Scooter Libby, who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice. Trump said Liz Cheney had pushed for the pardon.\n\nSpeaking at the White House in July 2019, Trump said, Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly and Liz was right in the forefront of that one and I said, 'What do you think, Liz,' and you said, 'Absolutely, he deserves it,' and it's been a very popular pardon. At another event, Trump said that Liz Cheney was so dedicated — and the loyalty. That was just an honor for me to do it. He called Cheney a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future.\n\nAD\n\nSoon, however, Cheney and Trump were at political war.\n\nA fight with Trump\n\nCheney criticized Trump's handling of the coronavirus, seeming to scorn the president's resistance to wearing a mask by tweeting a picture of her father wearing a face covering with the hashtag #realmenwearmasks. After Trump said I appreciate support from QAnon, the conspiracy theory group, Cheney called it a dangerous lunacy.\n\nCheney blasted Trump's proposal to withdraw U.S. troops from Germany as dangerously misguided, prompting a rebuke from Trump, who tweeted that Liz Cheney is only upset because I have been actively getting our great and beautiful Country out of the ridiculous and costly Endless Wars. The dispute prompted some House Republicans to launch a failed effort to oust her from her leadership post.\n\nIn his speech inciting the mob to storm the Capitol, Trump sounded obsessed with Cheney's criticism of him on the issue. After saying we got to get rid of Cheney, he said, You know, she never wants a soldier brought home. I brought a lot of soldiers home.\n\nCheney, who was unanimously reelected to her leadership position in November, has a voting record that underscores her conservatism. She has high ratings from right-leaning organizations and zero percent ratings from groups such as the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for gay rights; the League of Conservation Voters; and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, according to GovTrack.\n\nStuart Stevens, a political consultant who worked with Liz Cheney during both Bush-Cheney campaigns and recently wrote a book in which he predicted she would run for president, said she has become the de facto leader of the Republican Party, which he said should be distinguished from what he called the pro-Trump authoritarian party.\n\nCheney's recent actions helped mend a family rift. She was once criticized by her sister, Mary, who is openly gay and married, for opposing same-sex marriage.\n\nAs many people know, Liz and I have definitely had our differences, but I am incredibly proud of how she handled herself during the fight over the Electoral College, Mary Cheney wrote on her Facebook page last week. She stood up to President Trump. . . . He even denounced her by name from the stage at yesterday's rally — something that should definitely be considered a badge of honor. Good job Big Sister.
Bearded, baggy-eyed, habitually high on drugs or alcohol, Stone cut a curious figure at catered cocktail parties. He resembled an avatar of old Key West, a shrimper or deep-sea fisherman, a hell raiser temporarily ashore squandering his pay and his health. But he didn't behave like an island brawler. His bruises and scars came from falling down or stumbling into plate glass doors, not from fighting. He seldom raised his voice — which was surprisingly patrician — and rarely cut short his autodidactic monologues. Although a college dropout with a GED high school degree, he possessed arcane knowledge of religion, art, literature and history. Stone's most striking feature, however, was his hands — not big work-roughened mitts, but soft palms and the gentlest grip of any man I've ever met.\n\nBecause Stone knew I had been a friend of Graham Greene, whom he loathed, we danced around that subject. It was a shame, I thought, since Greene and Stone had so much in common — disorder and early sorrow, a weakness for drink and drugs, and an enduring interest in women, all tidily packaged in Catholic guilt.\n\nIn the biography Child of Light, Madison Smartt Bell captures every aspect of Stone's contradictory nature, especially his work ethic. Each of Stone's novels — from Hall of Mirrors (1966) through the National Book Award winning Dog Soldiers (1974) to his final book, Death of the Black-Haired Girl (2013) — was achieved despite the author's crippling depressions, repeated bouts of ill health and unwise dependence on self-medication.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA prolific writer himself, with more than 20 books, including a biography of Haitian revolutionary leader Toussaint L'Ouverture, Bell was also a friend of Stone's and occasionally a traveling companion. One of the best sections of this praiseworthy biography is the account of a trip he took with Stone to Haiti, along with one of Stone's mistresses, who had to nursemaid the novelist when it appeared that he might die while traveling to a voodoo ritual.\n\nYet sympathetic as he is to his subject, Bell never softens his focus or smooths over Stone's less admirable traits. A great deal of the credit for this candor goes to Stone's partner, whom Michael Herr christened the patron saint of writers' wives. Janice Stone served as her husband's muse, first reader, typist, cook and caretaker, accountant, travel agent and life coach. Unlike so many literary marriages, theirs lasted 55 years, and after Stone's death Janice remained her husband's helpmate and his biographer's enabler. Where other widows might protect a great man's reputation (and perhaps their own financial interest) by destroying unflattering documents or restricting access to diaries and letters, Janice set nothing off the record. Along with accounts of Stone's medications (recreational and otherwise), his stretches in rehab and his suicide attempt, Janice provided information about Stone's sexual escapades and her own affairs, which he encouraged. They had married young, before the late 60s' sexual liberation, and the Stones allowed each other astonishing leeway. Stone fathered a child with another woman, and even that didn't alienate Janice.\n\nBell has a novelist's gimlet eye for details, and the Stone archive offered him rich material. It revealed as much about the state of publishing in the 21st century as it did about Stone. By any objective standard, Stone was a successful author whose novels were critically acclaimed and received geometrically increasing advances. Paid $1,500 for his first novel, Stone finished his career with a million-dollar multi-book contract. As Bell reminisced in the New Yorker, Stone's life could be read as a fulfillment of the American dream of which his work was so critical.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut he never escaped the damage he suffered during his Dickensian childhood. Raised by an unmarried schizophrenic mother in a series of squalid hotel rooms, Stone was never told anything more about his father than his mother's unreliable report that the man was a Greek, a Jew, or a Lebanese. (A DNA test contained no information to support his mother's claims.) When his mother became unfit to care for him, Stone was consigned for four years to a Catholic orphanage where the faith was literally pounded into him. By the time mother and son were reunited, Stone was essentially a street child, and by his early teens, a drunk and a drug user. A stint in the U.S. Navy introduced him to a life more abundant, although it also reinforced his appetite for intoxicants and women.\n\nNot unreasonably, Bell maintains that Stone's accomplishments more than outweigh his transgressions. And who would argue otherwise when his wife forgave him everything? While I wish there had been more about Stone's early life, the daughter he fathered outside his marriage and the sexual partners who clearly influenced his fiction, Bell does a laudable job of explicating Stone's novels, including the dark ones like Outerbridge Reach, and the breezy autobiography Prime Green, which describes Stone's friendship with Ken Kesey. In the end, Child of Light leaves the reader with the urge to return to all of Robert Stone's work — surely the best sign of a fine biography.\n\nMichael Mewshaw's most recent book, The Lost Prince: A Search for Pat Conroy, was longlisted for the PEN biography award.\n\nCHILD OF LIGHT\n\nA Biography of Robert Stone\n\nBy Madison Smartt Bell
The former Republican senator from Indiana, appointed by President Trump, has sought to protect the independence of spy agencies to provide candid and cleareyed assessments of what's really going on in the world, especially vis-a-vis the threat posed by Vladimir Putin's revanchist Russia.\n\nAD\n\nIn the past, there's been a public report and a separate classified version. But this year there is only one version – and it's entirely unclassified. This is part of an effort by Coats to be more transparent in the face of sustained attacks from the president and his allies on the right against what they've taken to calling the Deep State.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has routinely clashed with the intelligence community, likening the agencies to Nazi Germany shortly before he took office, repeatedly questioning their expert consensus that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and boasting about his inauguration crowd size during a speech in front of the wall of stars that honors the fallen at CIA headquarters.\n\nWe need to assure our policymaking community, and the American people, that we can be trusted with this responsibility to use our information appropriately to protect the nation, Coats said in an afternoon speech to more than 150 members of his staff in McLean, Va. Through transparency, we will strengthen America's faith that the intelligence community seeks the truth – and speaks the truth.\n\n-- Here are the 10 biggest truth bombs from the 36-page Coats report. These are direct quotes:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n1. Traditional adversaries will continue attempts to gain and assert influence, taking advantage of changing conditions in the international environment — including the weakening of the post-WWII international order and dominance of Western democratic ideals, increasingly isolationist tendencies in the West, and shifts in the global economy.\n\n2. Russian efforts to increase its influence and authority are likely to continue and may conflict with U.S. goals and priorities in multiple regions.\n\n3. No longer a solely U.S. domain, the democratization of space poses significant challenges for the United States. Adversaries are increasing their presence in this domain with plans to reach or exceed parity in some areas. For example, Russia and China will continue to pursue a full range of anti-satellite weapons as a means to reduce U.S. military effectiveness and overall security. Increasing commercialization of space now provides capabilities that were once limited to global powers to anyone that can afford to buy them. Many aspects of modern society—to include our ability to conduct military operations—rely on our access to and equipment in space.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n4. The ability of individuals and groups to have a larger impact than ever before—politically, militarily, economically, and ideologically—is undermining traditional institutions. This empowerment of groups and individuals is increasing the influence of ethnic, religious, and other sources of identity, changing the nature of conflict, and challenging the ability of traditional governments to satisfy the increasing demands of their populations, increasing the potential for greater instability. Some violent extremist groups will continue to take advantage of these sources and drivers of instability to hold territory, further insurgencies, plan external attacks, and inspire followers to launch attacks wherever they are around the world.\n\n5. Increasing migration and urbanization of populations are further straining the capacities of governments around the world and are likely to result in further fracturing of societies, potentially creating breeding grounds for radicalization. Pressure points include growing influxes of migrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons fleeing conflict zones; areas of intense economic or other resource scarcity; and areas threatened by climate changes, infectious disease outbreaks, or transnational criminal organizations. All of these issues will continue to drive global change on an unprecedented scale.\n\n6. Advances in nano- and bio-technologies have the potential to cure diseases and modify human performance, but without common ethical standards and shared interests to govern these developments, they have the potential to pose significant threats to U.S. interests and security. In addition, the development and spread of such technologies remain uneven, increasing the potential to drastically widen the divide between so-called 'haves' and 'have-nots.'\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n7. Despite growing awareness of cyber threats and improving cyber defenses, nearly all information, communication networks, and systems will be at risk for years to come. Our adversaries are becoming more adept at using cyberspace capabilities to threaten our interests and advance their own strategic and economic objectives. Cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to public health, safety, and prosperity as information technologies are integrated into critical infrastructure, vital national networks, and consumer devices.\n\n8. Many adversaries continue to pursue capabilities to inflict catastrophic damage to U.S. interests through the acquisition and use of [weapons of mass destruction]. Their possession of these capabilities can have major impacts on U.S. national security, overseas interests, allies, and the global order. The intelligence challenges to countering the proliferation of WMD and advanced conventional weapons are increasing as actors become more sophisticated, WMD-related information becomes broadly available, proliferation mechanisms increase, and as political instability erodes the security of WMD stockpiles.\n\n9. Continued federal budget uncertainty strains the [intelligence community's] ability to make deliberative and responsive resource decisions. The outcome may be overextended budgets or lack of cost-effective solutions to address intelligence issues. The [intelligence community] needs to develop methods to efficiently shift resources to mitigate programmatic (fiscal) risk and avoid loss of vital programs, capabilities, and resource investments.\n\n10. There will likely be demand for greater intelligence support to domestic security, driven in part by concerns over the threat of terrorism, the threat posed by transnational illicit drug and human trafficking networks, and the threat to U.S. critical infrastructure. Intelligence support to counter these threats must be conducted … with adequate protection for civil liberties and privacy.\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- Despots — and would-be despots — have seen in Trump a model, as well as an alibi, Griff Witte, Carol Morello, Shibani Mahtani and Anthony Faiola report in today's newspaper. The strongman style of leadership is not new, of course, and it is not always obvious who is inspiring whom. But in interviews on four continents, diplomats, rights activists and foreign officials said that after two years of Trump using the world's most powerful megaphone to cheer authoritarians, bully democratic allies and denigrate traditional American values, the impact on how others govern is becoming clear.\n\nViktor Orban, Hungary 's increasingly autocratic leader, said Trump represents 'permission' from 'the highest position in the world.'\n\nTo Jair Bolsonaro, the new president of Brazil , the U.S. president is … proof that incendiary comments about women or minorities and a history of trafficking in conspiracy theories don't need to stand in the way of taking power.\n\nWhen the Nigerian army opened fire on rock-throwing demonstrators last fall, killing as many as 40 people, it defended itself by citing Trump's threats to do the same at the Mexican border.\n\nWhen the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia criticized ruler Hun Sen for cracking down on the opposition and the media, the authoritarian leader pointed out that Trump had his back — not the diplomats.\n\nAnd when members of the U.N. Security Council visited Myanmar 's commander in chief in late April to demand explanations for the expulsion of more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims, he used the phrase 'fake news' — the only words he spoke in English — no less than a dozen times.\n\nIn Honduras , President Juan Orlando Hernández backed Washington in a vote at the United Nations over U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Then Hernández allegedly used fraud to steal an election, triggering mass protests. Rather than condemn the move, the United States offered its congratulations.\n\nGuatemala also voted with the United States on Jerusalem and announced it would move its own embassy to the city. Months later, in August, President Jimmy Morales declared he was abolishing the mandate of a U.N.-backed commission that had long been known as an effective watchdog in curbing corruption. As he spoke, a column of three dozen jeeps — some with roof-mounted machine guns — that had been supplied by the United States for anti-narcotics operations rolled through Guatemala City, pausing at the commission's offices and the homes of human rights activists.\n\nKey quote: While the global decline in freedom didn't begin with Donald Trump's presidency, I do think he has been an accelerant, said Uzra Zeya, a State Department veteran who resigned last spring following a 25-year career that culminated as the nation's top Foreign Service officer in Paris.\n\n-- Trump's assistant secretary of state in charge of European affairs, who has overseen U.S. relations with NATO and the European Union for the past 16 months, announced his resignation. He cited personal and professional reasons. Carol Morello reports: In September 2017, [A. Wess] Mitchell became one of the first assistant secretaries of state in the Trump administration confirmed by the Senate, and his departure creates another vacancy in the ranks of senior officials. Currently, six of the 24 spots have nominees awaiting Senate confirmation. … In an interview, Mitchell said his resignation is not a protest of the administration's policies or the direction of foreign policy, and he praised [Mike] Pompeo's leadership and vision.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n-- The House overwhelmingly passed a bill aimed at preventing Trump from trying to pull out of NATO. Karoun Demirjian reports: The vast majority of House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the bill by a vote of 357 to 22, after members of both parties gave impassioned speeches for why the alliance was so vital to preserve and protect. 'Time and again the alliance has proven that the free peoples of the world are strongest when they stand together,' said Rep.

(Jon Thurber)\n\nThe FBI Agents Association held a news conference Jan. 22 to talk about how the ongoing government shutdown is affecting cases. (Reuters)\n\nSHUTDOWN, DAY 33:\n\nAD\n\n-- Hundreds of IRS workers have gotten permission to skip work because of financial hardship, just as the tax season gets busy. Danielle Paquette, Lisa Rein, Jeff Stein and Kimberly Kindy report: The Trump administration last week ordered at least 30,000 IRS workers back to their offices, where they have been working to process refunds without pay. … But IRS employees across the country — some in coordinated protest, others out of financial necessity — won't be clocking in, according to Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, and several local union officials. The work action is widespread and includes employees from a processing center in Ogden, Utah, to the Brookhaven campus on New York's Long Island.\n\nAD\n\nThe move is the leading edge of pushback from within the IRS, and it signals the potential for civil servants to take actions that could slow or cripple government functions as the political stalemate continues in Washington. U.S. Department of Agriculture meat inspectors have begun to call in sick, Transportation Security Administration sickouts at airports have been rising, and federal law enforcement agencies say the shutdown is increasing stress among agents and affecting investigations. … Not receiving pay for more than a month has taken a toll on employees across the government, but especially on those who are not in high-salary jobs. The employees summoned back from furlough to process tax refunds are paid between $25,800 and $51,000 a year, depending on their seniority.\n\n-- Irony alert: The shutdown has forced the State Department to postpone an international conference on border security. CNN's Michelle Kosinski and Jennifer Hansler report: The 16th International Export Control and Border Security Conference was scheduled to take place in Edinburgh, Scotland, in mid-February, with a goal of preventing the proliferation and transfer of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons across borders. However, it has been postponed 'due to uncertainty associated with the continuing partial U.S. federal government shutdown,' according to a letter ... signed by Kathryn Insley, the director of the Office of Export Control Cooperation.\n\nAD\n\n-- A group representing FBI agents issued a report saying the shutdown is affecting investigations on child trafficking, terrorism and more. The New York Times's Katie Benner reports: Because of the shutdown, the F.B.I. has been unable to issue grand jury subpoenas and indictments in several cases cited in the report. An agent working on an MS-13 investigation that has gone on for more than three years and resulted in 23 gang indictments for racketeering, murder and money laundering has been hamstrung by his inability to pay for an interpreter who can communicate with his Spanish-speaking informants, the report said. The bureau has also not been able to pay its informants, an important source of intelligence in terrorism, narcotics, gang, illegal firearm and other national security cases. The F.B.I. could lose those informants. (Read the full 72-page report here.)\n\nAD\n\n-- The funding lapse has also delayed the trial of a man accused of murdering two police officers in the U.S. Virgin Islands because expert witnesses in the case have been furloughed. Deanna Paul reports: Days before the Jan. 10 trial date, assistant attorneys general from the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Justice filed a motion with the local St. Croix court. 'Due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the People's control,' they requested a fourth continuance in the [Francis] Williams murder trial. 'Virtually all of the forensic evidence in this case was processed by scientists and agents attached to the FBI, ATF and the Department of Homeland Security,' prosecutors said in court filings.\n\nPresident Trump said he would be proud to shut down the government. Now the longest government shutdown in history is jeopardizing some of his top priorities. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\n\nPOLITICAL POSTURING:\n\n-- Lawmakers agreed … to more show votes that probably won't end the government shutdown. The Senate will vote tomorrow on competing measures from Trump and Democrats. Both are expected to fail. Erica Werner, John Wagner and Jeff Stein report: The result could be only to prove that some other solution is needed to end the partial shutdown, even as 800,000 federal workers face the loss of a second straight paycheck Friday. Trump's proposal, which the president announced in a weekend speech from the White House, would open the government through Sept. 30 while providing $5.7 billion for a border wall and giving temporary deportation protections to about 1 million unauthorized immigrants. But it also contains stringent changes to the nation's asylum rules, and Democrats who were already united against funding Trump's wall described these asylum provisions Tuesday as a new poison pill. The Democrats' plan is a stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through Feb. 8 without providing any new money for the wall. That would let both parties negotiate on border security while the government is reopened, a respite Democrats have been demanding. …\n\nThursday's planned votes are a product of an agreement between [Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer]. But even as the leaders announced the deal, they traded barbs in speeches on the Senate floor. McConnell accused Democrats of rejecting a reasonable proposal from Trump because of political opposition to the president, and Schumer argued that Republicans and Trump were operating in bad faith by including new asylum curbs and failing to consult with Democrats.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision to decline the Trump administration's request for an expedited review of DACA weakened the president's hand: If the court sticks to its normal procedures, even accepting the case at a later date would probably mean the justices would not hear arguments until the court's new term starts in October. That would probably keep the program in place until at least next year. With the court seemingly keeping the program safe for at least a year, Trump's offer to suspend his efforts to end it became less appealing to lawmakers who were already skeptical.\n\n-- Trump is preparing two versions of his State of the Union address, even if Nancy Pelosi declines to invite him to the House chamber and he is forced to give the speech somewhere else. Seung Min Kim reports: The administration is trying to conduct advance work to prepare for an address in the House chamber, originally scheduled for Jan. 29, even though Pelosi has the power to determine whether Trump can do so. … It's unclear what options for venues the White House is exploring aside from the House chamber, where State of the Union addresses have been delivered since President Woodrow Wilson's speech in 1913. On Tuesday, the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Tim Moore, said Trump called him to thank him for offering the Raleigh legislature as a venue. Trump told Moore in the phone call Monday evening, which lasted for about 10 minutes, that his staff was still determining where the address would be delivered. Trump also called Lee Chatfield, the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, who similarly offered up the chambers in Lansing.\n\n-- Pelosi remains adamant that Democrats will not vote to fund the wall, but several more moderate members want to compromise. Politico's Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade report: A group of centrist House Democrats, sick of political posturing, is pressing [Pelosi] to counter Trump's immigration proposal with her own potential compromise. The group, led by freshman Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, is asking the California Democrat to offer Trump a vote on his border wall or some sort of negotiated security package in February if he first signs a bill reopening the federal government … 'Give Trump the money,' Rep. Collin Peterson, a centrist Democrat from a red Minnesota district, told a local radio station Tuesday. 'I'd give him the whole thing…and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where it needs to be. Why are we fighting over this? We're going to build that wall anyway, at some time.'\n\n-- Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) introduced a bill called the Stop STUPIDITY Act to prevent future shutdowns. From Felicia Sonmez: The measure would automatically keep all of the federal government running in the case of a future funding standoff — with the exceptions of the legislative branch and the Executive Office of the President. 'The Stop STUPIDITY Act takes the aggressive but necessary step of forcing the president and Congress to do the jobs they were elected to do,' Warner said in a statement. ... The full name of Warner's measure is the 'Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act.'\n\n-- The bigger picture: Democrats note that Trump is following an established pattern of attempting to force his opponents to capitulate by offering to resolve a disaster of his own making. Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey report: Trump has described this approach as creating leverage and negotiating, but Democrats and other opponents have said it amounts to 'hostage taking.' 'It's sort of like bartering with stolen goods,' [Schumer] said Tuesday. Trump has used the same playbook during confrontations with Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, South Korea, North Korea and the European Union in the past two years with mixed success. … It is a well-worn tactic from Trump's business career, but this is the first time the livelihoods of so many U.S. workers and households have hung in the balance as a result of it.\n\n-- The shutdown has forced Trump to sideline the rest of his agenda. The New York Times's Peter Baker reports: The standoff has already forced Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Europe to meet with global business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown. The president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax-cutting plan he promised last year. He has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy.\n\nThe Supreme Court lifted an injunction on President Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military while the legal battle continues in lower courts. (Reuters)\n\nSCOTUS WATCH:\n\n-- The Supreme Court allowed Trump's transgender troop ban to go into effect as it works its way through lower courts. Robert Barnes and Dan Lamothe report: The justices lifted nationwide injunctions that had kept the administration's policy from being implemented. The Trump policy reverses an Obama administration rule that would have opened the military to transgender men and women and instead bars those who identify with a gender different from the one assigned at birth and are seeking to transition. The court's five conservatives — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh — allowed the restrictions to go into effect while the court decides whether eventually to consider the merits of the case. The liberal justices — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — would have kept the injunctions in place.\n\n-- The high court announced it will consider a New York City gun law, marking the first time the justices have taken up a Second Amendment case in nearly a decade. Robert Barnes reports: The decision to hear the case in the term that begins in October may signal that the reinforced conservative majority on the court is ready to examine more laws that restrict gun rights. New York's law is not replicated elsewhere: It permits transporting handguns only to firing ranges within the city. Those who challenged the law have licenses to keep a handgun at their homes. Petitioners included those who want to take their guns to firing ranges or competitions outside the city, and one who wanted to take the gun to his second home upstate.\n\n-- Barnes, our SCOTUS beat reporter, notes the decision to grand cert on the gun case may provide the most insight yet about where the conservative majority will take the court: The speculation had been that neither conservatives nor liberals knew whether they could count on the vote of the court's median justice, Anthony M. Kennedy. The court turned aside numerous challenges to restrictions on the kinds of guns that could be purchased, and whether they could be carried outside the home. After one such decision in 2018, a frustrated Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that 'as evidenced by our continued inaction in this area, the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court.' But, [law professor Adam] Winkler said, 'there is no hesitancy in Justice Kavanaugh,' who replaced Kennedy and has an expansive view of gun rights.\n\n-- The Trump administration asked the court to accelerate the review of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Barnes reports: Last week, U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman of New York ordered the administration to stop its plans to add the question to the survey. Furman said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross broke a 'veritable smorgasbord' of federal rules by overriding the advice of career officials who said including the citizenship question was likely to cut down the response rate and make the census less accurate. Normally, the Justice Department's next stop would be the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. But Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said that would not leave enough time for a final ruling from the Supreme Court. 'The government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of June 2019 to enable it to be printed on time,' he told the court.\n\nWEST WING INTRIGUE:\n\n-- Trump's legislative affairs director, Shahira Knight, is looking to leave the administration, Politico's Eliana Johnson and Nancy Cook report: Knight's talk of exiting a job she took less than seven months ago comes as she plays what some call a thankless role in talks between [Trump] and Capitol Hill lawmakers skeptical of cutting a deal [to end the shutdown] with her erratic boss. In recent weeks, she has taken a back seat to the stepped-up efforts of Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.\n\n-- Behind the scenes, Trump's communications team is struggling to convey a consistent message on the shutdown amid an ongoing power struggle. CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak report: The lack of a cohesive strategy emanating from the White House communications team has frustrated people throughout the West Wing who have deemed the press shop 'irrelevant' ... according to interviews with several current and former White House officials. No one has emerged as the clear leader among Sarah Sanders, Bill Shine, Kellyanne Conway or Mercedes Schlapp, leading to deep divisions among one of the administration's most fractious departments and causing a void for a coverage-obsessed president. The communications team has also drawn the ire of dozens of senior staffers, including Trump at times, who have blamed them for failing to blunt PR missteps and allowing them to turn into full-blown disasters.\n\nThe Trump White House in a nutshell: Trump was impressed by [deputy press secretary Hogan] Gidley's television appearances during the previous government shutdown. Once, after watching Gidley on his screen in the residence, the President walked over to the communications office to tell the staff he thought they were handling the shutdown well. In the days afterward, Trump confused several officials when he directed them to, 'Get me Tidley.' 'Who?' puzzled staffers asked. 'Tidley,' Trump replied. 'I want to talk to Hogan Tidley.' They informed him that the deputy press secretary's last name was Gidley, not Tidley.\n\n-- Trump tweeted that he has directed Sanders not to bother with press briefings. From John Wagner: Sanders has not provided an on-camera briefing for more than a month, including the duration of the partial government shutdown. 'The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the 'podium' much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press,' Trump said on Twitter. ... Olivier Knox, president of the White House Correspondents Association, said in a statement that the Trump administration's move 'sets a terrible precedent.'\n\n-- Former White House communications aide Cliff Sims recounts in his new tell-all that the president offered NASA all the money you could ever need to get an astronaut to Mars during his first term. New York magazine's Olivia Nuzzi reports: The day of [Trump's televised call to the International Space Station in 2017], Sims conducted a final briefing in the Private Dining Room with Trump, [Betsy] DeVos, [astronaut Kate] Rubins, and Robert Lightfoot Jr., the acting NASA administrator. … Lightfoot explained to the president — who, again, had recently signed a bill containing a plan for Mars — that NASA planned to send a rover to Mars in 2020 and, by the 2030s, would attempt a manned spaceflight. … Sims wrote that [Trump] leaned in toward Lightfoot and made him an offer. 'But what if I gave you all the money you could ever need to do it?' Trump asked. 'What if we sent NASA's budget through the roof, but focused entirely on that instead of whatever else you're doing now. Could it work then?'\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, dialed back comments he made Jan. 20 about negotiations over a Trump Tower project in Moscow. (Drea Cornejo/The Washington Post)\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- BuzzFeed obtained documents outlining detailed plans for Trump Tower Moscow, contradicting comments from Trump and his allies that the proposal fizzled in its earliest stages. BuzzFeed News's Azeen Ghorayshi reports: The plan was dazzling: a glass skyscraper that would stretch higher than any other building in Europe, offering ultra-luxury residences and hotel rooms and bearing a famous name. Trump Tower Moscow, conceived as a partnership between [Trump's] company and a Russian real estate developer, looked likely to yield profits in excess of $300 million. … On Monday, Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said 'the proposal was in the earliest stage,' and he went on to tell the New Yorker that 'no plans were ever made. There were no drafts. Nothing in the file.' However, hundreds of pages of business documents, emails, text messages, and architectural plans, obtained by BuzzFeed News over a year of reporting, tell a very different story. Trump Tower Moscow was a richly imagined vision of upscale splendor on the banks of the Moscow River. …\n\nBy September 2015, a New York architect had completed plans for a bold glass obelisk 100 stories high, to be topped by a gleaming, cut-diamond–like shape emblazoned on multiple sides with the Trump logo. … The Trump team would also have the option to 'brand all or any portion of the spa or fitness facilities' as 'The Spa By Ivanka Trump,' according to the plans. … The top residence of the Moscow tower, enjoying a view without equal in all the continent, was to be a gleaming penthouse, the most luxurious property in a seriously luxurious building. A show-stopping apartment like that could have been marketed for $50 million. But as BuzzFeed News reported in November, Trump's fixers planned not to sell it — but to give it away for free, to none other than Vladimir Putin himself.\n\n-- Trump, like many of his advisers, has grown tired of Giuliani's gaffe-prone media appearances frequently requiring the ex-mayor to walk back his comments, Politico's Eliana Johnson and Darren Samuelsohn report: Trump was apoplectic after a pair of weekend media interviews by his personal lawyer, in which Giuliani said that the president had been involved in discussions to build a Trump Tower in Moscow through the end of the 2016 campaign … Trump spent much of Sunday and Monday fuming to aides and friends about his lawyer's missteps. … Giuliani's public remarks — typically made in sporadic clusters of freewheeling media interviews — have long exasperated White House aides, including the president's in-house lawyer handling the Russia investigation, Emmet Flood. … Asked who in the White House is responsible for handling Giuliani's missteps, a White House aide said, 'Handling Rudy's f--- ups takes more than one man.'\n\nON CAPITOL HILL:\n\n-- In a divorce filing, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) alleges that her husband mentally and emotionally abused her — and even once physically assaulted her. The Des Moines Register's Luke Nozicka and Linh Ta report: 'We went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage,' Ernst wrote [in her affidavit]. 'I very nearly filed for divorce after a night that we argued, and it became physical.' Joni Ernst said she fled to her mother's house with her daughter in the middle of the night. Gail Ernst followed soon after, crying and apologizing, according to her affidavit. The next day, a victim's advocate at the courthouse performed an examination of Ernst's throat and head, she said; the advocate wanted to take Ernst to the hospital, according to the court filing. Ernst declined, writing that she was 'embarrassed and humiliated' and did not want people to know about what she described as an assault.\n\n-- Ernst, up for reelection next year, also claimed in the court filing she turned down Trump's offer to be his running mate in 2016. The Guardian's Ben Jacobs reports: The Iowa Republican met with Trump in New Jersey at his Bedminister golf course on [July 4, 2016] and gave a positive statement about the meeting. However, within two days, Ernst told Politico: 'I made that very clear to him that I'm focused on Iowa. I feel that I have a lot more to do in the United States Senate. And Iowa is where my heart is.'\n\n-- This Sunday's New York Times Magazine has a lengthy cover story on Mitch McConnell's legacy. The president whom the Senate Republican leader helped elect has turned out to be the one thing he can't control, Charles Homans writes. When I asked Elaine Chao, who is Trump's secretary of transportation and McConnell's wife of 26 years, if Trump and McConnell liked each other, she was silent for a full four seconds before replying, 'You'll have to ask the president that, and you'll have to ask the leader that.' When I did ask McConnell, all he said was, 'Yeah, we get along fine.' …\n\nWhen I asked McConnell how he felt about his legacy and Trump's being so closely linked, he rejected the premise. 'I don't think so,' he said. 'I think the most consequential call I made was before President Trump came to office.' I asked what he meant. 'The decision not to fill the [Antonin] Scalia vacancy,' he said. 'I think that's the most consequential thing I've ever done.'\n\n-- A group of progressive Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), secured seats on the House Oversight Committee, giving them a platform to grill Trump administration officials in a wide variety of investigations. Politico's Andrew Desiderio and Heather Caygle report: [Ocasio-Cortez], Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) won spots on the high-profile committee on Tuesday … Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the Oversight Committee, dismissed concerns about the outspoken freshman lawmakers. 'If I based the choices going on the committee based on what people said or their reputations or whatever, I probably wouldn't have a committee,' Cummings said.\n\n-- Ocasio-Cortez a popular choice for president — even though she's too young to serve, by John Wagner: A new poll finds that 74 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults would consider voting for [Ocasio-Cortez] for president if they could. For now, they can't. Ocasio-Cortez, who last year became the youngest woman elected to Congress, is 29. Under the Constitution, you must be at least 35 to be president. The Axios-SurveyMonkey poll highlights the splash that Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist, has made since her arrival this month on Capitol Hill. The 74 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults who say they would vote for her for president includes 17 percent who say they would 'definitely' do so.\n\n-- Ocasio-Cortez Builds a National Platform, but a District Office? Not Open Yet, by the New York Times's J. David Goodman: In three short weeks in office, [Ocasio-Cortez] has shaped a national conversation on taxation, emerged as the face of a green jobs plan in Washington and elevated her initials into a worldwide brand. But she has not yet opened an office in her own New York City district — a delay that may give a sense of her priorities early in her tenure. During an appearance on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' on Monday, she blamed the government shutdown. … But the shutdown has not had a similar effect on other first-term Congress members from New York State.\n\n-- Rep. Maxine Waters, the new chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, intends to call three major credit reporting firms to testify on Capitol Hill. From Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt: Top executives from Equifax, Experian and TransUnion are expected to appear at a hearing anticipated for Feb. 26, the sources said. … Waters, a California Democrat, is an outspoken critic of the industry, and the hearing will put a spotlight on legislation she drafted to revamp its practices. … The hearing will be a preview of the kind of intense scrutiny that Waters has vowed to direct at big banks and top Trump administration officials in the coming months.\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg entered the 2020 Democratic primary. Cathleen Decker reports: Buttigieg made his plans official in a video and email sent to supporters early Wednesday, before taking part in the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in Washington, D.C. He announced in December that he would not seek a third term as mayor of the Indiana city, a move widely seen as a precursor to a presidential run. He said Wednesday he was setting up an exploratory committee for president, the legal mechanism allowing him to raise and spend money on behalf of his campaign. Buttigieg suffused his announcement with references to his youth and the generational exception he represents compared to most of the Democratic field. He turned 37 on Saturday, making him the youngest entrant so far in the presidential race.\n\n-- The narrative: Democratic presidential candidates across the board are embracing liberal and populist policies, demonstrating how much the party has transformed in recent years. David Weigel and Jenna Johnson report: For years, Democratic presidential candidates have been skittish about taking positions that were considered too liberal, for fear of scaring off moderates and independent voters. That caution seems to be gone, along with soul-searching about making explicit appeals to conservative voters. … The party's swift shift has left vulnerable several Democratic candidates or likely ones who have voting records and previous stances that are out-of-line with current Democratic thinking. Those who defend their earlier stances risk seeming stuck in time to party that's quickly transforming, while those who have changed their positions risk being labeled as flip-floppers and opportunists.\n\n-- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) used a visit to the early primary state of South Carolina to pitch himself to black voters in a stark difference from his 2016 campaign. Annie Linskey and David Weigel report: 'Racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality,' Sanders said, in a speech that used the refrain 'racism is alive' to walk through a litany of problems faced by minorities. The changes from Sanders's last campaign were hard to miss. In 2016, he said that 'identity politics' distracted from what he considered real issues, like economic inequality and the decline of organized labor. This week, on his first trip to an early-primary state since the midterm elections, Sanders called [Trump] a 'racist,' pushed for an end to private prisons, endorsed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote and advocated for an end to the cash bail system. He spoke at two black churches, mingled with supporters at a barbecue joint and met with the state's legislative black caucus, which had largely rejected him in 2016.\n\n-- The South Carolina primary is taking on outsize significance in the 2020 Democratic nominating fight. The New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Astead W. Herndon report: The primary here may still be 405 days away and only fourth on the calendar of early-nominating states, behind Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. But at a time when [Trump] has stoked racial divisions and black voters have become an increasingly crucial Democratic constituency, South Carolina is already looming larger at the outset of this race than in any recent Democratic nominating contest. … The winner here will enter the March 3 Super Tuesday contests with a burst of momentum.\n\n-- Michael Bloomberg, who is weighing a presidential bid leaning on his centrist image, emphasized the importance of compromise in an Annapolis speech. Rachel Chason reports: He gave the keynote speech Tuesday at a leadership conference at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, praising the late senator John McCain — an academy alumnus — for his independence and willingness to work across the aisle. … Following meetings with Maryland lawmakers and state Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D), Bloomberg spoke at a news conference about the importance of 'balancing' different priorities. He called the partial federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, a 'disgrace.' 'You can't be an absolutist . . . life is much more complex than that,' he said. … Asked about the timing of an announcement about 2020, Bloomberg said: 'Well, I said I'd take a look at it in January, February. We're still in January.'\n\n-- Love a candidate but don't think she can win? You've been infected with Pundititis, by Ben Terris: Pundititis [is] a virus affecting the nervous system of Democratic voters that was born out of the 2016 elections. Those infected find themselves unable to fall in love with candidates, instead worrying about what theoretical swing voters may feel. Signs of Pundititis include excessive electoral mapmaking, poll testiness, and an anxious, queasy feeling that comes with picking winners and losers known as 'Cillizzasea.' If you experience any of these symptoms for three hours or more, please stop consulting your television. Although Pundititis afflicts voters, it can be deadly to politicians. And there is, perhaps, no potential presidential candidate more susceptible to its effects than [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThe commandant of the Coast Guard lambasted the ongoing shutdown and its impact on service members:\n\nA House Democrat expressed dismay over government employees working without pay:\n\nBut he then had to issue this mea culpa:\n\nA conservative commentator answered a Republican senator's rhetorical question about the shutdown:\n\nThe vice president expressed support for anti-government demonstrations in Venezuela:\n\nThe secretary of state virtually joined the World Economic Forum, per a CBS News reporter:\n\nA Post reporter panned the Brazilian president's performance at the forum:\n\nHarris's communications director tweeted a video of the candidate dancing to Cardi B:\n\nA Democratic senator and Iraq War veteran reacted to the Supreme Court's decision on transgender troops:\n\nFrom the Democratic mayor of South Bend,, Ind., an openly gay veteran and new 2020 candidate:\n\nThe Post's Fact Checker defended White House press briefings:\n\nChelsea Clinton announced she is expecting a third child:\n\nAnd some saw a possible metaphor in this road hazard near the White House:\n\nGOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE:\n\n-- Yahoo News, Operation Cobra: The untold story of how a CIA officer trained a network of agents who found the Soviet missiles in Cuba, by Sean D. Naylor: A 10-year veteran of the CIA, [Tom] Hewitt had spent the previous six months teaching the principal agent everything he knew about how to run an effective espionage network, doing all he could to mitigate the substantial risks that the agent would have to take in Fidel Castro's Cuba. The team's mission was to establish a network that could be used to gather intelligence and, if necessary, to foment counterrevolution against the Castro regime. Getting rid of Castro was a high priority for the administration of President John F. Kennedy and for the CIA.

I'm now in my mid-30s. My ex-girlfriend and I had talked about possibly adopting a child, but unfortunately that relationship broke up.\n\nHowever, I still want to adopt. The only problem is, I don't know if I should try to adopt now — or wait.\n\nI have a job, but that job pays me only when I am needed (which is rare). I have my own home and own my own vehicle, etc.\n\nAD\n\nI don't know how to bring this up to my family. I wonder what their reactions will be. I'm sort of afraid to say anything to them about it.\n\nAD\n\nMy dad was adopted, and I saw the problems he faced, and I just don't know what to do.\n\nProspective Dad\n\nProspective Dad: You seem to have put a lot of thought into this, but you don't seem to have done any research about adoption (other than writing to me). Becoming a parent (especially a single parent) is a heavy lift. It is emotionally, physically and financially taxing. It is also the greatest and most important thing you will ever do.\n\nI applaud the fact that parenthood is calling to you and hope you will answer the call.\n\nAD\n\nStart right now — by researching your options. Your local office of family and children's services would be a good first stop. Make an appointment to talk to a social worker. Ask any and all questions and take careful notes.\n\nYou might be a good candidate for fostering a child. Becoming a foster parent would give you the opportunity to see if full-time parenting is something you can tackle. You will be interviewed and educated about what is required, and you would be supported through your efforts.\n\nAD\n\nMany prospective parents enter the parenting journey through the foster-to-adopt program. This effort requires both fearlessness and faith.\n\nI hope you will also consider becoming a Big Brother. The Big Brothers Big Sisters of America program (bbbs.org) is a wonderful way for adults to connect with kids who are looking for a positive adult role model in their lives.

If I were you, I would be bewildered and upset.\n\nI'm going to assume that your daughter might be older — and that you are not encountering this coach regularly, and so there is no personal overlap between the three of you. This might account for how this news took so long to get to you.\n\nA three-year serious relationship is a major life-event not to disclose, but I don't think it is necessarily a total trust-breaker.\n\nYou should ask your husband what other minor details he neglected to share with you, pre-marriage. Does he have children you don't know about? Was he in the military, the seminary, a boy band?\n\nAD\n\nStay calm. It's time to talk.\n\nAD\n\nDear Amy: If the man who signed his letter Love Story truly wants to leave his wife for his lost love, but wants to leave gracefully, why doesn't he let his wife and children stay in their home?\n\nHe should accept his responsibility for his children's well being and leave the house to his wife and kids, if he must move on to chase happiness.\n\nDisheartened\n\nDisheartened: I agree. This man's Love Story spelled heartbreak for others.
Next, two prominent officials in the Arizona GOP, Reps. Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar, became ringleaders of a plot to overturn the election results. They have been identified as architects of last week's protest that turned into a deadly invasion of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo what is the Arizona Republican Party doing to recover? Why, it's attacking John McCain's widow.\n\nThe party just rolled out a censure resolution against Cindy McCain. Childish and bizarre, it attacks the wife of Arizona's beloved late (Republican) senator for having a past riddled with drug abuse. (She admitted three decades ago to a previous pain-medication addiction.)\n\nIt admonishes her for supporting leftist causes such as gay marriage. It scolds her for endorsing Biden, in direct opposition to … the Constitution. It upbraids her for objecting to Trump's criticism of her husband — and then it repeats such slander, saying the late senator, a war hero and POW, committed serious wrongdoing during his military service.\n\nAD\n\nThe text then says Republicans will officially censure her at their Jan. 23, 2020 Mandatory Meeting. (I'm still writing 2020 on my censure resolutions, too.)\n\nAD\n\nThe state party is apparently one-upping the Maricopa County GOP, which on Saturday censured Jeff Flake (Arizona's last elected Republican senator, who retired after denouncing Trump) but was prevented by parliamentary reasons from adding Cindy McCain to the resolution.\n\nThis follows the state party's Jan. 1 tweet announcing that we're never going back to the party of [Mitt] Romney, Flake and McCain. Thus, in one clause, did the Arizona GOP disavow both the last two Republican presidential nominees before Trump and the state's last two elected Republican senators.\n\nAD\n\nWhat next? A resolution denouncing Barry Goldwater as a socialist? Labeling Sandra Day O'Connor as antifa?\n\nThe self-destructive madness can be traced to the 2019 election of Kelli Ward (R-Wackadoodle) as state GOP chairwoman. Under the leadership of Ward — a two-time loser of Republican Senate primaries, one against McCain — the party embraced election conspiracy theories: It called for the state legislature to DE-CERTIFY the false results, and when the state's Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, an erstwhile Trump ally, defended the count, Ward tweeted that Ducey should #sthu — shut the hell up.\n\nAD\n\nCindy McCain reacted mildly to the party's attack, saying she's a proud lifelong Republican who supports candidates who put country over party.\n\nAD\n\nTV personality Meghan McCain was less tolerant of the latest attack on her parents. This is THE REAL problem facing the Arizona GOP, my mom! she tweeted. A few days after a domestic terror attack led by maniac Trump supporters.\n\nThere had been a strain of McCain antipathy within the Arizona party well before Trump, who served in the First Bone Spurs Division during Vietnam and attacked McCain's heroism for years, even posthumously. Meanwhile, a younger, multiracial electorate has been gradually turning against Republicans in the state, as in Texas, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nBut ruin accelerated with the takeover of the party by pro-Trump extremists. (Ward famously suggested in 2018 that the McCain family disclosed his imminent death because the narrative would be negative to me.) Republican operatives in 2019 were so concerned about Ward's competence — justifiably so, given the 2020 results — that they tried to circumvent the state party.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump is now spending his final days in office fomenting insurrection and giving medals to sports figures. But the Arizona GOP debacle, and the obsession with demonizing a revered, deceased leader, show the lasting damage Trump has done to the party. In place of McCain, the faces of the state party are now Gosar and Biggs, who along with Alabama's Rep. Mo Brooks allegedly organized last week's protest-turned-riot.\n\nI was the person who came up with the Jan. 6 idea with Congressman Gosar, Congressman Mo Brooks and then Congressman Andy Biggs, said Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander in a pre-event video. We four schemed up of putting max pressure on Congress while they were voting so that … we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud roar from outside.\n\nInstead, they sacked the Capitol, and five died — the latest and surest sign that the party ennobled by John McCain's patriotism has become the refuge of scoundrels.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSign up to receive my columns in your inbox as soon as they're published.\n\nThe U.S. is more politically polarized than ever.

But wait. This is where Peter Weber's season departs from the routine. One of them, he never makes it past the front door of her family's home. And he yet still keeps her around.\n\nFirst up is Hannah Ann, 23, a model from Knoxville, Tenn.\n\nAD\n\nThere's a particularly ugly convention in romantic comedies that finds the male protagonist fighting for a woman's affection by listing all the things he loves about her. Inevitably, as words spill out of his mouth, he starts enumerating behaviors that clearly irritate him, activities that are usually gendered in one way or another: He loves that she always takes exactly 53 minutes to pick out her entree, no matter how many times she's been to the restaurant. He loves that she always wears three sweaters to the office, even though her male colleagues seem just fine with the temperature. He loves that they're always late to meet his friends because she takes so long to get ready.\n\nAD\n\nNear the start of this episode, Peter does just that for Hannah Ann, though he organizes his thoughts on paper, an entreaty of affection on what appears to be a lined yellow legal pad, which is, as everyone knows, the most romantic kind of stationery. High on the list: He loves that she has a name for every dress [she's] ever worn. Does he, though?\n\nHannah Ann, to her credit, doesn't share our skepticism with the gesture. To the contrary, she so admires the trope that she had composed a similar document for him in an earlier episode. As she tells her sister, When he gave it to me I was like —. Here, her mouth hangs open. As the literary theorist Roland Barthes might put it, the pleasure of the text is clearest when it falls silent. Or when we do. Or something.\n\nAD\n\nHer father, meanwhile, is concerned with a different list — the many other women still in the running. There is other young ladies involved, he tells Peter, skepticism apparently overwhelming his capacity for ordinary grammatical speech. Attempting to reassure this nonplussed patriarch, Peter suggests that he plans to tell Hannah Ann this very night that he is falling in love with her. I wasn't expecting that, the concerned parent replies. I'd rather you not say that to her unless you mean it.\n\nAD\n\nI hear your concerns and I'll take those to heart, our protagonist responds. Soon after, he proves that he has done just that by telling Hannah Ann that he is falling for her. And she, with composure that would surely please her father, tells him in kind, And I'm in love with you.\n\nIt's all I wanted, is that validation, Peter says to the camera. In this regard, too, he is exactly like the hero of a romantic comedy.\n\nKelsey, 28, a professional clothier from Des Moines\n\nAD\n\nViewer, those are not wine grapes. Those are table grapes being stomped, crushed and danced on beneath Kelsey and Peter's feet. Iowa is not exactly known for its viticulture — and yet Kelsey takes Peter to a winery for their hometown date. Perhaps this is a chance for Kelsey to make up for her champagne crisis earlier this season, and there are moments of class. Their toes in a tub of grapes, Peter dips Kelsey as if they're gliding on a dance floor, not ankle-deep in fruit. Later, they create their own bottle of wine, which we hope is drawn from grapes untouched by toenail fungus.\n\nAD\n\nYour recappers checked in with some Des Moines residents, who confirm that many establishments in the Hawkeye state only serve Iowa wine, and it's brutal. Viewers on Twitter also were unconvinced.\n\nPeter runs with the wine analogies, describing his relationship with Kelsey as very bold with a hint of spice. It's that perfect blend that keeps you wanting to come back, he tells the camera. Which might be believable if they were in California, Oregon, even Virginia. But in Iowa, the analogies are the ultimate tell: Peter won't be subscribing to this wine club.\n\nAD\n\nPeter meets Kelsey's mother, stepdad and two sisters. He doesn't ask for Kelsey's hand in marriage. Her mother can tell Peter is at ease around Kelsey, but she's concerned, telling Peter: Don't break my girl's heart, do you understand?\n\nAD\n\nAlas, by the end of the episode that's what happens. Back in an airplane hangar in Los Angeles, Peter tells Kelsey he couldn't get to the I love you stage. She goes home.\n\nMadison, 23, a foster parent recruiter in Auburn, Ala.\n\nWhen we first met Madison back in the first episode, her father played almost as large a role in her intro video as she did. It should be no surprise that he casts an equally large shadow over her hometown visit.\n\nAD\n\nBefore he arrives, things go well: Madison takes her gentleman caller to an Auburn college basketball court where they are greeted by a prerecorded clip from alumnus Charles Barkley. The school's coach then leads them in drills where Peter struggles to dribble two balls simultaneously. And though Peter is terrible at this task, that shouldn't surprise us: He was just as bad at axe-throwing earlier in the episode. After the coach leaves, the couple makes out on the floor of the abandoned court like the last lovers after the rapture.\n\nAD\n\nBut the rapture will not come for them yet. No, first Peter must be judged, and judged he will be by her father, an elfin-featured man named Chad who kicks off Peter's visit by leading the whole family in a prayer. Madison, as her mother puts it, has made some very specific faith decisions. To put that in plainer language, she is saving herself for marriage, the ostensible endpoint of The Bachelor, though certainly not the only destination on Pilot Pete's flight plan.\n\nWell, obviously this is all happening really fast for dad, says dad when he learns that Peter has told Madison that he is falling in love with her. She's so pure, he adds, which is a totally normal thing for a dad to say about his adult daughter, probably. I just don't want you to break her heart.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike the more enthusiastic Hannah Ann, Madison seems to take her pater familias' concerns to heart, coming away from the evening unsure how to proceed. I really think I was hoping to be there. To tell Peter that I was in love with him, she says. Alas, she is not sure whether our spirits and our souls, apparently two different forms of disembodied personhood, are compatible.\n\nAD\n\nVictoria F., 26, a medical sales representative from Virginia Beach, Va.\n\nIf you hate-watch this show as much as we do, you know that there is a moment in every season of this garbage show that can break a person. That moment arrived on Peter and Victoria's date. Pete is the worst. Victoria is the worst. This season is the worst! This show is the worst. We are all the worst, for watching and enjoying it.\n\nAD\n\nPeter meets Victoria in her hometown of Virginia Beach, Va. Her black lab, Buxton, is with her, and when she jumps up on him and wraps his legs around him to make out — a move that we've deemed the koala — her dog runs away, into the ocean, without her even noticing. We are all Buxton, forever trying to escape the drama, running headlong into the tide.\n\nAnyway, they go to one of those touristy old-timey photo booths, where you put on petticoats and top hats and try not to think too hard about how long it's been since the photo place washed the costumes. They pose for a photo. Buxton is the only one who seems happy. They have ice cream and walk into a producer-arranged impromptu concert from Hunter Hayes, another country singer who, thankfully, Victoria has not dated. Somewhere, Chase Rice lets out a deep, wearied sigh.\n\nAD\n\nBut there's another dangerous ex lurking. A woman in a jean jacket approaches Peter at the concert with information about Victoria. She used to date our protagonist. Though her face is blurred out, she already came forward to US Weekly. Her name is Merissa Pence. The magazine doesn't manage to extract many more details about Victoria's crimes from her than the vague accusation Pence lobs in person, telling him: I don't think you deserve what you're on a date with right now. Victoria has allegedly broken up relationships. In US Weekly, Pence says that Victoria threatened to slash her tires.\n\nAD\n\nYears later, Peter will tell his therapist that country music, especially when performed live, is a major trigger for his anxiety.\n\nHours later, Peter arrives at Victoria's family's home with flowers, but she can sense that something is wrong.\n\nAD\n\nWhen he tells her about Merissa, she gets hostile.\n\nVictoria, do you think I enjoy this right now? Do you think there's any way I couldn't address this? She turns it back on him. You're supposed to meet MY family tonight and you decided that what Merissa told you is more important than meeting my family? she said. I'm so done with this right now, I can't do this. The last part was addressed to the producers — nothing better than when a contestant breaks the fourth wall! — and she walks away.\n\nPeter leaves without meeting her family, a Bachelor first.\n\nThey meet again at his Virginia Beach hotel, when she comes to apologize.\n\nFor some reason I can't walk away from you, she says.But you kind of do, he says. She ends it by telling him that she's falling in love with him, and giving him the old-timey photo.\n\nWhen everyone is together again in an airplane hangar for the rose ceremony, Peter gives his last rose to Victoria, despite the fact that they've spent approximately 35 percent of their short relationship fighting.\n\nShe is going to the fantasy suites, and we are going to keep hate-watching this show.
Enjoy today's Best of column from 2010.\n\nI'll be back with fresh Q and A next week.\n\nDear Amy: Recently, I virtually reconnected with a woman I knew more than 25 years ago.\n\nA few months ago, I was in her hometown and she came to my hotel. We had a few drinks and spent the night together. Recently, I was at a convention she also attended, and we spent the week together. We virtually skipped the convention and just enjoyed each other's company.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore recently, I was back in her town and we spent a few days together.\n\nWe talk about everything, share everything and have started talking about a new life together. This would entail us both leaving our spouses.\n\nWe talk every day, and know the pain this may cause, but we truly are in love and want to be with each other.\n\nWe both have high school-age children.\n\nDo I just tell my wife I am leaving her? Should I wait for a job in the new city first?\n\nI am conflicted about the how/when/where.\n\n— No Tiger\n\nNo Tiger: I've managed to stay sentimental enough about marriage that I would urge you to try to stay with — rather than flee from — your family.\n\nAll I can say is that there is no easy way to dump your family, certainly if in the course of leaving them you intend to also leave town.\n\nAD\n\nWhen faced with such a monumental life choice, it is helpful to sit down with a counselor to discuss your intentions. Try this first.\n\nAD\n\nJanuary 2010\n\nDear Amy: A long time ago, I broke off my engagement and shortly afterward married another man. We were married for more than 30 years when he died of cancer.\n\nDo you feel it would be inappropriate for me to try to contact my former fiance after 40 years? After I broke our engagement, we had no further contact.\n\nI am curious as to where life has taken him. I would like to drop him a note and offer to meet him for coffee and conversation to catch up.\n\nWhat is your opinion?\n\n— Curious\n\nCurious: My opinion is that you are lonely for companionship, and so you want to test the waters by returning to a familiar lost love.\n\nAD\n\nThis is a completely understandable impulse. I've had it myself, which is why after my long-ago divorce I dated everyone I ever knew in college.\n\nYour motives might not be completely clear to you — or your motive might be mixed — but you should be prepared for the fact that he has changed, that you have changed, and that, if he is married or in a committed relationship, he might see this contact as an unwelcome intrusion.\n\nAD\n\nYou should familiarize yourself with Facebook. Post an online profile, and then use it to get in touch with all sorts of people. The way all of our personal webs intersect, I bet it wouldn't be two weeks before he was aware of how to contact you.\n\nAD\n\nFebruary 2010\n\nDear Amy: I've had a friend from work for 25 years. We solved problems together, griped about conditions, lunched and played tennis. We retired and have remained friends, albeit with less get-together time.\n\nWell, suddenly my friend says he has to meet with a group every morning, including weekends. He is mysterious about the group, saying that he is not permitted to talk about what they do.\n\nThough I know his wife, I feel I can't ask her about this because I'm embarrassed.\n\nNow I am not permitted to talk with him during the day. No more lunches. I should let it go, but I feel as if a friendship that I valued is devalued. Do you have any idea what sort of group could have such requirements as abandoning longtime friends?\n\n— Puzzled Pal\n\nPuzzled Pal: Your friend might be attending AA meetings, religious meetings, getting dialysis treatments or playing poker. He also might want to exit the friendship, but not know how to tell you.\n\nIf you are truly worried about him, yes — you could reach out to his wife with an expression of concern.\n\nMarch 2010
Nicole Kidman in HBO's Big Little Lies. (Hilary Bronwyn Gayle/HBO)\n\nNicole Kidman. The name conjures many images and associations: the tumble of red curls and pert, blue-eyed face of the star as a young newcomer to the screen; the marriage to Tom Cruise and ensuing escape from Scientology; the lithe physique and dewy features that she wears easily to this day. But one phrase we often forget to attach to her is great actress.\n\nPerhaps because of her demeanor of self-effacing, even demure, modesty, it's been easy to underestimate Kidman over the course of a career that now spans three decades. But this week has offered a reminder of why we should prize an actress who has fashioned one of the most fascinating careers in a business notorious for pigeonholing its starlets early, keeping them boxed in and discarding them when their physical attributes show signs of sagging, bagging or otherwise naturally evolving.\n\nKidman has largely escaped that trap, as anyone who watched the recent HBO series Big Little Lies can attest. The stylish, compulsively engrossing thriller-slash-domestic-melodrama turned out to be a sleeper peak TV hit largely on the strength of its ensemble cast, which included Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Zoë Kravitz, Shailene Woodley and Kidman, who played the abused wife of a prosperous executive. Kidman — who co-produced with Witherspoon — was a standout in the series, her portrayal of a woman fighting for her own physical and psychic survival radiating shame, ambivalence, glazed confusion, determination and barely perceptible ripples of latent power. Never showy or gratuitous, it was a performance as delicate and fine-grained as the porcelain that her doll-like character, Celeste, sometimes seemed to be made of.\n\nNo sooner had Kidman delivered a powerhouse with Big Little Lies than she whipsawed her audience into another direction entirely: In Queen of the Desert, out Friday, she portrays the storied explorer, writer and photographer Gertrude Bell, a contemporary of T.E. Lawrence who traveled the Arabian Peninsula in the early 20th century and helped redraw the region's national boundaries after World War I. Written and directed by Werner Herzog with an uncharacteristically blunt and stodgily sentimental hand, Queen of the Desert isn't a great film. In fact, it's often a very bad one, its strenuous efforts to be the female version of Lawrence of Arabia notwithstanding. But none of its faults lie with Kidman, who dominates the screen in nearly every shot with regal composure and restraint (and, apparently, a generous supply of SPF-50 sunscreen).\n\n\n\nNicole Kidman as Gertrude Bell and Damian Lewis as Charles Doughty-Wylie in Queen of the Desert. (Lena Herzog/IFC Films)\n\nKidman in Lion. (Weinstein Co.)\n\nThis is a familiar dynamic in Kidman's filmography: She's made some famous duds, most recently the overbaked historical pseudo-epic Australia, the deliciously campy The Paperboy and the ill-advised Grace Kelly biopic Grace of Monaco.\n\nBut even in her worst movies, Kidman is never the problem; her performances rise above whatever dreck they're in, as if her supreme self-possession as a performer inoculated her against the toxic material she was working with. And the bad movies are relatively thin on the ground compared with the myriad triumphs: She won an Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours (we're still arguing about that nose), but that was a full seven years after her astonishing portrayal of a fame-hungry TV journalist in To Die For, in which she permanently shut up the doubters in a triumphantly crafty, satirical turn.\n\nOne need only consider Kidman's vanity-free supporting appearance in last year's Lion, alight quickly on Moulin Rouge! and The Others and go all the way back to her breakout roles in Dead Calm and Days of Thunder to appreciate the rigor and expressive range of an actress who can easily hold her own with the Meryl Streeps, Viola Davises and Cate Blanchetts of the world but is rarely mentioned in their company.\n\nRigor, range and — most crucially — curiosity: Just as admirable as the performances have been Kidman's choices when it comes to material and the filmmakers she wants to work with.\n\nEver since becoming a star, she's made small, artistically risky films that may not have had an upside where finances or fame or fan service were concerned but pushed the medium in exhilarating and sometimes strange, even alienating ways. For every conventional Hollywood production such as Cold Mountain or The Interpreter, she's made a chilly, Brechtian experiment in actorly submission, such as Lars von Trier's Dogville, or supported a still-emerging filmmaker, as in Jonathan Glazer's superb spiritual thriller Birth.\n\nNot many people saw Kidman's mesmerizing portrayal of the photographer Diane Arbus in the boundary-breaking film Fur, or her turn as a grieving mother in Rabbit Hole, or as the traumatized grown-up daughter of self-involved artists in The Family Fang. But she has become one of the industry's most valuable and adventurous side players, a headliner who — Q Scores and likability be damned — leverages her gifts and box-office pull in service to pushing the art form forward. It should surprise no one that her upcoming projects include the edgy, feminist TV mystery series Top of the Lake and films with Sofia Coppola and the Greek provocateur Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster).\n\n\n\nNicole Kidman in Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus. (Abbot Genser/Picturehouse via WireImage)\n\nKidman as Virginia Woolf in The Hours. (Clive Coote/AP)\n\nLast year, writing about actress Isabelle Huppert in the New Republic, the critic Miriam Bale noted that in the movie Elle, Huppert herself became an auteur, her craft and potent persona transcending the material and taking a hand in creating the movie that was every bit as crucial as the director's. The same, writ even larger, could be said for Kidman, whose shrewd auteurist eye is revealed not just in one movie but through the arc of her career. In an industry dedicated to escapism, shallow reassurance and dumbing down, she has single-mindedly pursued thoughtfulness, intelligence and risk, as an actor and a producer. (Check out the flawed, weird but wonderfully woman-centric erotic thriller In the Cut for an early example of the latter.)\n\nIt's nothing new for actresses to search out envelopes to push, edges to explore or boundaries to transgress in the name of publicity, stretching or simply staying relevant. In Kidman's case, her finest performance may be a cumulative one, far outstripping the workaday job of taking a character from the page to the stage. Her genius is just as strategic as it is technical, in how she's consistently leveraged stardom on behalf of growth, taste and sophistication. With her preternatural technical and physical gifts, she easily could have been sleepwalking through the past 30 years.

I want to be respectful of how people choose to refer to themselves, but the grammarian in me cannot tolerate using they'' or them'' to refer to a single person. Thus, I find myself sticking to the person's name only, as in How long will Jordan be in Wisconsin?'' Does Miss Manners, in her sagacity, have any suggestions for a better gender-fluid pronoun?\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou are kind to believe that Miss Manners can solve this problem, but this is a rare case in which she would like to appeal to her Gentle Readers for help.\n\nYou have stated the ground rules:\n\nBe respectful of others. In this case, it means not using masculine or feminine pronouns for those who object.\n\nDo not refer to a person as it.''\n\nResist using plural pronouns when referring to a single person.\n\nSo far, the solution has been to go around the problem: Make the subject plural, when possible, to use they'' correctly, or use he or she'' with single nouns. But this is getting tedious and doesn't cover everybody. What we need is something simple that can be easily learned, so that no one is confused or insulted.\n\nAD\n\nSo would someone please come up with a solution?\n\nDear Miss Manners: What is the appropriate way to address a couple who are technically engaged but have no plans to marry?\n\nAD\n\nFor example, one couple I know has been engaged for many years (including a ring), but have subsequently moved on with all significant milestones outside of marriage — home, children, major life changes, etc. No mention of marriage arrangements have come up since the initial engagement. So is it still appropriate to refer to them as one another's fiance(e)''?\n\nOr does using the term fiance(e)'' run the risk of sounding insulting, since it seems to highlight an unmet promise?\n\nWhat did they promise you? A weekend of lavish festivities?\n\nAD\n\nIt seems to Miss Manners that such a couple alone can define the relationship. If they are affianced, they must mean something slightly different from the term now available to committed but unmarried couples, who call themselves partners. Meanwhile, the rest of us should look for our champagne elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nDear Miss Manners: Do salad and dinner forks go on top of the napkin, or between the plate and napkin on the table itself?\n\nThe latter. As the first thing to do when sitting at table is to put the napkin on one's lap, Miss Manners would not run the risk of someone's not noticing the flatware and sending it crashing to the floor.\n\nNew Miss Manners columns are posted Monday through Saturday on washingtonpost.com/advice.

Friday's incident near the Lincoln Memorial in which a group of high school boys confronted an elderly Native American man sent a ripple of fear and anger across the country. The image of a group of high school boys clad in Make America Great Again hats, smirking and laughing resurfaced tensions that have been simmering since President Trump's campaign began. At one point, some reportedly chanted, Build the wall! though such chants are not audible on widely circulated video.\n\nWhile the general assumption is that younger Americans are more liberal, and therefore less likely to support Trump, we noted earlier this year that young white men are the only members of the millennial generation — generally but informally defined as those born between 1980 and 2000 — who lean more Republican than Democrat. Millennial men and millennial women tend to identify as Democrats more heavily, as do millennial whites and nonwhites.\n\nBut among white millennial men, the picture is different.\n\nThese kids on the Mall, though, aren't millennials. They're members of a younger generation that doesn't have a broadly accepted name. The previous administration dubbed them the Homeland Generation, but a recent survey from Pew Research Center labeled them Generation Z — presumably following Generation X and Generation Y, an early name for millennials. (The groups are defined here.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore importantly, Pew also dug into the political views of that group, born in 1996 or later by Pew's definition. The group mostly mirrors the generally liberal social politics of the millennials. In data provided to The Washington Post, though, we see this holds true even among the white men in the generation.\n\nConsider the question of whether respondents think racial and ethnic diversity is good, bad or makes no difference. Nearly 6 in 10 white males who are in Generation Z hold the view that racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing, vs. fewer than 4 in 10 white males born before 1946 (the Silent Generation, per Pew's labels). The drop-off is similar across Gen Z groups, but only among white men are the oldest members more likely to say diversity makes little difference than that it's a good thing.\n\n(There aren't enough nonwhites in the Silent Generation to be statistically significant, which is itself telling.)\n\nOr another question related to race: Which group is treated less fairly, blacks or whites? Gen Z white males are far more likely to say black Americans are treated less fairly, even compared to Generation X, those born from 1965 to 1980 under Pew's definition.\n\nWhite males in Gen Z and who are millennials are more likely to say government should do more to solve problems. The change over time here is stark, with responses among white men inverting neatly as the respondent gets older.\n\nPew's research on the generation established a lot of comfort among members of the generation on LGBTQ issues. The oldest whites who spoke to Pew saw same-sex marriage as a bad thing; the youngest, including young white males, disagreed.\n\nMind you, on these four subjects, white males generally offered more conservative views than their peers. But compared particularly to older white men, their views on diversity and racial bias were starkly different.\n\nIt's clear from Friday's incident on the Mall that the young men who confronted the Native American protester had somehow internalized that their behavior was acceptable. It's hard to read from that one scenario how they look at issues of race more broadly. But if part of the incident on the Mall reflected opposition to diversity, those views would be in the minority.
I want to adopt so badly, Tebow said to People. I can't wait. It's definitely something I see in my future.\n\nYou know what I think would be awesome? If I could adopt a kid from every continent. I think that would be a pretty cool goal, he said. I want to sit around the dinner table every night and see kids from Africa, Asia, Europe, South America, right here in the States. How cool would that be? It's one of my favorite things to dream about.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTechnically, Tebow omitted Antarctica, which is understandable, and Australia, which is a bit more odd, given that he has a close connection to the relatively nearby Philippines. Also, some scientists are pushing for the recognition of an eighth continent, Zealandia, so Tebow might need to further expand his brood.\n\nWhile the 29-year-old former Heisman winner is single, he is looking for a woman to share his life, one who checks off a few boxes. Of course I want a woman who I'm attracted to, he said. That's a very big part of it. But I'm looking for someone who loves Jesus and loves people. Someone who makes me want to be a better person for her.\n\nAnd she has to want kids, and has to want to adopt. That's a requirement.\n\nAD\n\nTebow's faith has led him to proclaim an intention to abstain from sex before marriage, which reportedly was a factor in a 2015 breakup between him and a former Miss Universe, Olivia Culpo. It wasn't clear from his comments to People if Tebow plans on having kids of his own, but he clearly wants a diverse family.
