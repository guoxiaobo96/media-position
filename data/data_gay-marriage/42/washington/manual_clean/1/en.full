{"original": "No presentation of masculinity — not Buttigieg's, and not Trump's — is a salubrious thing. It's all toxic. But there's a key difference. Trump's idea of manliness involves degrading women, threatening violence against racial and religious and sexual minorities, and using false and superficial displays of strength (Who's the loudest? Who's the meanest? Who's sleeping with the hottest women? Who's making other people look small?) to overcome self-doubt and feel big. By contrast, men who take the stoic approach, stifling their emotions and anything that smacks of stereotypical femininity, mostly harm themselves; acting like Gary Cooper can eat you up from the inside. But on a general-election stage, against Trump's primordial displays of dominance, the style that Buttigieg fashioned in the closet might serve him well, especially combined with the relative freedom he's found in the few years since. That's partly because his only real insecurity in life, it appears, has been about his queerness; intellectually, politically and morally, Buttigieg betrays almost too much self-confidence.

With Reno, what's notable is that both things happen. Some days she's Schwarzenegger; some days she's Xena; nobody can decide. In part, this may be a particularly American problem. Unlike countries with a tradition of queens or women occupying positions of feudal power, America has no cultural memory of powerful women. Look back into American history and whom do you come up with? Jane Addams? Betsy Ross? No one really seems to do, so the culture flounders for archetypes and keeps coming up with men. It was strictly based on the fact that she is – at least that she appears – physically big. And her demeanor appears to be kind of kick-ass. Six foot three, tanned, golden-haired, stubbled, wearing a jacket and khakis and not looking faintly like the attorney general, Saturday Night Live actor Will Ferrell is sitting in a borrowed office in the NBC building at Rockefeller Center.

Another Web site, titled The Many Mellow Moods of Janet Reno, is frankly and rudely sexual, referring to a sensuous beast that lurks within the Attorney General's wacky two-piece cotton blend suits, and offering a number of stock newspaper photos accompanied by lurid captions. In contrast, a search of Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen – the only Cabinet member whose name appears on the Web more often than hers – yields entries like Secretary of Defense Earth Day Message and Slide Image: Defense Reform Initiative. Hence the paradox of Janet Reno. The woman famous for saying, I don't do spin, has been spun over and over again. Reno herself takes a benign view of all this.

Some day, both sides agree, the issue is headed for a big court test case. Early polling shows that about six in 10 Californians support Knight's ballot initiative. But this will be a hard-fought and potentially divisive campaign--with each side promising to spend dollar for dollar, possibly as much as $10 million. Opposing the initiative is a San Francisco-based group calling itself No on Knight. They argue that the initiative is unnecessary, unfair, divisive and intrusive. Mike Marshall, the campaign manager for No on Knight, says that he believes the initiative is the beginning of an assault on gay rights in California and around the nation. In the last legislative session in Sacramento, where Democrats control the state government, gays and lesbians won a windfall of protective measures, from extension of domestic partner benefits to including sexual orientation in anti-harassment laws. Clearly, the radical right is using this issue to mobilize their conservative base, Marshall said. Supporters of the marriage measure have contributed almost $4 million so far--and much of the money has come from religious groups.

He firmly rejects the Great Marxisant fallacy, according to which any revolution worthy of the name can be conducted only by a class intent upon overthrowing the whole of bourgeois society and culture; it was this fallacy that inspired Herbert Marcuse to create a new revolutionary class, composed of students, blacks and other marginalized and disaffected groups. Marwick's own methodological explanation is more complex and sophisticated (so complex and sophisticated, perhaps, as to offer little practical guidance): Cultural and social change, while influenced by human agency, by contingency and convergence, takes place within the opportunities offered, and the constraints imposed, by structural, ideological, and institutional circumstances. Like a good disinterested historian, he also professes to reject the familiar ideological interpretations of the '60s: the radical view that sees it as a movement of social and sexual liberation, a boon to blacks, women, gays and other oppressed minorities; and the conservative view that harps on such disagreeable matters as the increase of crime and violence and an assault upon the universities and rational inquiry. Marwick does not, to be sure, refrain from judgment. Instead he couches his judgments in the familiar If . . . but, on the one hand . . . on the other hand mode.

In the same way, he argues, this new legislation reifies a biological theory of binary sex to obscure the way these bills authorize discrimination against transgender people.

As a result of the lawsuit, the government identified about 2,700 separated children in federal custody as of June, some of them infants and toddlers. … Although previous administrations also separated minors at the border in some instances — usually when they suspected the child was smuggled, or if the parent appeared unfit — the report said the practice appears far more common under Trump and began nearly a year before administration officials publicly acknowledged it.", "augmented": []}

She's more recognizable and even, possibly, more interesting to some people because she's a woman. Yet the flip side is the over-scrutiny that goes with being the first woman anything – much less the first woman in the top cop role, a role that naturally attracts, for its first female occupant, over-expectation, a narrower path, a narrower tolerance for mistakes, says Laura Liswood, executive director of the Council of Women World Leaders, an association of current and former female presidents and prime ministers at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. Feminist academics would say that it's also common for women in power to be sexualized the way Reno has been.

Though Reno has advanced the cause of women at the Justice Department, in keeping with her stated intent to hire based on excellence and diversity, she has tended to surround herself with women who think of themselves more as individualists than as feminists, who prefer not to make an issue of gender, to keep their heads down and work. In her approach, she's also strikingly different from the other controversial woman in the Clinton administration, the other woman who has jokes and Web sites devoted to her hair and her sexuality, the other woman who has appeared on a tabloid cover in a bathing suit (and another time, holding a space alien baby): Hillary Clinton.

His participation in the legal assault on Obamacare was hatched at — where else? — the Federalist Society's national convention in the fall of 2009, where, in the hallway of the Mayflower Hotel between sessions, he happened to bump into a clutch of fellow Federalists discussing the health-care legislation.

{"original": "Her explanation is that originally the title referred to the attorney who did general work for the crown, general in the sense of general store. So I am an adjective, she likes to say, not a noun. The adjective settles into a love seat under a window in her office, and motions toward a chair nearby. In her low-key clothes and straightforward demeanor she comes across as what linguists would call unmarked. An unmarked expression is a neutral one, an expression that attracts no notice. To say Do you feel well? is neutral, unmarked; to say Do you feel bad? is unusual; it's marked. Similarly, an unmarked person is a person who blends in, who avoids standing out. It's easy for men to be unmarked – wear a dark suit, keep your hair trimmed – but more difficult for women. If you wear makeup and short shirts and high heels, that's one form of marking, but if you don't gussy yourself up, you're a marked woman, too, you're making a statement. Which may be why Reno's appearance attracts so much attention. Many women in politics go ahead and mark themselves – with bright red jackets, bright green suits, bright gold accessories. Reno takes the opposite approach: short haircut, staid predictable dress, no jewelry save for a watch and a pair of modest earrings, no makeup except a faint trace of lipstick, no rings or nail polish on her graceful white hands.

They are even grudging in applying it to political events (was the English Revolution of 1688 a revolution or merely a restoration? ), still more so to social or cultural events. And still more to social or cultural events in their own time. Surely a longer perspective (the famous long view that historians are supposed to cultivate) will dissipate the effect of ephemeral experiences and reveal the continuity behind ostensibly dramatic changes. Yet occasionally, very occasionally, historians are privileged (or doomed) to live through real revolutions, even social and cultural ones. Arthur Marwick, a professor of history at the Open University in England, maintains that the 1960s witnessed one such revolution.

In the United States, courts can choose the standard they will use to determine whether a law is constitutional. If a law violates a fundamental right, such as free speech or the 14th Amendment, it will apply the highest standard of review, known as strict scrutiny.

It's because of her height; I don't read anything into it, says Carl Stern, former Justice Department public affairs director, who has consented to watch a videotape of the SNL Simba skit as a way of talking about Reno's public image – something that was, in a sense, his responsibility until he left the department in 1996.

More likely, her demeanor is in many ways the legacy of her mother, Jane Wood Reno. Jane Reno, a newspaperwoman for the old Miami News, was a woman who lived large in the way that many American communities permit and Washington, mostly, doesn't: She loved the outdoors, she scuba-dived and went on days-long seaside hikes and swam naked, she built the Reno house with her own hands, she got stopped for drunk driving, she collected eccentric characters as family friends. She let the wind and the weather age her naturally; photos of her in later years show a woman, worn and wrinkled, full of character, full of interest. This last characteristic, this unadorned quality, this respect for one's natural face, seems to be a legacy that Reno has inherited. At the same time, she notes, Mother and I were different in so many ways. Her mother was, to use a Southern expression, a catbird; Reno isn't. Instead, what you see when you see her is the girl in high school who sits in the front row. The responsible one, as her sister says; the one who sat on her siblings when they misbehaved.

Women, often, are polarizing, says political consultant Carter Eskew, something that will come as no surprise to working mothers, or to stay-at-home mothers, or to single mothers, or to unmarried women, or to women without children. Everybody has an opinion about the most personal choices a woman can make, and naturally these opinions get translated to the public arena. Reno thus remains an easy target despite her Olympian disregard of the rumormongers. In Washington, moreover, she also unnerves people because she is so introverted, such an inveterate non-schmoozer.

None of this, White marvels, has changed the way women are depicted and seen – in Washington, or really anywhere. Does anyone, White asks rhetorically, talk about what Orrin Hatch wears?

{"original": "Clinton in the highly symbolic, conventionally feminine role of first lady has one redoubtable host of expectations to cope with, and Reno, in the traditionally masculine role of top cop, has another. And both have coped in very different ways. Unlike Reno, Hillary Clinton came to Washington as a feminist networker, surrounded herself with women who made gender an issue first and foremost. Unlike Reno, she has at times attempted to parry the fulminators publicly. The response to her infamous 1992 campaign remark, I suppose I could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas, shows how risky it can be to answer the critics on their own terms. In a sense, Reno's head-down stance is consistent with her whole attitude toward publicity, which is to say: Go forward, do your work, don't make a lot of noise, don't spin. Whenever political appointees come to Washington, it's necessary to make a decision about how and whether to participate in the image-management industry. Madeleine Albright, for example, is one Cabinet member who pays close attention to how she looks and who she knows and how she's portrayed. In contrast, when Reno came to Justice she didn't even want a press office (in Miami, she fielded reporters' calls herself). When it became clear she had to have one, she chose Stern, a former law correspondent for NBC, to head it, with the idea that his natural inclination would be to distribute information rather than spin.

But it also contains stringent changes to the nation's asylum rules, and Democrats who were already united against funding Trump's wall described these asylum provisions Tuesday as a new poison pill. The Democrats' plan is a stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through Feb. 8 without providing any new money for the wall.

The team's mission was to establish a network that could be used to gather intelligence and, if necessary, to foment counterrevolution against the Castro regime. Getting rid of Castro was a high priority for the administration of President John F. Kennedy and for the CIA.
