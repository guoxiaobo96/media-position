-- A group of progressive Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), secured seats on the House Oversight Committee, giving them a platform to grill Trump administration officials in a wide variety of investigations. Politico's Andrew Desiderio and Heather Caygle report: [Ocasio-Cortez], Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) won spots on the high-profile committee on Tuesday … Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the chairman of the Oversight Committee, dismissed concerns about the outspoken freshman lawmakers. 'If I based the choices going on the committee based on what people said or their reputations or whatever, I probably wouldn't have a committee,' Cummings said.
In addition to tax breaks for low-income workers, Northam wants to increase spending on teacher salaries, mental-health services and other state programs.
These kids on the Mall, though, aren't millennials. They're members of a younger generation that doesn't have a broadly accepted name. The previous administration dubbed them the Homeland Generation, but a recent survey from Pew Research Center labeled them Generation Z — presumably following Generation X and Generation Y, an early name for millennials. (The groups are defined here.)
New Oregon legislation would put a moratorium on building mega-dairies. What happens next?  by The Counter's H. Claire Brown: Advocates worry that Biden's selection of former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack to lead the Department of Agriculture may signal a reticence to take bold action to regulate factory farms because the agency under Obama ultimately did little to curb emissions or blunt the power of the biggest meatpacking companies.
Stephen Colbert mocked the Supreme Court's decision to reinstate the transgender troop restrictions:
I had a different bishop. I hoped the system might respond differently, she said.
Liz Cheney, 54, has been a member of the House of Representatives for only four years, coinciding with Trump's presidency. But she rose in meteoric fashion to the top ranks of GOP leadership after just one term representing Wyoming, leaving admirers and enemies in her wake.
7. Despite growing awareness of cyber threats and improving cyber defenses, nearly all information, communication networks, and systems will be at risk for years to come. Our adversaries are becoming more adept at using cyberspace capabilities to threaten our interests and advance their own strategic and economic objectives. Cyber threats will pose an increasing risk to public health, safety, and prosperity as information technologies are integrated into critical infrastructure, vital national networks, and consumer devices.

The Justice Department inspector general is examining the abrupt departure earlier this month of U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak, who departed after Trump complained that Georgia officials weren't doing enough to find election fraud, Matt Zapotosky reports. DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz's investigation appears to be in its early stages.
It also comes as Biden makes an all-out push to tackle to the pandemic, issuing executive orders to increase mask-wearing and implementing a national strategy to expand access to testing and vaccines.
After being informed of the president's tirade by her father, Cheney walked out on the House floor, still hoping to stop the effort backed by Trump to overturn the electoral college votes. Then she heard a mob banging on the chamber's doors and a shot fired, and realized that an attempted insurrection was underway. She hustled to a secure location and later called Fox News.
Cheney's memo was hailed by Democrats. But the advice was not heeded by the vast majority of those in Cheney's caucus, as 139 out of 211 House Republicans voted to challenge electoral college votes from Arizona, Pennsylvania or both.
And I learned a lot from it, he continued. What I learned is that you can't say hurtful things about people, period. No matter where you are or who you are talking to.
At least hundreds of National Guard troops were forced to sleep in parking garages after being booted Thursday from the U.S. Capitol complex following their job to secure Biden's inauguration in the wake of the Jan. 6 riots. I've never in my entire career felt like I've been booted onto the curb and told, 'Figure it out on your own,'  said one of the soldiers, who said he served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some troops are headed home, while others have apparently been returned to the Capitol complex, after an uproar on social media.
The state party is apparently one-upping the Maricopa County GOP, which on Saturday censured Jeff Flake (Arizona's last elected Republican senator, who retired after denouncing Trump) but was prevented by parliamentary reasons from adding Cindy McCain to the resolution.
On Jan. 20, Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, reflected on his time under former president Donald Trump. (The Washington Post)
This follows the state party's Jan. 1 tweet announcing that we're never going back to the party of [Mitt] Romney, Flake and McCain. Thus, in one clause, did the Arizona GOP disavow both the last two Republican presidential nominees before Trump and the state's last two elected Republican senators.
Nicole Kidman. The name conjures many images and associations: the tumble of red curls and pert, blue-eyed face of the star as a young newcomer to the screen; the marriage to Tom Cruise and ensuing escape from Scientology; the lithe physique and dewy features that she wears easily to this day. But one phrase we often forget to attach to her is great actress.
Stuart Stevens, a political consultant who worked with Liz Cheney during both Bush-Cheney campaigns and recently wrote a book in which he predicted she would run for president, said she has become the de facto leader of the Republican Party, which he said should be distinguished from what he called the pro-Trump authoritarian party.
The other flourish was the reimagining of the traditional wreath-laying at Arlington National Cemetery, usually a more low-key affair, to compensate for the absence of the parade that usually stretches from the Capitol to the White House after the president's swearing-in. The 2021 version, rather than just featuring the outgoing president and vice president, included Biden, Vice President Harris, Bill and Hillary Clinton, George W. and Laura Bush, and Barack and Michelle Obama.
One need only consider Kidman's vanity-free supporting appearance in last year's Lion, alight quickly on Moulin Rouge! and The Others and go all the way back to her breakout roles in Dead Calm and Days of Thunder to appreciate the rigor and expressive range of an actress who can easily hold her own with the Meryl Streeps, Viola Davises and Cate Blanchetts of the world but is rarely mentioned in their company.
By September 2015, a New York architect had completed plans for a bold glass obelisk 100 stories high, to be topped by a gleaming, cut-diamond–like shape emblazoned on multiple sides with the Trump logo. … The Trump team would also have the option to 'brand all or any portion of the spa or fitness facilities' as 'The Spa By Ivanka Trump,' according to the plans. … The top residence of the Moscow tower, enjoying a view without equal in all the continent, was to be a gleaming penthouse, the most luxurious property in a seriously luxurious building. A show-stopping apartment like that could have been marketed for $50 million. But as BuzzFeed News reported in November, Trump's fixers planned not to sell it — but to give it away for free, to none other than Vladimir Putin himself.
Gathered to watch President Biden take the oath of office and film a message emphasizing the ceremony's importance to the republic, they also recorded a PSA [public service announcement] aimed at building confidence in the safety and efficacy of the covid vaccine, one of the sources said. That message will be released in the coming weeks, the source added. Another source said the PSA was a work in progress and confirmed the rough timetable.
TV personality Meghan McCain was less tolerant of the latest attack on her parents. This is THE REAL problem facing the Arizona GOP, my mom! she tweeted. A few days after a domestic terror attack led by maniac Trump supporters.
Two complaints were filed against Ensz after he conducted the wedding, including from the Rev. Amanda Miller Garber, pastor of Rise Church in Harrisonburg, Va., who herself had conducted a same-sex ceremony in 2014 (she was suspended without pay for a month). Disciplinary actions are worked out at the local level, and Miller said that she thought if she filed a friendly complaint, Ensz might be dealt with less harshly.

Thursday's planned votes are a product of an agreement between [Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer]. But even as the leaders announced the deal, they traded barbs in speeches on the Senate floor. McConnell accused Democrats of rejecting a reasonable proposal from Trump because of political opposition to the president, and Schumer argued that Republicans and Trump were operating in bad faith by including new asylum curbs and failing to consult with Democrats.
Republicans say the chances Trump will be convicted in his next impeachment trial are plummeting. A maximum of five or six GOP senators may vote for impeachment, the Hill reports. I thought if he pardoned people who had been part of this invasion of the Capitol, that would have pushed the number higher because that would have said, 'These are my guys,' said one Republican senator. Another said Trump's supporters would be very upset if the party moved to convict him, a base the GOP needs ahead of the 2022 midterms.
-- Lawmakers agreed … to more show votes that probably won't end the government shutdown. The Senate will vote tomorrow on competing measures from Trump and Democrats. Both are expected to fail. Erica Werner, John Wagner and Jeff Stein report: The result could be only to prove that some other solution is needed to end the partial shutdown, even as 800,000 federal workers face the loss of a second straight paycheck Friday. Trump's proposal, which the president announced in a weekend speech from the White House, would open the government through Sept. 30 while providing $5.7 billion for a border wall and giving temporary deportation protections to about 1 million unauthorized immigrants. But it also contains stringent changes to the nation's asylum rules, and Democrats who were already united against funding Trump's wall described these asylum provisions Tuesday as a new poison pill. The Democrats' plan is a stopgap spending bill that would fund the government through Feb. 8 without providing any new money for the wall. That would let both parties negotiate on border security while the government is reopened, a respite Democrats have been demanding. …
Monday is Buy American  day, and Biden will sign an order beefing up requirements for government purchases of U.S. goods and services.
-- Yahoo News, Operation Cobra: The untold story of how a CIA officer trained a network of agents who found the Soviet missiles in Cuba, by Sean D. Naylor: A 10-year veteran of the CIA, [Tom] Hewitt had spent the previous six months teaching the principal agent everything he knew about how to run an effective espionage network, doing all he could to mitigate the substantial risks that the agent would have to take in Fidel Castro's Cuba. The team's mission was to establish a network that could be used to gather intelligence and, if necessary, to foment counterrevolution against the Castro regime. Getting rid of Castro was a high priority for the administration of President John F. Kennedy and for the CIA. Hewitt knew this was an important mission, but he could not have imagined that his team would soon play a vital role in preventing nuclear Armageddon.
-- Love a candidate but don't think she can win? You've been infected with Pundititis, by Ben Terris: Pundititis [is] a virus affecting the nervous system of Democratic voters that was born out of the 2016 elections. Those infected find themselves unable to fall in love with candidates, instead worrying about what theoretical swing voters may feel. Signs of Pundititis include excessive electoral mapmaking, poll testiness, and an anxious, queasy feeling that comes with picking winners and losers known as 'Cillizzasea.' If you experience any of these symptoms for three hours or more, please stop consulting your television. Although Pundititis afflicts voters, it can be deadly to politicians. And there is, perhaps, no potential presidential candidate more susceptible to its effects than [Sen. Elizabeth] Warren.
John Lomperis, a United Methodist who advocates with the traditionalist Protestant group Institute on Religion and Democracy, said that the bishop and Ensz might agree to a just resolution, which is like an out-of-court settlement.
In his speech, Northam pitched tax and budget plans that hinge on using $1.2 billion in new revenue that the state expects to collect as a result of last year's federal tax overhaul. He also urged the GOP-controlled legislature to consider his plans to address gun violence — legislation that Republicans snuffed out last year.
When the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia criticized ruler Hun Sen for cracking down on the opposition and the media, the authoritarian leader pointed out that Trump had his back — not the diplomats.
Trump had feuded with Cheney's father, saying in 2011 that I didn't like Cheney when he was a vice president. Here's a guy that did a rotten job as vice president. Nobody liked him.
And some saw a possible metaphor in this road hazard near the White House:
For all the bipartisan niceties of opening day, political reality settled in quickly. The House Appropriations Committee wasted no time brushing off the governor's proposed amendments to the state's $117 billion biennial budget.

-- Washington will start to see rain tonight that will last into tomorrow. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: High pressure centered offshore and our next system approaching from the west combine for a slightly milder flow from the south. After a significantly less frigid start in the 20s to near 30, temperatures rise into the upper 30s to mid-40s this afternoon under partly to mostly cloudy skies, with winds from the south around 10 mph. Can't rule out a spotty afternoon shower or two, but most of the rain looks to hold off until late tonight.
It's nothing new for actresses to search out envelopes to push, edges to explore or boundaries to transgress in the name of publicity, stretching or simply staying relevant. In Kidman's case, her finest performance may be a cumulative one, far outstripping the workaday job of taking a character from the page to the stage. Her genius is just as strategic as it is technical, in how she's consistently leveraged stardom on behalf of growth, taste and sophistication. With her preternatural technical and physical gifts, she easily could have been sleepwalking through the past 30 years. Instead, she's chosen to keep her eyes wide open.
Cox included a nod to Del. ­Eileen Filler-Corn (D-Fairfax), whom Democrats chose as the first female caucus leader in our history, he said, to raucous applause.

More importantly, Pew also dug into the political views of that group, born in 1996 or later by Pew's definition. The group mostly mirrors the generally liberal social politics of the millennials. In data provided to The Washington Post, though, we see this holds true even among the white men in the generation.
A Post reporter panned the Brazilian president's performance at the forum:
What next? A resolution denouncing Barry Goldwater as a socialist? Labeling Sandra Day O'Connor as antifa?
But he then had to issue this mea culpa:
Tuesday night, Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) called for Cheney to step down as the chair of the House Republican Conference. She is weakening our conference at a key moment for personal political gain and is unfit to lead, he said in a statement.
At the same time, he said, the decision will prompt Republicans who disagree with her decision to consider whether there should be political consequences for her internally.
In 2016, Cheney sought Wyoming's lone U.S. House seat, which her father had once held. After winning the seat, Cheney's ambition was to become one of the most powerful women on Capitol Hill.
The Vikings also noted then that the ban could be reduced to two games if Priefer attended sensitivity training, and when he was reinstated after the first two weeks of the 2014 season, the team said it was informed that he had been fully and thoughtfully engaged throughout the process and successfully completed the [training] program.
She won the post by arguing that Republicans needed to change their messaging and be more aggressive. Soon she was launching all-out assaults, saying in March 2019 on NBC's Meet the Press that Democrats were the party of anti-Semitism, the party of infanticide, the party of socialism.
-- The shutdown has forced Trump to sideline the rest of his agenda. The New York Times's Peter Baker reports: The standoff has already forced Mr. Trump to cancel a trip to Europe to meet with global business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, at a time when the world economy faces a possible slowdown. The president has made no evident progress in filling a series of senior vacancies nor has he produced the tax-cutting plan he promised last year. He has done nothing in weeks to publicly promote priorities like fighting opioid abuse or bolstering the economy.

-- The South Carolina primary is taking on outsize significance in the 2020 Democratic nominating fight. The New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Astead W. Herndon report: The primary here may still be 405 days away and only fourth on the calendar of early-nominating states, behind Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. But at a time when [Trump] has stoked racial divisions and black voters have become an increasingly crucial Democratic constituency, South Carolina is already looming larger at the outset of this race than in any recent Democratic nominating contest. … The winner here will enter the March 3 Super Tuesday contests with a burst of momentum.

-- Behind the scenes, Trump's communications team is struggling to convey a consistent message on the shutdown amid an ongoing power struggle. CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak report: The lack of a cohesive strategy emanating from the White House communications team has frustrated people throughout the West Wing who have deemed the press shop 'irrelevant' ... according to interviews with several current and former White House officials. No one has emerged as the clear leader among Sarah Sanders, Bill Shine, Kellyanne Conway or Mercedes Schlapp, leading to deep divisions among one of the administration's most fractious departments and causing a void for a coverage-obsessed president. The communications team has also drawn the ire of dozens of senior staffers, including Trump at times, who have blamed them for failing to blunt PR missteps and allowing them to turn into full-blown disasters.
Richard Cheney, meanwhile, said in February 2016 that Trump sounded like a liberal Democrat and that he would not endorse him. But two months later, CNN reported that Cheney was breaking with the two former Bush presidents, who did not support Trump, and endorsed him at a time when the candidate had all but wrapped up the nomination.
Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, the nominee for energy secretary; Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Biden's nominee for U.N. ambassador, and Denis McDonough, the nominee for the Department of Veterans Affairs, will testify before the Senate on Wednesday morning.

The report also stated that the special teams coach initially denied to investigators that he made any inappropriate remarks about the LGBTQ community or marriage equality, and that he categorically denied making the nuke comment. However, when presented with Loeffler's recollection, Priefer said he was not going to disagree with it.
Ever since becoming a star, she's made small, artistically risky films that may not have had an upside where finances or fame or fan service were concerned but pushed the medium in exhilarating and sometimes strange, even alienating ways. For every conventional Hollywood production such as Cold Mountain or The Interpreter, she's made a chilly, Brechtian experiment in actorly submission, such as Lars von Trier's Dogville, or supported a still-emerging filmmaker, as in Jonathan Glazer's superb spiritual thriller Birth.

'The Stop STUPIDITY Act takes the aggressive but necessary step of forcing the president and Congress to do the jobs they were elected to do,' Warner said in a statement. ... The full name of Warner's measure is the 'Stop Shutdowns Transferring Unnecessary Pain and Inflicting Damage in the Coming Years Act.'

In recent weeks, she has taken a back seat to the stepped-up efforts of Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
The concern I have, and something we're working on, is getting people who have vaccine hesitancy, who don't want to get vaccinated — because many people are skeptical about that. So we really need to do a lot of good outreach for that, he said in a White House briefing.

Traditional adversaries will continue attempts to gain and assert influence, taking advantage of changing conditions in the international environment — including the weakening of the post-WWII international order and dominance of Western democratic ideals, increasingly isolationist tendencies in the West, and shifts in the global economy.

-- Ocasio-Cortez Builds a National Platform, but a District Office? Not Open Yet, by the New York Times's J. David Goodman: In three short weeks in office, [Ocasio-Cortez] has shaped a national conversation on taxation, emerged as the face of a green jobs plan in Washington and elevated her initials into a worldwide brand. But she has not yet opened an office in her own New York City district — a delay that may give a sense of her priorities early in her tenure. During an appearance on 'The Late Show With Stephen Colbert' on Monday, she blamed the government shutdown. … But the shutdown has not had a similar effect on other first-term Congress members from New York State.
On Wednesday, the committee passed the bill on an 8-to-6 vote, with two Republicans among the yeas: the panel's chair, Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (Fauquier); and Sen. William R. DeSteph Jr. (Virginia Beach).
No sooner had Kidman delivered a powerhouse with Big Little Lies than she whipsawed her audience into another direction entirely: In Queen of the Desert, out Friday, she portrays the storied explorer, writer and photographer Gertrude Bell, a contemporary of T.E. Lawrence who traveled the Arabian Peninsula in the early 20th century and helped redraw the region's national boundaries after World War I. Written and directed by Werner Herzog with an uncharacteristically blunt and stodgily sentimental hand, Queen of the Desert isn't a great film. In fact, it's often a very bad one, its strenuous efforts to be the female version of Lawrence of Arabia notwithstanding. But none of its faults lie with Kidman, who dominates the screen in nearly every shot with regal composure and restraint (and, apparently, a generous supply of SPF-50 sunscreen).

Trump is now spending his final days in office fomenting insurrection and giving medals to sports figures. But the Arizona GOP debacle, and the obsession with demonizing a revered, deceased leader, show the lasting damage Trump has done to the party. In place of McCain, the faces of the state party are now Gosar and Biggs, who along with Alabama's Rep. Mo Brooks allegedly organized last week's protest-turned-riot.

-- Former White House communications aide Cliff Sims recounts in his new tell-all that the president offered NASA all the money you could ever need to get an astronaut to Mars during his first term. New York magazine's Olivia Nuzzi reports: The day of [Trump's televised call to the International Space Station in 2017], Sims conducted a final briefing in the Private Dining Room with Trump, [Betsy] DeVos, [astronaut Kate] Rubins, and Robert Lightfoot Jr., the acting NASA administrator. … Lightfoot explained to the president — who, again, had recently signed a bill containing a plan for Mars — that NASA planned to send a rover to Mars in 2020 and, by the 2030s, would attempt a manned spaceflight. … Sims wrote that [Trump] leaned in toward Lightfoot and made him an offer. 'But what if I gave you all the money you could ever need to do it?' Trump asked. 'What if we sent NASA's budget through the roof, but focused entirely on that instead of whatever else you're doing now. Could it work then?'

-- BuzzFeed obtained documents outlining detailed plans for Trump Tower Moscow, contradicting comments from Trump and his allies that the proposal fizzled in its earliest stages. BuzzFeed News's Azeen Ghorayshi reports: The plan was dazzling: a glass skyscraper that would stretch higher than any other building in Europe, offering ultra-luxury residences and hotel rooms and bearing a famous name. Trump Tower Moscow, conceived as a partnership between [Trump's] company and a Russian real estate developer, looked likely to yield profits in excess of $300 million. … On Monday, Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said 'the proposal was in the earliest stage,' and he went on to tell the New Yorker that 'no plans were ever made. There were no drafts. Nothing in the file.' However, hundreds of pages of business documents, emails, text messages, and architectural plans, obtained by BuzzFeed News over a year of reporting, tell a very different story. Trump Tower Moscow was a richly imagined vision of upscale splendor on the banks of the Moscow River. …

But ruin accelerated with the takeover of the party by pro-Trump extremists. (Ward famously suggested in 2018 that the McCain family disclosed his imminent death because the narrative would be negative to me.) Republican operatives in 2019 were so concerned about Ward's competence — justifiably so, given the 2020 results — that they tried to circumvent the state party.

But even in her worst movies, Kidman is never the problem; her performances rise above whatever dreck they're in, as if her supreme self-possession as a performer inoculated her against the toxic material she was working with. And the bad movies are relatively thin on the ground compared with the myriad triumphs: She won an Oscar for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in The Hours (we're still arguing about that nose), but that was a full seven years after her astonishing portrayal of a fame-hungry TV journalist in To Die For, in which she permanently shut up the doubters in a triumphantly crafty, satirical turn.
Ensz said he was asked to officiate the wedding by one of the grooms, whom he had confirmed and was a youth minister to. He declined to provide more details about the wedding to protect the couple's privacy.
THERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:
Key quote: While the global decline in freedom didn't begin with Donald Trump's presidency, I do think he has been an accelerant, said Uzra Zeya, a State Department veteran who resigned last spring following a 25-year career that culminated as the nation's top Foreign Service officer in Paris.
-- Trump, like many of his advisers, has grown tired of Giuliani's gaffe-prone media appearances frequently requiring the ex-mayor to walk back his comments, Politico's Eliana Johnson and Darren Samuelsohn report: Trump was apoplectic after a pair of weekend media interviews by his personal lawyer, in which Giuliani said that the president had been involved in discussions to build a Trump Tower in Moscow through the end of the 2016 campaign … Trump spent much of Sunday and Monday fuming to aides and friends about his lawyer's missteps. … Giuliani's public remarks — typically made in sporadic clusters of freewheeling media interviews — have long exasperated White House aides, including the president's in-house lawyer handling the Russia investigation, Emmet Flood. … Asked who in the White House is responsible for handling Giuliani's missteps, a White House aide said, 'Handling Rudy's f--- ups takes more than one man.'
The proposal between Methodist leaders outlining a future split suggested that clergy who conduct same-sex marriages should remain in good standing and that any judicial processes should be put on hold as of Jan. 1.
And the 2019 Oscar nominations were announced:
The Fact Checker analyzed Trump's claims that asylum restrictions will aid Central American migrants:

-- Trump is preparing two versions of his State of the Union address, even if Nancy Pelosi declines to invite him to the House chamber and he is forced to give the speech somewhere else. Seung Min Kim reports: The administration is trying to conduct advance work to prepare for an address in the House chamber, originally scheduled for Jan. 29, even though Pelosi has the power to determine whether Trump can do so. … It's unclear what options for venues the White House is exploring aside from the House chamber, where State of the Union addresses have been delivered since President Woodrow Wilson's speech in 1913. On Tuesday, the speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, Tim Moore, said Trump called him to thank him for offering the Raleigh legislature as a venue. Trump told Moore in the phone call Monday evening, which lasted for about 10 minutes, that his staff was still determining where the address would be delivered. Trump also called Lee Chatfield, the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives, who similarly offered up the chambers in Lansing.
-- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) used a visit to the early primary state of South Carolina to pitch himself to black voters in a stark difference from his 2016 campaign. Annie Linskey and David Weigel report: 'Racial equality must be central to combating economic inequality,' Sanders said, in a speech that used the refrain 'racism is alive' to walk through a litany of problems faced by minorities. The changes from Sanders's last campaign were hard to miss. In 2016, he said that 'identity politics' distracted from what he considered real issues, like economic inequality and the decline of organized labor. This week, on his first trip to an early-primary state since the midterm elections, Sanders called [Trump] a 'racist,' pushed for an end to private prisons, endorsed a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote and advocated for an end to the cash bail system. He spoke at two black churches, mingled with supporters at a barbecue joint and met with the state's legislative black caucus, which had largely rejected him in 2016.
Later today, the vice president plans to hold a virtual meeting with National Economic Council Director Brian Deese and small-business owners.
Bishop Sharma Lewis is bound by oaths she took as both a pastor and a Bishop to uphold the Book of Discipline and she processed both complaints, Paul Steidler, a spokesman for the bishop, said in a statement.
QUOTE OF THE DAY: John Kerry was asked what advice he would give to the president: Resign. The former secretary of state added of Trump, He doesn't take any of this seriously. (Heather Long)
-- The D.C. Council voted to override Mayor Muriel Bowser's veto of a bill to decriminalize Metro fare evasion. Faiz Siddiqui reports: The 11-to-2 vote to override the veto — Bowser's second in office — means the legislation now heads to Congress for final review. … Bowser expressed concern about the impact the legislation could have on Metro's bottom line, arguing it could exacerbate the agency's revenue problems and create potential safety issues. … But the council overruled the mayor's objections and rejected her argument that lessening the penalties for fare-jumping would encourage potential lawlessness and make Metro less safe.
The denomination uses an internal judicial system with judges and trials led by clergy. In 2019, the church adopted new penalties, effective Jan. 1: The mandatory penalty for officiating a same-sex marriage would be a year's suspension without pay, and a second conviction would mean a pastor would be defrocked.
Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio), Biden's nominee for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, will appear before the senators on Thursday morning.
We need to assure our policymaking community, and the American people, that we can be trusted with this responsibility to use our information appropriately to protect the nation, Coats said in an afternoon speech to more than 150 members of his staff in McLean, Va. Through transparency, we will strengthen America's faith that the intelligence community seeks the truth – and speaks the truth.
(There aren't enough nonwhites in the Silent Generation to be statistically significant, which is itself telling.)
To Jair Bolsonaro, the new president of Brazil , the U.S. president is … proof that incendiary comments about women or minorities and a history of trafficking in conspiracy theories don't need to stand in the way of taking power.
The president could have immediately and forcefully intervened to stop the violence, Cheney said in the statement. He did not.

Such unions are prohibited by Methodist doctrine, but church trials over same-sex marriage have become increasingly controversial in recent years, with a growing number of congregations and individuals supportive of both same-sex marriage and LGBTQ clergy.
The text then says Republicans will officially censure her at their Jan. 23, 2020 Mandatory Meeting. (I'm still writing 2020 on my censure resolutions, too.)
Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's most prominent infectious-disease expert, expressed concerns Thursday about public resistance to getting the vaccine.
It shouldn't be a partisan issue to make sure that weapons are not in the hands of people who pose a threat, especially when the threat is to their own safety or their family's safety, Northam said.
By objecting to electoral slates, members are unavoidably asserting that Congress has the authority to overturn elections and overrule state and federal courts, she wrote in the memo, which she released last week. Such objections set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states' explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the President and bestowing it instead on Congress. This is directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans.
-- The House overwhelmingly passed a bill aimed at preventing Trump from trying to pull out of NATO. Karoun Demirjian reports: The vast majority of House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the bill by a vote of 357 to 22, after members of both parties gave impassioned speeches for why the alliance was so vital to preserve and protect. 'Time and again the alliance has proven that the free peoples of the world are strongest when they stand together,' said Rep. Michael McCaul (Tex.), the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He called the alliance 'a bulwark against international terror' and 'critical to our national security, and to the preservation of our military prowess around the world.'
Speaking at the White House in July 2019, Trump said, Scooter Libby is a man that got treated very unfairly and Liz was right in the forefront of that one and I said, 'What do you think, Liz,' and you said, 'Absolutely, he deserves it,' and it's been a very popular pardon. At another event, Trump said that Liz Cheney was so dedicated — and the loyalty. That was just an honor for me to do it. He called Cheney a wonderful person, and somebody that has, I don't know, a pretty unlimited future.
Six days earlier, Cheney was in the House chamber, urging that Republicans reject efforts pushed by Trump and many others in her party to challenge the electoral college results that determined Trump had lost his reelection bid. She did not know she was being attacked by Trump, who was delivering the speech that would incite a mob to storm the Capitol, until her father reached her by phone in the House cloakroom.
After winning reelection in 2018, a year in which Republicans lost control of the House, enabling Nancy Pelosi to become speaker, Cheney ran for a post traditionally sought by longtime members: leadership of the House Republican Conference Committee.
The second complaint was not what you would call friendly, Miller said. Neither she nor Ensz would say who submitted the complaint, citing an ongoing process.
Kelu Chao, a journalist who has worked at Voice of America for nearly 40 years, was named interim leader for the Agency for Global Media. Earlier this week, Biden ousted Michael Pack, the Trump ally who led the federal media agency, as well as two other VOA leaders who were only on the job for a few weeks, a journalist who has worked at Voice of America for nearly 40 years, was named interim leader for the Agency for Global Media. Earlier this week, Biden ousted, the Trump ally who led the federal media agency, as well as two other VOA leaders who were only on the job for a few weeks, Paul Farhi reports
-- The high court announced it will consider a New York City gun law, marking the first time the justices have taken up a Second Amendment case in nearly a decade. Robert Barnes reports: The decision to hear the case in the term that begins in October may signal that the reinforced conservative majority on the court is ready to examine more laws that restrict gun rights. New York's law is not replicated elsewhere: It permits transporting handguns only to firing ranges within the city. Those who challenged the law have licenses to keep a handgun at their homes. Petitioners included those who want to take their guns to firing ranges or competitions outside the city, and one who wanted to take the gun to his second home upstate.
-- Ocasio-Cortez a popular choice for president — even though she's too young to serve, by John Wagner: A new poll finds that 74 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults would consider voting for [Ocasio-Cortez] for president if they could. For now, they can't. Ocasio-Cortez, who last year became the youngest woman elected to Congress, is 29. Under the Constitution, you must be at least 35 to be president. The Axios-SurveyMonkey poll highlights the splash that Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist, has made since her arrival this month on Capitol Hill. The 74 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning adults who say they would vote for her for president includes 17 percent who say they would 'definitely' do so.
But his ties to the UMC are deep, and it's the denomination he grew up in.
-- Hundreds of IRS workers have gotten permission to skip work because of financial hardship, just as the tax season gets busy. Danielle Paquette, Lisa Rein, Jeff Stein and Kimberly Kindy report: The Trump administration last week ordered at least 30,000 IRS workers back to their offices, where they have been working to process refunds without pay. … But IRS employees across the country — some in coordinated protest, others out of financial necessity — won't be clocking in, according to Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, and several local union officials. The work action is widespread and includes employees from a processing center in Ogden, Utah, to the Brookhaven campus on New York's Long Island.
Former presidents tend to come together under sad, even dire circumstances — the funeral of a prominent political figure, or a horrific natural disaster.
8. Many adversaries continue to pursue capabilities to inflict catastrophic damage to U.S. interests through the acquisition and use of [weapons of mass destruction]. Their possession of these capabilities can have major impacts on U.S. national security, overseas interests, allies, and the global order. The intelligence challenges to countering the proliferation of WMD and advanced conventional weapons are increasing as actors become more sophisticated, WMD-related information becomes broadly available, proliferation mechanisms increase, and as political instability erodes the security of WMD stockpiles.
As many people know, Liz and I have definitely had our differences, but I am incredibly proud of how she handled herself during the fight over the Electoral College, Mary Cheney wrote on her Facebook page last week. She stood up to President Trump. . . . He even denounced her by name from the stage at yesterday's rally — something that should definitely be considered a badge of honor. Good job Big Sister.
At his introductory news conference with the Browns in February 2019, Priefer addressed his suspension, telling reporters (via cleveland.com), A situation occurred in Minnesota where I made a comment I shouldn't have made. I apologized for that comment.
The Trump administration left Black Americans behind. They want Biden to narrow the gaps.
Trump will host a briefing call on his immigration proposal with state and local leaders and later participate in a roundtable on health-care pricing. He will then meet with conservative leaders about his immigration proposal.
Liz Cheney declined to comment. Richard Cheney did not respond to a request for comment.
The successes in this past year have come about not because I, or you legislators, did something individually — but because we worked together, he said. When we work together and help provide a strong foundation for Virginians, our families and businesses thrive.
Republicans, however, have argued that much of that windfall should go toward tax breaks for a wider swath of Virginians. Del. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), chairman of the budget-shaping Appropriations Committee, said he will set aside all of that $1.2 billion and instead focus on smaller adjustments to the spending plan.
I was the person who came up with the Jan. 6 idea with Congressman Gosar, Congressman Mo Brooks and then Congressman Andy Biggs, said Stop the Steal organizer Ali Alexander in a pre-event video. We four schemed up of putting max pressure on Congress while they were voting so that … we could change the hearts and the minds of Republicans who were in that body hearing our loud roar from outside.
The letter was first reported by DCist.
It admonishes her for supporting leftist causes such as gay marriage. It scolds her for endorsing Biden, in direct opposition to … the Constitution. It upbraids her for objecting to Trump's criticism of her husband — and then it repeats such slander, saying the late senator, a war hero and POW, committed serious wrongdoing during his military service.
In early January, leaders in the United Methodist Church tentatively agreed to spin off a traditionalist Methodist denomination that would continue to oppose same-sex marriage and decline ordination to LGBT clergy — allowing the remaining portion of the United Methodist Church to permit same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy for the first time in its history. The plan will be voted on at the church's denomination-wide conference in May.
Cheney criticized Trump's handling of the coronavirus, seeming to scorn the president's resistance to wearing a mask by tweeting a picture of her father wearing a face covering with the hashtag #realmenwearmasks. After Trump said I appreciate support from QAnon, the conspiracy theory group, Cheney called it a dangerous lunacy.
-- South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg entered the 2020 Democratic primary. Cathleen Decker reports: Buttigieg made his plans official in a video and email sent to supporters early Wednesday, before taking part in the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in Washington, D.C. He announced in December that he would not seek a third term as mayor of the Indiana city, a move widely seen as a precursor to a presidential run. He said Wednesday he was setting up an exploratory committee for president, the legal mechanism allowing him to raise and spend money on behalf of his campaign. Buttigieg suffused his announcement with references to his youth and the generational exception he represents compared to most of the Democratic field. He turned 37 on Saturday, making him the youngest entrant so far in the presidential race.
Cheney's recent actions helped mend a family rift. She was once criticized by her sister, Mary, who is openly gay and married, for opposing same-sex marriage.
In the past, there's been a public report and a separate classified version. But this year there is only one version – and it's entirely unclassified. This is part of an effort by Coats to be more transparent in the face of sustained attacks from the president and his allies on the right against what they've taken to calling the Deep State.
-- Ernst, up for reelection next year, also claimed in the court filing she turned down Trump's offer to be his running mate in 2016. The Guardian's Ben Jacobs reports: The Iowa Republican met with Trump in New Jersey at his Bedminister golf course on [July 4, 2016] and gave a positive statement about the meeting. However, within two days, Ernst told Politico: 'I made that very clear to him that I'm focused on Iowa. I feel that I have a lot more to do in the United States Senate. And Iowa is where my heart is.'
Forty percent of Americans say they definitely will get inoculated when they can, and another 23 percent say they probably will, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. But just one quarter of Republicans say they definitely will get vaccinated.
The self-destructive madness can be traced to the 2019 election of Kelli Ward (R-Wackadoodle) as state GOP chairwoman. Under the leadership of Ward — a two-time loser of Republican Senate primaries, one against McCain — the party embraced election conspiracy theories: It called for the state legislature to DE-CERTIFY the false results, and when the state's Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, an erstwhile Trump ally, defended the count, Ward tweeted that Ducey should #sthu — shut the hell up.
When I asked McConnell how he felt about his legacy and Trump's being so closely linked, he rejected the premise. 'I don't think so,' he said. 'I think the most consequential call I made was before President Trump came to office.' I asked what he meant. 'The decision not to fill the [Antonin] Scalia vacancy,' he said. 'I think that's the most consequential thing I've ever done.'
-- Trump's assistant secretary of state in charge of European affairs, who has overseen U.S. relations with NATO and the European Union for the past 16 months, announced his resignation. He cited personal and professional reasons. Carol Morello reports: In September 2017, [A. Wess] Mitchell became one of the first assistant secretaries of state in the Trump administration confirmed by the Senate, and his departure creates another vacancy in the ranks of senior officials. Currently, six of the 24 spots have nominees awaiting Senate confirmation. … In an interview, Mitchell said his resignation is not a protest of the administration's policies or the direction of foreign policy, and he praised [Mike] Pompeo's leadership and vision.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) argues a trial shouldn't begin until mid-February to give Trump time to mount a defense. Trump has apparently secured an attorney for the trial: Butch Bowers, a Columbia, S.C., lawyer known for his prominent role in litigating political and election matters for North and South Carolina Republicans.
Trump has routinely clashed with the intelligence community, likening the agencies to Nazi Germany shortly before he took office, repeatedly questioning their expert consensus that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and boasting about his inauguration crowd size during a speech in front of the wall of stars that honors the fallen at CIA headquarters.
At that point, per the report, Priefer told investigators, It was a joke between three people, three men.
Or another question related to race: Which group is treated less fairly, blacks or whites? Gen Z white males are far more likely to say black Americans are treated less fairly, even compared to Generation X, those born from 1965 to 1980 under Pew's definition.
He said he is surprised his disciplinary case is still open while others have been put on pause.
Sens. Glen H. Sturtevant Jr. (R-Chesterfield) and Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax County) proposed a measure to make Virginia the 38th and final state to ratify the federal Equal Rights Amendment. The bill died in House and Senate committees last year, although it had cleared the full Senate in previous years.
HOT ON THE LEFT: Passenger Confronts GOP Congressman Over Flying First Class During Shutdown, from HuffPost: [A] Republican lawmaker had an uncomfortable run-in Tuesday when a fellow airplane passenger found him flying first class from Chicago to Washington, D.C., according to a video of the encounter shared with HuffPost. 'Congressman, do you think it's appropriate to fly first class while 57 TSA agents aren't being paid?' the person says to Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), in an apparent reference to [TSA's] 57,000 employees, who are being required to work without pay. … Davis remained silent, prompting the person to say, 'Taking that as a yes.' HOT ON THE RIGHT: GOP strategist blasts Stephen Miller, says 'Maybe someday he'll have a relationship with a live human woman,' from Fox News: Rick Wilson, the strategist, was on MSNBC's 'All in with Chris Hayes' and was discussing Miller's behind-the-scenes influence over [Trump's] immigration policies. There's something deeply wrong with Stephen Miller… and maybe someday, he'll have a relationship with a live human woman,' Wilson said, in response to Hayes criticism that Miller's hard-line views on immigration are what's driving the ongoing government shutdown. 'I don't know if that has anything to do with it,' Hayes' responded, according to a video obtained by MEDIAite.
That accusation was made by ex-punter Chris Kluwe in a January 2014 essay he wrote for Deadspin in which he claimed that his advocacy for same-sex marriage probably led to his release the previous year by Minnesota after eight seasons with the team. Kluwe wrote that, in addition to the nuke comment, Priefer's other remarks on the topic included: disgust at the thought of two men kissing; belittling any idea of acceptance or tolerance; and claiming more than once that the punter would wind up burning in hell with the gays.
Pew's research on the generation established a lot of comfort among members of the generation on LGBTQ issues. The oldest whites who spoke to Pew saw same-sex marriage as a bad thing; the youngest, including young white males, disagreed.
A House Democrat expressed dismay over government employees working without pay:
-- This Sunday's New York Times Magazine has a lengthy cover story on Mitch McConnell's legacy. The president whom the Senate Republican leader helped elect has turned out to be the one thing he can't control, Charles Homans writes. When I asked Elaine Chao, who is Trump's secretary of transportation and McConnell's wife of 26 years, if Trump and McConnell liked each other, she was silent for a full four seconds before replying, 'You'll have to ask the president that, and you'll have to ask the leader that.' When I did ask McConnell, all he said was, 'Yeah, we get along fine.' …
Mind you, on these four subjects, white males generally offered more conservative views than their peers. But compared particularly to older white men, their views on diversity and racial bias were starkly different.
He added the U.S. death toll, currently at 409,000, would probably top 500,000 by the end of next month. Let me be equally clear: We will get through this, he said, Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better, Biden said yesterday as he signed 10 executive orders and other documents to streamline the response to the pandemic.Let me be equally clear: We will get through this, he said, per Ashley Parker and Matt Viser
The Supreme Court's decision to decline the Trump administration's request for an expedited review of DACA weakened the president's hand: If the court sticks to its normal procedures, even accepting the case at a later date would probably mean the justices would not hear arguments until the court's new term starts in October. That would probably keep the program in place until at least next year. With the court seemingly keeping the program safe for at least a year, Trump's offer to suspend his efforts to end it became less appealing to lawmakers who were already skeptical.
Thursday is Health Care day. Biden will rescind policies blocking federal funding for nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion services.
I knew it was a risk, he said. I couldn't sit by and not do something when this couple had invited me to officiate their wedding.
Video obtained by The Washington Post appears to show National Guard troops in a parking garage and indoor tennis court near the U.S. Capitol. (Obtained by The Washington Post)
Consider the question of whether respondents think racial and ethnic diversity is good, bad or makes no difference. Nearly 6 in 10 white males who are in Generation Z hold the view that racial and ethnic diversity is a good thing, vs. fewer than 4 in 10 white males born before 1946 (the Silent Generation, per Pew's labels). The drop-off is similar across Gen Z groups, but only among white men are the oldest members more likely to say diversity makes little difference than that it's a good thing.
The Senate's Privileges and Elections Committee got right down to work on two proposed constitutional amendments — one related to the ERA, the other to same-sex marriage.
The Vikings hired a pair of attorneys to investigate Kluwe's allegations about Priefer's comments and the reasons for the punter's release. In a July 2014 report they noted that the team's long snapper at the time, Cullen Loeffler, told them he also heard Priefer talk about putting all the gays on an island and nuking it. For the attorneys, that provided an important piece of corroboration, although they wrote that no other witnesses they interviewed recalled hearing any remarks of that nature by Priefer.
Hassett said he fears that, without more aid, the pandemic will cause the economy to collapse like it did the first quarter of last year, when the GDP shrank by 5 percent, per CNN
Invoking the Virginia Way of political compromise, Northam catalogued the accomplishments of his first year in office — including expanding Medicaid to hundreds of thousands of low-income Virginians, raising the larceny threshold and securing funding for Metro — and he urged both parties to cooperate.
There is no question that the president formed the mob, the president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob, Cheney told the network where she once worked and whose pundits had long supported Trump. He lit the flame.
White males in Gen Z and who are millennials are more likely to say government should do more to solve problems. The change over time here is stark, with responses among white men inverting neatly as the respondent gets older.
The bipartisan bonhomie is a stark departure from Trump's approach to the coronavirus pandemic. His Health and Human Services Department crafted a never-aired $250 million campaign to defeat despair featuring celebrities like Dennis Quaid, which was criticized for being designed to boost Trump's reelection chances.
-- The Supreme Court allowed Trump's transgender troop ban to go into effect as it works its way through lower courts. Robert Barnes and Dan Lamothe report: The justices lifted nationwide injunctions that had kept the administration's policy from being implemented. The Trump policy reverses an Obama administration rule that would have opened the military to transgender men and women and instead bars those who identify with a gender different from the one assigned at birth and are seeking to transition. The court's five conservatives — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh — allowed the restrictions to go into effect while the court decides whether eventually to consider the merits of the case. The liberal justices — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — would have kept the injunctions in place.
Hours after Kluwe's essay was published, Priefer issued a statement in which he vehemently denied the allegations.
There had been a strain of McCain antipathy within the Arizona party well before Trump, who served in the First Bone Spurs Division during Vietnam and attacked McCain's heroism for years, even posthumously. Meanwhile, a younger, multiracial electorate has been gradually turning against Republicans in the state, as in Texas, Georgia and North Carolina.
After cutting his teeth as a graduate assistant with Navy, Priefer's first coaching jobs were at the college level, including a brief stint at Virginia Military Institute, before he was hired in 2002 by the Jacksonville Jaguars to assist with their special teams. He held the same role with the New York Giants the following three years, then oversaw special teams for the Kansas City Chiefs and Denver Broncos.

When the Nigerian army opened fire on rock-throwing demonstrators last fall, killing as many as 40 people, it defended itself by citing Trump's threats to do the same at the Mexican border.
Friday's incident near the Lincoln Memorial in which a group of high school boys confronted an elderly Native American man sent a ripple of fear and anger across the country. The image of a group of high school boys clad in Make America Great Again hats, smirking and laughing resurfaced tensions that have been simmering since President Trump's campaign began. At one point, some reportedly chanted, Build the wall! though such chants are not audible on widely circulated video.
She and her father have had an up-and-down relationship with Trump that turned toxic. As she heard Trump and many of her colleagues declare several weeks ago that Congress should seek to challenge the electoral college results, she sat down to write a 21-page memo warning Republicans against the effort.
 Can Mitch McConnell stand against Donald Trump and still control the Kentucky GOP?  by the Lexington Herald Leader's Daniel Desrochers:  Tensions are high. The Nelson County Republican Party voted to censure McConnell over his statements on the Senate floor Tuesday, passing a resolution that called on McConnell to retract his comments. Don Thrasher, the Nelson County Republican Party Chairman, said he felt that McConnell impugned the integrity of Trump on the Senate floor. by the Lexington Herald Leader's Daniel Desrochers: 
Gov. Gina Raimondo (D-R.I.), Biden's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, will testify before the Senate on Tuesday at 10 a.m.
The former Republican senator from Indiana, appointed by President Trump, has sought to protect the independence of spy agencies to provide candid and cleareyed assessments of what's really going on in the world, especially vis-a-vis the threat posed by Vladimir Putin's revanchist Russia.
It would be incredibly hard to leave, he said. This is my spiritual home and what I've known.
The idea of bringing the three former presidents together to film the handover-of-power video came from Stephanie Cutter, a veteran Democratic operative who served as an executive producer of Biden's inauguration, the sources said.
Although he is backing those same bills again, including measures that call for universal background checks and an assault-weapons ban, Northam chose to highlight just a single bill in his speech — one that he said Republican legislatures in other states have adopted. The extreme risk law would make it easier for law enforcement and the courts to remove firearms from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.
After the election, with Liz Cheney winning a House seat at the same time Trump captured the presidency, Trump baldly tried to win the Cheney family's goodwill. He pardoned the elder Cheney's former chief of staff, I. Lewis Scooter Libby, who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice. Trump said Liz Cheney had pushed for the pardon.
-- Pelosi remains adamant that Democrats will not vote to fund the wall, but several more moderate members want to compromise. Politico's Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade report: A group of centrist House Democrats, sick of political posturing, is pressing [Pelosi] to counter Trump's immigration proposal with her own potential compromise. The group, led by freshman Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, is asking the California Democrat to offer Trump a vote on his border wall or some sort of negotiated security package in February if he first signs a bill reopening the federal government … 'Give Trump the money,' Rep. Collin Peterson, a centrist Democrat from a red Minnesota district, told a local radio station Tuesday. 'I'd give him the whole thing…and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where it needs to be. Why are we fighting over this? We're going to build that wall anyway, at some time.'
Jimmy Fallon shared Trump's window thoughts:
But among white millennial men, the picture is different.
This is a familiar dynamic in Kidman's filmography: She's made some famous duds, most recently the overbaked historical pseudo-epic Australia, the deliciously campy The Paperboy and the ill-advised Grace Kelly biopic Grace of Monaco.
Friday, finally, is Immigration day. Biden will sign executive orders focused on border processing and refugee policies, as well as establish a family reunification task force.
The decision marked an extraordinary denouement for Cheney and her potentially precarious perch in the party's leadership. She had feuded for months with Trump and lately had been at odds with the majority of her caucus, even as speculation mounts about whether she might one day seek the speakership. The move was applauded by those in the party who have urged a clean break with Trump.

Biden will today sign a new slate of executive actions that will, among other things:
-- The funding lapse has also delayed the trial of a man accused of murdering two police officers in the U.S. Virgin Islands because expert witnesses in the case have been furloughed. Deanna Paul reports: Days before the Jan. 10 trial date, assistant attorneys general from the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Justice filed a motion with the local St. Croix court. 'Due to unforeseen circumstances beyond the People's control,' they requested a fourth continuance in the [Francis] Williams murder trial. 'Virtually all of the forensic evidence in this case was processed by scientists and agents attached to the FBI, ATF and the Department of Homeland Security,' prosecutors said in court filings.
-- Michael Bloomberg, who is weighing a presidential bid leaning on his centrist image, emphasized the importance of compromise in an Annapolis speech. Rachel Chason reports: He gave the keynote speech Tuesday at a leadership conference at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, praising the late senator John McCain — an academy alumnus — for his independence and willingness to work across the aisle. … Following meetings with Maryland lawmakers and state Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D), Bloomberg spoke at a news conference about the importance of 'balancing' different priorities. He called the partial federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, a 'disgrace.' 'You can't be an absolutist . . . life is much more complex than that,' he said. … Asked about the timing of an announcement about 2020, Bloomberg said: 'Well, I said I'd take a look at it in January, February. We're still in January.'
The move is the leading edge of pushback from within the IRS, and it signals the potential for civil servants to take actions that could slow or cripple government functions as the political stalemate continues in Washington. U.S. Department of Agriculture meat inspectors have begun to call in sick, Transportation Security Administration sickouts at airports have been rising, and federal law enforcement agencies say the shutdown is increasing stress among agents and affecting investigations. … Not receiving pay for more than a month has taken a toll on employees across the government, but especially on those who are not in high-salary jobs. The employees summoned back from furlough to process tax refunds are paid between $25,800 and $51,000 a year, depending on their seniority.
I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president, so it was really something that you didn't feel that you can actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions about it. The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know, what the evidence — what the science is and know that's it, let the science speak, it is somewhat of a liberating feeling, Fauci said at his first press conference of the Biden administration.
Harris's communications director tweeted a video of the candidate dancing to Cardi B:
Cheney served as deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs during the administration of her father's first term as vice president. She then played a crucial role in the 2004 Bush-Cheney reelection campaign, after which she returned to her post at the State Department and later served a stint as a Fox News pundit.

Virginia's General Assembly marks its 400th anniversary this year, and there were nods to its history throughout the opening day of the legislative session.
-- The Trump administration asked the court to accelerate the review of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Barnes reports: Last week, U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman of New York ordered the administration to stop its plans to add the question to the survey. Furman said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross broke a 'veritable smorgasbord' of federal rules by overriding the advice of career officials who said including the citizenship question was likely to cut down the response rate and make the census less accurate. Normally, the Justice Department's next stop would be the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. But Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco said that would not leave enough time for a final ruling from the Supreme Court. 'The government must finalize the census questionnaire by the end of June 2019 to enable it to be printed on time,' he told the court.
A bill by Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) would bar QAnon followers from receiving security clearances. Following a report that at least 22 current or former members of the military or law enforcement were found to have been at or near the Capitol riots, Murphy, a former Pentagon official, drew up the bill. If any Americans participated in the Capitol attack, or if they subscribe to these dangerous anti-government views of QAnon, then they have no business being entrusted with our nation's secrets, she said.

-- The narrative: Democratic presidential candidates across the board are embracing liberal and populist policies, demonstrating how much the party has transformed in recent years. David Weigel and Jenna Johnson report: For years, Democratic presidential candidates have been skittish about taking positions that were considered too liberal, for fear of scaring off moderates and independent voters. That caution seems to be gone, along with soul-searching about making explicit appeals to conservative voters. … The party's swift shift has left vulnerable several Democratic candidates or likely ones who have voting records and previous stances that are out-of-line with current Democratic thinking. Those who defend their earlier stances risk seeming stuck in time to party that's quickly transforming, while those who have changed their positions risk being labeled as flip-floppers and opportunists.
Chelsea Clinton announced she is expecting a third child:
A Fox News host recounted his family's car accident that thankfully resulted in no major injuries:
Former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama — who starred in an Inauguration Day video playing up the democratic transfer of power — will also soon be jointly urging wary Americans to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, according to sources familiar with the project. The sources requested anonymity to speak candidly.
It is a remarkable statement that sets a new bar for leadership in the House, said Brendan Buck, a former aide to House Speaker John A. Boehner. She is turning the page on Donald Trump. I think she is doing the right thing in her mind, and when you do the right thing for the right reasons you have to hope the politics work out for you.
The committee then went on to consider a proposal from Sen. Adam P. Ebbin (D-Alexandria) to remove the state's defunct gay-marriage ban from the state Constitution. The ban has been unconstitutional since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that same-sex couples have a right to marry nationwide. The plan from Ebbin, who in 2003 became the state's first openly gay legislator, would have put the matter to a referendum.

Perhaps because of her demeanor of self-effacing, even demure, modesty, it's been easy to underestimate Kidman over the course of a career that now spans three decades. But this week has offered a reminder of why we should prize an actress who has fashioned one of the most fascinating careers in a business notorious for pigeonholing its starlets early, keeping them boxed in and discarding them when their physical attributes show signs of sagging, bagging or otherwise naturally evolving.

A Democratic senator and Iraq War veteran reacted to the Supreme Court's decision on transgender troops:
While the general assumption is that younger Americans are more liberal, and therefore less likely to support Trump, we noted earlier this year that young white men are the only members of the millennial generation — generally but informally defined as those born between 1980 and 2000 — who lean more Republican than Democrat. Millennial men and millennial women tend to identify as Democrats more heavily, as do millennial whites and nonwhites.
 QAnon believers seek to adapt their extremist ideology for a new era: 'Things have just started,' by Drew Harwell:  by Drew Harwell:  Biden's rise to the White House marked the biggest inflection point yet for QAnon's core believers, who this week voiced doubts and frustrations that the movement's years-old promises of mass executions and an extended Trump presidency had been bogus all along.

Ensz, whose ministry at George Mason is ecumenical, said that because this was his first offense, he doesn't expect his credentials to be pulled. If they were, Ensz might be able to seek credentials from a different conference. Because his ministry is ecumenical, it would probably still keep him on staff, he said.
As Biden readies his immigration plan, Republicans are already fundraising off their opposition to it:
And when members of the U.N. Security Council visited Myanmar 's commander in chief in late April to demand explanations for the expulsion of more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims, he used the phrase 'fake news' — the only words he spoke in English — no less than a dozen times.
Republican leaders embraced Northam's language of cooperation before drawing a sharp line over taxes.
-- Rep. Maxine Waters, the new chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, intends to call three major credit reporting firms to testify on Capitol Hill. From Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt: Top executives from Equifax, Experian and TransUnion are expected to appear at a hearing anticipated for Feb. 26, the sources said. … Waters, a California Democrat, is an outspoken critic of the industry, and the hearing will put a spotlight on legislation she drafted to revamp its practices. … The hearing will be a preview of the kind of intense scrutiny that Waters has vowed to direct at big banks and top Trump administration officials in the coming months.
-- The bigger picture: Democrats note that Trump is following an established pattern of attempting to force his opponents to capitulate by offering to resolve a disaster of his own making. Damian Paletta and Josh Dawsey report: Trump has described this approach as creating leverage and negotiating, but Democrats and other opponents have said it amounts to 'hostage taking.' 'It's sort of like bartering with stolen goods,' [Schumer] said Tuesday. Trump has used the same playbook during confrontations with Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, South Korea, North Korea and the European Union in the past two years with mixed success. … It is a well-worn tactic from Trump's business career, but this is the first time the livelihoods of so many U.S. workers and households have hung in the balance as a result of it.
In his speech inciting the mob to storm the Capitol, Trump sounded obsessed with Cheney's criticism of him on the issue. After saying we got to get rid of Cheney, he said, You know, she never wants a soldier brought home. I brought a lot of soldiers home.
Not many people saw Kidman's mesmerizing portrayal of the photographer Diane Arbus in the boundary-breaking film Fur, or her turn as a grieving mother in Rabbit Hole, or as the traumatized grown-up daughter of self-involved artists in The Family Fang. But she has become one of the industry's most valuable and adventurous side players, a headliner who — Q Scores and likability be damned — leverages her gifts and box-office pull in service to pushing the art form forward. It should surprise no one that her upcoming projects include the edgy, feminist TV mystery series Top of the Lake and films with Sofia Coppola and the Greek provocateur Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster).
9. Continued federal budget uncertainty strains the [intelligence community's] ability to make deliberative and responsive resource decisions. The outcome may be overextended budgets or lack of cost-effective solutions to address intelligence issues. The [intelligence community] needs to develop methods to efficiently shift resources to mitigate programmatic (fiscal) risk and avoid loss of vital programs, capabilities, and resource investments.
-- Barnes, our SCOTUS beat reporter, notes the decision to grand cert on the gun case may provide the most insight yet about where the conservative majority will take the court: The speculation had been that neither conservatives nor liberals knew whether they could count on the vote of the court's median justice, Anthony M. Kennedy. The court turned aside numerous challenges to restrictions on the kinds of guns that could be purchased, and whether they could be carried outside the home. After one such decision in 2018, a frustrated Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that 'as evidenced by our continued inaction in this area, the Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court.' But, [law professor Adam] Winkler said, 'there is no hesitancy in Justice Kavanaugh,' who replaced Kennedy and has an expansive view of gun rights.
Republicans also said they were open to dialogue about gun safety — though House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) cautioned that Democrats must do that in the context of respecting our traditional rights.
And about Austin's experiences with Beau Biden.
Ten days after the Dec. 26, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, Bush enlisted Clinton and George H.W. Bush to lead what became a successful a global campaign for private donations. Five years later, it was Obama's turn to task Clinton and the younger Bush with collecting aid in the aftermath of an earthquake that devastated much of Haiti.

Biden's inaugural committee felt both for small-d democratic purposes but also aligned with Joe Biden's values and message, we are going to restore confidence in government again, or at least build some of it back, the source continued. That posed a challenge given the absence of the outgoing president, who plays a pretty starring role in Inauguration Day — the greeting at the White House — the whole nine yards.
4. The ability of individuals and groups to have a larger impact than ever before—politically, militarily, economically, and ideologically—is undermining traditional institutions. This empowerment of groups and individuals is increasing the influence of ethnic, religious, and other sources of identity, changing the nature of conflict, and challenging the ability of traditional governments to satisfy the increasing demands of their populations, increasing the potential for greater instability. Some violent extremist groups will continue to take advantage of these sources and drivers of instability to hold territory, further insurgencies, plan external attacks, and inspire followers to launch attacks wherever they are around the world.
Priefer's stint with the Vikings is also noteworthy for a two-game suspension in 2014, after an outside investigation determined that there was credibility to a former player's accusation that he once said, We should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows.
-- Federal judges chose a Virginia House of Delegates redistricting map considered highly favorable to Democrats. Gregory S. Schneider reports: Six Republicans would wind up in districts where a majority of voters chose Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election, according to an analysis of the maps by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. No current Democrats would see their voter majority change to Republican, based on those election results. The map could help Virginia Democrats flip the House of Delegates, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority.
When our predecessors first assembled at Jamestown Island all those years ago, they changed everything. Those first citizen servants forged a path we continue on today, four centuries later, he said.
Cheney did not directly answer the question, which foreshadowed elements of the attack on the Capitol. Look, I don't believe this is right or left, she said. I think this is an issue on which all of us should come together.
But Northam's vision of a rapidly rising state flush with cash to build on its success is based on a fundamental disagreement with Republicans, who still control both houses of the legislature. The governor wants to spend some $1.2 billion that could flood state coffers because of changes to the federal tax code under the tax cuts President Trump signed last year.
As the scope of the destruction became apparent, I spoke to each of these gentlemen, and they each asked the same simple question: 'How can I help?' Obama said with his two predecessors at his side in the Rose Garden. In the days ahead, they'll be asking everyone what they can do — individuals, corporations, NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] and institutions.

The Trump White House in a nutshell: Trump was impressed by [deputy press secretary Hogan] Gidley's television appearances during the previous government shutdown. Once, after watching Gidley on his screen in the residence, the President walked over to the communications office to tell the staff he thought they were handling the shutdown well. In the days afterward, Trump confused several officials when he directed them to, 'Get me Tidley.' 'Who?' puzzled staffers asked. 'Tidley,' Trump replied. 'I want to talk to Hogan Tidley.' They informed him that the deputy press secretary's last name was Gidley, not Tidley.
Democrats and Republicans alike cheered and rose at a few points during Northam's 50-minute speech, such as when he called for extending broadband access to rural areas and pledged to make the state the best for business.
The party just rolled out a censure resolution against Cindy McCain. Childish and bizarre, it attacks the wife of Arizona's beloved late (Republican) senator for having a past riddled with drug abuse. (She admitted three decades ago to a previous pain-medication addiction.)

Last year, writing about actress Isabelle Huppert in the New Republic, the critic Miriam Bale noted that in the movie Elle, Huppert herself became an auteur, her craft and potent persona transcending the material and taking a hand in creating the movie that was every bit as crucial as the director's. The same, writ even larger, could be said for Kidman, whose shrewd auteurist eye is revealed not just in one movie but through the arc of her career. In an industry dedicated to escapism, shallow reassurance and dumbing down, she has single-mindedly pursued thoughtfulness, intelligence and risk, as an actor and a producer. (Check out the flawed, weird but wonderfully woman-centric erotic thriller In the Cut for an early example of the latter.)

Kidman has largely escaped that trap, as anyone who watched the recent HBO series Big Little Lies can attest. The stylish, compulsively engrossing thriller-slash-domestic-melodrama turned out to be a sleeper peak TV hit largely on the strength of its ensemble cast, which included Reese Witherspoon, Laura Dern, Zoë Kravitz, Shailene Woodley and Kidman, who played the abused wife of a prosperous executive. Kidman — who co-produced with Witherspoon — was a standout in the series, her portrayal of a woman fighting for her own physical and psychic survival radiating shame, ambivalence, glazed confusion, determination and barely perceptible ripples of latent power. Never showy or gratuitous, it was a performance as delicate and fine-grained as the porcelain that her doll-like character, Celeste, sometimes seemed to be made of.

Cheney blasted Trump's proposal to withdraw U.S. troops from Germany as dangerously misguided, prompting a rebuke from Trump, who tweeted that Liz Cheney is only upset because I have been actively getting our great and beautiful Country out of the ridiculous and costly Endless Wars.

But in interviews on four continents, diplomats, rights activists and foreign officials said that after two years of Trump using the world's most powerful megaphone to cheer authoritarians, bully democratic allies and denigrate traditional American values, the impact on how others govern is becoming clear.

CNN's Michelle Kosinski and Jennifer Hansler report: The 16th International Export Control and Border Security Conference was scheduled to take place in Edinburgh, Scotland, in mid-February, with a goal of preventing the proliferation and transfer of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons across borders.

But with few exceptions, Republicans sat stone-faced as Northam called for dialogue about gun safety and ending the practice of suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay court costs. His call to allow early voting seemed to fall especially flat on that side of the aisle, particularly as he tied prohibitive barriers to voting to the state's history of slavery. So did his call to add language to the state code declaring that a woman has the fundamental right to make her own health-care decisions.

3. No longer a solely U.S. domain, the democratization of space poses significant challenges for the United States. Adversaries are increasing their presence in this domain with plans to reach or exceed parity in some areas. For example, Russia and China will continue to pursue a full range of anti-satellite weapons as a means to reduce U.S. military effectiveness and overall security. Increasing commercialization of space now provides capabilities that were once limited to global powers to anyone that can afford to buy them. Many aspects of modern society—to include our ability to conduct military operations—rely on our access to and equipment in space.

-- A group representing FBI agents issued a report saying the shutdown is affecting investigations on child trafficking, terrorism and more. The New York Times's Katie Benner reports: Because of the shutdown, the F.B.I. has been unable to issue grand jury subpoenas and indictments in several cases cited in the report. An agent working on an MS-13 investigation that has gone on for more than three years and resulted in 23 gang indictments for racketeering, murder and money laundering has been hamstrung by his inability to pay for an interpreter who can communicate with his Spanish-speaking informants, the report said. The bureau has also not been able to pay its informants, an important source of intelligence in terrorism, narcotics, gang, illegal firearm and other national security cases. The F.B.I. could lose those informants. (Read the full 72-page report here.)
Among those supporting the effort to challenge the results was Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), a potential rival to Cheney for the speakership if Republicans regain the House in two years.

Guatemala also voted with the United States on Jerusalem and announced it would move its own embassy to the city. Months later, in August, President Jimmy Morales declared he was abolishing the mandate of a U.N.-backed commission that had long been known as an effective watchdog in curbing corruption. As he spoke, a column of three dozen jeeps — some with roof-mounted machine guns — that had been supplied by the United States for anti-narcotics operations rolled through Guatemala City, pausing at the commission's offices and the homes of human rights activists.
Congress waived a requirement for the defense secretary to be out of the military for seven years.

So what is the Arizona Republican Party doing to recover? Why, it's attacking John McCain's widow.
It's clear from Friday's incident on the Mall that the young men who confronted the Native American protester had somehow internalized that their behavior was acceptable. It's hard to read from that one scenario how they look at issues of race more broadly. But if part of the incident on the Mall reflected opposition to diversity, those views would be in the minority.
-- In a divorce filing, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) alleges that her husband mentally and emotionally abused her — and even once physically assaulted her. The Des Moines Register's Luke Nozicka and Linh Ta report: 'We went through a very dark and troubling time in our marriage,' Ernst wrote [in her affidavit]. 'I very nearly filed for divorce after a night that we argued, and it became physical.' Joni Ernst said she fled to her mother's house with her daughter in the middle of the night. Gail Ernst followed soon after, crying and apologizing, according to her affidavit. The next day, a victim's advocate at the courthouse performed an examination of Ernst's throat and head, she said; the advocate wanted to take Ernst to the hospital, according to the court filing. Ernst declined, writing that she was 'embarrassed and humiliated' and did not want people to know about what she described as an assault.
