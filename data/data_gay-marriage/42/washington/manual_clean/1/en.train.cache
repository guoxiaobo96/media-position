cohen also did not dispute a report that he tried to swing online polls for the 2016 election in trump's favor:
those talks included the city and county, alma martinez, el monte city manager, told the los angeles times.
i figure he's just being super polite, but after we make our exit and he takes the wheel of his rented suv — you navigate, i'll drive, he tells mckenna; i've always been terrible at land navigation — it becomes clear that he wasn't pretending. that banner she's having them sign, what a good way to build teamwork, he says. it's the kind of thing that builds a sense that you're all working together, and toward something. a good organizer knows about building a social culture in a campaign.
usccb statements about previous presidential elections and inaugurations took a more positive and collaborative tone. in 2016, the conference put out a statement congratulating donald trump, saying it looks forward to working with president-elect trump to protect human life from its most vulnerable beginning to its natural end.
harris, shown in 2004, began her career as a prosecutor in the bay area. she launched, and won, a gutsy first bid for elective office against her former boss for the job of san francisco district attorney. (marcio jose sanchez/ap)
in 2014, after the supreme court legalized same-sex marriage, and the court denied south carolina's attempt at a stay, sarratt told the greenville news that the couple knew many who chose sexual identity over a life of faith, but that there is no need to sacrifice either.
if we're going to be the party who believes women — and i think we should — kirsten took a courageous position and that should be acknowledged, said neil sroka, communications ­director for democracy for america, a liberal political action committee.
in rome, he said, he saw dictator benito mussolini thundering from a balcony against the league of nations. in shanghai, he and his grandmother walked through the rubble from the japanese attack and occupation. in the streets of mumbai, he said, he saw mohandas gandhi.
• get input from labor and environmental groups in any trade negotiations. this would include any potential revival of the trans-pacific partnership, which proceeded without the u.s. (and with a new name) after trump withdrew in 2017.
according to a new poll from the pew research center, the teens may offer a window into the politics of generation z more broadly.
today is a good day, del. roslyn tyler (d-sussex) said before voting to raise the minimum wage after 10 years of failure.
buttigieg and garcetti are two of four mayors who are either in the race, seriously considering it, or confusing people by not ruling it out. the latter two, mike bloomberg and bill de blasio, are political rivals with an incredibly similar pitch: if you doubt that the country can work again, come to new york.
the rest of the week they'll rehearse and write, jettisoning stuff that doesn't work, even up to show time. this is ferrell's third season with snl. he started playing reno about a year ago. the idea crossed his mind because he was interested in doing a part that's broad and physical. then his girlfriend independently came up with the idea, and that solidified the notion. he liked the visual humor of a large woman manhandling people. i originally wanted to do this thing where she was almost like a bodyguard for president clinton, ferrell says, and they'd be in cabinet meetings and she wouldn't say anything, and then if clinton didn't like the person she'd be like, `bill, do you want me to get rid of him?' instead, he and co-writer scott wainio came up with janet reno's dance party. in these segments, reno is shown in trademark blue dress, partying in her basement, introducing guests mainly for the sake of humiliating them, quizzing teenagers and then telling them to shut up. we just kind of created this, like, tough woman who lives in this make-believe world, he says. janet reno as you've never seen her before! their only aim was to be silly, ferrell says, sitting in front of a monitor watching the simba tape.
gillibrand said in a cbs news interview last year that as she expanded her views beyond the lens of upstate new york, she realized that her gun rights and immigration positions were wrong.
but in february 2017, journalists uncovered anti-semitic and homophobic tweets on an account belonging to meklat, and his meteoric rise was quickly overshadowed by a staggering fall.
empathy is a muscle. it would do all of us good to strengthen it, and that means not just reflecting on our experiences but exercising our imaginations. imagine a terrible thing happening to you, and how you would like to be treated in the aftermath; now recognize that the terrible thing already happens to thousands of americans every day. the goal is not to walk a mile in someone else's shoes; the goal is to recognize that someone else's shoes may never fit you and yet they still deserved to be warm and dry.
friday, october 22, 1999; page a2 los angeles—the campaign to declare that marriage only between a man and a woman is legal in california--as opposed to a union of two men or two women--has suddenly turned very personal. the issue, which is as much about homosexual rights as it is about family values, is pitting religious conservatives against gays and their allies here, and may once again roil the political waters of this bellwether state, just as initiatives over bilingual education, affirmative action and illegal immigrants have in the past. and in this case, it already has pitted father against son. in an opinion piece last week in the los angeles times, the son of the ballot initiative's sponsor wrote that his father is anti-gay and pursuing a blind, uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a subject about which he knows nothing and wants to know nothing, but which serves his political career. the son, david knight, revealed that he is gay and living with a life partner named joe. he is also a graduate of the air force academy, a former fighter pilot who served in the persian gulf war and now, at age 39, is a cabinet maker in baltimore leading a quiet, full life. he says his father has rejected him because of his sexual orientation.
linking previously scattered social movements, ni una menos forged a diverse coalition of women to challenge the status quo. after beginning as a protest against machista violence, ni una menos eventually broadened its claims to encompass reproductive rights. feminist activists argued that without legal abortion, ni una menos would always be a misnomer, because unsafe, clandestine abortions represent one of the leading causes of maternal death in argentina.
she stepped onto the scaffolding in front of the recently besieged u.s. capitol and she communicated that, no, we would not be traveling back to 1814 or to anywhen else. no, because of the votes of 81 million americans, we would be moving only forward.
in the end, buttigieg appealed to enough voters to vault into serious contention but not enough to lift him higher. he built an improbably broad base that was not broad enough, and when the primary moved to more diverse states, he simply could not keep up.
when we depose you, you're not going to get away with that, kaplan says. he had the mantle of the presidency, and that's now gone.
state data shows that the great voter-registration advantage that republicans once had in the des moines suburbs continues to narrow. in 2018, four state house seats and one congressional seat went from red to blue. in 2019, democrats in polk county won 13 seats on city councils and school boards that had been held previously by republicans.
along the way, his use of south bend as the backbone of his experience was both a boon to his candidacy and also a threat to undo his campaign at times. after a white police officer shot a black south bend resident in june, buttigieg was widely criticized for his handling of the matter — as well as his general relationship with the south bend police department and the city's minority residents. the shooting set off weeks of protests, briefly taking buttigieg off the campaign trail.
the saturday night live skits may be good-natured, laughable, but they go out to an estimated 9 million viewers. and they are consistent with a pattern in which reno, more even than other women in the clinton administration, has been incessantly sexualized: in the snl skits, on late-night tv, in jokes, in rumors, at washington dinner parties, on at least one recent videotape in which small-time right-wing politicians declaim pompously against her, a videotape anonymously shipped to the washington post and labeled janet reno – evil lesbian. the culture gropes for an archetype, a way to understand her, some means of comparison. after the waco disaster and her truman-like assumption of responsibility, spy magazine superimposed reno's head over the pumped-up pectorals of arnold schwarzenegger in the terminator. more recently, the weekly world news tabloid superimposed her head over the body of a fleshy model wearing a swimsuit and platform shoes (janet reno . . . as you've never seen her before! promised the headline to the story, which purported to show how men in japan salivate over reno), while jay leno took the opposite approach, superimposing her head on the body of xena: warrior princess, a tv heroine who is also a lesbian icon. the culture, in short, is confused. is she ma kettle, hillbilly dominatrix? is she nurse ratched, humorless and repressed? is she jimmy stewart, gregory peck, joan of arc? she's hit from all sides.
they would marry after douglass was honorably discharged from the 54th massachusetts volunteer infantry following the civil war. (his was the regiment depicted in the movie glory.)
they took turns asking zaun questions about issues that concerned them. when one asked him to fight for more money to go toward education, another held up her cellphone to record zaun responding that he would rather try to find ways to cut administrative costs. this was potential fodder to argue that zaun was weak on school funding.
marino was first elected in 2010 to represent much of the same territory, in what was at the time the most republican-leaning pennsylvania district represented by a democrat. chris carney, a moderate democrat who'd worked on counterintelligence for the bush administration, won the seat in 2006 after don sherwood, a formerly safe republican incumbent, was revealed to have conducted a years-long abusive affair.
that opening, along with another statewide contest next year in which gov. mike dewine is expected to face at least one trump-aligned primary challenger, is likely to make ohio a central battleground for control of the republican party, and an inviting one for mr. trump, who held on to ohio in the election while losing three other northern battleground states, the times reports.
notable: retired gen. lloyd austin officially took the helm of the department of defense, with vice president harris (d-calif.) swearing him in.
they get it, maybe better than anybody, what the jokesters are doing, the easy target that is appearance. they marvel at how, if they'd talked to janet reno on the phone, they would have thought her gentle, petite; how, based on the way she looks, people get a different idea entirely. they marvel at how impressions are formed, how people react to people who are not conventional, people who are not like them, people who do not walk the narrow norm. it's men, says lisa. they can't see a woman being an attorney general. some men, says another youth force member, j.j. galay. i wonder, says cory, if we'll ever have a black man or a woman or a jewish president. they all wonder about this. they are not optimistic. they know about the power of image. they're just like reno, they feel, because they're young, because they're different, because they're ethnic, because people see them and leap to conclusions. to janet reno she may be merely janet reno; to them she is janet reno, she is a woman, she is a tall woman, and all of those things affect how people deal with her, how they react. at the same time she is more than that: she is them. nobody knows us, says ramesh, and they sit there, four kids from the streets of new york, profoundly sympathizing with the attorney general of the united states. liza mundy is a staff writer for the magazine.
but mr. miller also said he did not regret that the incident may have ended his statewide potential. as it turned out, he served another three decades as senate president, his influence uninterrupted at the state house while moving trucks pulled up to the governor's mansion across the way every four or eight years.
republican leaders have repeatedly accused the new majority of cutting corners in their haste to shake up the status quo.
checks and balances, as conway explains it to me, is not an attack on the federalist society but a reminder of the core principles the society has stood for ever since that band of students gathered at yale. and now, here in a corner of the vast, tingling network, another connection is being made.
would an era have pushed forward women's rights dramatically?
• create a pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the u.s.
i'll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated, but removing it entirely was a mistake, the younger hefner wrote on twitter. nudity was never the problem because nudity isn't a problem. today we're taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are.
negotiations were ongoing between local authorities, the church and protesters to mitigate tensions, eimiller said.
right after college i went to work for john kerry, june of 2004. it was one of those deals where you graduate, pack a bag and go where they tell you. i thought i was going to d.c., so i moved there, started sleeping on a friend's couch, and then got a phone call from arizona: 'i hear you're my new research director.' i'm like, 'oh, okay.' they said, 'do you have a car?' no, i didn't. 'well, buy one tomorrow, start driving, and you can be here at work on friday.' so that's what i did.
trump went on a tweetstorm this morning, attacking pelosi and blaming democrats for the shutdown while claiming a new caravan of migrants is on the way:
it's not uncommon for young people to hold liberal views that moderate as they age. but gen zers grew up in a very different world than previous generations. the oldest among them was 11 when the first black president was elected. they became teenagers as same-sex marriage was legalized around the country. they also, according to pew, will be the most racially diverse and well-educated generation.
claims for exemptions based on religious beliefs aren't new, melling said, and they were raised after civil rights laws were enacted to prevent racial discrimination. bob jones university, which previously banned interracial dating, lost a supreme court case when the court ruled that the first amendment did not prevent the irs from revoking the tax-exempt status of a religious university whose practices are contrary to compelling government interest.
plenty of liberal-leaning writers have pushed back on the idea that supporting bds is anti-semitic; republicans have replied by pointing out that senate democratic leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) says that it is. the democratic party's shift to the left since 2016 hasn't met much resistance from its establishment and didn't stop it from winning the midterms. but many campaigns have been tripped up by associations, both by having them and by seeming skittish if they ended them.
• re-evaluate trump's tariffs on chinese goods. biden said he would work with u.s. allies, with the goal of exerting collective leverage to force china to change its economic practices.
our movement was intended to bring light and awareness to the hateful rhetoric taught by this group, the activist organization said of the church. we understand that what they preach can make people upset. however, we would never promote, encourage or condone any violence or acts of harm.
my research suggests the impact would be less dramatic. first, the era would probably affect supreme court decisions indirectly, by raising sex equality to the status of a fundamental right and increasing the standard that the supreme court would apply in determining whether a law that discriminates on the basis of sex violates the constitution. that would make it more likely that courts would favor those who sought gender equality. second, the era would not constitutionally protect women in most cases of violence against women. i'll explain below.
on monday, the senate general laws and technology committee passed separate housing and employment bills, sending them to the floor. two republicans signed on to the housing measure for the first time: sens. bryce e. reeves (r-fredericksburg) and frank m. ruff jr. (r-mecklenburg). sen. richard h. black (r-loudoun), one of the legislature's most outspoken conservatives, cast the only no vote in committee, although reeves and ruff joined him in opposing the employment bill.
this younger generation is much more likely to see climate change as a result of human behavior and to believe black americans are treated unfairly.
i got that email, he says.
the ties between jcn and leo are opaque. jcn's office is on the same hallway as the federalist society in a downtown washington building, though jcn's website and tax filings list a mailing address at a different location, an address shared by multiple companies.
what i thought was going to be an afternoon ceremony with 50 attendees has turned into an evening ceremony with 90, followed by an outdoor party with a dj and loud music into the wee hours.
barack obama wished his wife, michelle, a happy birthday:
for all his adaptability, mr. miller was stubborn when it came to history. in 2017, he was widely criticized for opposing the removal from the state capitol grounds of a statue of roger taney, the maryland-born supreme court chief justice who supported the 1857 dred scott decision that blacks in free or slave states could not be citizens.
• guarantee 12 weeks of paid leave from work for new parents or those caring for an ill family member. an employee on leave would get two-thirds of his or her pay, up to $4,000. the bill biden supports would fund this by increasing the payroll tax paid by employers and workers.
we are a family now, mcadams said. and i've got more best friends and sisters and brothers than i did three years ago. i'd be damned if i lost contact with them after 2018. nothing is stopping us now because we are a family, and donald trump is still president.
turning to me, conway says: that's one of the young people who just loves what we're doing. … he's a recent law school graduate, a few years out, and a clerk for a really prominent judge here in the district. … the younger people really feel it, and their view is: this will end, the current era. and they're going to be around a long time, and they're not worried that it's going to affect their careers.
his wife, coretta scott king, then pregnant with their third child, feared her husband would be killed in jail. her fear turned to terror after he was yanked from his cell in the middle of the night and taken to a maximum-security prison in reidsville, ga. by the time she reached mr. wofford, a friend since the 1955-1956 montgomery bus boycott, she was hysterical.
he promised to usher in generational change to the white house and deliberately avoided releasing detailed plans at first, though he spoke of big ideas like abolishing the electoral college and restructuring the supreme court.
news you can use if you live in d.c.:
for too long progressives were ceding that constitutional ground to the right and organizations like the federalist society, says elizabeth wydra, president of the constitutional accountability center, a progressive think tank and law firm that fashions originalist arguments. when you actually look at the text and history of the entire constitution, particularly focusing on the transformative amendments that were enacted in the wake of the civil war, you really see an arc of progress that pushes our country toward inclusion, equality and greater democracy that tells a very different story from a lot of what the folks on the right, including the federalist society, would have you believe about our constitution. the cac has made originalist arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion rights. its position is that those rights are guaranteed by a textual and historical understanding of the original meaning of the 14th amendment's equal protection clause. the cac also is using an originalist reading of the foreign emoluments clause as it represents members of congress who claim trump is unconstitutionally benefiting from foreign payments.
civil rights demonstrators gather for a we want change rally at the lincoln memorial in washington on june 6 to protest the killing of george floyd. (matt mcclain/the washington post) biden justice department will be different by matt zapotosky the justice department in the biden administration is likely to increase resources for the civil rights division and resume wide-ranging scrutiny of troubled police departments nationwide, analysts say, as president-elect joe biden seeks to fulfill his campaign promises of combating systemic racism and fighting for equal rights. with those words, the president of the united states assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it, biden said. and at that moment, i knew the threat to this nation was unlike any i had ever seen in my lifetime. as biden takes office, he will now have to address that threat himself, as hate crimes are on the rise and analysts say white supremacists and other domestic extremists have been emboldened by president trump. read the full story arrow-right
there's one little hitch in the performance, when he praises wexton for being in the minority in the state assembly and still passing four pieces of major legislation. (actually, it's 40, she says, interjecting with a smile but an unmistakable note of sharpness.) buttigieg plays it off laughingly, saying he's so much more impressed with her now, since in our legislature back home, four bills for a democrat would be quite a feat, and hands over the mic to the candidate, who smiles a bit warily, looking like she knows she's been upstaged.
-- marci whitaker, who is married to acting attorney general matt whitaker, sent an email to a slate reporter who wrote a critical article about her husband. in her message, marci whitaker said her husband should not have to recuse himself from the mueller probe, which she described as wrapping up. it isn't really or shouldn't be that controversial to state that the mueller investigation should stay within the parameters given. particularly when that is said more than a year prior as the investigation is just beginning, she wrote, apparently referring to her husband's past criticism of the probe. and by all means, assume that a person who speculated on a hypothetical scenario would then put some dark plan into motion, when by all accounts, the investigation is wrapping up and [the] eyes of the nation are upon them.
there are many ways to divvy up the democratic field: one easy way is to divide the evolved candidates with the ones who've never really changed. supporters of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) frequently point out that he has talked (and to some extent looked) the same for his entire career in politics, advocating for a european-style welfare state, moving to the left on only gun rights and some aspects of criminal justice reform. rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii), a 2016 sanders backer who is bidding for his voters, has already apologized for her previous, heated opposition to lgbt rights, releasing a three-minute video this week to explain how she changed.
a dozen years later, democratic candidates and potential ones now argue that more barricades are not what is needed at the border. candidates who once dodged questions about same-sex marriage now support it and are calling for greater protection of transgender individuals. medicare-for-all — or something like it — has become standard, along with promises to combat racism, sexism and global climate change.
by 2011 — while in the white house — he had come around: he privately told his advisers he approved of gay marriage. but for public circulation, his aides wanted only to promote the line that he was evolving. to some liberals, obama's reticence reflected a lack of political courage. obama has liberal instincts and will effectuate progressive reforms, wrote harvard law professor randall kennedy in his book the persistence of the color line, but only if he can do so without getting uncomfortably close to what he perceives to be too high a political price.
it is much more likely that anything involving the state corporation commission will be at a much later date, gilbert said.
you're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free, he said at the time. and so it's just passe at this juncture.
warnock's candidacy flew somewhat under the radar in the lead-up to the 2020 election, and his political profile was lower going into that race than that of ossoff, who had competed in big races before this one.
the idea came to me. . . . why shouldn't he just call mrs. king? mr. wofford recounted in the oral history voices of freedom by henry hampton and steve fayer. she was very anxious. . . . why can't kennedy at least just call her and say, 'we're working at it; we're going to get him out. you have my sympathy.' a personal, direct act.
another woman told opus dei that she was made uncomfortable by the way mccloskey hugged her, the group told the post. the community says it is investigating a third claim described by an opus dei spokesman as potentially serious. in a statement, monsignor thomas bohlin, the opus dei vicar, said mccloskey's actions at the center were deeply painful for the woman who made the initial complaint and we are very sorry for all she suffered.
in a letter dated june 20, 1877, whitman wrote:
that's what i mean. you can be a grown-a– man like matt here and don't recall us not being at war. which is a whole 'nother part of it. look how many candidates this year — including 11 of the house candidates he's been boosting — are young veterans. i think the sense of obligation kicked in, the awareness that it's part of a civic duty and a moral failure when you only have other people fighting your wars. and in my case, that included a lot of the people i was commanding in the reserves. that's part of what pushed me into it. i thought, 'why not me?' 
my own dear amelia: how can i express the pleasure it affords me to receive a letter written by hand of her i love. . . .
mr. miller clung to his grudges as if they were prized treasures. those who crossed the boss, as one colleague described betraying mr. miller, could find their legislative proposals — and their political careers — extinguished. after then-del. patricia h. billings (d-montgomery) opposed legislation he supported, mr. miller sent her a christmas card. i haven't forgotten your vote, he wrote.
the media blitz coincided with yet another campaign to promote gorsuch's nomination, by judicial crisis network. jcn announced that it would spend $10 million, calling it the most robust operation in the history of confirmation battles. crc, its media consultant on the campaign, later boasted that online videos, television ads, pundit commentary, opinion essays and other material supporting gorsuch had been viewed 1.2 billion times.
caffeine and cocktails: sweetleaf, which was founded by a queens native, has two lic locations: the original site in a 19th-century building with a vinyl records room in the back and a waterfront store that transforms into a bar (with alcoholic coffee beverages) after 5 p.m. if you've grown immune to multiple espresso shots, etto espresso bar amps up the jolt with the bulletproof latte, an espresso drink mixed with kerrygold butter and high-octane brain oil. for coffee with a cause, order a cup of coffeed, which donates a percentage of sales to a local charity. at lic landing, which serves the locally roasted beans, the money goes to hunters point parks conservancy. you won't be the first — or last — person to walk past dutch kills, a speakeasy with discreet signage. hint: look for the blinking bar sign above. inside the former warehouse, the bar is replete with dark wood and brownout lighting. order a drink from the menu, which looks as if it were banged out by a frustrated novelist, or drop a few key words like ginger and don't like the taste of alcohol and the bartender will whip up a drink that fits your low (or high) tolerance for booze. the long island city brewery tour features four stops, including big alice brewing, which occupies a former bible storage facility.
the host pressed gillibrand to answer for her transformation from a conservative congresswoman representing a rural district into an outspoken liberal senator. so, 10 years ago, when i became senator … i recognized i didn't know everything about the whole state, and one of the first things i did was i travel to brooklyn, she replied. and i met with a family who had just lost their daughter, a teenage girl, who was shot with a stray bullet. … i just knew i was wrong, and i knew i had to do something to make sure that young beautiful girl did not die in vain. … and, now, i've been a leader on these issues.
that strategy, built by communications director lis smith, allowed buttigieg to rise to prominence in a field that didn't seem likely to have much room for someone like him. along the way, it underlined a key point about politics in the trump era: even without experience, money or organization, if a candidate — even an un­or­tho­dox one — knows how to play the media, he can catapult to prominence.
to assess the potential effect of a federal era, we can examine the impact of state-level equal rights amendments, which half the states have. california passed the first one in 1879, prohibiting workplace-based sex discrimination; delaware is the most recent, having adopted such an amendment just last year. maine, minnesota and new york may be getting close.
tom vilsack, the former agriculture secretary who was iowa's governor from 1999 to 2007, remembered producing a 30-year plan for the state at the turn of the century, suggesting that it could become a hub for immigrants — and being blown back by the reaction.
and why, in a multi-national study such as this, is so much attention paid to memphis, tenn., which is hardly typical of the united states let alone of western europe (but which happens to be the location of rhodes college, where the author was a visiting professor and availed himself of the city's research facilities)? but these are incidental details compared with the main issue: the nature of the revolution itself. and here marwick has made a genuine contribution, first in affirming the reality of the cultural revolution as it manifested itself in so many spheres of life; then in showing how that revolution permeated and transformed mainstream society; and finally in putting it all in an international perspective, exposing the differences and yet basic similarities provided by the perspective. for americans especially, it is useful to be reminded that the american experience was not unique -- certainly not the product, as is sometimes suggested, of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war. and the insistence upon the interaction between the dominant culture and the counter-culture (the term itself was coined in 1968) is also fruitful, obliging us to recall another aspect of the revolution that is too often forgotten, the fact that so many of the revolutionaries proved to be imaginative, ambitious and eminently successful commercial entrepreneurs, creating whole industries out of the counter-culture itself -- boutiques, experimental theatres, art galleries, discotheques, nightclubs, 'light shows', 'head shops', photographic and model agencies, underground films, pornographic magazines.
in the interview with the post, leo said he took time off from the federalist society — a charity that says it does not endorse specific nominees — during the nomination fights in 2005 and 2006. the group's tax filings show that his compensation in those two years jumped by nearly 50 percent, to about $328,000 annually. leo did not respond to a question about how his compensation was affected by his time off. a spokesman for the federalist society said leo's pay went up — despite the time off — because of the organization's extraordinary revenue growth. back at the federalist society the following year, his compensation was $419,000.
bh group is a private firm whose team of professionals, which includes leonard leo, provides management and consulting services to philanthropists and nonprofits, a crc spokesman for leo said in a statement. like similar firms on the left, its clients are private as are the details of the work for them.
chasten normally joins his husband onstage after rallies, but saturday night, the buttigiegs lingered in a noticeably longer hug than usual — a rare sign of the emotional toll the campaign was taking on pete buttigieg, who knew then the end was near.
the federalist society, a charity, has regularly paid him more than $400,000 in annual compensation in recent years, tax filings show. in 2016, the catholic association paid him $120,000 for management consulting.
adoption without freedom of consent is not consensual adoption. i don't know how else it can possibly be described, he told the washington post.
he also became more adept at managing media campaigns. in a previously undisclosed email, leo boasted to a colleague in 2009 about his savvy at generating free publicity through the federalist society.
the final vote was 84 to 15, with mcconnell (r-ky.) among those supporting yellen.
terri harrison went to london when she discovered she was pregnant, only to be tracked down by a priest and nuns, who brought her back to ireland and placed her in a mother and baby home.
but he refused to talk about the money behind his advocacy, saying, i'm not particularly knowledgeable about a lot of it.
i read in the new york times today that if i run for president, one of my problems will be that i like republicans, biden said. he made the sign of the cross. bless me, father, for i have sinned.
i have a very simple rule, which is, i'm engaged in the battle of ideas, and i care very deeply about our constitution and the role of courts in our society, he said. and i don't waste my time on stories that involve money and politics because what i care about is ideas.
martin spoke after the long-awaited release of a 3,000-page report from the commission on mother and baby homes, which investigated conditions for the 56,000 unmarried mothers and 57,000 children who passed through the system — at 18 homes run by the state and by catholic charities — from 1920 until 1998, when the last facility was shuttered.
miss manners need hardly point out how silly it is to apply this automatically to brides who are out on their own and self-sufficient. weddings are family occasions, and families should talk them over and decide, without pressuring one another, what each element feels it can comfortably contribute. only then should the plans be made so that they are affordable.
the mayoral pitch, which we're going to hear more and more this year, has an advantage over a pitch from any other sort of democrat: it is a story of endless building, compromises and success. most mayors who've taken office since 2010 have presided over economic growth; the controversies that can dog them, starting with accusations that gentrification and big businesses are benefiting the most from the economy, are overwhelmed by stories about how well these mayors know their communities.
things started innocently when colton chose 23-year-old hannah b. (also known as miss alabama 2018) for the season's first one-on-one date, which included bachelor staples: a drive in an absurd-looking car, a horseback ride, and a sit-down on a couch (followed by a dip in a hot tub) in the middle of the desert.
that custom was causing trouble long before gay weddings became legal. it referred to a time when brides were married from under their parents' guardianship, and the wedding expense was offset by the expectation that all subsequent living expenses would be paid by the bridegrooms.
bringing back nudity may not solve all the magazine's problems, samir husni, a journalism professor at the university of mississippi, told the associated press on monday.
co-pastoring is a growing trend in u.s. houses of worship, with many churches and couples finding that sharing the often-emotionally heavy workload can benefit both the clergy and the congregants.
political activism and ministry are intertwined in the black church, and that was the case throughout warnock's career: over the years, warnock has advocated for expanding medicaid, the federal and state program that helps cover medical costs for those with limited incomes; expanding the affordable care act; protecting the voting rights of marginalized americans; opposing the death penalty; supporting abortion rights; and same-sex marriage.
the democratic activists saw it differently. when the forum started, they took their seats. there was nothing particularly coordinated about them; they weren't wearing special uniforms or reciting catchy slogans. they didn't even sit next to one another.
whether we think of ourselves as christians, hindus, muslims, sikh, buddhists, jews, atheists, agnostics, or anything else, it is imperative that we stand united in our commitment to protect religious freedom and the right to worship or not worship, safely and without the fear of retribution, gabbard said.
the small center — its members and its leaders — continue to have an outsize impact on policy and politics. it is the conservative spiritual and intellectual center that mccloskey had imagined and its influence is felt in all of washington's corridors of power.

mr. miller graduated from the university of maryland in 1964 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and a law degree in 1967. in 1965, he married patricia given, a college classmate. in addition to his wife, survivors include five children — melissa miller of chesapeake beach, michelle miller fink and melanie miller, both of annapolis, tommy miller jr. of west river, md., and amanda miller stokely of sunderland, md. — as well as three brothers, five sisters and 15 grandchildren.
today, the united states conference of catholic bishops issued an ill-considered statement on the day of president biden's inauguration. aside from the fact that there is seemingly no precedent for doing so, the statement, critical of president biden came as a surprise to many bishops, who received it just hours before it was released, cupich wrote, challenging the idea that gomez's words were endorsed by or represent u.s. bishops. the internal institutional failures involved must be addressed, and i look forward to contributing to all efforts to that end, so that, inspired by the gospel, we can build up the unity of the church, and together take up the work of healing our nation in this moment of crisis.
rep. liz cheney (r-wyo.), the number three house republican, is also on trump's personal hit list, per haberman and epstein, after she became the only member of house gop leadership to vote to impeach the former president.
we lost in 2016, and the largest single factor in that loss was that we coudln't match our previous performance with the obama coalition, one of them said. we couldn't match the enthusiasm. that is a long-run problem — how does he inspire more enthusiasm than hillary? young black voters who fell off in 2016 weren't excited by hillary, so how does joe biden fix that? is it when people start talking about his votes against busing?
by the last page of this very long book, in his opinion, the ifs and buts, on the one hand and on the other, are resolved, as marwick happily looks back to a period that, in his opinion, was so much better than those that preceded or followed it: gone was the stuffy conservatism of previous decades, while the radical, divisive, philistine conservatism of reagan and thatcher was yet to come. one has come a long way from the opening page, where marwick deplored the political polemic, nostalgic mythologizing, and downright misrepresentation of both sides in this debate. although there is much valuable material in his own voluminous work, it too is a notable contribution to that polemical genre.
still, his campaign vowed to press on through super tuesday, arguing that buttigieg was the best-positioned moderate candidate to challenge sanders. buttigieg increasingly targeted the vermont senator, warning that nominating sanders would be detrimental for down-ballot races.
the next year, leo joined forces with wealthy conservative donor rebekah mercer and stephen k. bannon, then the chairman of breitbart news, on the board of a small charity known as reclaim new york. mercer and bannon would go on to play central roles in trump's insurgent campaign, mercer as a leading financial backer and bannon as campaign chief.
the original ambition was not so grand. a handful of conservative law students at the university of chicago, yale and harvard in the early 1980s wanted an outlet for their maverick notions of the law amid the liberal domination of the legal academy. when we started the federalist society, we didn't know we were starting the federalist society, lee liberman otis, one of the chicago co-founders, told me. we thought we were starting groups at each of our law schools. … 'let's start something where we could talk about those ideas.' 
other bishops put out more subtle rebukes of gomez.
warnock has always held king, a fellow georgia native, in high regard. one of his mentors at st. john baptist church was quoted as recalling that the civil rights icon was warnock's ideal — which is in part why he went to morehouse college, the historically black men's college king also attended.

ms. st. james later returned to the united states, making her bid for elective office in san francisco in 1996. (she was said to have sought the republican nomination for president in 1980, but the extent of her efforts were unclear.)
her crusade started with a desire to remove trump, but it was also about herself. after the great unsettling of 2016, she realized she hadn't taken stock of her neighborhood, which had grown so much that she could hardly recognize it.
we don't have any information leading us to believe that the demonstrators in the past are in any way responsible for this, reynoso said.
white house press secretary jen psaki has said biden does not plan to change his views on senate rules (that the 60-vote supermajority should stay).
• lower the eligibility age for medicare, government health insurance for the elderly, to 60 from 65.
when the democratic candidates began to file in 2018 and 2019, she urged her group members to do everything they could to elect them.
• forgive up to $10,000 in student loan debt per american. this appears to be something biden could do on his own, though it would be expensive -- $390 billion, by one measure.
if you looked up 'political opportunism' in the dictionary, kirsten gillibrand's photo would be next to it, republican national committee spokesman michael ahrens said last week. from jumping on the 'abolish ice' bandwagon to turning on the clintons, gillibrand always goes where the political wind blows. democrats know it, which is why she's barely registering in the polls.
this one is not a dance party skit, but the concept is the same: to emphasize her tough stiff awkward side – the only side of her that americans are aware of, since the only time most of us see her is on tv, during high-profile confrontations – while making up this imaginary silly side. see! ferrell says, as reno's bedroom appears on the screen. things like the fact that she's with the big simba doll, and her bedroom's kind of frilly. like, why would she have that? he watches as reno clambers up on her bed. between the glasses and the work of the wig department, ferrell's is not a bad likeness. but the mannerisms aren't based on the woman, he says, just her broad outline. in this, ferrell's reno is very different from darrell hammond's clinton, the only other running political character at the moment on snl, which has produced some of the nation's memorable political impersonations, among them dana carvey's george bush. carvey was so bush-like you could imagine him on the presidential succession list. similarly, hammond has studied clinton so closely that he's developed a theory, in listening to him, that the president has had extensive dental work. ferrell doesn't go in for details like that. i just sound the way she looks, he says, which is to say tough. when he dances, he patterns his jerky movements after those of a college chum. a male college chum.
on parenting spoke with four gay men who had all entered fatherhood in the past 10 years through different means. one adopted through foster care, and another had an open adoption through a private agency. another worked with a surrogate in the united states, and one worked with a surrogate overseas. their experiences and geographies were varied, but several themes emerged. the road toward fatherhood may be more smoothly paved than it was 10 years ago, but there are still significant challenges.
but already pending for the south florida retiree is a trio of lawsuits that allege defamation, fraud and more fraud — all of which are helmed by one attorney.
he added that over the past two years, hirono has been attacked by right wing ideologues for her examination of donald trump's ideologically-driven nominees to the courts.
she once described her group as a weapon in the republican conservative arsenal that caters to donors who want a high return on their investment for their political dollars, according to a video of a speech she made at the nonprofit david horowitz freedom center.

in my adult life, politically, no one has inspired me to get off the sidelines and truly make a difference more than hillary clinton has, gillibrand wrote in a january 2016 essay endorsing clinton for president. clinton wrote a foreword for gillibrand's 2014 memoir.

chasten was also the first onstage at buttigieg's south bend event sunday, and he delivered an emotional introduction in which he told the crowd his husband had helped him believe in himself again, and that he urged him to run for president because i knew there were other kids in this country who needed to believe in themselves, too.
death valley national park in california released a time-lapse video showing the hours it took two park rangers to prepare a restroom for reopening:
in 2018, a similar bill was passed by argentina's chamber of deputies but came up short in the senate. by 2020, advocates for legalization had president alberto fernández on their side; fernández had defeated antiabortion incumbent president mauricio macri in 2019.
david's father, the sponsor of the protection of marriage initiative, which will be put before voters here in march, is state sen. william pete knight, a conservative republican from palmdale who has attempted--and failed--five times in the state house to pass similar legislation declaring that marriage is only for a man and a woman. neither david nor pete knight is discussing the matter with the news media, but pete knight did issue a statement saying, i care deeply about my son, and adding he regrets that david felt he needed to force a private, family matter into the public forum. he suggested that he and his son were closer than what david knight told readers of the newspaper. three years ago, the senator, who also is a former test pilot who holds the guinness book of world records mark for flying speed at 4,520 mph, publicly acknowledged that his son is gay, as was his younger brother, who died of aids. the question of who makes a marriage is surfacing now because of recent attempts in states such as hawaii and vermont to legalize and sanction gay marriages. if a same-gender couple were to get a legal marriage certificate in, say, montpelier--as hollywood's famous lesbian couple ellen degeneres and anne heche suggested they might--and then come home to california, the state might have to recognize the union. but in 1996, president clinton signed the federal defense of marriage act, which essentially gave each state the right to determine its own laws on same-sex marriage.
her biggest role model is her late mother, shyamala gopalan, an indian immigrant, civil rights activist and breast cancer researcher who raised two daughters mostly by herself. during her presidential campaign and in the months since she was added to the democratic ticket, harris has spoken of her mother as much as trump or biden or anyone else, most often to share a piece of advice gopalan drilled into her as a child.
intentional is a word that emerged as a sort of motto for each couple interviewed.
one government employee expressed her frustration with congress in writing, per a post reporter:
something about his delivery, his profile and his demeanor sparked nationwide interest. boyish and eloquent, buttigieg seemed simultaneously to answer some democrats' urgent desire for an anti-trump and their long-standing hunger for candidates who are fresh-faced and rhetorically agile, like john f. kennedy and obama.

or to 1814. two weeks ago, rioters invaded the capitol, the first time such a thing had happened since british forces tried to burn it down. they smashed windows, toppled artifacts, rifled through senators' private desks in search of evidence that would help them literally turn back the clock, negating the results of a free and fair election.
in my past, i said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were hurtful to people in the lgbtq community and to their loved ones, she said. i'm deeply sorry for having said them. my views have changed significantly since then, and my record in congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart.
when buttigieg decided to undertake the dnc race in 2017 — gambling that if he couldn't knock off keith ellison and tom perez, the favorites of the sanders and clinton camps, he could at least give his future a rocket-boost and once again win by losing — he debated circles around the two front-runners, and charmed cable-news viewers and grizzled party elders with his unexpected eloquence and fresh vision for the party, which included a bundle of bright ideas for digital strategies. right before the vote, headed for a third-place finish, he bowed out and returned to south bend with enough new backers to form a super pac that would give him an excuse to travel the country in 2018 and lay the groundwork for 2020.
it would be helpful if the language were a little bit stronger because the level of tension is so high, collins told reporters outside her office.
the fringe includes internet fulminators upset by her miami campaign against deadbeat dads or by waco or simply by federal law enforcement in general. among other things, the fulminators regularly fabricate bogus press releases (some of which have found their way into newspapers and provoked letters of inquiry from congressional offices) attempting to persuade the nation that reno favors parental licensing, or that she believes that a cultist is one who has a strong belief in the bible. but at a certain point, the images of janet reno these days cross over the predictable borders of political partisanship and even the ordinary borders of american heartland paranoia, and slip into someplace else entirely – the realm of intense cultural anxiety about women in power. there is something about her, rocklike and unbleached, that simultaneously fascinates and confounds and even terrifies the popular imagination: how exactly do you make sense of such a tall woman, such a strong woman, such a quiet woman, such a shy woman? how do you find a way to portray the complexities of an introvert who is constantly in the public eye, a lawyer who loves to work, a nerd, a physically rugged outdoorswoman who loves to kayak and hike, an aging woman, a woman who can sit through daylong congressional hearings with hardly a break? why, you portray her as a man, or as a slut, or as a lesbian, or, better yet, as some strange and awful combination of the three!

enough is enough, gillibrand wrote in a facebook post. the women who have come forward are brave and i believe them. while it's true that his behavior is not the same as the criminal conduct alleged against roy moore, or harvey weinstein, or president trump, it is still unquestionably wrong, and should not be tolerated.a few days later, gillibrand called on trump to immediately resign because he had been accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women.
barnett realized he had misread the federalist society. despite his initial impression of a closed conservative sect, the society seemed open to testing a diversity of ideas — and speaking on that panel changed his professional life. he switched from contracts to constitutional law. he made himself an expert on the ninth amendment, which got him involved in a case seeking to protect people from federal prosecution for using medical marijuana in california, where the state had legalized it. the case ended up relying not on the ninth amendment, but on the commerce clause — a strict reading of which is a favorite federalist tool for curbing federal power. barnett argued the matter before the supreme court in 2004. he lost — but in the process he developed some subtle jujitsu moves with the commerce clause.

i do know how it got started — the shooting and the town hall meeting, said gladys muhammad, a black south bend native who stumped on buttigieg's behalf. those of us who were not involved and just in the community, we decided not to speak. we decided to let the grass-roots people voice their concerns because they needed to be heard. we wanted that to happen. as angry as they were, they needed to say what they needed to say. we stepped back and didn't say anything.
but it'll all be worth it, he replied.
but after so much progress, hefner wrote, our hard-won victories are in peril. just as the social and political pendulum had swung in liberals' favor, as history has shown time after time, the pendulum swings back.
experts who have followed gillibrand's rise said the impression that she has hair-trigger judgment and an overriding instinct to capi­tal­ize on the political moment could prove more problematic than any one shift on policy.
in 2010, leo served on the board of a tea party group called liberty central. ginni thomas, wife of justice clarence thomas, received $120,511 as the start-up's president that year. she later stepped down following questions about possible conflicts of interest, saying the issue had become a distraction for the group.
mr. miller survived various threats to his power, including a failed attempt to oust him in 2000 led by state sen. thomas l. bromwell (d-baltimore). two years later, the legislature's ethics panel rebuked mr. miller for yelling at two appeals court judges about a pending dispute over redistricting maps. he also faced scrutiny from federal prosecutors investigating contributions to a campaign fund he oversaw. no charges were filed.

the announcement comes on the heels of the revelation trump considered replacing acting attorney general, jeffrey rosen, with a different department lawyer, jeffrey bossert clark, who was more amenable to wielding the department's power to help keep trump in office.
the strategy initially paid off. buttigieg went on to narrowly win the iowa caucuses in february and came in second in new hampshire. his troubles appealing to minority voters, however, hampered him as the race moved on to more diverse states. he came in third in nevada and fourth in south carolina, winning over only two percent of the state's black voters.

-- the dnc said it was among those targeted in a widespread cyberattack detected after the midterms. abc news's maryalice parks and lee ferran report: 'on november 14, 2018, dozens of dnc email addresses were targeted in a spear-phishing campaign, although there is no evidence that the attack was successful,' the dnc wrote in an amended complaint filed late thursday, part of an ongoing lawsuit against the russian government, the 2016 donald trump campaign and others. the dnc said that the content and the timing of the emails led the organization to believe it was targeted as part of a wider phishing campaign that cybersecurity firms had previously said appeared to use some of the same technical tricks as a russian hacking group known as cozy bear, or apt 29.
mr. miller's early years in the state legislature and his reign as a boss of the prince george's democratic organization coincided with the county's transition from majority white to majority black. mr. miller adapted by forging alliances with a number of rising black leaders.
historically, younger people are less civically engaged and vote in fewer numbers than older generations. in 2018, 31 percent of eligible millennials voted in the midterms. if millennials and gen zers increased their participation in elections, they could have the power to decide the outcome.
a few hours before the fundraiser, mr. miller agreed to an interview with a local television reporter, who asked why he was hosting the affair far from his legislative district. it helps educate my constituents as to why baltimore needs the economic help, mr. miller said. i mean baltimore is a goddamn ghetto. it's worse than inner-city washington, d.c. it is shit.
after a quick scan of the dingy thrift shop — matt, look, $7 suits! — we follow him into lou's soul food, which smells like 30 years of fried food. it's a buffet, he says, as if that settles things, and we find a table near the back to talk about his first campaign experience.
this time, the turnout is clearly not going to be a disappointment; we start to see the lines of very nice parked cars a couple of blocks before we reach the mcmansion that is our destination. inside, the vast open living, dining and kitchen space is jammed with well-off white people in high cocktail mode. only wexton recognizes the special guest, and they chat briefly before the folks are hushed and buttigieg (pronounced properly) is introduced.
trump, whose campaign made animosity to immigrants a central theme, won the state in 2016 by almost 10 points.
here is what i think about time travel, and the longing for it: the only real time machines are our own bodies, carrying through from the past to the future. the only real way to travel through time is to move through it, day by day.
the vibe: lic still has grit under its fingernails. the subway rumbles overhead, and warehouses sit abandoned on forlorn streets. on a misty night, i half expected humphrey bogart to appear out of the shadows. during the day, the city is frenetic, but you can always find a quiet place along the river or under an idled crane. unlike other boroughs, you don't need to squeeze into a pair of skinny jeans and cultivate a beard to fit in. wear what you want and, if you say hello to an licer, you might receive an even grander salutation in return: during a big apple greeter tour, a resident in the hunters point historic district invited us into his home to ogle his property and play with his one-eyed dog.
i've really just lost faith in the republicans, said toebben, who planned on caucusing with democrats for the first time. i understand the realities of politics, but i also understand that you have got to see the bigger picture in life. i think they've lost track of the big picture.
if you say a magistrate wants exemption … the government is then licensing discrimination, melling said.
russ vought, who led [trump's] office of management and budget, plans to announce two pro-trump organizations tuesday, aiming to provide the ideological ammunition to sustain trump's political movement after his departure from the white house, per nichols and markay.  … vought is among those who are staying close to trump. he's working to ensure that cultural issues that trump ran on, from transgender rights to critical race theory, remain front and center in the republican party and coming elections.
you know julia what i think we would be justifiable in doing if his consent is still withheld and i hope you think nearly with me. . . . you alone julia have it in your power to decide whether despite ev[e]rything we carry our engagement into effect. you have only to decide for me to act. if you will set a tim[e] when i must be in missouri i will be there no matter if my reg.t is still in texas. the matter is one of importance enough to procure a leave of absence, and besides for the love i bear my dear julia i would not value my commission to[o] highly to resign it. my happiness would be complete if a return mail should bring me a letter setting the time not — far distant — when i might 'clasp that little hand and call it mine.'
the ideological tension boiled over into tuesday's invocation in the house, where the rev. robert m. grant jr. of the father's way church in warrenton gave a prayer that railed against abortion and same-sex marriage, prompting most of the democratic caucus to walk out. even a few republicans retreated to the rear of the chamber.
people familiar with her role in the transition say that loyalty is harris's primary goal. biden has also made clear in multiple interviews since the election that he wants to empower harris to take the lead on certain issues when his plate is full. harris, meanwhile, has avoided outlining any priorities for herself.
i believe it is a moral question for me, she said. i've seen the hatred and the division that president trump has put out into our country, and it has called me to fight as hard as i possibly can to restore the moral compass of this country.

leonard leo stepped onto the stage in a darkened florida ballroom, looked out at a gathering of some of the nation's most powerful conservative activists and told them they were on the cusp of fulfilling a long-sought dream.
checking out a number of panels, i was impressed that, true to its claim, the federalist society really had invited capable liberal advocates to try to rebut conservative perspectives. people always treat me politely in these circumstances, but they always look at me in bemusement about how wrong i am, w. neil eggleston, former white house counsel for obama, quipped during the session on stare decisis. he cautioned the newly empowered majority on the supreme court against overturning landmark decisions such as roe v. wade just because it could with slim 5-to-4 majorities.
she is in many ways the ideal legal adversary to take on trump. kaplan is a brash and original strategist, with neither a gift for patience nor silence, a crusader for underdogs who has won almost every legal accolade imaginable. kaplan, says new york democratic gov. andrew m. cuomo in an email, has been indispensable in the fight against the cancer of hate and division that trump spent four years exacerbating.
this urge to have answers now, now, now is strong and can come across as inauthentic, said ted johnson, a senior fellow at the brennan center for justice who has observed gillibrand. it's okay to say, 'i didn't know.' it's okay to engage audiences. but it's not okay to compensate for the not knowing and the not engaging with a super strong position immediately in order to win them over. the thing about growth is that it takes time.
in november 2017, gillibrand said that bill clinton should have resigned during his presidency following his affair with a white house intern. that angered some clinton loyalists. former adviser philippe reines, who tweeted: over 20 yrs you took the clintons' endorsements, money, and seat. hypocrite. interesting strategy for 2020 primaries. best of luck.three weeks later, gillibrand called on her colleague franken to resign following accusations of sexual misconduct from several women. she was the first prominent democrat to do so, and many others followed, although she also faced criticism from members of her party and some major donors .

those bills always died — until tuesday, when the senate approved the measure. the house went a step further, making immigrants eligible for a conventional driver's license — though not the real id-compliant license that will be required to board an airplane or enter a federal facility, starting in october.

as they set out to find registered democrats, mcadams saw an ankeny beyond its stereotype. there were trailer parks, and residents there said they couldn't afford rising rents. middle-class-looking homes had sunken ceilings and no hot water inside.
essentially the reason he is suspending his campaign is the reason he started the campaign: his goal is to defeat the president and bring a new kind of politics to our country, a buttigieg aide said. he thought his candidacy would be best vehicle to do that. and when it became clear his candidacy was not the most viable vehicle to do that, he stepped aside to make sure [democrats] could still achieve those things.
the global opus dei community confirmed last week that it ordered mccloskey to leave washington in 2003 and said his priestly duties were restricted. subsequent reports have raised questions about whether his duties were restricted and in which ways. he was later sent to chicago and california. opus dei paid the woman a $977,000 sexual misconduct settlement in 2005.
rolling monologue is more like it. buttigieg is a human data-processor, one very interesting topic suggesting the next, punctuated by observations about something he's spotted out the window in passing. one minute he's telling me about his plans for the rest of the midterm election season, then he's asking me about the prospects for the campaigns i've covered, then he's on to the theory of parks and recreation, the wonders of tax-increment financing, the time he drove a van for al gore and got lost in boston, and the unpredictable dress codes at different kinds of campaign events. i was underdressed for the fundraiser in columbia. it turned out to be a very dignified thing at don fowler's house — the former dnc chief — and now this morning, i felt overdressed with the tie with the volunteers. it took me years to calibrate my way around south bend, and now i'm trying to crack the campaign dress code. i'm beginning to absorb the lifestyle of somebody who's running. most of our events have been surgical, flying in and out, but it's going to be this way for the next three weeks and, hey, matt, look! there's the bucket trucks we saw in the parking lot last night, right? maybe not the exact ones.
the senator has latched on to the burst of activism prompted by president trump's election and his policies, a movement that's largely driven by women. she called the 2017 women's march on washington truly the most inspiring moment of my entire life and joined the protesters who challenged brett m. kavanaugh's nomination to the supreme court last fall. she also stood up to fellow democrats as the #metoo era dawned, criticizing then-sen. al franken of minnesota and former president bill clinton for their alleged inappropriate behavior toward women.

we know that more is coming, as the intercept scooped some of these internal plans in november. but roping the public option into the single-payer discussion, which worked for republicans in 2010, is a tougher task now — it makes no changes to private plans whatsoever and has become the universal compromise position of the democratic party.
and we got one more mullally-offerman scene before the episode ended: it's nice to be here at the beginning before you're a complete basket case, mullally deadpanned to colton.
but what if the era had been ratified way back in 1982? let's consider what it would — and would not — have done.
the downside, said gertner, are the assumptions made. if i'm out shopping with my son without my husband, strangers will sometimes say, 'oh, are you giving mommy a break?' i know there are plenty of straight dads out there who find that patronizing, too.
if you're going to time travel, know that the machine moves only in one direction — the future — and that the machine is you, and that it never really gets there, but you can always move forward.
now, they're across the country in a city we left, some with babies we thought we'd know beyond occasional video calls, some with babies due any day now. even if we were there, we remind ourselves, we couldn't see them that often. we'd have to distance. we couldn't hold their new babies or let them hold ours, not yet, and not for the foreseeable future.
supporters of many of the rules opposed by equal rights advocates say they are aimed not at discrimination but at protecting a christian way of life. when the georgia senate last week passed a bill that would allow state-backed adoption agencies to refuse assistance to same-sex couples, its sponsor, state sen. william ligon (r), told the atlanta journal-constitution that just because you are a faith-based organization doesn't mean you have to check your faith at the door and cannot participate in government programs.
infant mortality at the institutions was in many years double the national average. some 9,000 infants died — 15 percent of all those who were born in the system — a statistic the investigators call appalling.
the house has been more aggressive on this front than the senate, passing all eight bills called for by northam. they would institute universal background checks; limit handgun purchases to one per month; require owners to report a firearm theft or loss within 24 hours; give local officials the authority to pass gun restrictions; tighten the prohibition on guns for someone under a protective order; make it a felony to recklessly leave a gun in reach of anyone 18 or younger; and create a red flag law allowing authorities to seize weapons from someone deemed a threat. the chamber narrowly approved an assault weapons ban tuesday, 51 to 48, after struggling over how to define those firearms and how to enact the ban.
but the choreographed scenario plouffe and others had put together crumbled as soon as biden spoke honestly on meet the press. the media reaction was swift and overwhelming. the associated press declared, obama's vague gay marriage stance under scrutiny. the boston herald warned, veep's marriage 'gaffe' an issue for prez.
krowl said grant's letters clearly reveal the depth of his love for julia and how central she had become to his life.

the main series, which concluded last year, centered on three earth-guarding superheroes — amethyst, garnet and pearl — who guided the sweet and buoyant half-human boy steven, who was gradually growing into his powers. the title character was based on the showrunner's own brother, steven sugar, an artist on the show, and the creator says the three heroic female-coded non-binary aliens were based on facets of herself as she sought to be a role model to him as his elder sibling.
the senate has passed five of the governor's gun-control bills. on tuesday, it rejected a measure on reporting lost or stolen guns. the sponsor of the assault-weapons bill withdrew it from consideration, and the child-access bill died in committee.
shop hop: malls, malls, malls. the one surprise: vintage dress company, which relocated from del ray in alexandria to 23rd street a few months ago. owner darlene bakke scours estate sales, charity shops and thrift stores for threads and accessories from the 1950s through the 1990s. some of her timeless finds include a pair of jordache jeans, a rudolph-red snowsuit and a donna reed-era yellow cardigan with pearls. she plans to add a wedding dress salon for brides who want to give gowns a second chance at love and marriage.
even as iowa democrats focus on their first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest on monday, with many still undecided and anguishing over their choice, activists are trying not to lose sight of a longer-term political goal: staging a political takeover.
if we ever shut down the government over a policy dispute, we'd be run out of town on a rail, said south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg at a news conference wednesday.

he said he doesn't want to avoid the questions, but he wants to make it clear that some information is none of other people's business. we're always asking ourselves, 'what's the company line?' and we haven't found it yet.
dear amy: a few months ago, i offered to my 45-year-old niece our home for her wedding. this will be her third wedding and his second.
why not me? is also the way buttigieg thinks about running for president. it's no accident, he says, that this year's democratic field could include five other current and former mayors: eric garcetti of los angeles, andrew gillum of tallahassee, mitch landrieu of new orleans, michael bloomberg of new york and julián castro of san antonio. with most state capitols every bit as clogged up in partisan stalemates as washington, mayors still actually get to do stuff, as he puts it.

one of the most prolific fundraisers in congress, gillibrand has raised more than $56 million during her political career, including $20 million between 2013 and 2018. but her prowess has led to criticism that she was too cozy with wall street.in 2013, the daily show's john oliver confronted gillibrand about campaign donations from wall street and said: what i deeply want to know is: what do you have to do for that? what is required of you for that money? because it makes me uncomfortable.
-- in a post op-ed, mcconnell slammed house democrats' proposed changes to the federal election commission. he writes: since watergate, the commission has been a six-member body so neither party can use it to punish political opponents. apparently, democrats have grown tired of playing fair. this bill would weaponize the fec with a 3-to-2 partisan makeup. it would also empower that newly partisan fec to track and catalogue more of what you say. it would broaden the type of speech the commission can define as 'campaign-related' and thus regulate. … apparently the democrats define 'democracy' as giving washington a clearer view of whom to intimidate and leaving citizens more vulnerable to public harassment over private views.
this past week, buttigieg offered a taste of how he'd square off against trump. asked what he'd do if he became president and trump refused to leave the white house, the ex-mayor deadpanned, i guess if he's willing to do chores, we can work something out. while trump would have no trouble striking back at joe biden, with his schoolyard threats to beat the hell out of him, or bloomberg, trying to out-billionaire him, how would his fragile manhood respond to such casual disdain from, of all things, a gay man?
i met leo at the federalist society's offices in washington. despite the fact that in his personal capacity while on leave from the society he put so much effort into advising the trump administration on judges, he endorses the network theory of the society, telling me, it's less about who gets what job and more about building a community that can be self-perpetuating and self-sustaining and self-driving.
before the presidency, trump was often as engaged in legal tussles as he was in real estate, suing and threatening to sue his way out of financial trouble. with a return to private life, his terror is that he will no longer be protected by the office and will have to deal with these lawsuits, says his niece. trump faces the prospect of spending considerable time in the role of defendant. kaplan says she will seek to depose him in all three cases. trump's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment on the cases in this article.
as part of his apology tour, meklat called finkielkraut and asked to see him. i was touched by that, finkielkraut said in an interview. he invited meklat for tea and was curious to hear what he had to say.
nevertheless, this episode brought us some pretty bizarre and petty arguments. the main rift was between demi and tracy, which was first hinted at during the group date challenge where contestants talked about their firsts. tracy, 31, told a rambling tale about her first time dating a virgin — not colton! — and how it ended with a sorority sister punching her in the face.

as pumped as anyone is olowski, watching with me from the side. but to understand what the federalist society has achieved and where it's headed, he advises me to look beyond the scorecard of confirmed judges — and to instead consider the intellectual sparring and professional grooming going on at federalist society chapters and forums across the land.
the orders will be biden's first steps to helping americans gain health insurance, a prominent campaign goal that has assumed escalating significance as the pandemic has dramatized the need for affordable health care — and deprived millions of americans coverage as they have lost jobs in the economic fallout, amy reports.

have you hugged a mayor today? it wasn't planned this way, but the u.s. conference of mayors meeting came to washington at a narratively ideal time: the point in the government shutdown when the city began to ask whether it would ever end.
the episode captured the irony, and ultimately the downfall, of buttigieg's meteoric campaign. in an age of identity and representation, buttigieg, a married gay man, presented himself as a longtime outsider, one who understood what it meant to be shunned and who promised a politics of inclusion. but buttigieg could never convince african americans, a pillar of the democratic coalition and a group for whom representation has moved to the center of public discussion, that he understood their experience or how to fight for their rights.
several states have wrestled with similar cases. the utah compromise in 2015 was hailed by some as an accommodation between mormon leaders and lgbt activists, a signal that leaders on both sides could be open to giving a bit. the law banned employers and landlords from discriminating against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and it also protected employees from being fired for talking about religious or moral beliefs.
biden, known for going off-script, had been rigorously prepped and reminded of his mission: stay on message.
gilbert, the majority leader, didn't deny that west's election was a matter of brute political force but said virginians will appreciate having a highly qualified, strong female judge on the scc.
the authors of the report note that the experience of women and children in the 1920s was vastly different than in the 1990s. in the early years, ireland was an impoverished country, among the poorest in europe, and life was hard for many, and the homes for unmarried mothers were run like workhouses. in later years, there was schooling, counseling and more services.
several operatives also argued that biden, despite two national elections at obama's side, would struggle to excite the voters who were hardest to turn out.
mayor buttigieg ran an incredible campaign that broke glass ceilings and inspired countless lgbtq people to run for office and enter public service, human rights campaign president alphonso david said in a statement. his history-making, open and honest campaign gave representation to a community that has been for far too long pushed out of the spotlight.
so conservatives shifted from blocking marriage equality to blocking restroom access for transgender people in 2016. having lost that round, they've shifted to protecting young people from gender-confirmation treatment, still grounded in the same theories of sex and gender as biologically determined.
in a statement, he said that he has experienced discrimination firsthand and said those who work against equality carry that stain and must be held accountable.
barack said of his friend, he probably got out a little bit over his skis — out of generosity of spirit.
also hoping for a speedy confirmation this week:
but masculinity is always a performance; the more performative it is, the less healthy. and buttigieg's act is just as consistent and firmly ingrained as trump's routine, though it offers a starkly different presentation: even-keeled, carefully controlled and cerebral. some attribute it to midwestern stoicism, and his mother has called it a family trait. others have chalked it up to his time poring over grocery-pricing spreadsheets for mckinsey and co.
trump redirected billions of dollars to upgrade barriers on the u.s.-mexico border, made it harder to gain asylum in the u.s. and barred immigration by citizens of 12 countries. biden calls immigration an irrefutable source of our strength and can tweak policy on his own. but his more ambitious plans would require the approval of congress, which hasn't passed a major immigration law since 1986.
during her interview, roberts had asked the president, so you're not upset with anybody?
when carroll first met with kaplan, the lawyer quickly understood her client's objective. i don't give two flying figs about an apology, carroll says. i am dying to get him in a deposition. i want him to say that i'm not a liar. i just want him to admit that he lied and that, yes, it happened.

though buttigieg prefers to label himself — if he must label himself — a progressive democrat, he can deliver a spontaneous dissertation on why young americans say they prefer socialism to capitalism that would do rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez proud. nobody should mistake it for youthful idealism or recklessness, he says. i think the new generation that emerges now will have a different kind of seriousness about the future, he says. it's more immediate and personal, the younger you are. you're going to be on the business end of climate change, of tax cuts; you're going to be touched more by our post-9/11 wars. matt, how old were you on 9/11?

culture fix: you will have to cross the potomac for museums, but stay put for experimental theater. synetic theater, a neighborhood presence since 2010, leads the classics (cyrano, richard iii) down an alternative path with dance, music, technology and the visual arts. a few galleries focusing on local painters, potters, jewelry makers and more appear in the underground arcade of the crystal city shops. aboveground, a sprinkling of public art and murals add a touch of whimsy to the otherwise wan landscape of high-rises. for a walking tour, download a map. the grounds, a repurposed parking lot in pentagon city, hosts public events and art installations, including a recent assemblage of seesaws that radiated light and sound when see-ed and saw-ed.
it was, as harris has recited over and over, gopalan's insistence that you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you're not the last. so much of the pressure on harris now — to ensure that she stands out for substantive accomplishments that pave the way for others — is pressure she says she has felt before.
mcconnell had said sunday night and monday morning that it was his intention to take up legislation addressing daca, border security and other issues if democrats agreed to fund the government until feb. 8.
but there's no spinning it: women's march inc., which has organized the largest rallies and political campaigns of the young movement, is coming into 2019 dogged by controversy. tamika mallory, one of the group's other co-founders, has associated with nation of islam leader louis farrakhan, has never completely denounced his anti-semitism, and has been accused of holding her own conspiratorial beliefs about jews.
in other ways, democrats have been cautious about pushing their advantage. many of their newly gained seats are in suburban districts that until recently favored republicans. lawmakers are also protective of virginia's prized triple-a bond rating, which contributes to the state's status as a top place for doing business.
barnett's experience is a typical example of how different the society is from the stereotype of a traditional top-down washington pressure group. the society itself lobbies for no policies; it never signs amicus briefs or represents clients in cases. no one at federalist society headquarters in washington dictated barnett's moves or told him how to advocate for what positions. it's just that at a few gatherings made possible by the federalist society that barnett happened to attend, synapses fired, a corner of the hive mind engaged, and barnett took it from there. multiply that chemistry tens of thousands of times over the past 36 years and you have the federalist society's true source of power.

for all his aw-shucksiness, if buttigieg has the least bit of doubt that he's ready to make the leap to commander in chief, at an age that barely qualifies him constitutionally for the job, it's impossible to detect. he has often been urged to run for congress — the next logical steppingstone — but he sees it as a dead end. i would find it demoralizing, he says. david axelrod, obama's political guru, is among the powerhouse democrats who see no reason buttigieg should wait. axelrod's first pete sighting was in november 2015, when the young mayor was given the john f. kennedy new frontier award at harvard. he spoke without a note in front of him and gave one of the most stirring speeches i've heard, axelrod told the south bend tribune. he has that gift. axelrod has given buttigieg the same advice he gave obama after his famous democratic national convention keynote speech in 2004: the biggest mistake politicians make is missing their moment by hesitating.
consider her record as san francisco's district attorney from 2004 to 2011. ms. harris was criticized in 2010 for withholding information about a police laboratory technician who had been accused of 'intentionally sabotaging' her work and stealing drugs from the lab. after a memo surfaced showing that ms. harris's deputies knew about the technician's wrongdoing and recent conviction, but failed to alert defense lawyers, a judge condemned ms. harris's indifference to the systemic violation of the defendants' constitutional rights. ms. harris contested the ruling by arguing that the judge, whose husband was a defense attorney and had spoken publicly about the importance of disclosing evidence, had a conflict of interest. ms. harris lost. more than 600 cases handled by the corrupt technician were dismissed. …
death valley, ca – death valley national park announced today that some recently closed areas of the park will once again be accessible to visitors in the coming days. some visitor services, including campgrounds and the stovepipe wells contact station, will also reopen using revenue generated by recreation fees. visitors should go to the park website at nps.gov/deva while planning their trip to get the latest information on accessibility and available services. areas that have been recently closed but that are or will be accessible to park visitors include: • dantes view, artists drive, natural bridge, harmony borax works and mustard canyon, salt creek, keane wonder mine, mesquite sand dunes, and historic stovepipe wells roads. because of the distances and complexities involved and unknown nature of all issues, the opening of these sites may take a week or longer. scotty's castle remains closed due to flood damage. mosaic canyon road remains closed in association with water utility work for stovepipe wells village. upper and lower wildrose roads are closed due to snow and ice. national park service officials have determined that by using federal land and recreation enhancement funds to immediately bring back park maintenance crews to clean restrooms, remove trash, and remove health and safety risks park staff will be able to restore accessibility to the park. through generous donations from the death valley natural history association, the furnace creek visitor center will remain open. entrance fees and camping fees will not be collected and ranger programs will not be offered.

whatever happens, mr. miller said, it would no longer be his problem.
before biden went on meet the press, the white house had been considering ways for obama to speak his mind. aides had drawn up an elaborate strategy allowing the president to seize on gay marriage as a major civil rights issue. a blueprint for his announcement had slowly come together. the game plan had the president appearing at an lgbt event in new york on may 14 followed by a visit to abc's daytime talk show the view to reveal his change of heart. i was just maniacal about order and planning, plouffe explained in obama: an oral history 2009-2017″ by brian abrams. he recognized that a historic moment lay before the president. i wanted it to be the president's moment.

the words special election and pennsylvania are enough to induce terror in republicans after their disastrous 2018 performance in the state. the year began with them losing a once-safe district to rep. conor lamb (d) and ended with them getting blown out statewide while dropping three more seats — and holding three more by single digits.

from there, the story of the federalist society's influence became the story of approximately 70,000 random epiphanies. that's roughly the number of active participants in the society today, according to its leadership. my admittedly unscientific sample of a dozen federalists' personal stories — backed up by political scientists' more systematic research into the question — suggests that each individual federalist is akin to an excited synapse in a sprawling hive mind with no one actually in charge.

as part of the agreement to go back into government, both parties agreed to support legislation that would create an office of identity and cultural expression and appoint commissioners to enhance the development of both languages, although in slightly different contexts: the use of irish by public authorities and the use of ulster scots in arts and literature. given that the two sides have been wrestling over the language issue since 1998, if not before, working through the details and implementing the legislation will be challenging.

the process was smooth, depew said, until the surrogate delivered their daughter, kimaya, at 32 weeks gestation in 2012. communicating with doctors in india with very different expectations of what you need to understand as a parent from 10,000 miles away — it was pretty stressful, depew said. kimaya was diagnosed with cerebral palsy due to complications from birth and has significant mobility impairment, depew said. but it was a successful experience because we have a lovely, happy daughter, he said.

the statement by los angeles archbishop josé gomez immediately set off a debate among the dozens of u.s. bishops, who, like u.s. catholics, are bitterly divided on the direction of their extensive denomination and its entanglement with partisan politics. those divisions are coming to a head in the figure of biden, who makes it clear with his weekly churchgoing, his frequent references to catholic teachings and culture, and his use of catholic symbols that he will not accept the view of conservative catholics that he is not part of the church.
in an interview with the washington post in the back of a bus rolling through iowa a few months before she dropped out of the primary race, harris admitted she had always been uncomfortable with the idea of abolishing private insurance, despite endorsing a plan that did just that. she eventually drafted a plan of her own that would expand government-run plans while allowing private plans to continue for a longer period.
it's not just democratic candidates who have undergone a political transformation — the party's voters have also shifted to the left on many issues in recent years and have become much more partisan. nine in 10 democrats supported stricter laws covering the sale of firearms in a 2018 gallup poll, up from about 2 in 3 a decade earlier. forty percent of democrats and democratic-leaning independents support increasing legal immigration, according to pew research center data, up from 20 percent in 2006. and support for same-sex marriage has increased among democrats and republicans.

ms. harris was similarly regressive as the state's attorney general. when a federal judge in orange county ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional in 2014, ms. harris appealed. in a public statement, she made the bizarre argument that the decision 'undermines important protections that our courts provide to defendants.' in 2014, she declined to take a position on proposition 47, a ballot initiative approved by voters, that reduced certain low-level felonies to misdemeanors. she laughed that year when a reporter asked if she would support the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. ms. harris finally reversed course in 2018, long after public opinion had shifted on the topic. in 2015, she opposed a bill requiring her office to investigate shootings involving officers. and she refused to support statewide standards regulating the use of body-worn cameras by police officers.
this is an unspinnably bad poll for the president, coming just a few days after brad parscale, his 2020 campaign manager, said internal data showed him in his strongest-ever position. other presidents have seen the won't reelect number surge past the will reelect number and prevailed. that happened to bill clinton; it happened to barack obama. but we're three weeks into the shutdown with no public data that suggests it has fixed the president's problems outside his base. even 7 percent of voters who backed the president in 2016 say they would not in 2020; if he gained no additional voters, that would put him at 43 percent support, wiping out his win margins in florida, michigan, pennsylvania and wisconsin.

in a time of growing and aggressive secularism in american culture, when religious believers face many challenges, it will be refreshing to engage with a president who clearly understands, in a deep and personal way, the importance of religious faith and institutions, gomez wrote in his statement. at the same time, he added, i must point out that our new president has pledged to pursue certain policies that would advance moral evils and threaten human life and dignity, most seriously in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender. of deep concern is the liberty of the church and the freedom of believers to live according to their consciences.
gillibrand, 52, is most well known for her efforts to combat sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, to repeal the military's policy of don't ask, don't tell and to make it easier for capitol hill staffers who have been sexually harassed or assaulted to report their experiences.
according to others, it's equally common for women to be de-genderized: it's a classic image, turning powerful women into powerful men, says pippa norris, associate director of research at harvard's joan shorenstein center on the press, politics and public policy, pointing out that the british satire spitting image portrayed margaret thatcher as winston churchill smoking a cigar. with reno, what's notable is that both things happen. some days she's schwarzenegger; some days she's xena; nobody can decide. in part, this may be a particularly american problem. unlike countries with a tradition of queens or women occupying positions of feudal power, america has no cultural memory of powerful women. look back into american history and whom do you come up with? jane addams? betsy ross? no one really seems to do, so the culture flounders for archetypes and keeps coming up with men. it was strictly based on the fact that she is – at least that she appears – physically big. and her demeanor appears to be kind of kick-ass. six foot three, tanned, golden-haired, stubbled, wearing a jacket and khakis and not looking faintly like the attorney general, saturday night live actor will ferrell is sitting in a borrowed office in the nbc building at rockefeller center. it's monday, which means the cast and writers are starting to plan the upcoming show. will there be a reno skit? ferrell doesn't know yet. today they'll brainstorm with host helen hunt. tomorrow they'll write.

we have worked hard to create a branded organization . . . that does not carry partisan baggage, higgins said in 2015. being branded as neutral but actually having the people who know, know that you're actually conservative puts us in a unique position.
her explanation is that originally the title referred to the attorney who did general work for the crown, general in the sense of general store. so i am an adjective, she likes to say, not a noun. the adjective settles into a love seat under a window in her office, and motions toward a chair nearby. in her low-key clothes and straightforward demeanor she comes across as what linguists would call unmarked. an unmarked expression is a neutral one, an expression that attracts no notice. to say do you feel well? is neutral, unmarked; to say do you feel bad? is unusual; it's marked. similarly, an unmarked person is a person who blends in, who avoids standing out. it's easy for men to be unmarked – wear a dark suit, keep your hair trimmed – but more difficult for women. if you wear makeup and short shirts and high heels, that's one form of marking, but if you don't gussy yourself up, you're a marked woman, too, you're making a statement. which may be why reno's appearance attracts so much attention. many women in politics go ahead and mark themselves – with bright red jackets, bright green suits, bright gold accessories. reno takes the opposite approach: short haircut, staid predictable dress, no jewelry save for a watch and a pair of modest earrings, no makeup except a faint trace of lipstick, no rings or nail polish on her graceful white hands. the effect is to make her stand out like a pileated woodpecker.
no one could move, but everyone seemed to understand that the march was a glimpse of a new kind of coalition whose true strength had yet to be tested, sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) wrote in her in new memoir, about the washington march.

tim winter, the chairman of the boone county democratic party, who introduced gillibrand at a saturday morning gathering, said that his own views on gun control have evolved over the years: as a young man who loved pheasant hunting with his friends, he didn't think any gun laws were needed. now, as the father of two young children, he thinks lawmakers need to draw lines, especially when it comes to assault-style weapons.

still, his profile continued to rise, and by last fall, buttigieg had shifted to a more moderate lane as he tried to seize a middle ground between biden and sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), whom he targeted repeatedly over universal healthcare, arguing that his approach — adding a public option that he dubbed medicare for all who want it — was superior because it left choice to the american people.

he might very well have won the dnc race if you could have had a secret ballot, says howard dean, who endorsed buttigieg for his old job. but it's such an insider race. … that was hard to overcome. dean, who has spoken with buttigieg about his own experience vaulting from obscurity to the top of the 2004 democratic primaries, sees a lot of obama­esque qualities in the mayor. he has a magnetism about him, he says. and i think he projects this idea of, 'let's get past all this partisan crap and do something for the country for a change.' i think his age is an advantage. i really think the american people would like to see our generation step aside and see a new generation take leadership.
larry hogan. he has welcomed, for the first time, chatter about potentially running for president; he told reporters today that both the president and the speaker of the house were to blame for the shutdown and its theatrics. let's figure out border security, and let's get people to work, and let's let the state of the union take place like it always does, he said. worth noting: that's largely the democratic plan, not the republican one.
but he did not scare off democrats by building, or letting his supporters build, a pre-campaign operation. there was some scoffing about ready for hillary, the 2013-2015 effort to organize potential supporters of the 2016 nominee, but it raised millions of dollars and hosted scores of events. during the invisible primary of the same period, clinton and allies scouted for talent and communicated to those who weren't picked that it would be a mistake for their long-term plans, if they worked for someone else.
kamala harris. she's the focus of a devastating laura bazelon column on her prosecutorial record, which remains the single biggest impediment in her effort.
clinton in the highly symbolic, conventionally feminine role of first lady has one redoubtable host of expectations to cope with, and reno, in the traditionally masculine role of top cop, has another. and both have coped in very different ways. unlike reno, hillary clinton came to washington as a feminist networker, surrounded herself with women who made gender an issue first and foremost. unlike reno, she has at times attempted to parry the fulminators publicly. the response to her infamous 1992 campaign remark, i suppose i could have stayed home, baked cookies and had teas, shows how risky it can be to answer the critics on their own terms. in a sense, reno's head-down stance is consistent with her whole attitude toward publicity, which is to say: go forward, do your work, don't make a lot of noise, don't spin. whenever political appointees come to washington, it's necessary to make a decision about how and whether to participate in the image-management industry. madeleine albright, for example, is one cabinet member who pays close attention to how she looks and who she knows and how she's portrayed. in contrast, when reno came to justice she didn't even want a press office (in miami, she fielded reporters' calls herself). when it became clear she had to have one, she chose stern, a former law correspondent for nbc, to head it, with the idea that his natural inclination would be to distribute information rather than spin. according to stern, she remains remarkably unconcerned about how people see her.
nunn also said he didn't think it was very wise. while the democrats were experiencing more success in ankeny, he was able to sail through his election in altoona — one of those blue-collar democratic districts that swung for trump. their attitude, he said, only solidified the idea that the party was catering to the elite.

-- federal courts could run out of money before the end of the month. the new york times's thomas kaplan reports: judges and court officials around the country are bracing for the likelihood that the federal judiciary will be unable to maintain its current operations within the next two weeks, once it exhausts the money it has been relying on since the shutdown began last month. already, courts have been cutting down on expenses like travel and new hiring. court-appointed private lawyers who represent indigent defendants have been working without pay since late december, according to the administrative office of the united states courts, which provides support for the court system.

on the surface, what harris symbolizes to an increasingly diverse party has been obvious: she is a woman of color who tugged at a historic desire for representation, brought a lengthy résumé from the nation's most populous democratic state, and has held her own against the trump administration. to her supporters, she is a symbol for equity and empowerment for a party that has long sought both.
given their values on lgbtq policies, it would be good to have them in the state, as a force for good, as part of that growing ally base, said austin mayor steve adler in a january interview after his city was named a finalist.
but what no one envisioned was his rapid fall just five years after arriving in washington for reasons that weren't disclosed until last week.
two days after she was reelected, gillibrand said in a late-night television interview that she was considering a run.
but gillibrand's transformation had already begun. the day of her appointment, she vowed to work on a bill to strengthen background checks with a fierce critic of her gun record, then-rep. carolyn mccarthy (d-n.y.). the following day, she told an audience in harlem that she could perhaps be flexible on gun control.
immigration represented a more dramatic shift for gillibrand. as a house member, she opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants and supported making english the official language and deputizing police officers to act as immigration agents. after joining the senate, she began to support comprehensive immigration reform and a pathway to citizenship, along with other liberal priorities on immigration.
leonard leo will know, a white house aide wrote in an email obtained by the post. we probably don't want the fed soc paying for it, but he might know some generous donor.
the extension prompted a lightbulb moment: as i thought about it, the more angry i got that there weren't women in the rest of america that had the same kind of luxury that i had, she said. it takes personal experience sometimes to get on board.
under your leadership, may the american people continue to draw strength from the lofty political, ethical and religious values that have inspired the nation since its founding, said francis, who had called biden on nov. 12 to offer his congratulations and to discuss working together on issues including poverty, climate change and integrating immigrants and refugees.
leo joined additional advocacy groups that expanded his influence following the supreme court's landmark citizens united decision in 2010, which lifted restrictions on spending by corporations, unions and nonprofits on politically oriented advertisements and media campaigns.
and an additional birthday wish came from one american icon to another:
leo, 53, wears round, horn-rimmed glasses, tailored suits and monochromatic pocket squares. his office at the federalist society is filled with mementos of his career, including a red trump-campaign-style hat that reads make the court great again and a gold-framed new yorker profile of himself. on a bookshelf is a photo of leo and kavanaugh in tuxedos. a nameplate on the shelf reads, the real boss.

when mcadams and her family moved to ankeny in 1999, this place was a reliably red bedroom community of 27,000. by 2018, the number was 66,000 and growing.
although she climbed her way through the bruising world of california politics over the course of a decade, harris did not emerge as a washington presence until she arrived in the senate in 2017. she spent little time there before contemplating a presidential campaign; by late 2018, she had written a memoir scheduled to publish right around the time democrats, including her, would be starting to announce their candidacies for president.
widened roads and state highways connect ankeny to cities that were once surrounded by fields and farms, like johnston, urbandale and waukee, which boasts of students speaking 62 languages in the schools.
it's evident that i'm not an anti-semite, meklat said, when asked to respond. it's impossible.
i'd never been a burn-down-the-ramparts sort of person. i believed in working in institutions, says kaplan. living a life very much on the margins didn't appeal to me. i really wanted to have kids. i really wanted to be part of the jewish community. i really wanted to have a career. all of this would have been unavailable in the world i grew up in.
after his ordination in 1981, mccloskey returned to the united states and within a few years was installed as the catholic chaplain at princeton university. he soon became enmeshed in campus controversies. critics said he told catholic students to steer away from certain classes he considered insufficiently christian, reports at the time said. others were angered by his uncompromising positions on birth control and premarital sex. mccloskey had a way of finding controversy and attention no matter where he went.
people may have assumed she was heir apparent, but she got her campaign moving and started grabbing top staff, one operative said. that is not the case with the biden people.
according to buttigieg's husband, chasten buttigieg, there's another obama parallel that most people wouldn't guess from pete's genial retail politicking and smooth style on the stump: he's definitely an introvert. and he's still coming out of some of his shells. that's something he's learned in part from chasten, who does improv comedy on the side and maintains a busy twitter feed that can be flat-out hilarious. when we go out, we'll go to events and then i'd want to keep going out to a bar for a beer, chasten says. and he'll be wanting to go home and curl up with a book.
and last week, state sen. zach nunn filed legislation that would ban county parties from pouring money into nonpartisan races and printing fliers like the ones distributed by bagniewski.
and that is how he had an arsenal of commerce-based arguments ready when the affordable care act was passed in 2010. by then barnett was a leading voice of the growing libertarian wing of the federalist society, and he became one of the architects of constitutional claims at the core of lawsuits against the health-care plan. his participation in the legal assault on obamacare was hatched at — where else? — the federalist society's national convention in the fall of 2009, where, in the hallway of the mayflower hotel between sessions, he happened to bump into a clutch of fellow federalists discussing the health-care legislation. (josh blackman, a popular federalist social media force and a professor at the south texas college of law, documented the moment in his 2013 book, unprecedented: the constitutional challenge to obamacare.) barnett told me how one person in the group says, 'you want to do something about this?' i said, 'sure.' … and he said, 'whatever we do, we've got to do it fast because it's going to come out of committee very soon.' 
-- a draft of the family-separation policy shows the trump administration considered denying migrant children asylum hearings and specifically targeting their parents for prosecution. nbc news's julia ainsley reports: in one comment, a justice department official suggests that customs and border protection could see that children who have been separated from their parents would be denied an asylum hearing before an immigration judge, which is typically awarded to children who arrive at the border alone. instead, the entire family would be given an order of 'expedited removal' and then separated, placing the child in the care of hhs in u.s. marshall's custody while both await deportation. … 'it appears that they wanted to have it both ways — to separate children from their parents but deny them the full protections generally awarded to unaccompanied children,' said lee gelernt, a lawyer for the american civil liberties union who led the class action suit on behalf of migrant parents who had been separated from their children.
he pointed to his body of work, including a number of columns he and his collaborator, badroudine saïd abdallah, wrote for libération's bondy blog on the theme of anti-semitism in the banlieues.
but events such as the partial government shutdown are not going to inspire them to get more involved. while the parkland teens' tremendous efforts influenced changes at the state level and got pro-gun-control candidates elected to congress, they've been met mostly with dysfunction at the federal level.

in ankeny, mcadams was still trying to understand the big picture. she saw her community as a blank political canvas, its future still unwritten.
next to her was amy tagliareni, a 49-year-old administrator of a small nonprofit and a mother of a middle-schooler. she had moved to the state in 2008 but had never voted in a primary until 2018. she voted for hillary clinton in the 2016 general election but felt she needed to become more active because so many middle-class white women like her had voted republican or chosen not to vote at all. the president won the majority in all but one precinct of ankeny districts in polk county.

virginia has not become the east coast version of california, said university of mary washington political scientist stephen farnsworth. but virginia is clearly being governed in a far more liberal direction than has been the case in decades, if not ever.
senate majority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) and mcconnell must now agree to the structure of the trial, including length of arguments, motions to call witnesses, and a possible motion to dismiss the trial at its outset, politico's andrew desiderio and marianne levine report.

just in neutral, technical terms, i don't think biden's seen as being on the cutting edge of grass-roots organizing, another operative said. traditionally, his base has been high-dollar donors.
stunned, she yanks him off the ground and kisses him roughly, after which the fantasy dissolves and janet reno, attorney general, is shown to be making out with simba the tiger. she is – has this been mentioned already? – a man. also, she is tall. that's one thing. it may be the main thing, the thing that explains so much else. this is what janet reno would tell you. they do this sort of thing because she is so tall. she's tall, says former labor secretary robert reich, who is not, when asked what single thing strikes him about janet reno. the few times we did events together, i was reminded of just how tall she is. well, yes, that's one point you can safely make about the attorney general. she is, without question, tall – 6 foot 1 – hence perhaps one popular image that has emerged of her, big and fearless, clomping through the corridors of justice. what reno's sister, maggy hurchalla, sniffingly calls the image of a large person with boots on. but that's just one of many images the culture has yielded during reno's five-year tenure. one of the longest-serving attorneys general in modern history and arguably the most powerful appointed woman in american politics (given the inherent stature of her cabinet post and her long-running investigative authority over the president), reno has been in the public eye more often, or at least more dramatically, than anyone else in clinton's cabinet.
you can still see the effects of the closet in buttigieg's formal bearing (not just a military trait), his difficulty really opening up into a smile (his mouth stretches into a toothy grimace, with his eyes squinted) and the invisible barrier that always seems to exist in each interaction, no matter how pleasant. it's what happens, as michael hobbes wrote for huffpost, after years of constantly scanning social situations for ways we may not fit into them. and for buttigieg, who didn't come out until age 33, that's a lot of years of unnatural self-constraint.
-- just hours after trump blocked pelosi from using a military aircraft to visit the troops, first lady melania trump boarded a military plane for a flight to palm beach, fla., so she could spend the weekend at mar-a-lago. (miami herald)

the british house of commons also passed johnson's withdrawal deal jan. 9 — suggesting that the u.k. is now very likely to exit the european union on jan. 31. northern ireland now needs locally accountable politicians to represent its interests throughout the transition, making the significant decisions about implementation that remain.
when clinton resigned her senate seat in january 2009, new york gov. david paterson (d) appointed gillibrand, who was then barely known outside upstate new york — angering many democrats who considered gillibrand too conservative.on the hill, members of the new york delegation nicknamed gillibrand tracy flick after the bubbly, blond and ambitious character played by reese witherspoon in the movie election.
every time a party gains power, it reassesses its relationship to grass-roots organizers, and those organizers become bigger, more important targets for critics. democrats have to deal with an inevitable and sticky fact of politics — associating with activists or politicians who come under fire for their own associations or remarks. for some republicans, the ostracization of rep. steve king (r-iowa) over his racist remarks was meant to signal that their party policed itself and democrats did not.
leo later gave the president a list of possible supreme court nominees. trump released the list during the primary campaign, a gesture that helped him win the support of skeptical mainstream republicans. gorsuch and kavanaugh were added to the list later.
• revive the 2015 multinational deal intended to limit iran's nuclear work in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. trump scorned it as one-sided. biden says the u.s. would rejoin if iran returns to compliance with its terms.
-- senate republicans are weighing rules changes to accelerate confirmations of trump's nominees. seung min kim and paul kane report: typically, a nomination can be debated for a maximum of 30 hours on the senate floor after senators invoke cloture ... but republicans are mulling cutting short those 30 hours to as brief as two hours for relatively noncontroversial nominees, such as candidates for the district court. … while gop senators discussed wanting support from democrats to revise the rules — a process that would take 67 votes — [mitch mcconnell] also raised the prospect of using the so-called 'nuclear option' to change the rules unilaterally.
it's a service which is demanded by society, she told canada's globe and mail in 1980, referring to prostitution. we have to accept the viability of sexual service as a means of work — it's just like someone doing your nails, doing your hair, or giving you an enema in the hospital.
they decided to use their wedding ceremony as a vehicle for focusing on laws discriminatory to women. stone kept her maiden name, and they eliminated the marriage vow 'to obey,' and circulated a written protest against the 19th century marriage laws which denied women all legal standing, ruth said.
don't ever suggest another bill! mr. miller yelled, according to evans. mr. miller, he said, was afraid of seeming too liberal in a conservative district. it was nothing more basic than getting reelected, evans said. his core was delivering as a retail politician.
in reply, biden singled out a gay couple at the meeting. he had visited the two men in their home and met their two adopted children, and when he had walked into the house, the kids, ages 7 and 5, had handed biden flowers. the vice president repeated for the national television audience what he had said to those two men at the private meeting: i wish every american could see the look of love those kids had in their eyes for you guys. and they wouldn't have any doubt about what this is about.
in the later years of her life, she returned to washington state, where she lived with her second husband, paul avery, a california crime reporter who had covered cases including the serial murders of the zodiac killer and the kidnapping of heiress patty hearst by the symbionese liberation army in 1974. he died in 2000.
she's pretty much a fundamentally pragmatic person . . . always asking about: 'what is the real impact this is going to have on people's lives?'  jill habig, who served as an adviser to harris's attorney general's office and senate campaign, said in a 2019 interview with the post. but in terms of the methodology of how you get to that goal, she's not very ideological. her approach is pretty much: 'what's going to be most effective? what's going to get us there?' 
leo, then a commissioner, said the federalist society had learned to sidestep pointed questions about judicial nominees — and he urged carter to do the same in his work for the commission. we get around these inquiries quite well, and i am sure you can find a way to do so as well, he wrote.
but more recently another liberal position has emerged, and it shows what the federalists have achieved. this position might be summed up as: if you can't beat them, join them — methodologically, at least. a number of liberal scholars have applied themselves to the task of showing how, in fact, originalist approaches can yield progressive results. as this train of thought has flowed out of the academy, liberal originalist logic is, more and more, showing up in legal briefs and even in supreme court dissents. advocates of all stripes know they must be ready with textualist arguments because, thanks in large part to the work of the federalists, it's more likely than ever that the judge deciding a case will want to hear that perspective.
everybody wants to take credit for mgm, lawlah said. it was mike miller's baby. he never took his eye off of it.
if she's put more thought and study in it, and sees it a different way, i have no problem with that, said kris begne, 55, who works in human resources at an insurance company and saw gillibrand during her two-day visit to the state. that's what you should be doing, if you're human. if you're reading and learning and watching tv, if you're studying any issues, you should be open to changing your mind. otherwise, why have a conversation with anybody?
there's a bear in the woods:
she had conservative bona fides,maddow said. she had an a rating from the nra. she said she wanted to make english the official language of the u.s.a. her first question to gillibrand began with this: tell me about that transformation.
the march/april issue of the magazine will feature photos of playmate elizabeth elam on a cover that says naked is normal, an interview with scarlett johansson, a profile of cnn political commentator van jones and a piece on the hip-hop outfit run the jewels.
there's no question that he was the chaplain of washington conservatives and he held a real appeal for them, said journalist mark shields, who met ­mccloskey only a few times, but knew him through his friend and longtime political sparring partner, robert novak. shields, a liberal catholic, said he often jousted over faith issues with novak, who was drawn to mccloskey's traditional catholicism and was later baptized and confirmed by him.
one of wilson's advisers, conway-lanz said, wrote: it seems the president is wholly absorbed in this love affair and is neglecting practically everything else.
during his confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary committee in november, and in written questions that he answered in early december, buescher was asked about his public statements during his 2014 campaign, his position on issues such as abortion as well as his membership in the knights of columbus, a catholic fraternal society.
some religious-freedom observers and activists see the state law and myrick's case as a victory in the tension between lgbt rights and government workers' religious rights. a same-sex couple seeking to wed wouldn't know that a government official intends to discriminate against them, as the official would be opting out of all marriages, activists argue.

in ireland, the once dominant catholic church shared power with the government, overseeing daily lives, running schools, hospitals, nursing homes, social welfare and poverty programs. but in recent years, the irish have steadily rejected directives from the church, overturning constitutional prohibitions against divorce, birth control, same-sex marriage and abortion.
the way we think this shapes up is, if you want the most ideological, far-out candidate possible, you've got your answer. you want the most washington candidate possible, you've got your answer, buttigieg said in november. everybody else, i think, can come our way. i think that's almost everybody.
yet he found himself sunday in his hometown of south bend, ind., the city where his struggles with racial issues as mayor earned detractors and supporters, telling supporters that the path has narrowed to a close.
like elizabeth warren, kirsten gillibrand ended one of the first days of her presidential campaign (sorry, yes, exploratory committee, fine) with an interview on the rachel maddow show. but the setups couldn't have been more different.
kavanaugh, gorsuch, alito and thomas are all at the banquet — a record turnout of supreme court justices for the annual affair. there's also a trio of trump's once and future justice department leaders: deputy attorney general rod rosenstein (alumnus of the federalist society's harvard law school chapter), recently fired attorney general jeff sessions (frequent society speaker) and acting attorney general matthew whitaker (recommended by leonard leo to be sessions's chief of staff). it's as if the players in the recent melodramas surrounding the justice department are minor actors compared with the federalist society itself — which provides the enduring climate within which storms on the right come and go.
in short, his trial campaign run through the south is not proceeding quite as planned. but there are seven people here to inspire and impress — eight, if you count me — and buttigieg is not one to waste an opportunity.
our message was simple, bag­niewski said. these are the democrats. this is the fight of our lives. get rid of donald trump.

in his remarks in parliament, martin highlighted extracts:
could it now be time for a millennial? when we catch up in early december, buttigieg says he saw glimmers of it in 2018: we saw indications that it's okay to talk about our values as democrats again. that the politics of conviction that appealed to young people, with bernie in 2016, can also be articulated successfully by the next generation.
the washington post's cleve wootson wrote in november of warnock:
impeachment part deux: the house last night formally delivered an article of impeachment charging trump with inciting the deadly insurrection at the capitol, as democrats prepared to use his own words as evidence against him in his senate trial next month, seung min kim, tom hamburger, josh dawsey and karoun demirjian report.
-- the hhs inspector general issued a scathing report saying that the trump administration separated thousands more migrant families than previously disclosed and that the policy existed for nearly a year before trump appointees acknowledged it. they publicly insisted there was no family-separation policy even as they privately implemented it. amy goldstein reports: the report says no one systematically kept count of separated children until a lawsuit last spring triggered by the trump administration's 'zero tolerance' policy, under which the government tried to criminally prosecute all parents who crossed the border illegally, taking their children from them in the process. as a result of the lawsuit, the government identified about 2,700 separated children in federal custody as of june, some of them infants and toddlers. … although previous administrations also separated minors at the border in some instances — usually when they suspected the child was smuggled, or if the parent appeared unfit — the report said the practice appears far more common under trump and began nearly a year before administration officials publicly acknowledged it.

i'd like to unleash him on capitol hill, kudlow told the washington times in 2001. a few doses of father mccloskey, and we'll turn this country around. he's an old-fashioned evangelical pastor. in some ways, the catholic church has fallen short in its evangelizing mission, and i think father john is awakening that.

the unfinished business of bernie sanders, by jason zengerle
during my three interviews with him before he declared his presidential campaign, buttigieg didn't care to talk much about any of that, though he joked at times about his rigid habits. his husband, chasten, was more forthcoming. i can see how people think he has a lot of walls up, he said. peter's still trying to come out of his shells.
after a 10-minute wait to see who else might turn up, a bushy-bearded afghanistan veteran in a hoodie is called upon to introduce the special guest and mangles his name four different ways. buttigieg (buddha-judge) just beams. you can call me pete; everybody does, he says. he stands and delivers a condensed version of the talk he's been giving around the country since the summer, mostly in support of the 20 first-time house candidates in red districts that he's backing with his super pac, hitting home.
earlier in the day, buttigieg had told me how much he relishes coming into an environment like this, where nobody knows me from adam, and seeing what happens when he starts speaking. sometimes you can watch people as you go up to the podium and they're like, 'what's the deal with this guy?' and then it's, 'okay, he's up there, he can talk.' if it's going right, i love to watch the faces then: partly i like to study them to see what's working and not, what to cut out next time or maybe expand. but there's this look, when you know you really have them. it's hard to describe, but it's unmistakable.
since gillibrand was appointed to the senate in january 2009 to fill the seat left open when hillary clinton became secretary of state, she has undergone a rapid and dramatic political shift, abandoning many of the centrist positions she held during her time as a congresswoman from upstate new york and becoming one of the senate's most liberal members.trump's campaign manager brad parscale has seized on this transformation, pointing to gillibrand as an example of democratic political contortionism — even as trump, too, has shifted in nearly all of his policy positions.
• raise to 125,000 the number of refugees allowed into the u.s. in 2021. that's up from trump's cap of 18,000 in 2020, and from the target of 110,000 for 2016, the year before trump became president.
senator gillibrand strongly condemns anti-semitism from anyone, in all forms, and believes it has no place in a movement for women's empowerment or anywhere else, her campaign said.
if the idea was to get as many people as possible to know him, buttigieg had a good person to help: smith. as frenetic as buttigieg was steady, as prone to expletives as buttigieg was averse to them, and as intolerant of stillness as buttigieg was dedicated to it, smith always seemed like an unlikely partner.
mike miller was the cornerstone for all the progress that has occurred in the state over the past three decades, said timothy f. maloney, a prominent trial lawyer and former democratic state delegate representing prince george's. there has been no major initiative that has occurred without mike's leadership. he saw everything from a historical context and tried to get ahead of history to see where things were going.
the special counsel's office learned about trump's directive for cohen to lie to congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the trump organization and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents. cohen then acknowledged those instructions during his interviews with that office. … it is the first known example of trump explicitly telling a subordinate to lie directly about his own dealings with russia.
republicans have already started to hammer her.
warnock ran on a liberal platform, especially supporting criminal justice reform, expanding health-care access and improving the economy and job market for groups that are often left out of economic booms. and the minister's views on these issues are deeply shaped by his religious faith, he has said.
democrats countered that, politics aside, a candidate for the scc needed more than 30 minutes of review before being appointed. all we're asking for is fairness and vetting, said house minority leader eileen filler-corn (d-fairfax).
absolutely, i'd answer, but that's not us. we are partners. we have our own salaries. and we are both women. she'd laugh.
the impetus for the report came from the discovery of infant remains at the bon secours sisters home in tuam, western ireland. dogged historians discovered death certificates for almost 800 infants at the home but could not find burial records, until the grim excavations began.
talking points distributed by biden allies say that he could run as a progressive champion who was outspoken on lgbtq rights even when every pundit around said that it was a political mistake. his rivals point out that biden would be the only democrat who cast a vote in favor of a national ban on same-sex marriage, in 1996. only one other potential candidate, sanders, was in office that year.

(evelyn hockstein for the washington post) trump's recognition of white nationalists will loom by matt zapotosky when joe biden formally announced his entry into the presidential race in 2019, he said he was moved to do so while watching president trump talk about a white nationalist rally that turned violent in charlottesville. a woman protesting the racist demonstrators had been killed in the mayhem, but rather than condemning the white nationalists, trump said there were very fine people on both sides. read the full story arrow-right
they might win these suburbs, but they are going to lose every other part of the state, and all the gains they make will be mitigated, nunn said. but as a republican in the suburbs, he readily admitted he felt a bit endangered.
while trump billed himself as a populist, kaplan perceived a consistent disconnect in how trump university and other enterprises allegedly took advantage of the very people whose interests he claimed to champion.
these should have been the safest places for children to be born; instead, they were the most dangerous places, he said.
plouffe's consternation over the political risk to the president turned out to be unfounded. in his ingenuous way, biden had nudged the president to fall in line with the mood of the country. a gallup poll that week found that 50 percent of americans said they supported legal rights for gays wishing to marry; 65 percent of democrats and 57 percent of independents agreed, while 22 percent of republicans approved.
but buttigieg, who worked out of chicago and specialized in energy and economic development, didn't make a career of it. he left mckinsey after three years and two extended leaves to door-knock for obama in 2008 and serve as research director for the gubernatorial campaign of indiana democrat jill long thompson.

when buttigieg took the microphone, he was forced to yell, doing his best to deliver his message without showing frustration that no one in a room full of black dignitaries seemed to want to hear it. when former vice president joe biden took the same stage later that afternoon, the room was raucous at his arrival, then rapt for his remarks.
rep. luis v. gutiérrez (d-ill.) blasted his democratic colleagues in the senate for shortchanging latino voters, an increasingly critical voting bloc for the party.
after his unequivocal declaration on same-sex marriage, biden told gregory about that private meeting he had had with gay advocates in los angeles. during the meeting's question-and-answer period, biden recounted, one of the men wanted to know: let me ask you, how do you feel about us?
the breakthrough came monday after senate democrats bowed to pressure to reopen the government, joining republicans in backing an immigration and spending compromise that was quickly denounced by liberals and immigration activists.
• rejoin the paris agreement on global warming. trump withdrew the u.s. from this pact, through which almost 200 countries have pledged limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
privately, his advisers point to that as a key pivot point in buttigieg's campaign. instead of delivering a triumphant victory speech on national television to a party eager for a savior, he was slammed for declaring victory prematurely. instead of a week of coverage of his triumph, outlets focused on the reporting debacle.
cnn published a rundown last night of gillibrand's reversals on immigration under the stinging headline how kirsten gillibrand went from pushing for more deportations to wanting to abolish ice. the story points out that she even attacked the republican congressman she defeated in 2006 from the right, blasting him as too soft on border security.
bezos won the equality award for his long-standing personal commitment to building a more equal society and shining a spotlight on the challenges lgbtq people face in their daily lives, human rights campaign president chad griffin said in a statement. speaking at the group's washington gala in october, bezos expressed strong support for equality. i believe that the ideal of equality is ingrained deeply within all of us. it is inalienable, he said.
with mckenna navigating from the back seat, we speed off with controlled aggression toward the interstate and two fundraisers in northern virginia. it's a shame about richmond, but we'll have more time to talk this way, buttigieg says. i have to make a couple of calls, just so you know. i figure what we ought to do is we'll find a place with a decent lunch. there should be good barbecue in this part of virginia, right? as long as we're in fairfax by 3 o'clock or so we'll be okay. so i'm pretty much all yours. we can make this a rolling interview. so to speak!
at issue was a vacancy on the state corporation commission, a three-judge panel that regulates public utilities, banking, insurance and other commerce. chartered in the early 1900s to oversee the railroad monopolies, the scc is an independent body sometimes called the fourth branch of the state government.
for years, democratic presidential candidates have been skittish about taking positions that were considered too liberal, for fear of scaring off moderates and independent voters. that caution seems to be gone, along with soul-searching about making explicit appeals to conservative voters.
that doesn't mean the era is now in force. in 1972, when congress originally sent the era to the states to be ratified, it set a deadline of 1979 for ratification, a deadline that was extended to 1982 — at which time only 35 states had ratified the measure. for that and other reasons, three state attorneys general recently filed a federal suit aiming to block adoption of the amendment. on jan. 7, era advocates filed suit in massachusetts arguing that the deadline is not binding because it was not in the text of the original amendment. that will take time to work its way through the courts.
in 2016, the national center for transgender equality published a survey of transgender adults. of those who reported they identified as or were perceived as transgender or gender-nonconforming during their k-12 school years, 77 percent said they had been harassed or mistreated in some way; just over half reported being harassed verbally for their gender identity; a quarter indicated they'd been physically attacked, and about a tenth said they'd been sexually assaulted. seventeen percent said they left school before they graduated because of the harassment and violence they endured. just over half of those who reported negative experiences in schools said they had considered suicide, which is higher than the third of transgender-identified youth who had not been harassed.
meghan mccain's realization about the necessity of universal parental leave is wonderful, and i'm grateful for it. i'm eager to see her try to hold politicians' feet to the fire. and i expect that in doing so, she might have another realization: that it's frustrating to try to persuade people to care about an injustice when they haven't suffered through it themselves.
sorcher says that when making content decisions, cartoon network had to factor in that steven universe was airing in nearly 200 countries, including some culturally conservative markets.
• make the u.s. economy reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. this promise relies on tougher fuel-efficiency standards accelerating the adoption of electric vehicles. to make them run, biden would install 500,000 public charging outlets.
carney won that election narrowly and won a second term in 2008 by running far ahead of barack obama. but marino defeated him by 10 points and held onto the seat comfortably after two rounds of redistricting. in 2016, president trump carried the district with 66.1 percent of the vote, one of his strongest performances anywhere in the state.
a senate bill to prohibit taking campaign money from dominion died in committee. and both houses are advancing sweeping environmental legislation called the virginia clean economy act that dominion has had a strong hand in shaping. the measure sets goals for switching to renewable energy sources in coming years and helps safeguard dominion's investments in wind and solar.
another day, another clear majority of voters putting shutdown blame on the president. there has been no shift in these numbers since the shutdown began; the president's only comment on shutdown polling has been to refer to a crosstab in one poll that suggested latino voters were moving his way since last year. (this was probably a small sampling error.)
i think i'm justified in my concern. a 2019 the new york times/yougov survey found that 28 percent of parents said that day care and preschool expenses were a very significant financial strain and 20 percent said they went into debt to manage those expenses. a ranking of 35 organization for economic cooperation and development countries from least to most family-friendly put the united states in 34th place, ahead only of mexico.
buttigieg's decision came shortly before super tuesday, the biggest primary day of the year, at a time when the democratic race shows signs of becoming a race between sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and former vice president joe biden, with biden occupying a centrist position that buttigieg had hoped to make his own.
the irish prime minister vowed to act on all the recommendations of the report, including a restorative justice program, and to deliver the legislative change necessary to at least start to heal the wounds that endure.
on adventure time years earlier, sugar had been excited to write marceline, who long pined for princess bubblegum. (they eventually got together.) yet at that time, sugar also understood how the industry operated: most children's network animation had dealt with same-sex couplings only in coded ways, she says, so any allusion to a gay relationship had to fly under the radar.
the warnock/loeffler race also appeared to be a microcosm of many of the larger culture and political wars being fought in politics across the country. warnock sought to replace a lawmaker who has closely aligned herself to president trump, who lost the state.
he signed the feb. 14, 1973, letter little pretty, naba, mata hari, tigress, abigayil, zorro and chunky.
yet kaplan continues to offer heard legal advice on the case and other legal matters. they speak regularly, sometimes daily. she is the bravest lawyer i have ever met. she doesn't get intimidated or scare easily, heard says. the well-behaved woman never interested me. there's a rebellious part of robbie. i think of her as my jewish mother.
soon, new hampshire, south carolina and nevada operations sprung up, as well. he hired senior adviser and key strategist michael halle — one of the architects behind buttigieg's delegate strategy — in july. by august, he had a deputy campaign manager, hari sevugan.
appearing with robinson were two legislators who have supported similar bills in recent years, sen. siobhan s. dunnavant (r-henrico) and del. glenn r. davis jr. (r-virginia beach).
there's been a fairly condescending notion from democrats that to win back trump voters you have to go in and look comfortable in white working-class communities, one operative said. that won't pass in the democratic party anymore. if you try that, you're going to hear 'hey, you voted to send our jobs overseas,' and that's right in trump's strike zone. he's got some experience in nailing democrats who voted for these trade deals.
most prominent democrats aren't publicly challenging this evolution, citing the party's successes during the midterm election, when democrats won races in rural areas that had voted for both obama and trump. in some of those cases, however, the democratic nominees beat out candidates with more liberal positions in the primaries.
when you absorb any amount of someone's pain that they're living in that moment, it's hard to ignore it, gillibrand told gq last year. it changed my view completely and it changed my view immediately. it wasn't an evolution. it wasn't a thoughtful process. it was immediate.
the house has voted to decriminalize marijuana, imposing a fine of no more than $25 for simple possession. a house measure to legalize pot was defeated, with democrats saying the state is not ready for that step. the senate passed a decriminalization bill late tuesday.
the couple married dec. 18, 1915.
the effects of the shutdown over the weekend were relatively muted: halting trash pickup on national park service property, canceling military reservists' drill plans, switching off some government employees' cellphones.
within days, kaplan and her team flew to virginia. the firm adopted an outside-the-box approach and sued two dozen avowed neo-nazis, white supremacists and associated groups, invoking the 1871 ku klux klan act to argue that they conspired for months to commit racially motivated violence, thereby making it more of a challenge for the organizers to adopt free speech as a defense. the case is scheduled for trial in october.
checks and balances! says one admirer.
nearly two years after he announced his cancer diagnosis, mr. miller's passing unleashed a wave of grief in annapolis and further sealed a complete leadership transformation at the state house he presided over for 33 years. because of his illness, mr. miller relinquished the senate presidency in october 2019 but retained his seat as a rank-and-file member until dec. 23, when he resigned.
um, let's see — i was 5.
ahead of the vote to end debate, schumer warned mcconnell to keep his word.
what i'm most interested in is how she got there. or rather, why it took her so long to get there. or rather, how we can speed up this process so that it doesn't require every leave-denier to personally birth a child before they also get on board.
the order wrote: we were part of the system in which they suffered hardship, loneliness and terrible hurt. we acknowledge in particular that infants and children who died at the home were buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way. for all that, we are deeply sorry.
we're going to have to understand that judicial confirmations these days are more like political campaigns, leo told the members of the council for national policy, according to a recording of the speech obtained by the washington post. we're going to have to be smart as a movement.
in 2012, leo joined the boards of the nonprofit catholic association and an affiliated charity, the catholic association foundation. they funded campaigns to rally catholic voters and stop states from recognizing same-sex marriage.
about 15 minutes later, kavanaugh wrote back: leonard just called me and gave me the same earful.
if the church is to be fully honest, it needs to acknowledge that it wasn't simply somehow an equal partner in all of this, o'gorman said, but rather it directed and dominated a culture that stigmatized women, that violated the rights of women and children, that brutalized people in this country and hundreds of thousands of women in particular.
still, the relief among senators upon reaching a deal was palpable. as the voting began, schumer shouted from his seated position. lindsey! thank you, my friend, he said as graham approached and shook his hand. we wouldn't be here without you.
upset: this green card relationship was actually a genuine love connection — at least on one man's part. i agree that there were many red flags here, but blaming and shaming wouldn't serve the greater good.
most of the money went toward supporting the chapter programs and staging conferences — in other words, tending to the network and the idea factory. what makes leonard leo so consequential is not because he's so smart or whatever, it's that he's sitting at the center of an enormous network, says steven teles, author of the rise of the conservative legal movement: the battle for control of the law and a professor of political science at johns hopkins university. he has lots of information, and that information isn't just his; it's that those things bubble up through those relationships … spreading through all these people who know each other, and they develop reputations and linkages, which then have lots of other consequences.
• raise the top federal income tax rate to 39.6%, where it was before trump and congressional republicans cut it to 37% starting in 2018. this top rate would apply to income beyond $400,000 (more for married couples filing jointly).
-- gillibrand may be the starkest example, but this week has shown that she's certainly not the only 2020 presidential candidate who is recalibrating in an effort to catch up with the party's base. the center of gravity in the democratic party has undeniably moved further to the left since sanders's unexpectedly strong performance against hillary clinton in 2016. half of democrats now embrace the label liberal in pew's polling, up 15 points from when barack obama won the nomination in 2008. many of the party's pickups in the 2006 midterms came from conservative rural areas, including gillibrand, but the gains in 2018 were mostly thanks to moderates in the suburbs. democratic voters have adopted more-liberal stances on a battery of social issues, health care, guns and more. and politicians who have been on the scene for a while find themselves trying to catch up with the times.
also, i knew when i met rachel there was no way i was going to be able to be in the closet and be with rachel, kaplan says. those two things were completely incompatible. everyone in the new york gay rights movement knew lavine. politics, civic engagement and intellectual rigor were part of the attraction. on an early date in a romantic chelsea bistro, the two argued at length over the comparative power of the bolsheviks and the mensheviks during the russian revolution.
in 2016 and 2017, the three nonprofits raised about $33 million, with the bh fund taking in $24,250,000 from a single donor whose identity is still not publicly known, documents show. bh fund then gave a total of almost $3 million to the two other leo groups, freedom and opportunity fund and america engaged. the center for responsive politics published details about the groups' spending in february.
also here is ramesh james, a tall longhaired young man of trinidadian heritage about whom cory says, speaking of personal presentation: he doesn't look like a youth organizer. he looks like he's going to give you a `colombian necktie' and kill your brother and sister. everybody laughs. ramesh laughs. it's the story of his life. and true, he has been in trouble. growing up in queens, he says, he was jumped by some kids who beat him so badly with bats and pipes that he had to be hospitalized and is now deaf in one ear. he says he shot one of his attackers and was sent to a juvenile detention facility. now he's on probation, working at youth force, a supervisor, responsible, articulate, intelligent, traveling with lisa when she's invited to talk at events. it's always lisa invited to talk at events. she's small and female. he's tall and male. he knows how reno feels, being tall, being different. i could give the woman a hug, he says, struck by how real and human she appears in person. in fact, after the event was over, after they'd all finished singing with peter yarrow, ramesh singing onstage with youth force, reno singing from the front row, ramesh did walk over to embrace the attorney general, who had made a point of hugging lisa, but instead was edged away by security guards, he says. tall guy, dark-skinned. sorry, no hugs. he's used to it. they're all used to it.
nurturing ambitions to become an artist, she settled in san francisco, leaving her husband and son behind. she said she did not engage in prostitution until after she was arrested on false accusations of having done so.
h istorians are notably wary of the word revolution. they are even grudging in applying it to political events (was the english revolution of 1688 a revolution or merely a restoration? ), still more so to social or cultural events. and still more to social or cultural events in their own time. surely a longer perspective (the famous long view that historians are supposed to cultivate) will dissipate the effect of ephemeral experiences and reveal the continuity behind ostensibly dramatic changes. yet occasionally, very occasionally, historians are privileged (or doomed) to live through real revolutions, even social and cultural ones. arthur marwick, a professor of history at the open university in england, maintains that the 1960s witnessed one such revolution. and a revolution, moreover, that transcended political and national boundaries. marwick confines himself to four countries, britain, france, italy and the united states (with passing references to germany, eastern europe and japan). as a good historian, he apologizes for focusing on so artificial a period as a decade, and then, with further apologies, for prolonging the sixties to encompass the long decade of 1958 to 1974. the apologies are unnecessary. there was a revolution in these (and other) countries, and decades are sometimes significant units of time, even though they spill over into the adjacent years. the 800-odd page book (with another hundred pages of bibliography, footnotes and index) is one to be read in rather than read through.
i don't want people to put me in a box here, she said. i have a lot of friends who are in the lgbt community, and they just want to be living their lives. just like someone who's heterosexual, they just want to live their lives.
it's just like the brokerage business or any business of sales, mccloskey told the national catholic reporter in 2003. you get a reputation, you deal with one person and they mention you to another person . . . and all of a sudden you have a string of people.
buttigieg would spend most of the next few months repeating himself, in television interviews and magazine sit-downs, on cnn town halls and sunday shows. from the earliest days of buttigieg's bid, mike schmuhl, a longtime friend turned campaign manager, acknowledged it was a long shot.
if you compare biden's on-paper strength to what we saw in the past few contests, it would make sense to call him a front-runner. the only serious poll of iowa so far, december's des moines register/cnn poll, put him at 32 percent in the first caucus state, 13 points ahead of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt). every national poll of democratic votes, which don't mean much at this stage but generate plenty of news, has put biden on top. polls testing him against the president consistently put him ahead.
confirmation nation: confirmations to biden's cabinet continue on the hill as janet yellen was approved as the first female secretary of the treasury department, jeff stein and rachel siegel report.
if she puts any pressure on herself, it is the pressure that she does not want to be the last, said moore, one of the first black women to break into the upper echelons of democratic politics. you're always thinking about how you can make sure that door stays open to someone else. you don't want the doors to close behind you, because they would really never open if they do.
although he left washington at perhaps the height of his fame, mccloskey's legacy is the ongoing influence of the catholic information center. the center's board includes leonard leo, executive vice president of the federalist society, which helped shepherd the supreme court nominations of brett m. kavanaugh and neil m. gorsuch. white house counsel pat cipollone is a former board member, as is william p. barr, who served as attorney general under president george h.w. bush and is now president trump's nominee for the same position.

mr. miller sometimes got himself into trouble for his freewheeling banter. in 1989, as he was emerging as a statewide political force, he used a profanity to describe baltimore, a blunder that quashed whatever hope had to run for governor.
i think the way you win this issue is you focus on getting the rights and privileges protected throughout the entire country, and then you do the state-by-state advocacy for having the title, she told an lgbt publication not long before her senate appointment, according to the advocate.
we're focused on an intersectional, international strategy that sets the narrative for 2020, said linda sarsour, one of the four co-founders of the women's march. you want to knock on our door and get our vote in 2020? you'd better get with the agenda.
their failure to add even a modest compliment to this rather pointed observation leads me to suspect that they do not like my new hairstyle. i am loath to say something to the effect of, yes, do you like it?'' because, frankly, i do not want their opinion (it is hard enough for me to decide on personal grooming matters; i do not need input from everyone i know), and in any case they seem to have already made their true opinion known by their rather loud silence.

just two weeks into the 116th congress, we have a member pulling the ripcord: rep. tom marino (r-pa.), a five-term conservative who arrived in washington with the tea party wave.
president trump welcomed democrats' decision to relent and said the administration would work toward solving the problem of very unfair illegal immigration.
nelles recalls a time when kaplan called to consult on a case. she's yapping at me on the phone and then lets out a little screech.
pelosi must make tlaib pay a price for her use of the language of jew-hatred, jonathan tobin wrote in the new york post. if she doesn't, it won't just be a matter of hypocrisy but a sign of the growing tolerance for anti-semitism on the left.
overview iyanna cooke hugs a friend at the site of daniel prude's killing by police after a vigil at first church of god in rochester, n.y., on sept. 3. (libby march for the washington post) it will take more than words to 'heal' racial wounds by tim craig, mark berman and amy b wang the united states is a nation that has spent the past four years torn apart by racism, political polarization and mistrust stoked by a president who seems to relish the chaos he helps cause. helping the country heal will be among president-elect joe biden's top priorities. but as biden prepares to take office on jan. 20, his administration must confront just how deep the country's wounds are as he attempts to finalize his agenda on policing, racial and social justice, and equity within the criminal justice system. read the full story arrow-right

who do you think is mostly responsible for the partial shutdown of the federal government? (fox news, 1,008 registered voters)
but, he added, all's well that ends well.
the trump factor: from his perch in palm beach, trump is working to oust perceived political enemies by supporting pro-trump primary challengers to republicans who he feels have betrayed him. with portman's departure, ohio is now seen as a major new opportunity for the president, according to the new york times's maggie haberman and reid epstein.
two years later, as democrats swept the state, marino won his final term by 32 points. but even scott wagner, the republican nominee for governor who lost statewide by 17.1 points, carried marino's seat by 20. it's never a good sign when an incumbent heads for the exits, but a republican loss here would take an even more dramatic swing than the one that elected sen. doug jones (d-ala.).
lew was lewis douglass, the eldest son of abolitionist frederick douglass, and he was writing to his beloved h. amelia loguen on june 16, 1862, from rochester, n.y.
so why isn't he treated like hillary clinton was, with potential rivals scurrying out of his shadow? in conversations this week, operatives working with most of the candidates already running for president offered a number of reasons. some imagined that biden could carve out a lane for himself; some speculated that he could collapse once a presidential bid moved from fantasy to reality.
the plan didn't seem like that much of a coup. they had done the same for derry, knocking on doors and making phone calls to get her elected in a district where the republican registration advantage had shrunk from 14 percentage points in 2016 to about 7 today.
-- a belarusian model who claims she has evidence that the trump campaign colluded with russia was held in moscow on prostitution charges. anton troianovski and rosalind s. helderman report: the model, anastasia vashukevich, had been deported from thailand earlier in the day after spending nine months in prison on charges of conspiracy and soliciting prostitution. she was booked to fly to minsk, belarus, but was detained along with three others traveling with her as she changed planes at moscow's sheremetyevo inter­national airport, according to her husband and another person traveling with her. … her arrest in moscow was unexpected and blocked her from possibly talking to dozens of journalists waiting for her in the airport's arrivals zone.

all he has to do, really, is be a tall tough woman with short hair, any tall tough woman with short hair, and voila, janet reno! look over there, there's gilligan's island! on screen, reno, using a pillow as an oar, rows herself and simba on an imaginary raft to south america, where clinton is on a state visit. then she uses her window curtain to make a bridal veil for a fantasy marriage ceremony. would they have focused on the attorney general's romantic life if the attorney general were a man? no, ferrell says without hesitation. they'd only go after the sex angle if a man had done something to deserve it, if there was something there already, a clinton thing, a jfk thing, a gary hart thing. but with reno, the fun is that there's not an obvious sex thing. she's perceived as almost asexual in a way, so it's fun to do that she really dreams about . . . asexual? well, i think, she just seems like a career-driven woman who is no-frills. on the screen, clinton has now materialized in the attorney general's bedroom. i feel we're giving her the benefit of the doubt, ferrell suggests, in that we've chosen to portray her as being repressed and dreaming about – men. well, um, yes. sure enough, in her screen fantasy, reno is kissing the president. ferrell is laughing. he's never seen the broadcast version before.

reading his paean to bernie, it's clear that young buttigieg already had a streak of ambition and opportunism to match his idealism. i have heard that no sensible young person today would want to give his or her life to public service, the senior-class president and valedictorian of st. joseph high concluded. i can personally assure you this is untrue. and it paid off: at the award ceremony in boston, ted kennedy offered him a summer internship on the spot. that first wide-eyed taste of washington after his freshman year at harvard set him on the path that could soon, improbably enough, have him facing off against the once-obscure socialist congressman who struck him, 18 years ago, as both immensely admirable and impossibly old.
kaplan is celebrated for her candor. she's active in lgbtq causes, recently serving as the board chair of the gay men's health crisis. she rhapsodizes about her big gay jewish wedding in 2005 to rachel lavine, a liberal activist who serves on new york's democratic committee.
in a working paper analyzing americasbarometer and latinobarómetro public opinion data from across the region, smith and boas found that when abortion or same-sex marriage dominate the headlines, abortion rights or antiabortion attitudes start to matter more on election day. traditionally, voters mostly worry about bread-and-butter issues when they go to the polls. but as candidates stake out opposing positions on new culture war issues, elections are being transformed. championing abortion or same-sex marriage rights can pave the way to victory, but so can conservative opposition — as happened in brazil's 2018 election of jair bolsonaro.
susie buell, a major democratic donor who has criticized gillibrand's handling of the episode, wrote in an email to the washington post that she saw gillibrand as the leader in the force calling for franken's resignation, calling it a rush to judgment at a very intense moment.
the 48 men who have served as vice president of the united states constitute a monochromatic collection whose diversity could generously be defined as whether someone wore a bow tie or a regular tie, had a mustache or a beard, was balding or merely on the verge.
according to the survey, released thursday, gen z teens and young adults have overwhelmingly adopted left-leaning beliefs similar to those of the millennials before them. they overwhelmingly disapprove of president trump, believe the government should do more and reject american exceptionalism.

colm o'gorman, executive director of amnesty international ireland, said the report absolutely validates the testimony of many survivors and victims over the years who talked about forced labor, appalling acts of abuse and forced adoptions.
-- president trump allegedly instructed his longtime fixer, michael cohen, to lie to congress about negotiations to build a trump tower in moscow and continued receiving updates about the project during the 2016 campaign, according to buzzfeed news's jason leopold and anthony cormier. the story cites two unnamed federal law enforcement officials. trump also supported a plan, set up by cohen, to visit russia during the presidential campaign, in order to personally meet president vladimir putin and jump-start the tower negotiations. 'make it happen,' the sources said trump told cohen. and even as trump told the public he had no business deals with russia, the sources said trump and his children ivanka and donald trump jr. received regular, detailed updates about the real estate development from cohen, whom they put in charge of the project. …
buttigieg's exit leaves several unanswered questions, chief among them whether he will endorse biden or any of the other remaining contenders, and whether his staffers will shift over to another campaign. it also leaves unanswered the question of buttigieg's own future.
underscoring the piece's potency, the harris operation forcefully pushed back in a statement to reporters that made no apologies: kamala harris has spent her career fighting for reforms in the criminal justice system and pushing the envelope to keep everyone safer by bringing fairness and accountability, said harris spokeswoman lily adams. when most prosecutors were using a tough on crime approach, senator harris was starting back on track in 2004 which diverted young people charged with first time drug offenses into apprenticeship and training programs instead of decades long prison sentences. when she was attorney general, she brought accountability to the system with the first statewide training on implicit bias and procedural justice in the country, body cameras to the agents at doj, launched multiple pattern and practice investigations and demanded data on in-custody deaths and police shooting be made available to the public.
in paris, it came as quite a shock that meklat was given a book deal with grasset, one of the most prestigious french publishing houses.
i understood in reading this kid, for a part of his generation, that words spoken or written in the virtual universe were themselves virtual and had nothing to do with the real world, said nora, who also happens to be jewish. i don't say that as an excuse for him, just as something that struck me.
the departure of the clintons kind of uncorks a new energy, buttigieg is saying as we rattle up the interstate. it's an exciting time to be a democrat. the party has to figure out what it means now.
gillibrand has said that she developed a passion for politics while growing up in albany. her maternal grandmother was an influential political organizer, and her mother worked as a lawyer, had a black belt in karate and shot the family's thanksgiving turkey each year.
one of the most widely read, and shared, op-eds in the new york times yesterday was a blistering rebuttal of this attempted rebranding by law professor lara bazelon, who formerly directed the loyola law school innocence project: all too often, she was on the wrong side of that history. … time after time, when progressives urged her to embrace criminal justice reforms as a district attorney and then the state's attorney general, ms. harris opposed them or stayed silent. most troubling, ms. harris fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct that included evidence tampering, false testimony and the suppression of crucial information by prosecutors. … if kamala harris wants people who care about dismantling mass incarceration and correcting miscarriages of justice to vote for her, she needs to radically break with her past. a good first step would be to apologize to the wrongfully convicted people she has fought to keep in prison. ...
as leo tells it, trump was open to one of his long-held goals: a federal court system dominated by conservative judges who believe the constitution must be interpreted literally.
an aide to buttigieg's campaign said buttigieg and his advisers looked at their models after south carolina results came in, and they discovered their path had narrowed.
but once upon a time, before the age of tweets and tinder, lovers took ink to paper to express their devotion to one another. so for this valentine's day, the washington post asked curators at the library of congress to select some of their favorite love letters.
it's rush hour on a november evening in washington's busiest regional rail hub, but swarming commuters must yield to a much more potent tide. the federalist society has taken over the main hall of union station for its annual black-tie gala. the stone walls of the vast, vaulted concourse are bathed in pale red and blue, while larger-than-life white spotlight cameo silhouettes of james madison's head — the society's trademark — crown the columns and glow on video screens. two hundred and twenty sold-out tables, each set for 10, await the throng funneling through a block-long tent, where $200-a-plate tickets are checked; inside, exclamations of celebration and reunion echo and blend into a deafening roar.
loeffler also accused warnock of inviting communist leader fidel castro to a church where he served in the 1990s, an allegation fact-checkers dismissed. loeffler's campaign also sought to tie warnock to jeremiah wright through attack ads, in ways that politifact described as mostly false. such attacks prompted backlash from other black church leaders.

in 1991, kaplan came out to her parents at age 25. it did not go well. her mother walked up to a wall and began banging her head, repeatedly, in dismay. which she has apologized for over and over again, kaplan says. the family remains close.
mccain is, of course, completely correct. among the world's 41 wealthiest countries, the united states is the only one that doesn't mandate paid leave — leagues behind top-ranking estonia, hungary and the other countries that offer more than a year. paid parental leave is good for families, good for children and good for working parents, and america's failure on this matter is so self-evident that we don't need to spend more than this one paragraph emphasizing it. meghan mccain is one thousand percent right.

the directives, which may take the form of an executive order or a presidential memo, are expected to be part of a package of executive actions focusing on 'equity,' according to two people familiar with the plans. the other administrative actions are expected to focus on tribal governments, fair housing, and private prisons. the biden administration has told outside groups it is also preparing measures on voting rights.
[davis] wouldn't let anyone issue licenses, laycock said. but the county is not an employee, the county has no religion, and exempting the county would deprive all same-sex couples of essential government services. substituting a different [official] for myrick doesn't deprive anyone of anything.
obama seemed unperturbed, noting that he'd already decided to announce his position before the election. he lightly chastised his vice president, and in a way that revealed what he understood about biden. certainly the vice president was impetuous, but, the president knew, joe cared deeply about the way americans were treated.
meanwhile, for all the federalist society's steamrolling progress on display, i detected a sign of tension that may, too, carry into the future. near the conclusion of the gala, while mcgahn and mcconnell are still gloating, i notice a figure standing at a high-top with a drink in the bar area. it's george conway iii, husband of trump communications counselor kellyanne conway. george is surrounded by some friends, and none of them is paying much attention to mcgahn and mcconnell.
as president, obama demonstrated his sympathy for the rights of the gay community. he led and won the repeal of the clinton-era don't ask, don't tell policy, which denied openly gay americans the right to serve in the military. obama also ended the justice department's legal defense of the 1996 defense of marriage act, which defined marriage as a union of a man and a woman and allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages attained in other states; the supreme court would rule the law unconstitutional in 2013.

i didn't want to stop anyone from getting married, said myrick, who is 68 and lives in monroe, n.c. i also knew my religious convictions would not allow me to perform those marriages personally.
all four of the men interviewed have children in school, and all four said their schools, a mix of private and public, had been extremely supportive of their families. the thing that has been the most difficult are strangers who don't understand, gertner said. they see us out with our son and we don't fit into their little box of what a family looks like. i've been asked whether jeffrey and i mixed our sperm together in a cup. and that's rude, but as our son gets older, he is being shaped by a certain narrative about who he is.
nine of the groups hired the same conservative media relations firm, creative response concepts, collectively paying it more than $10 million in contracting fees in 2016 and 2017. during that time, the firm coordinated a months-long media campaign in support of trump's supreme court nominee, neil m. gorsuch, including publishing opinion essays, contributing 5,000 quotes to news stories, scheduling pundit appearances on television and posting online videos that were viewed 50 million times, according to a report on the firm's website.
• undo trump's country-specific immigration bans, restrictions on asylum-seekers and expansion of the public-charge rule, which denies legal-resident status to immigrants deemed likely to need government assistance for things such as food.
the center of gravity of the american people is way to the left of the center of gravity of congress and, in many ways, to the left of the national democratic party, buttigieg had told me earlier in the year. that's especially true of millennials. their political outlook is shaped by being the first post-world war ii generation to face diminished economic prospects, and also the first to fully experience the diminished quality of life wrought by decades of tax-slashing, privatization and deregulation: inefficient social services, unaffordable child care, crummy roads and trains and public transportation, slow internet speeds, and a rapidly warming earth. buttigieg's peers are eager to embrace a politics that's bigger and more ambitious — more new deal than new democrat. they want swing-for-the-fences solutions from politicians who don't pretend that all the country needs is just some minor tweaks.
that, he says, is an incredible idea.
leo came to be known in the white house as coordinator of all outside coalition activity regarding judicial nominations, according to a 2003 email by a white house aide to kavanaugh and others.

buttigieg, the wunderkind mayor of south bend, ind., and one of the longest of 2020 presidential long shots, knew about the storm. his plane from chicago had been delayed by the bad weather on friday night, finally touching down in charleston, s.c., at 3 a.m. after three saturday events in the carolinas, he had driven five hours through the night with matt mckenna, his lanky and eternally patient young aide, only to find most of williamsburg's tourist hotels booked solid with local families and work crews. somebody forgot to make reservations. for the second straight morning, buttigieg has had to skip his 6 a.m. run. he's just learned that his second planned event of the day, another pep talk for another congressional candidate in richmond, has been canceled.
… the women's marches now loom as a lesson on what can go wrong when the decentralized grass-roots movements that gained traction after donald trump's election adopt rhetoric and behavior that challenges public sympathy.
people familiar with the inner workings of the transition say biden has been adamant about harris being the last voice he hears on issues — to, as moore put it, an exacting extent. she also said — while declining to share details — that while harris did often agree with biden about a candidate or issue, she has not been shy about speaking up when she doesn't.
when was the last time alan greenspan got accused of wearing bad glasses? the point could be argued. ours is, as john white notes, an age of celebrity, an age of tv, an age of visuals, an age of glare. men do worry about their clothes, their hair, their wrinkles. okay, says white, thinking. proxmire, when he had his implants done in the '70s, those plugs put in, it was commented on. i'm trying to think of another example . . . some male politicians make fun of themselves and the way they look. mario cuomo used to make fun of his own italian appearance, ted kennedy of his weight – but in the early days, kennedy's weight was seen as a barometer of whether he'd run for president. with men, he suggests, a change is related to political ambition; with women it would be striking but unrelated to ambition, a fashion statement. in other words, women in public positions are expected, far more than men, to be both competent and ornamental. and what's most different about reno, white points out, is how the lampoons so quickly leave the realm of mere visuals and move into the sexual realm. i was trying to think of prominent male politicians who have been bachelors, and i thought of sam rayburn, who was married for weeks or maybe just days, and it was never discussed or commented on, white says.
in 2016, mr. wofford described the merging of his personal and political ideals in an essay published in the new york times, finding love again, this time with a man.
by the time the focus shifted to new hampshire, sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) was staging her brief but important rise: buttigieg advisers felt her surprise third-place finish there cost buttigieg a victory, as well as precious attention. he lost to sen. bernie sanders by less than two percentage points, falling short of would have been a stunning victory in the backyard of the independent from vermont.
the party's swift shift has left vulnerable several democratic candidates or likely ones who have voting records and previous stances that are out-of-line with current democratic thinking. those who defend their earlier stances risk seeming stuck in time to party that's quickly transforming, while those who have changed their positions risk being labeled as flip-floppers and opportunists.
america right now is crying out for leadership, leadership i know exists in this room, said los angeles mayor eric garcetti in a thursday speech. it's time to demand that washington follow our lead, instead of the other way around.
harris will almost certainly be scrutinized more than most of the men who preceded her.
there is a time and a place for everything, del. matt fariss (r-campbell) said afterward. this is a time we need to work together and not be divisive.
but for the woman who suffered years of emotional despair, the success of the center has two aspects. she remains a deeply religious catholic and celebrates the center's work. but she is also left with the unshakable memory of the center's famous champion as he pushed against her 17 years ago.
she has got a different voice, a voice of gravitas, a complete and rounded voice, moore said. she has not shied away from her voice and [biden] has not shied away from her opinion.
in 2009, he got his dander up when richard mourdock, the republican state treasurer facing reelection in indiana, sued the obama administration to block the auto bailout. this was an insane thing for an elected official in indiana to do, buttigieg says. that made me start asking: why don't i run against this guy?
liberal legal advocates and scholars realized they were in a serious battle for the law with the federalist society after the supreme court decided bush v. gore in 2000, handing the white house to george w. bush. peter rubin, then a professor at georgetown, founded the american constitution society to win hearts and minds of students, lawyers and judges.
culture fix: enjoy a modern art moment at moma ps1, an affiliate of the larger institution in manhattan. the museum, which occupies long island city's first school, showcases several long-term art installations plus exhibits with a shorter shelf life. the museum also holds free live performances (music, lectures, etc.) through its vw sunday sessions series. sculpturecenter goes large — in magnitude and concepts — with experimental artworks that fit comfortably inside a former trolley repair shop. each year, it introduces one or two shows by midcareer artists and several exhibits by solo and group artists. japanese-american artist isamu noguchi didn't have to travel far to check up on his noguchi museum, which opened three years before his death in 1988; his studio sat across the street from the zen repository of stone works and akari light sculptures. more than 60 artists from 14 countries lent a hand — or spray can — to the top to bottom mural project, which covers all four sides of a three-story warehouse.
generation z, defined as those born after 1996, is on the cusp of adulthood. the oldest are graduating college. by 2020, almost half will be eligible to vote in the presidential election, which means their values and opinions could soon help shape national politics.
the supreme court could clarify controversial questions when it decides later this year whether a bakery owner has the constitutional right to decline to make a cake for a same-sex wedding.
mr. wofford served stateside in the army air forces, then graduated from the university of chicago in 1948. that year, he married fellow student clare lindgren and traveled with her throughout india and pakistan on a fellowship to study the work of gandhi, who had just been assassinated.

i attacked her, rivera said. i was opposed to her and she did not hold that against me. for all intents and purposes, she broke bread with me and said i want your support.
in past campaigns, democrats have foundered over accusations of flip-flopping. what has changed since then? basically, it was the victory of donald trump, who rolled into his 2016 campaign with a long, often videotaped record of liberal statements. there is a precedent now for telling voters how you evolved and why you won't change back and for making commitments to interest groups that you'll deliver for them. but the candidates who never had to evolve have it easier.
his predicament worsened after the judge in the case learned of a prior conviction: several months earlier, king and his wife had been driving a white friend to the hospital in a neighboring county and were pulled over by a police officer suspicious of the interracial group of travelers. the civil rights leader, who had been found guilty of driving with an out-of-state-license, a misdemeanor, was sentenced to four months of hard labor.
these kids will be a better generation than we are, is a time machine. i'm waiting for the perfect candidate, is a time machine. longing for things to be changed without working to change them is a time machine.
nevertheless, with an aggressive, no-holds-barred media exposure strategy, buttigieg managed to rise in the public consciousness over 2019 and soon began raising more money and polling higher than many of his opponents who were governors or sitting members of congress. buttigieg's obvious intelligence and eloquence excited many democratic voters looking for a powerful counter-force to president trump.
in 1970, with the backing of the prince george's democratic machine, mr. miller won his first political race, capturing a house of delegates seat. four years later, he was elected to the state senate as a conservative democrat.
my precious sweetheart: there are so many things i want to say first — but i can't decide where to begin — but as a preliminary i will ease my heart by saying that which is dearest in all the world — and it is — i love you — love you — love you.
a federal judge ruled last year that she should have been allowed to opt out of performing marriages because of her religious beliefs. as a result, myrick reached a settlement in january with the government to compensate her for her pay, retirement pay and attorneys' fees. she has been represented by the becket fund, which has taken up high-profile cases such as hobby lobby's supreme court case on insurance coverage for contraception. the opinion in her case doesn't serve as binding precedent on other district judges, but a lower court decision like this could be cited in future cases.
his aides crossed their fingers, hoping success in iowa and new hampshire might convince a wider range of voters that buttigieg could win, could lead democrats to their urgent goal of unseating trump.
the irish leader said his society had suffered from a warped attitude to sexuality and intimacy, with a very striking absence of kindness.
another operative was blunter: the biden of democrats' dreams was not the 76-year-old biden who appeared on the stump. this might have been the simplest critique, and clearest argument for why other democrats do not fear biden.
the story in question, by alexander burns, described an october 2018 visit to michigan where biden collected $200,000 to speak to a business group and praised rep. fred upton (r-mich.) as one of the finest guys i've ever worked with.
• create federal grants to encourage more states to enact red flag laws allowing family members or police to ask a court to temporarily remove firearms from people exhibiting violent behavior.
at the conference, every mayoral pitch overlapped: mayors were into negotiation, not brinkmanship. another common thread: no one can ever again say that a job less weighty than governor or senator was too little experience for the presidency.

king was released the next day after robert kennedy, his brother's campaign manager, made another call — this time to the judge. he drove home the political importance of freeing king and assured the jurist that his help would make him a welcome visitor in a future kennedy white house, biographer larry tye wrote in his 2016 book bobby kennedy: the making of a liberal icon.
mr. miller waved off suggestions he commanded the senate with a heavy hand, saying he sought to delegate power and promote fellow senators.
i think he felt it was the right time because of the sense of jaundice president trump had created, said former obama adviser david axelrod, who was in touch with buttigieg at various times throughout his campaign.
there's no reason that by 2025, we can't have most of our energy coming from renewables, biden said thursday. it's all within our grasp, but for special interests. he recapped the implementation of the 2009 stimulus package by saying that it required us to work together, because our backs were against the wall. the reaction from rival campaigns: which republicans does he think the next president will have to deal with?
the normally stoic buttigieg appeared to be steadying himself throughout his farewell remarks in his hometown of south bend, bringing to an end what was for a time an electrifying candidacy. after a year of going everywhere, meeting everyone, defying every expectation, seeking every vote, the truth is that the path has narrowed to a close for our candidacy, if not for our cause, buttigieg said.
republicans countered that west is a well-known figure in richmond and hampton roads. and they pointed out another factor: because the chairman of the scc is also a woman, west's appointment would give the agency its first female majority.
some argued that buttigieg was being unfairly painted as racially insensitive.
they're bringing us along with them. they're dragging some of us out of our safe democratic beliefs — and that's part of the growing process, wolff said. always having white people with the same opinion about everything gets us nowhere — clearly, it has gotten us nowhere in the past 25 years. we need to start looking like what we say we stand for and represent.
-- more than 130 house republicans voted against the treasury department's plan to lift sanctions against companies owned by a russian oligarch with close ties to putin. karoun demirjian and jeanne whalen report: the overwhelming 362 to 53 vote will not prevent the trump administration from easing sanctions on three companies connected to [oleg deripaska], as senate republicans narrowly blocked a similar measure on wednesday. but the house vote does mean that a majority of republicans on capitol hill oppose [trump's] efforts to soften punitive measures on a russian oligarch — a rejection with potential implications for the administration's continued stance on russia, and for the gop lawmakers who backed the plan to ease the sanctions. house minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.) and gop whip steve scalise (r-la.) both broke with trump to join democrats to support the resolution, along with the rest of their leadership team — a particularly awkward rebellion for the white house and [mitch mcconnell].
republicans are already painting the opposition as completely out of touch with most americans and too liberal to win back the white house from a president who in 2016 demonstrated appeal in culturally conservative states that usually voted with democrats.

she pledged to do something to get more involved — or at least find more like-minded people. she rebuilt the democratic club's website and updated its social media pages. more residents were visiting the facebook page, and more started attending meetings. before 2016, the group averaged a monthly attendance of eight. now, the attendance averages around 50.
mr. wofford was arrested for protesting police brutality during the 1968 democratic national convention in chicago and spent a night in jail. he later told the pittsburgh post-gazette that he became disillusioned with the radical youths leading the protests.
blair lee iv, then montgomery county's chief lobbyist, learned the consequence of opposing legislation mr. miller supported one day as he walked along a state house corridor. all of a sudden i saw this curly-haired guy coming around the corner. he sees me and puts both hands on my lapels and backed me against the wall, lee once told the post. he has got an irish temper and an irish humor, but you never know which one he'll be in at that minute.
iowa saw a dramatic shift away from democrats in 2016. thirty-two of the state's 99 counties voted twice for barack obama, then for donald trump; rural democratic legislators who had held office for years were swept out in the wave.

for mccarthy, 53, the hour-long confrontation with king was a critical moment early in his tenure as the new leader of republicans in the house, testing whether the easygoing californian was willing to take on a popular conservative and assert himself in the wake of sweeping gop defeats in the 2018 elections and the high-profile speakership of rep. paul d. ryan (r-wis.). it was also a reminder of how republican leaders have done little to police their ranks on the charged issue of race in recent years, from their embrace of trump despite him casting doubt on president barack obama's u.s. citizenship to their support of the divisive king — making his punishment an outlier rather than the standard.
buttigieg has a magnetism about him. ... i think his age is an advantage, says former dnc chairman howard dean.
the leaders of independent women's voice appeared frequently on fox news, speaking in support of trump and his judicial nominees. they spoke at rallies, according to videos, and they bought facebook ads that reached hundreds of thousands of users, according to a facebook political advertising database.
what about registration for the military draft, abortion, same-sex marriage and gender-neutral bathrooms, issues that have been on the agenda since the era battle began in the 1970s? again, any effect would likely be indirect, with the court applying the strict scrutiny standard. but an era may not be necessary to expand rights protections in those areas. the supreme court didn't need an era to invalidate state laws that prohibit same-sex marriage, for example. and the supreme court will soon announce its decisions on two cases — altitude express v. zarda and bostock v. clayton county — that hinge on the question of whether the on the basis of sex language in the civil rights act necessarily includes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

in hallways and during panels, networking continued to mix with intellectual ferment. i ran into josh blackman, the texas professor and blogger; he was scheduled to be on a panel where he would urge judges to tweet more and make decisions easier to search online. all the action does go on in the hallway, he told me. at dinner last night i met with friends old and new who had things they wanted to tell me, things they wanted me to think about, things i want to write about. as long as you have your eyes and ears open, you always are able to connect in new ways.
the obama team's carefully choreographed campaign kickoff had suddenly exploded: the vice president had announced, on live tv, that he favored same-sex marriage while the president, as everyone knew, lagged behind him. in their book, double down: game change 2012, mark halperin and john heilemann reported the shock of david plouffe, obama's 2008 campaign manager who was now a senior adviser to the president. when plouffe read the transcript of biden's meet the press interview, he cried: what the f---? how can this have happened?
during a friday night house party in sioux city, iowa, a likely caucus-goer asked sen. kirsten gillibrand, the new york democrat who announced her campaign days earlier, to explain how her rating from the national rifle association quickly fell from an a as a house member to an f as a senator.
perhaps you made it to inauguration day only to realize it wasn't the destination, just a connecting gate, and that the destination always ends up being a connecting gate.
maddow's interview with warren began with a preroll of the senator's interviews on nbc news as a consumer rights advocate, demonstrating that the senator had been building a record for years before she ever ran for office. the interview with gillibrand began with the story of how she flipped a historically republican house seat in upstate new york.
curator julie miller, an early american history specialist, picked a now-famous letter by thomas jefferson to maria cosway, written oct. 12, 1786, while jefferson was u.s. ambassador to france. jefferson was a widower; cosway was married. but that did not halt the future president.
as the transition team assembled her vice-presidential staff, harris was unapologetic about making sure people had a chance to serve, said minyon moore, who has managed harris's transition. moore said harris cast a wide net in her search for staff members and asked key questions in dozens of zoom interviews — including what she should be looking at as vice president.
a thick-shouldered pragmatist who had no use for ideologues, mr. miller led the campaign to legalize casino gambling in maryland and, despite his centrist views, facilitated the passage of progressive laws including legalization of same-sex marriage and the repeal of the death penalty.
for friends and followers, ­mccloskey's approach was overdue. and his message was one they wanted official washington to hear.
when she cut down the medication she was taking for parkinson's disease because it was interfering with her sleep, stern says he quizzed her about the fact that this would make her tremor more pronounced. how would that look? how would it play out? her reply, he says, was, so i'll be an old lady who shakes. but ironically, her lack of image management has in some ways made her a more inviting target for the leakers and the fulminators. as hard as she has tried to avoid the gender issue, it often simply proves impossible to avoid. she has encountered adversaries who attempt to discredit her through the crudest and easiest of means, by challenging her heterosexuality even as they offer absolutely no evidence – none – beyond her unmarried status. it's something that unmarried female politicians commonly run up against. in virginia, when then-attorney general mary sue terry was running for governor, her opponent, george allen, suggested his status as a family man was one reason why he was better qualified; in an earlier race an opponent had attempted to challenge terry with a crude reference to her five ringless fingers. similarly, an antagonist in dade county, jack thompson, once approached reno at a public forum, thrust a piece of paper in her direction, and demanded that she check a box saying whether she was heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual.
yet buttigieg continued to struggle to find answers to questions about race. when he said being gay helped him understand the importance of tolerance and acceptance, it provoked a backlash from those who argued he was equating two very different experiences.
ms. st. james was a unionist to the core. once, a newspaper reported that she had been a madam, and she agitated for a retraction, according to the washington post.

dear, dear boy pete i'm stopping here now for a week or two in the house i believe i have mentioned to you before, and where i wanted you to come and see me and still want you if you have a chance. but i spend most of my time down at an old farm down in new jersey where i have a fine secluded wood and creek and springs, where i pass my time alone, and yet not lonesome at all (often think of you pete and put my arm around you and hug you up close, and give you a good buss often.)
but, as her campaign strategists learned the hard way, harris is not easily summed up in a pithy slogan. her work in the criminal justice system, which had been beneficial during her rise in california, put her askance the social justice advocates gaining power in the national party. she has projected a political persona that is more practical than ideological in a party lurching to the left. the combination proved a tough sell in a field full of presidential candidates with firm ideological moorings, encyclopedic plans and résumés the length of dissertations.
but harris is not expected to spend four years hovering politely in the background. as the partner to a 78-year-old president, she is the heir apparent in the democratic party — a party whose heir was so unapparent a little over a year ago that two dozen people ran in its presidential primary.
the underpinning of the time-travel fantasy was the idea that america could sort itself out if only we checked out for a little while. as if the vast and entrenched problems of pandemic illness, unemployment, death, racism, toxic nostalgia and total information warfare amounted to little more than a stress fracture that would heal in time as long as we had patience. as if it's a bumpy flight, and your big challenge is to pop an ambien and see whether you can fall asleep soundly enough to wake up at your destination.
buttigieg's meet pete campaign never took flight. he blew through his mckinsey savings and still got clobbered, losing by 25 points. but in a way, he says, it was my first experience in winning by losing. the defeat stung, but i learned how to organize a team, he says. and he learned that smarts weren't the only secret to political success: it matters more to understand human beings and how to reach them, how to move them.
so when sugar pitched the same-sex ceremony, she had to convince the network that it was organic to the show's evolution. the wedding arc, a double episode titled reunited, aired in 2018, marking a shift in network policy that rippled across its other shows. after that, sorcher says, it just became the policy for cartoon network to treat gay relationships like heterosexual couplings.
he routinely attended galas and black-tie federalist society events that included justices thomas, alito and antonin scalia, as well as mcconnell and other leading lawmakers, according to interviews and annual reports by the federalist society.
i received your two letters dearest harry — the one from ann arbor and the other from battle creek, on my return from shalamazoo (where i wrote you last.) a fervent 'thank god,' escaped my lips as i read your deliverance from the railroad disaster. never until then had i known how dear or how necessary you are to me. but when i reflected how barren life would be to me if you had been killed, how much of its sunshine, and its power of use, would have gone more than ever before, i felt how much i need you.
we just never noticed it because we were too damn busy, mcadams said.
candidates have discovered that it's easier to be elected by not offending anyone rather than by impressing the voters, he wrote. politicians are rushing for the center, careful not to stick their necks out on issues. most democrats shy away from the word 'liberal' like a horrid accusation. but not the man from vermont. sanders' courage is evident in the first word he uses to describe himself: 'socialist.' 
abortion legalization failed in 2018. what changed?
for once, liberal members of the media are asking the same questions that republicans are raising. the republican national committee welcomed chameleon kirsten to the 2020 campaign by predicting that she'd be apologizing for the stances she'd held in her four years representing the upper hudson valley. indeed, she's been moving left ever since her 2009 appointment to the senate and has explained her transition as a process of steady, informed evolution.

in 2018, the party did not recover its strength in most rural areas and lost a race for governor that had been seen as winnable. but democrats flipped two of the state's four house seats, electing rep. cindy axne (d-iowa) and rep. abby finkenauer (d-iowa) in races in which liberal solutions for health care and other issues were at the forefront.

the letter is part of a new campaign called no gay no way aimed at leveraging amazon's high-profile search to press state and local officials for better protections. the group has already chartered a plane to fly a banner with its message over the technology giant's headquarters in seattle, and it has taken out advertisements in the nine states.
my deepest prayer for you today, as a priest, citizen and friend, is that you always remember that the lord is near and no matter the sound and fury around you, that god wants to give you peace, a deep-seated peace that will sustain you. let all of us hear the good news today: the lord is near, so no need to worry or to be afraid, o'brien said during the mass.
even so, lgbt rights remain a tough sell in this southern capital. a bill to repeal the state's already defunct ban on same-sex marriage failed in a tied committee vote last week, on the opening day of the general assembly. on monday, legislation to expand the state's hate-crime law to include gay and transgender people died in a senate committee.

-- democrats said that if the report is accurate, trump must quickly be held to account for his role in the perjury, with some raising the specter of impeachment, tim elfrink reports.
the firm's high-profile cases have attracted top legal talent, like joshua matz, who briefly left the firm last year to help the house judiciary committee draft articles of impeachment.
-- rep. tom marino (r-pa.), who has served in congress since 2010, announced he would resign next week to take a job in the private sector. mike debonis reports: the former prosecutor was one of the first house republicans to endorse donald trump for president and he was an informal adviser to the candidate. marino has won handily in his heavily republican district but faced a new reality as democrats seized majority control of the house in november. [trump] nominated marino to be the nation's drug czar in 2017, but marino withdrew from consideration following a washington post/'60 minutes' investigation detailing how the lawmaker helped steer legislation through congress that weakened the drug enforcement administration's ability to go after drug distributors, even as opioid-related deaths continue to rise.
land of saturday night live. except that she's here for something else. throughout her career, the attorney general who downplays gender has chosen to focus on one of the most basic women's issues: children. being a woman may or may not have made it easier for her to flog the issue of juvenile justice, the problem of kids and crime. whatever the case, she willingly does flog it. part of the job of being a cabinet member is traveling around the country in carefully orchestrated set pieces, giving speeches, talking to grass-roots groups, and she does this with energy and diligence. this day, she happens to be in new york, at an image factory, one of the world's most powerful: the advertising agency of saatchi & saatchi, whose first-floor lobby is, just now, thick with hair spray, perfume, dry-cleaning fluid, mousse, shoe polish, lip gloss, the collective effluvia of people who do not share janet reno's pared-down approach to personal presentation. outside a velvet rope surrounding rows of chairs facing a makeshift stage, there are scores of employees of saatchi & saatchi, which has worked with the justice department's juvenile justice office to create a series of public service announcements designed to change the way people think about teens, to change the way teens think about themselves, to lure them into community organizing and away from crime.
so that night at the caucus training, mcadams tried to give the volunteers every tool they would need to make their events run smoothly. she went over complex equations to properly calculate delegate counts. she suggested displaying tallies in publicly visible spaces so everyone could clearly see the results. to prevent perceptions of bias, she asked the volunteers not to wear clothing or buttons endorsing a political candidate.
on a snowy saturday, about a week before the caucuses, the new activists were targeting another one of the last remaining republicans, a square-jawed state senator named brad zaun. zaun was attending a legislative forum held in a no-frills community room at a local park, on a panel that included the urbandale mayor and state rep. karin derry, a political newcomer who had won her seat during the democratic wave of 2018.

jcn board director gary marx told the post the two organizations share similar goals but have different boards, different missions, different functions and do very different things.
unlike davis, myrick did not object to marrying any specific couple, and she did not ask other employees in the office to refuse to do so.

in 2017, america engaged passed on almost $1 million to the lobbying arm of the national rifle association. that same year, the nra announced a $1 million ad campaign in support of gorsuch. the ads targeted lawmakers in montana, indiana, missouri and north dakota who had supported obama's calls for gun control. your freedom is on the line, the ads stated.
but now that she was fully onboarded, she had a request for her co-hosts: the women of the view should make paid maternity leave their 2021 mission. they should put [politicians'] feet to the fire — especially members of mccain's own republican party who pay lip service to family values — to make paid maternity leave a legislated guarantee.
gabbard said she grew up in a socially conservative household where i was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.
in 1986, as schaefer became governor, the state's 47 senators elected mr. miller steinberg's successor. at 44, mr. miller assumed the senate's throne, fueling chatter that he was on a glide path to becoming governor. three years later, mr. miller hosted a swanky fundraiser in baltimore, an event that many regarded as his statewide coming-out party.
leo told the post that from the accounts of the calls, it appears i was conveying the widely shared belief among conservatives that discriminating on the basis of race is always wrong and inconsistent with the dignity and worth of every person.
but abortion decriminalization passed in argentina for reasons that go far beyond the president. while his coalition of supporters was more likely to support legalization than members of the opposition, the vote did not break neatly along party lines. moreover, before 2015, peronist governments held power for 12 years without introducing legislation regarding abortion rights.
over and over on tuesday, lawmakers marveled that they were approving ideas that had gone nowhere in two decades of republican dominance.
o'gorman said that while the church had apologized, we've yet to see the church fully acknowledge the degree to which it created and enforced the culture, rather than saying it was merely part of a culture.

i expect the majority leader to fulfill his commitment to the senate, to me and to the bipartisan group, and abide by this agreement. if he does not . . . he will have breached the trust of not only the democratic senators, but members of his own party as well, schumer said.
-- a democratic group aligned with chuck schumer, majority forward, is launching $600,000 in shutdown-based attack ads today against six republican senators facing competitive 2020 elections. sean sullivan reports: the ads target sens. martha mcsally (ariz.), cory gardner (colo.), david perdue (ga.), joni ernst (iowa), susan collins (maine) and thom tillis (n.c.). ... as ominous music plays, a narrator points out that this is 'the longest government shutdown in history,' and warns of the impact on food safety inspections and air travel security. the ads are tailored to raise state-specific concerns about the effects of the shutdown. the north carolina ad underscores the strain on hurricane recovery efforts.
buttigieg's persona has inspired a thousand jibes and memes during his unlikely run, most of them unflattering: he's an emotionless technocrat for instance, or just plain mayo pete. and while he has turned himself from a small-city mayor into a serious contender for president, buttigieg's super-composed exterior can be a disadvantage in a party primary race, where passion and relatability are appealing.
to democrats, that's the whole point.
as the night went on, desperate ploys for attention moved on to air horns, and literally banging a pot in someone's face, and numerous inappropriate uses of the word cougar used to describe women who are younger than 32. demi pretended to make up with a crying tracy in what appeared to be a utility closet, telling her, you are one of the most amazing women i've ever met . . . you're an amazing storyteller and he's going to love your story. they both got a rose, setting them up for an inevitable two-on-one elimination date in a future episode.
it's not enough for trump to be tall and bulky; when men get under his skin, he has to belittle them, literally, with labels like liddle' bob corker, liddle' adam schiff and now mini mike bloomberg, who wants a box for the debates. it's not enough to control america's nuclear codes; he must boast to kim jong un that his nuclear button is a much bigger & more powerful one. and when it comes to women, standard-issue misogyny is never enough. stormy daniels becomes a horseface for threatening his manhood, while the hot ones, he boasts, always welcome even his crudest sexual advances.
he finished third in nevada, garnering just 2 percent support among black voters. not long after voting ended in south carolina, buttigieg's aides checked their polling models and realized he probably would fare poorly.
trump responded the next day in a tweet: lightweight senator kirsten gillibrand. . . someone who would come to my office 'begging' for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against trump.
federal appeals court appointments president trump has appointed more judges to the federal appeals courts than all other presidents at equivalent points in their presidencies.
buttigieg knew that if he could make good on his audacious promises, he could also make a name for himself — which he quickly proceeded to do, beating the 1,000-day target and spiffing up the old plant over the harrumphs of the city council veterans and longtime government officials who couldn't help resenting the technocratic kid from the fancy schools and the global consultancy.
and many states have done so. ballot initiatives banning same-sex marriages also recently passed in alaska and hawaii. some day, both sides agree, the issue is headed for a big court test case. early polling shows that about six in 10 californians support knight's ballot initiative. but this will be a hard-fought and potentially divisive campaign--with each side promising to spend dollar for dollar, possibly as much as $10 million. opposing the initiative is a san francisco-based group calling itself no on knight. they argue that the initiative is unnecessary, unfair, divisive and intrusive. mike marshall, the campaign manager for no on knight, says that he believes the initiative is the beginning of an assault on gay rights in california and around the nation. in the last legislative session in sacramento, where democrats control the state government, gays and lesbians won a windfall of protective measures, from extension of domestic partner benefits to including sexual orientation in anti-harassment laws. clearly, the radical right is using this issue to mobilize their conservative base, marshall said. supporters of the marriage measure have contributed almost $4 million so far--and much of the money has come from religious groups. catholic bishops support the measure and so does the church of jesus christ of latter day saints. this is a new type of coalition, said rob stutzman, spokesman for the protection of marriage initiative. the catholic bishops are literally writing us checks, and so are the mormons.

the mayors of some of the targeted cities have spoken out, saying their communities are diverse, inclusive places that should not be punished for state-level actions. and some lgbt activists have argued that putting 50,000 amazon workers in a politically red state might bring change there. corporate heavyweights in north carolina, indiana and georgia have had some success beating back legislation that lgbt advocates view as discriminatory.
in short, even in washington – in a city where married people are normal, where divorced people are normal, where people having affairs are normal – a single woman with a magnificent career and a host of abiding friendships and a set of rugged hobbies is suspected of being odd, of not having a life. her lifestyle is not ordinary; it's not what most people do. this, in part, is the cultural assumption that the saturday night live video taps into. hence janet reno in her bedroom, wearing a nightie, alone with her fantasies. this is the main thing that carl stern notices about the video; this is what irritates him. what's grating, he says, is that the attorney general has not only a very normal sort of life but a nice life. both in florida and in washington she has a great many friends whose homes she visits, and she goes to plays, her dance card is full. to portray her as a wallflower that nobody asks to dance is not only demeaning but inaccurate. she's a woman with a very active, full life – as i said, her dance card is full. for that reason, he says, i find it a little painful. i am interested,says john white, in the comment on the blue dress. white, professor of politics at catholic university, is sitting in a room in the school's law library watching the same snl tape. outside, hundreds of would-be attorneys general, or simply would-be attorneys, are studying for pre-christmas finals.
the mistake democrats risk making in 2020, he says, is looking in the rearview mirror for solutions. i get the urge people will have after trump. 'look at the chaos and the exhaustion: wouldn't it be better to go back to something more stable with somebody we know?' but there's no going back to a pre-trump universe. we can't be saying the system will be fine again just like it was. because that's not true; it wasn't fine. not if we could careen into this kind of politics.
as the oldest of 10 children, mr. miller navigated family squabbles — often instigated by his volatile father — and developed skills that helped him later maneuver in annapolis. from boyhood through early adulthood, mr. miller worked at his family's store and learned lessons that would stay with him as a politician.
-- puerto rico gov. ricardo rosselló lambasted the trump administration amid escalating tensions over, among other things, the president's desire to use the island's disaster-relief funds for his border wall. jeff stein reports: rosselló ripped the trump administration thursday for rejecting food stamp funding for the island and reportedly plotting to cut its emergency aid … the feud comes amid the resignation of a top housing and urban development official, widely regarded as one of the most capable administrators in the agency, after the white house's attempt to block disaster recovery money for puerto rico. … in a facebook video addressed to trump, rosselló attacked 'unconscionable' remarks and 'completely false and inaccurate information' tied to the trump administration.

in 1991, he defeated a giant of pennsylvania politics — former republican governor and u.s. attorney general richard thornburgh — in a special election to become the state's first democratic senator in more than 20 years. in philadelphia in 2008, he introduced then-sen. barack obama (d-ill.) before the stirring a more perfect union speech on race relations during the presidential race that would propel obama to the white house.
standing in front of a big fireplace and a huge tv showing the redskins game on mute, buttigieg is in his element, opening with some banter about where he's from — you might know us for our football team — before segueing into the message he's honing for 2020. it's very important for people in communities like mine to know there's a formula for moving forward that isn't resentment, that isn't nostalgia, he says, recounting his first campaign for mayor. we didn't go around saying we're going to make south bend great again. the folks laugh heartily at the implicit dig at trump. i didn't go around thumping my chest saying i alone can fix it. we came together and identified problem-solvers to get things done and actually change the trajectory of our future.

democrats pulled back in some areas, suggesting a limit to the state's new blue status. a controversial ban on assault weapons never got a vote in the senate, though the house of delegates kept a version alive. neither chamber approved a repeal of the state's right-to-work law. campaign finance reform has seen little action.

unsurprisingly, the people working for other candidates think that biden's framing for a potential campaign has put him in a weaker position. the upton comment was one example of a biden refrain: that he can get both parties to come to the table and cut deals on issues of obvious national importance.
leonard leo told me he disputes the notion that the constitution contains either conservative or progressive values, and he denies that originalism is rigged to reach conservative and libertarian results. the constitution is a structural road map for how to ensure accountability and transparency in government, he said. and there are timeless values in it that are tied to the weaknesses of human nature and the danger of unlimited authority being vested in one person or a group of people. … you're practicing originalism appropriately when you're doing so without looking behind the curtain and trying to predetermine results.
the vote to end debate on the spending bill came together quickly after collins and several other senators said they wanted a firmer, more detailed commitment from mcconnell.
she's a man, she's a woman, she's a man-woman, she's straight, she's gay – but amazingly often, she's depicted sexually. or at least with extreme attention to her personal appearance. on the world wide web, a search of reno's name yields close to 34,000 entries, including not only news accounts and justice department press releases but also one web site in which her haircut is superimposed over the visages of demi moore, courtney love, jenny mccarthy and – yes – a man, andy richter. another web site, titled the many mellow moods of janet reno, is frankly and rudely sexual, referring to a sensuous beast that lurks within the attorney general's wacky two-piece cotton blend suits, and offering a number of stock newspaper photos accompanied by lurid captions. in contrast, a search of secretary of defense william s. cohen – the only cabinet member whose name appears on the web more often than hers – yields entries like secretary of defense earth day message and slide image: defense reform initiative. hence the paradox of janet reno. the woman famous for saying, i don't do spin, has been spun over and over again. reno herself takes a benign view of all this. i think people just like to have fun, is what she says of the jokes, the tabloid photos, the internet sites. there are those close to her who agree.

as gillibrand traveled across iowa last weekend, she was greeted by longtime democratic voters, some of whom said they've undergone similar evolutions in their political beliefs — and that it's healthy to do so. even in the most conservative areas of the state, local party leaders shrugged off concerns that liberal platforms would scare off voters.
would mccain now support leave if she'd had an easy, complication-free labor? she seemed to be arguing for congress to specifically support the amount of time she herself had taken: three months. what if she'd recovered after only 10 weeks? would that then be her policy recommendation? or conversely, what if her postpartum experience had been even more trying or if she'd lacked the support system of the husband and mother-in-law she said she relied on? would she be asking the women of the view to stump for four months of paid leave? five?
playboy's first issue without nude photos came out in february 2016, ending a more than six-decade run of glossy centerfolds featuring young women baring it all. the magazine still featured sexy, seductive pictorials of the world's most beautiful women, including its iconic playmates, as playboy put it at the time. generally speaking, the goal was to attract a younger demographic of readers and more mainstream advertisers.
earlier sunday, his campaign held a call with reporters in which senior adviser michael halle and deputy campaign manager hari sevugan made the case that while buttigieg probably wouldn't win any of the 14 states that vote tuesday, he could still accumulate enough delegates to keep sanders's lead to a minimum.
this advice resonates with what i had been picking up over a couple of weeks of conversations with people in and around the organization: much of the federalist society's influence comes not from its very public washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level. and so, a glimpse of the impact yet to come could be had at far tables fanning out to the corners of union station where the sound is bad — the law students and professors from houston, boston and los angeles; the young lawyers at the dawn of long careers scarfing fancy food at tables underwritten by their firms. let the politicians build the coalitions to confirm conservative judges and roll back the administrative state, olowski says. that's not the federalist society's job. the federalist society's job is to put these ideas out there. and of course, as james madison could tell us, ideas tend to outlive presidents, political majorities and even judges.
and when democrats learned the name, they were unhappy: it was patricia west, a former circuit court judge from virginia beach who was chief deputy to former republican state attorney general ken cuccinelli ii. west joined cuccinelli in a number of controversial actions, including challenges to federal environmental protections and the affordable care act and defending virginia's ban on same-sex marriage.
in 1991, he was pennsylvania's secretary of labor and industry when gov. robert p. casey sr. (d), an early political mentor, appointed him to fill the vacancy created by the death of sen. john heinz (r) in a plane crash. promising balm for the frustrations of the middle class — including a proposal for national health-care reform — mr. wofford then defeated thornburgh with 55 percent of the vote.
hours earlier, biden attended mass at the cathedral of st. matthew the apostle, a soaring cathedral in downtown washington and one of several where biden attended mass as vice president. it is also where the funeral for the first catholic u.s. president, john f. kennedy, was held. there, biden heard a homily by the rev. kevin o'brien, a friend and former official at georgetown university who heads santa clara university.
consider supreme court decisions in domestic violence cases, especially the 2005 decision in castle rock v. gonzales. in that case, jessica gonzales's husband violated a restraining order she had against him and brutally murdered their three daughters. the court maintained that the police in castle rock, colo., could exercise discretion in deciding whether to enforce a protective order — and that gonzales had no constitutional right to that protection. an era would likely have little effect here.

-- maryland gov. larry hogan (r) unveiled a budget proposal that includes tax relief and raises for state employees. ovetta wiggins and arelis r. hernández report: the $46.6 billion budget proposal — a 4 percent increase over last year's fiscal plan — raises the pay of state employees by at least 3 percent, extends a tax relief to the retired military, police officers and fire and rescue workers, provides $57 million for businesses that locate in 'opportunity zones,' and sets aside $1.3 billion in reserves to guard against a potential economic downturn.
i was treated like a second-class citizen by my family. society had an obsession with hiding everything, one witness said.
the idea that biden would crack the trump coalition with his appeal to white working-class voters was simply not flying with rival campaigns; they'd heard it about hillary clinton, who was seen as able to win back democrats who'd left out of frustration with president barack obama. when they're exposed to the heat of a campaign, brands can hold strong, or they can melt.

at the time, his campaign staff was just trying to push buttigieg within striking distance of the donor count needed to qualify for the debate stage. within 24 hours, he had reached a third of the 65,000 donor threshold. two days later, his campaign announced it had reached 55,000 individual donors.
harris began her career as a relatively liberal prosecutor in the bay area, one who launched a gutsy first bid for elective office against her former boss, a rough-and-tumble incumbent named terence hallinan, for the job of san francisco district attorney. she won, taking a high-profile stand against capital punishment in the process.
what about these repeated attempts to make sense of a powerful woman by making her into a man or an ambiguous sort of woman/man? what about saturday night live? i thought it was just kind of a spoof of this 6-foot-1 big old girl, she says mildly, then adds, in what is, for her, an outburst: i can't figure out why anybody's that interested in me. in her? yeah. in her? yeah, she says again. 'cause i'm basically just myself. she's the attorney general! i know! she says. but i'm not any different from – i mean, if you asked my friends in miami, i don't think they'd say i've changed. which is not to say that she doesn't have some interest in how she's portrayed. she does in fact collect the cartoons about her, even, she reveals, the biting ones. the biting ones? yes, she says. the biting cartoons. the biting cartoons? the real zingers, she explains, laughing now, seeing what the misunderstanding was. given the context, it seemed plausible that there would be cartoons of janet reno . . . well . . . biting somebody. no, she says. there are none of those that she knows of. nor, she says precisely, keeping the record straight, of me being bitten. days later. early morning. time for the attorney general, the first female attorney general, the first 6-foot-1, blue-suited, shoulder-padded, catalogue-shopping, alligator-wrestling, christmas-tree-hauling female attorney general, the attorney general who does not spin and does not bite, to go to new york city.
such expression kept young fans engaged, as they looked up to sugar. to have people respond to these little details in the show and relate to it and find me and say: 'i've never seen that before,'  she says, it was so moving to realize that there are so many of us out there.

in another case, a nonprofit leo launched in 2016, the freedom and opportunity fund, gave $4 million over two years to a nonprofit called independent women's voice, about half the group's revenue, tax filings show. leaders of independent women's voice last year spoke at rallies, wrote online commentary and appeared regularly on fox news to promote another of trump's supreme court nominees, brett m. kavanaugh.
president-elect joe biden has said his priority upon taking office as the 46th president will be to heal and unify the nation. he has said little about how he plans to go about the task, beyond committing to creating a national police oversight commission within the first 100 days of his administration. still, many say that the credibility biden earned among civil rights leaders as vice president to barack obama, combined with his long-standing ties with law enforcement, including his work on the 1994 crime bill, make him well-positioned to bridge divides among law enforcement officials and civilians pushing for change.
in recent years, though, its power has been diminished by the general assembly, culminating last year when legislators passed an overhaul of utility regulation that set strict limits on the scc's oversight of dominion energy and appalachian power.
buttigieg made history by becoming the first openly gay candidate to earn delegates for the presidential nomination in a major political party. he also broke barriers by making his marriage to his husband, chasten, a major part of his campaign.
joe manchin iii (w.va.) and kyrsten sinema (ariz.) — publicly reiterated their previously stated opposition to eliminating the filibuster, our mike debonis mcconnell on monday said he was prepared to move forward on a [senate power-sharing] deal 'modeled on that [2001] precedent' after two democratic senators —(w.va.) and(ariz.) — publicly reiterated their previously stated opposition to eliminating the filibuster, our mike debonis reports.
when it comes to the question of whether to have a baby, affordable, high-quality child care is just the tip of the iceberg. after i proposed to the love of my life back in october, we stayed at duke's to celebrate our engagement. then little by little our friends and family, chosen and biological, joined us to congratulate us and wish us well. we drank champagne and ate barbecue sandwiches and grinned from ear to ear as we reminisced with our friends about how we'd met, started dating and fell in love.
no presentation of masculinity — not buttigieg's, and not trump's — is a salubrious thing. it's all toxic. but there's a key difference. trump's idea of manliness involves degrading women, threatening violence against racial and religious and sexual minorities, and using false and superficial displays of strength (who's the loudest? who's the meanest? who's sleeping with the hottest women? who's making other people look small?) to overcome self-doubt and feel big. by contrast, men who take the stoic approach, stifling their emotions and anything that smacks of stereotypical femininity, mostly harm themselves; acting like gary cooper can eat you up from the inside. but on a general-election stage, against trump's primordial displays of dominance, the style that buttigieg fashioned in the closet might serve him well, especially combined with the relative freedom he's found in the few years since. that's partly because his only real insecurity in life, it appears, has been about his queerness; intellectually, politically and morally, buttigieg betrays almost too much self-confidence. he speaks in such perfect paragraphs that his critics think he is scripted, even when he improvises. it can sometimes come off as lofty or smarter-than-thou — but the message discipline is impressive. and buttigieg has shown a sneaky flair for effective zingers.
fast facts: long island city was a real long island city with its own mayor and police force until 1898, when the five boroughs consolidated and lic became a member of the queens court. in the early years, the area was farmland, and manhattan was accessible only by ferry. in the mid-20th century, the city experienced an industrial boom with 1,400 factories, including many — oil refineries, glass works, ship building, iron foundries — that left a dark smudge on the riverside landscape. several kinder commodities, such as bread, spaghetti, shoes and film studios, also flourished, and a few survived the mass closings in 1970s and early '80s. over the years, lic has staged a comeback, as more businesses and residents flee the rising costs of brooklyn and manhattan. amazon will reside in anable basin, a 19th-century man-made inlet on the east river that once supported old (cough, cough) industry.
o ffering his most extensive comments since taking office, biden told cnn , i think it has to happen.
the new u.k. government no longer depends on the dup, as the conservative party won an outright majority. it declared that it would call new elections in northern ireland if the parties did not find common ground by jan. 13. in the december u.k. elections, both sinn fein and the dup lost votes to more centrist parties, so they had no appetite to face the voters again without making progress on issues that matter to them.
gertner and his husband, jeffrey marshek, knew early in their relationship that they wanted children and that they wanted a biological connection to their child. there wasn't a lot of information about surrogacy when we were researching, said gertner, who married marshek in 2010. the couple knew they would need to save significant money upfront. they worked with a surrogacy agency that was recommended to them.
what information we have been able to find on social media and in her writings gives us great pause, said del. alfonso h. lopez (d-arlington), who complained that the last-minute nomination gave lawmakers no time to fully vet her. west has an active twitter account and regularly retweets posts from franklin graham, ann coulter and other conservative icons.

on thursday, mccarthy and other house gop leaders asked democrats to condemn a 2012 tweet in which rep. ilhan omar (d-minn.), a new member of the house foreign affairs committee, said that israel had hypnotized the world and to distance themselves from omar's support for the boycott, divestment, and sactions movement. (omar has pointed out that her tweet was opposing airstrikes israel was carrying out across the gaza strip.)
heard says of kaplan, i'm instantly drawn to the type of individual who can look upon the goliath and say, 'i think i can take you.' that kind of energy and temerity is rare in the world, especially in the legal world.
while the federalist society may never take an official position on anything, conservative funders know who their friends are. ever since the founding symposium at yale in 1982 was bankrolled largely by conservative organizations, the society has enjoyed steady financial support from the right. the group raised $20 million in 2017; more than $300,000 came from interests related to conservative activist funders charles and david koch.
[pete buttigieg, citing need for generational change, joins 2020 democratic presidential race]
former vice president joe biden celebrated his first nominating contest win in the 2020 presidential election during south carolina's primary on feb. 29. (the washington post)
harris, 56, has yet to offer any grand vision of what kind of vice president she hopes to be, although few vice presidents have by inauguration day. in her dozen or so appearances since the ticket declared victory, harris has praised biden, lauded his nominees, assured the american people that change is coming and outlined the urgent crises facing the country. her social media feed, never exactly uninhibited, is now an even more carefully curated thread of lines from speeches and supportive platitudes. she has been a dutiful partner, making little news and no public waves.
as much as anything, he yearned for a return to the political center.
suing the powerful has brought repeated threats. kaplan has an apartment in manhattan but requested that her country home's location, where she has spent the pandemic working, go unnamed.

after the house floor session began at noon wednesday, speaker kirk cox (r-colonial heights) called a recess so the commerce and labor committee could hold an unusual, 30-minute meeting to interview the scc candidate who had emerged with full approval of the senate republican caucus.
the presidential election was a natural time stamp, and so the inauguration seemed like a natural destination. just teleport me to jan. 20, i heard more than one person joke. cryogenically freeze me until it's over. in washington, the scaffolding for the inauguration platform gradually took shape, and honestly, it looked as if it could be something from nasa: a launchpad for a rocket to anywhen.
but in the first months of his candidacy — and, as it happened, the last months, as well — smith made sure buttigieg was booked on every television show possible. he sneaked calls to broadcast stations on almost every drive, took reporters with him from one event to another, and talked to local cameras whenever they would have him.
we were soon on a plane with our two cats, on our way to my dad's house in utah, for as long as the shutdown lasted. it looked like that might be may or june, so we packed a pair of shorts and a couple of tank tops in case we were still there when the weather warmed up, just in case.
the report makes for hard reading: many of the women did suffer emotional abuse and were often subject to denigration and derogatory remarks. it appears that there was little kindness shown to them and this was particularly the case when they were giving birth.
-- trump attorney rudy giuliani dismissed the report: if you believe cohen, i can get you a great deal on the brooklyn bridge.
kaplan says the greatest abuse she's received on social media has come not from neo-nazis, white supremacists or trump's true believers, but from depp's vehement online champions.
it's a smart campaign, funny, snappy, designed to show that while teenagers may sometimes seem threatening or grungy, that often has nothing to do with who they really are. posters on the wall show photographs of teenagers who look like drifters and drug dealers but are in fact law enforcement activists. in the lobby is a 150-pound bell, made of confiscated handguns, that will be rung to launch the ad campaign. she'll be here on this side of the bell, the pr director is telling photographers, surrounded by a bunch of kids. he is talking about reno, the main draw of the event. also here is peter yarrow of peter, paul and mary, who will be singing an anti-crime version of his song where have all the flowers gone? titled where have all the children gone? also here are a number of actual kids, members of youth force, an organization run by and for young people whose purpose is giving juveniles a voice in the justice system.

mccloskey's abrupt departure left some scratching their heads, but they assumed he had good reasons for giving up on the washington grind of green rooms and galas. last week, the real explanation for mccloskey's hasty exit from washington was revealed.
these differences are particularly pronounced among gen zers who self-identify as republican. while older republicans overwhelmingly support trump, his job approval drops off significantly with the younger generations. eighty-five percent of baby-boomer republicans believe trump is doing a good job. fifty-nine percent of gen zers share that view.

some republicans have come to see the issue as a matter of personal liberty — and perhaps political survival in an election year when the gop is struggling to appeal to voters in once-friendly suburbs.
research finds that countries are more likely to lift or loosen restrictions on abortion when a programmatic left party is in power. that would include argentina's peronist party, the center-left anchor of its governing frente de todos (everybody's front) coalition. many journalistic accounts documented the government's attempts to influence undecided senators, against countervailing efforts by macri and leaders of the catholic church.
personal experiences can be powerful and life-altering. but the trouble with policies guided by the personal struggles of famous tv personalities is that they are not based on what average citizens need or what experts determine is optimal. they are based on the solipsism of influential people who are scandalized only by injustices that they experience personally.
you have to be optimistic that we are trusting each other and trusting the process we are putting in place and that over the next 17 days, we will get to a bill that can get a commanding vote in the senate, not just barely pass, sen. christopher a. coons (d-del.) said.
non-parents like us are paying attention to what it's like to be a parent right now, and we don't like what we see. families who were already on their contingency child-care plans before the pandemic, stringing together affordable care with some combination of professionals, friends and family, are now on plans b, c and d, or they're stepping back from work as a result.
the organization has in recent years taken steps into the political realm, funding anti-same-sex marriage initiatives in a number of states.
san diego bishop robert w. mcelroy said he was echoing pope francis' message to president biden and calling for dialogue, not judgment; collaboration, not isolation; truth in charity, not harshness. … it is a pathway of reconciliation that places the healing of our society ahead of any specific policy issue, in the recognition that repairing the soul of our country is the pre-requisite for any sustainable effort to advance the common good. … most importantly of all, pope francis' message to president biden fundamentally speaks to him in his humanity, a man of catholic faith striving to serve his nation and his god.

robinson considers herself a social moderate. in 2013, she voted for the state's first openly gay judge. but she has also supported legislation that could allow a private business owner with deeply held religious convictions — akin to the wedding-cake baker who won a narrow victory at the u.s. supreme court last year — to turn away gay customers.
leo's freedom and opportunity fund, meanwhile, distributed $4 million to independent women's voice over two years.
but whether that ethos extends to the decision about amazon's second headquarters is unknown. in its search requirements, amazon lists the presence and support of a diverse population. company officials have declined to expand on the meaning of that, but anthony little, president of glamazon, issued a statement saying that diversity and equality are ingrained in the leadership principles of the company.
buttigieg was serious about trying — that much was clear. from the start, he pitched himself as a unique messenger for a new message: the rise of president trump had exposed the old ways of operating as flawed and unsustainable. a young mayor from the midwest might just be the person to handle what lies ahead — and in a field that included senators, former mayors and a former vice president, buttigieg wanted a chance.
it's really time for me to get out of politics, he said in the interview. our democracy is the oldest in the history of the world, but it's on very shaky legs. i see the democrats going further to the left, and the republicans going further to the right, until something absolutely horrible happens and people realize they've made a terrible mistake.
a woman who had gone to him in 2002 for spiritual guidance told the washington post that the popular prelate had victimized her. on several occasions during and after private spiritual counseling sessions in his office to discuss her troubled marriage, he put his hands on her hips and pressed himself against her, kissed her hair and caressed her, the woman said. she said she had smelled alcohol on his breath.

how a growing women's movement put reproductive rights in the spotlight
if our research on argentina is any indication, abortion rights advocates in other latin american countries may have more success if they focus on the public health consequences of prohibition and its disproportionate impact on women living in poverty. ultimately, abortion legalization in argentina won because of the persuasive power of street activism. we expect that leftist and rightist social movements will be similarly critical in determining the future of abortion laws elsewhere in latin america.

mccloskey did not take a typical path to the priesthood. after graduating from st. john's college high school in northwest washington, he went to columbia university, where he majored in economics. with his ivy league degree in hand, he headed not to the seminary, but to wall street, where he worked for citibank and merrill lynch. a few years later, he moved to rome to begin his training to become a priest.
gillibrand, now 52, has often described her changes of view as epiphanies. on the subject of guns, she tells about meeting in 2009 with the parents of a brooklyn teenager who was killed by a stray bullet. she dropped her nra-backed positions as a result, she says.
in a post on the playboy website, hefner outlined a new playboy philosophy, in which he suggested that the decision to embrace nudity again was partly rooted in the country's political and cultural climate. he ticked off a list of collective accomplishments from the past few years: the election of the first mixed-race president (his term), a supreme court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization in some places, the nomination of a woman by a major political party.
biden would raise taxes on several fronts to finance his domestic agenda but says only people earning $400,000 or more would pay a higher amount. his best chance to implement his tax-hike plan would likely be if democrats win big in the 2022 congressional midterm elections, increasing their majorities in the house and senate.
in 2005 and 2006, leo served as the leader of the campaigns supporting supreme court nominees john g. roberts jr. and samuel a. alito jr. he and other members of an advocacy coalition spent about $15 million in donations from undisclosed donors on ads, telemarketing and the mobilization of grass roots groups, leo later told a federalist society chapter at the university of virginia. they conducted polls to help craft the most persuasive messages and arranged dozens of background briefings for reporters.

-- kevin mccarthy's decision to strip rep. steve king (r-iowa) of his committee assignments could signal how the california republican intends to assert himself as house minority leader. robert costa and mike debonis have the behind-the-scenes details on the showdown between mccarthy and king: when [king] was ushered into [mccarthy's] office monday night, after sparking outrage for questioning whether the term 'white supremacist' is offensive, he expected to be scolded. he did not expect his career in congressional politics to effectively end. but as the iowa republican sat on a couch beneath an eight-foot-tall portrait of abraham lincoln, it quickly became clear that ­mccarthy — whom king has long privately knocked as soft — was taking a hard line. king, an ally of [trump's] and a regular guest on conservative media programs, offered to 'go quiet,' according to three people familiar with the exchange who were not authorized to speak publicly. mccarthy dismissed the suggestion — and the nine-term republican was soon stripped of all his committee assignments.
this whole thing has come as quite a shock to me, said russell shaw, who co-wrote a book with mccloskey, good news, bad news: evangelization, conversion and the crisis of faith. i thought it was abrupt when he left and now i wonder why i didn't dream of anything like this.

in a recent article, i analyzed legislative measures that would prohibit transgender people from accessing sex-segregated areas such as public restrooms and school locker rooms. using a variety of data sources, including the human rights campaign's state equality index archives and the national center for transgender equality's state action center archives, i identified 71 bills introduced in state legislatures between jan. 1, 2014, and feb. 7, 2018, that included the word transgender.
as the senate's leader, mr. miller was unafraid to lacerate rivals, accusing gov. william donald schaefer (d) of hiring eunuchs and sycophants and comparing parris n. glendening (d), then prince george's county executive, to a baboon. in the heat of one election season, he promised democrats would bury republicans six feet deep, faces up.
but the resolution of the three-day stalemate exposed a growing rift between two groups of democratic senators: those facing tough reelection campaigns in states trump won, and those courting liberal voters ahead of possible 2020 presidential bids.
mr. miller could offer foes a second chance, but only if it served a larger political purpose. if he needed you, he brought you back, said former state senator gloria g. lawlah (d-prince george's), who mended fences with mr. miller after a falling-out. he was the master of power and control.
roberts asked about biden's remarks the previous sunday: did he jump the gun a little here?
obama chafed at his own lack of authenticity on gay marriage. his wife, michelle, and his longtime friend and adviser valerie jarrett told him to disregard the politics and simply declare publicly what he felt. david axelrod, the chief strategist for both obama presidential campaigns, and dan pfeiffer, a senior presidential adviser, counseled the president that voters responded better to a candidate who delivered his own unvarnished truth.
lifelong republicans such as mark toebben, a 62-year-old retired business executive, voted for her for reasons that went beyond trump. he had grown increasingly frustrated that lawmakers wouldn't boost the education budget past the rate of inflation. it felt as if his party was attacking the very thing that made his community great: the school system.
justice is served: the justice department's inspector general announced its office is opening an investigation into whether any current or former department official tried to improperly alter the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, matt zapotosky and robert barnes report.
on one hand, i say something to the poor girl, and i break my brother's trust.
-- hogan's anti-trump speeches and planned trip to iowa in march are fueling 2020 speculation. politico's alex isenstadt reports: hogan used his inaugural address on wednesday to repudiate the 'debilitating politics' of washington — and to raise the specter of impeachment. … the white house is paying close attention. the president's political aides have been monitoring the maryland governor for months, and several said they regarded the inauguration speech as an unmistakable act of aggression. they noted that trump 2016 primary rival jeb bush was a featured speaker at the ceremony, and that mark salter, a longtime republican speechwriter and a fierce trump critic, helped craft hogan's address.
here are several major policy areas that have seen action during the session, including some that faced crucial votes on tuesday.
• eliminate the earnings cap on obamacare tax credits that subsidize the purchase of health insurance. the cap currently limits the benefit to those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level.
when he first gave a full accounting of his time in the closet — in a speech at a human rights campaign event in las vegas last year — it was all about pain, until he became whole later in life. in his teens, he said of his sexuality, i would have cut it out with a knife. that chimed deeply with anyone who's been there: the welter of emotions stuffed down, through dint of constant effort and practice, because the cost of revealing them might be exposure. coming out of the closet and finding — if you're as lucky as buttigieg — the love of your life is massively freeing and courage-giving. but old habits of presenting yourself don't drop away overnight.
the courtly, professorial nonagenarian said he did not consider himself gay. too often, our society seeks to label people by pinning them on the wall — straight, gay or in between, he wrote. i don't categorize myself based on the gender of those i love.
biden plans to nominate california labor secretary julie su for the no. 2 position at the labor department, bloomberg law's ben penn reports.
the house and senate also voted to make certain undocumented immigrants, often referred to as dreamers, eligible for in-state tuition at state colleges and universities.
but summer also brought tragedy — and with it, the kind of scrutiny buttigieg had largely avoided. in south bend, an unarmed black man named eric logan was shot and killed by a white police offer.
• spend $50 billion in his first year to repair roads, highways and bridges.
dear miss manners: as i'm sure you know, traditionally the bride's family comes up with the cost of the wedding. but now that marriage has become so diversified, who holds that responsibility? grooms to grooms, brides to brides — and has this changed the tradition as far as straight marriage goes?
hannah: let's make a toast to. . . .' okay! and i'll put a bunch of words that sound good, that are real, that are real, real words. okay. (more laughter) okay. let's make a toast to — first, it's my birthday, so to this amazing day. and, um . . . yeah. roll tide.

documents show that leo never assumed a formal position at jcn, which eventually changed its name to the judicial crisis network. but he told the post he is very supportive of the group.
garcetti, who has not declared anything about 2020 but has made several trips to primary states, came to the meeting with a story to tell. a six-day teachers' strike ended with a 6 percent raise and a commitment to shrinking class sizes, most of what the unions had wanted.

traumatized by 2016, only slightly healed by 2018, democratic primary voters are still not sure what to think about electability, except to worry about it.
for example, in 2019, the socially conservative minnesota family council published a 66-page document titled responding to the transgender issue in conjunction with the heritage foundation, the anti-lgbtq group alliance defending freedom, groups of radical feminist essentialists such as women's liberation front, or wolf, and the newly minted kelsey coalition, composed of parents and medical professionals who do not believe children and adolescents are capable of identifying as transgender.
i'm gay . . . and that i think you should look into. (this left colton truly speechless, although that doesn't seem like too great a feat.)
i'm watching the faces he's watching, seeing folks whisper low to their spouses: who is this guy again?
i'm very familiar with the media, leo wrote to tom carter, then a spokesman for the u.s. commission on international religious freedom, a government agency created to promote religious liberty abroad. i spend probably close to $800,000 annually on a pr team at the federalist society, and we generate press that has a publicity value of approximately $146 million each year.
the leos and their six children have lived in a mclean home that was purchased in 2010 for $710,000, according to real estate records. they paid off a 30-year mortgage last august and two months later bought a $3.3 million summer home with 11 bedrooms in an affluent seaside village on the coast of maine. in a statement, leo described the mansion as a retreat for our large family and for extending hospitality to our community of personal and professional friends and co-workers.
swearingen, who is fluent in spanish, earned a master of divinity from duke divinity school, where she won an award for her preaching.
ni una menos framed abortion as an issue of social justice and public health — rather than the united states' framing, in which it is an individual right. further, it emphasized that poor women in particular are likely to encounter dangerous conditions when seeking abortions; one popular chant at demonstrations has been: the rich abort, the poor die. that has changed the reproductive rights conversation.
but he welcomes liberals to the federalist society's jurisprudential worldview: there are liberals who work really hard at trying to develop a neutral, originalist approach to interpretation, he said. the fact that people may come out differently occasionally — that's okay. half the battle is just agreeing that it is essential.
rival campaigns-in-waiting circulated this piece on background and promised it's a taste of the attacks to come if harris gets traction.
the family foundation of virginia, a conservative advocacy group, has lobbied vigorously against such legislation, contending that it threatens religious liberty.
who did the operatives worry about? really, no one, and none were exactly glib about biden's potential challenge. he had the ability, they said, to enter the race with massive national attention, with polls showing him well ahead of trump, and with some democrats quickly endorsing him. but after 2016, they simply were not afraid of front-runners.
the republican national committee has labeled gillibrand a chameleon for her shifting positions and tried to paint all candidates as egotistical and caring more about their political careers than voters. the catholic association, which opposes abortion, reacted to harris's campaign announcement in a statement that highlighted her support of abortion rights and said that this mentality did not serve hillary clinton well in key battleground states like pennsylvania, ohio, wisconsin and michigan.
the official launch of obama's reelection campaign was slated for the first weekend in may 2012. first, obama was to hold back-to-back rallies on saturday, may 5, in the battleground states of ohio and virginia. then, on sunday, vice president biden was to hit the airwaves on nbc's meet the press.
a backslapping raconteur, mr. miller was a singular presence as he ruled the senate. his mane of white hair and chiseled features invited reminders of the founding fathers, at least in appearance — comparisons that mr. miller rarely discouraged.
mike bloomberg. he'll join sharpton at the same event as biden.
some of her policy positions rapidly changed. the night before her appointment was announced, she called a gay rights group to profess her full support for same-sex marriage. as she voted for gun-control measures, her nra rating fell to an f.
kennedy won the election by 84 electoral votes and a popular margin of 112,000 votes. seventy percent of black voters cast their ballots for him. in the making of the president, 1960, historian theodore h. white credited kennedy's success to the master stroke of intervention in the martin luther king arrest.
throughout her career the first female attorney general has downplayed gender, unlike, say, supreme court justices ruth bader ginsburg or sandra day o'connor, both of whom are from roughly the same generation as reno, both of whom have made sex discrimination a crucial part of their public story lines. even though (as she quietly said in her confirmation hearing) reno, too, was denied a law job because of her gender, she has chosen not to go there, not to wave that particular flag. i don't think [gender] remotely occurs to her, says anne bingaman, former head of the antitrust division. though reno has advanced the cause of women at the justice department, in keeping with her stated intent to hire based on excellence and diversity, she has tended to surround herself with women who think of themselves more as individualists than as feminists, who prefer not to make an issue of gender, to keep their heads down and work. in her approach, she's also strikingly different from the other controversial woman in the clinton administration, the other woman who has jokes and web sites devoted to her hair and her sexuality, the other woman who has appeared on a tabloid cover in a bathing suit (and another time, holding a space alien baby): hillary clinton. in a sense, hillary clinton and janet reno both have been thrust into excruciatingly difficult roles for modern women to accommodate.
she also views her lawsuit as symbolic, saying, it's for all the women in the country who have been harassed or assaulted by powerful men, and feel helpless to do anything about it.
he absolutely radiated holiness and kindness and caring and charisma, the woman said thursday in an interview. he persuaded me that i needed to be hugged, which of course i did, but i needed to be hugged by my husband, not by him. the post does not name victims of sexual assault without their consent.
without anyone to make the necessary decisions since 2017, bread and butter issue areas such as health and education have fallen into crisis. in december, for example, almost 20,000 health service workers went on strike over low pay, inadequate staffing levels, dangerous conditions and a declining quality of care. citizens have put intense pressure on politicians to do the jobs for which they continued to be paid despite the suspension.
while obama's aides railed over biden, the president was more annoyed at the appearance of white house chaos than at biden's remarks, for he knew his sentiments were in concert with the vice president's. by monday, the white house was losing control of the issue. obama's advisers watched aghast as education secretary arne duncan echoed biden's view on msnbc's morning joe political talk show. when asked if he believed that same-sex men and women should be able to get legally married, duncan promptly replied: yes, i do.
more broadly, the shooting raised a crucial question: was buttigieg, a young, white, harvard-educated man from indiana, the right candidate to lead a diverse party? more to the point: could he really empathize with the black experience?
while single men may evoke some passing interest, and while it still may be difficult for a spouseless man to attain the presidency, unmarried men don't arouse nearly the suspicion that unmarried women do. put it this way: there's no web site devoted to the many mellow moods of david souter. even so, it's tricky, figuring out to what extent reno is treated the way she is because she's a woman. in important ways reno has benefited from her gender: gender is the reason i'm here, reno says simply, acknowledging the fact that she was appointed in part because she's a woman. she's more recognizable and even, possibly, more interesting to some people because she's a woman. yet the flip side is the over-scrutiny that goes with being the first woman anything – much less the first woman in the top cop role, a role that naturally attracts, for its first female occupant, over-expectation, a narrower path, a narrower tolerance for mistakes, says laura liswood, executive director of the council of women world leaders, an association of current and former female presidents and prime ministers at harvard's john f. kennedy school of government. feminist academics would say that it's also common for women in power to be sexualized the way reno has been. that's the way you bring a strong woman down – you insult her, degrade her, portray her as sexually profligate, reduce her to her own anatomy.
when asked, have you ever said that publicly before? duncan answered bluntly: i don't know i've ever been asked publicly.
the new senator proved more than flexible. she voted against the nra's entire agenda and received an f-rating from the group by her next election, less than two years later. her shift on guns was so rapid that it drew a word of caution from mccarthy, who became an ally.
that a black democrat will represent georgia is proof of changing demographics and intense organizing in that state, said keneshia grant, a political science professor at howard university, speaking on the day of the runoff.
morally confused sister: you see this as a matter of trust-breaking — or perhaps the other principals involved gaslight you into believing that you have a duty to either keep or disclose secrets. you are not in charge of policing your adult brother. you don't owe it to either party to tell — or lie.
for the interview, duncan sat in a studio in washington, taking the questions through an earpiece. his staff was standing by listening to his answers but couldn't hear the questions. the words same-sex marriage never came out of the education secretary's mouth. afterward, duncan recalled, his staff walked out with him and said, oh, that interview went really well.
researchers at the southern poverty law center have classified the church as one of 70 hate groups in the country that promote anti-lgbtq sentiments.
a senate bill to outlaw discrimination in housing sailed out of committee monday — with support from a pair of conservative republicans who had never been on board before.
some people have stereotypical reactions to women in positions of leadership, says maggy hurchalla, and on the other hand you have curiosity, not even unkind curiosity, from people because they like her. but there are also those close to her who see something else going on. among them is reno's former deputy, jamie gorelick, who says that she doesn't normally like to look at things in terms of gender but who thinks that, in the case of reno, it's hard to ignore. you can't look at the `saturday night live' skits or listen to the comments made about her when she first came to washington by washington society, says gorelick, and not think that if she were a man, her personal traits – like not particularly caring about fashion – would be considered okay. then again, maybe people say these things because she's, you know, tall. it's because of her height; i don't read anything into it, says carl stern, former justice department public affairs director, who has consented to watch a videotape of the snl simba skit as a way of talking about reno's public image – something that was, in a sense, his responsibility until he left the department in 1996. they have an ensemble cast, he says, pooh-poohing the fact that reno is played by a man. whoever fits the description, so be it. in this, stern is adopting the line that reno herself takes.
as the battles continue in the courts and in legislatures, some religious-freedom advocates who would like to see a compromise have expressed fears that the country is at an impasse and that the law will ultimately favor one set of rights or the other.
furthermore, the politics of brexit changed the political parties' calculations. from 2017 until the u.k. parliament's december elections, the dup enjoyed power as junior partner to the conservative party. however, the dup was less influential than it had hoped; it was unable to prevent the british parliament from extending same-sex marriage and abortion rights to people in northern ireland, despite its strong opposition. perhaps more important, the dup also failed to prevent boris johnson's government from approving a brexit withdrawal deal that will leave northern ireland tied to the republic of ireland's economy and that of the european market — while creating trade barriers between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom.
perhaps you realized that arriving at a better future doesn't happen all at once, and that you never just wake up to it.
on the other, if i don't say anything, i break her trust.
now meklat is back, attempting to clear his name. last month, he published a book, autopsie, which contends that young people are drawn to social media without fully understanding the consequences it might have on their lives. and he has launched a full-fledged apology campaign, making the rounds on all the major talk shows to explain himself to a highly skeptical public. central to his argument: second chances are rarely given to people of color, to whom extra scrutiny always applies.
i separate my advocacy from the educational work of the federalist society, he said in his statement. i put in a full day's work for the society and spend a substantial amount of my personal time on the other public service work i also love.
as i approach, conway is being congratulated by people coming up from all sides.
the politician who says she dislikes publicity because i feel like i'm intruding on people . . . i've just not cared for it. really, there's no easy way to describe a woman who is devoid of affect, who throws out a negative force field as she sits. it's brilliant. you can see how she rope-a-dopes congress. she is not glib. she doesn't feel the need to help, conversationally. she deflates her own accomplishments at the same time as she's deflating conversation. she reveals that she buys her blue dresses from a catalogue – the attorney general, a catalogue shopper – but won't say which one. wouldn't want publicity. as for the rustic, up-from-the-everglades myth, she thought it was a hoot, she says, when in early profiles the press made this big deal about how her mother wrestled alligators; u.s. news & world report even did an illustration of janet reno herself roping a gator. wait a second. these alligators are a crucial part of the reno story line. is it not true that everyone in the reno household knew how, if not to wrestle an alligator, to put one to sleep by turning it over on its back? little alligators, she says, precise, lawyerly. wouldn't want to self-aggrandize. as for all these other images of her, these multiple story lines, all these so-called portrayals – she is not convinced that they exist. i think i'm fairly transparent, she says. i think it's fairly obvious what i am. maybe so.
ms. st. james won endorsements from mayor willie brown and poet lawrence ferlinghetti, among others, but in a race for one of six seats, she came in seventh place.
speakers at that first symposium included future justice antonin scalia, who was then a law professor at the university of chicago and a mentor to the campus federalist society chapter. choosing as his topic the two faces of federalism, scalia presumed that his audience was on a mission to influence national policy, and so he told the gathering: i urge you, then — as hamilton would have urged you — to keep in mind that the federal government is not bad but good. the trick is to use it wisely.
over the years obama had shifted his stand on the issue. in chicago in 1996, when he ran for an illinois state senate seat, he told a gay newspaper in a questionnaire that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. but in 2004 as a u.s. senate candidate he asserted that marriage was something just for a man and a woman. in 2008, on the presidential campaign trail, he took an official position against a change in marriage rights, though he let it be known among his confidants that his views were evolving.
-- sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) has taken to describing herself as a progressive prosecutor while rolling out her new memoir, the truths we hold, ahead of a forthcoming presidential announcement. america has a deep and dark history of people using the power of the prosecutor as an instrument of injustice, harris writes in the book. i know this history well — of innocent men framed, of charges brought against people without sufficient evidence, of prosecutors hiding information that would exonerate defendants, of the disproportionate application of the law.

but the news was tempered by senate minority leader mitch mcconnell's (r-ky.) announcing he would allow the 50-50 senate to organize after it became clear democrats didn't have the votes to eliminate the filibuster, which acts as a 60-vote supermajority for most legislation. liberal activists have been aggressively pushing for its removal.
youth seems to be meklat's ultimate defense. i think you have to remember that i was 18 when i created it, meklat said, referring to the marcelin deschamps account.
the last time i was around this many virgins, well, i was on 'the view!' 
the time travel fantasy is pure escapism, which is to say it's both optimistic and wholly irresponsible. it's a way of saying, i wish things were better, but also of saying, let me know when we get there, okay? a way of being a perpetual passenger, insisting you're not equipped to drive.
-- chaos erupted on the house floor after democrats tried to pass a bill to reopen the government by voice vote. the hill's juliegrace brufke reports: the vote will be postponed after republicans called foul on their request for a roll call vote not being granted. the democratic bill, which would fund the government through feb. 28, was expected to be approved but will be dead on arrival in the senate. democrats will request to vacate the vote and take it up again next week, according to a democratic leadership aide. … republicans argued they had called for a roll call vote on the measure, with rep. brett guthrie (r-ky.) having made the request, which was ignored or not heard by rep. g.k. butterfield (d-n.c.), who was presiding over the floor during the vote. sources on the floor said the request was made too late.
there is much for this crowd to celebrate. the conservative and libertarian society for law and public policy studies has reached an unprecedented peak of power and influence. brett kavanaugh, whose membership in the society dates to his yale law school days, has just been elevated to the supreme court; he is the second of president trump's appointees, following neil gorsuch, another justice closely associated with the society. they join justice clarence thomas (who said last spring he's been a part of the federalist society now since meeting with them … in the 1980s), chief justice john roberts (listed as a member in 1997-98) and justice samuel alito (a periodic speaker at society events). the newly solidified conservative majority on the court will inevitably decide more cases in line with the society's ideals — which include checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the constitution according to its original meaning. in practice, this could mean fewer regulations of the environment and health care, more businesses allowed to refuse service to customers on religious grounds, and denial of protections claimed by newly vocal classes of minorities, such as transgender people.
democratic and independent senators who relented in the standoff said they did not necessarily trust mcconnell, but had faith that the bipartisan negotiators, including sens. susan collins (r-maine) and joe manchin iii (d-w.va.), would force him to abide by his commitments.
in his methodological observations, marwick is very much the cautious professional historian. he firmly rejects the great marxisant fallacy, according to which any revolution worthy of the name can be conducted only by a class intent upon overthrowing the whole of bourgeois society and culture; it was this fallacy that inspired herbert marcuse to create a new revolutionary class, composed of students, blacks and other marginalized and disaffected groups. marwick's own methodological explanation is more complex and sophisticated (so complex and sophisticated, perhaps, as to offer little practical guidance): cultural and social change, while influenced by human agency, by contingency and convergence, takes place within the opportunities offered, and the constraints imposed, by structural, ideological, and institutional circumstances. like a good disinterested historian, he also professes to reject the familiar ideological interpretations of the '60s: the radical view that sees it as a movement of social and sexual liberation, a boon to blacks, women, gays and other oppressed minorities; and the conservative view that harps on such disagreeable matters as the increase of crime and violence and an assault upon the universities and rational inquiry. marwick does not, to be sure, refrain from judgment. instead he couches his judgments in the familiar if . . . but, on the one hand . . . on the other hand mode. thus, if a relaxed censorship brought an explosion of porn and exploitation, it was also accompanied by a remarkable continuity in the revival in serious american film-making.
they met one stormy night in 1865 when whitman was the last passenger on doyle's car, according to the library congress exhibit. to pete, the poet looked 'like an old sea-captain.' we were familiar at once. i put my hand on his knee — we understood from that time on we were the biggest sort of friends.
with money came staff and the need to scale his operation in less than half the time of some of his competitors. his iowa state director hit the ground in the first days of may. by september, the campaign was opening 20 offices in the state in 20 days. the buttigieg campaign had to find what talent was left in other early states, too.
-- states are reporting a sharp increase in the number of unemployment claims filed by federal workers. tim craig reports: under federal guidelines, furloughed federal workers and contractors who have been told not to report to work are generally eligible to apply for unemployment benefits, although many will have to repay the money if they receive back pay when they return to the job. but on wednesday, in another blow to federal workers, the u.s. labor department sent guidance to states clarifying that hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are working without pay do not qualify for unemployment benefits.
gentleness is the only constructive response. of course we need to applaud people when they change their minds, of course we need to welcome them wholeheartedly to the team, of course we need to bite our tongues when they discover 40-year-old talking points, of course we need to recognize that someone like mccain might be a more resonant voice for conservative viewers than liberals like goldberg or joy behar. righteously scolding latecomers is gratifying but counterproductive to the cause — a self-centered move in its own right.
leo also developed a reputation as a conservative moneyman. when kavanaugh and other bush aides were looking for someone to pay for a press event aimed at supporting the stalled judicial nomination of miguel estrada, they turned to leo.
at first, it looked like it would be a complete disaster when the date was filled with painfully awkward silences. and nothing compared with the cringeworthy moment when colton gave a champagne toast, and then encouraged hannah to give a toast of her own, because it was her birthday. we'll just transcribe the moment, which rang oddly similar to miss teen south carolina's infamous pageant answer about the iraq.
former vice president joe biden, who is contemplating a run, has defended his leading role in the senate passage of the 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act, which activists say accelerated the rate of mass incarceration and disproportionately affected minorities. he has apologized for his treatment of anita hill in the early 1990s when she accused clarence thomas, then a supreme court nominee, of sexual harassment.
-- king is raising money off his comments about white nationalism and white supremacy. the des moines register's robin opsahl reports: 'the unhinged left has teamed up with republican 'nevertrumpers' and is pulling out all the stops to destroy me,' king wrote in a campaign email to his supporters. in the email, king said the new york times and 'rabid leftist media' are coming after him for supporting [trump] and because of his views on immigration.
this issue was the showpiece issue for democrats, who promised action after last year's mass shooting at a virginia beach municipal building.
fast facts: arlington's crystal city, pentagon city and potomac yard were originally part of abingdon plantation, and agriculture predominated until the railway arrived on the scene. in the latter half of the 19th century, the area dabbled in gambling but later turned respectable with office buildings, residential developments and hotels. in the early 2000s, the naval air systems command and the patent and trademark office relocated, causing the work-and-play population to drop. amazon will occupy three buildings on 18th street near the crystal city metro station, plus two new sites in pentagon city that will bookend a whole foods, another bezos company.
mccloskey, 65, is once again living in the washington area and has advanced alzheimer's disease, opus dei officials said.
key quote: there are only a handful of republicans and shrinking who will vote against him, said sen. lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.), who has been advising trump on the upcoming proceedings.
many individual federalists are political and ideological warriors, though never in the name of the federalist society. rather, society events provide the proving ground where they hone their arguments, seize a chance to shine and come to the attention of mentors higher up in the political-legal hierarchy. in that sense, the federalist society is a talent network and placement agency as well.
we've come so far, biden said. but we still have far to go.
all of the fathers interviewed mentioned the significant emotional work they had done to prepare to become fathers.
the rest of us could only watch it and think: just get me to the inauguration. put me in an h.g. wells novel. find me a wrinkle in time.
for years, abortion had been considered politically untouchable. but the legislative debate in 2018 made it one of the most important issues in the 2019 presidential campaign. each candidate weighed in, and when fernández opened the new legislative session in early 2020, he promised to introduce a bill that would legalize abortion.
the senate voted along party lines tuesday to give local governments control over confederate statues. earlier the session, the senate passed a bill to find a replacement for the statue of confederate gen. robert e. lee that represents virginia in the u.s. capitol. the house voted along party lines tuesday to remove lee's statue from statuary hall, and approved the local control bill by a vote of 53 to 46.
-- in other significant senate news, retired astronaut mark kelly — the husband of former congresswoman gabrielle giffords (d) — is actively considering challenging appointed arizona sen. martha mcsally (r) in 2020. the arizona republic's yvonne wingett sanchez reports: a spokesperson for kelly confirmed kelly's interest in running in 2020. … 314 action, a nonprofit political action committee that recruits, trains and bolsters the candidacies of scientists and candidates with stem (science, technology, engineering and math) backgrounds, is spending six figures on a social media campaign aimed at recruiting kelly for the race and raising awareness about his biography.
where's the grass-roots support? multiple operatives described biden as a genuinely beloved figure among democratic voters but not one who had turned his popularity into a real network of support. he did not waste his time after leaving the white house: he wrote a memoir about his son beau's death from cancer, he went on a multistate speaking tour, he launched a pac, and he campaigned for dozens of democrats, especially in places where other party figures were not terribly popular.
chasten had sat through buttigieg's speeches before. but after the cnn town hall, he and his husband were headed for something on a much different scale.
in the senate, gillibrand has fought for the lgbt community, helping to lead the successful effort to repeal don't ask, don't tell, the policy barring military service by out gays and lesbians, and pushing legislation to stop discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
advocates for dreamers were less convinced.
harrison said: they threatened me with the high courts. they were going to ring my father in his place of work. they were going to put me in the national newspapers, and under no circumstances would i ever be allowed to take my son back because he was happy with his mommy and daddy.
so even as white voters in iowa and new hampshire took to buttigieg, it became increasingly clear that he was winning almost no support among african americans in more diverse states.
senator gillibrand has been an ally to us and a leader on a number of fights, said winnie wong, a women's march organizer focusing on the medicare-for-all lobby day.
they said it was love at first sight, said barbara bair, literature and cultural specialist.
when he took his seat on the set of nbc's washington studio, biden projected the image of the president's lieutenant in a crisp charcoal suit, white shirt and blue-striped tie. but when host david gregory asked about a sensitive unresolved issue hanging over the administration, biden veered from the campaign playbook. you know, gregory began, the president has said that his views on gay marriage, on same-sex marriage, have evolved. but he's opposed to it. you're opposed to it. have your views … evolved?
ms. st. james was known in san francisco as the convener of the hookers' ball, a coyote fundraiser that for years was one of the city's most colorful political events. at its height, in 1978, it attracted 20,000 guests, including a sizable contingent of politicians.
her son was put in a locked nursery, and she was allowed to see him only at feeding times. and then one day her son was gone.
she won a special election in 2010 with 63 percent of the vote and followed with 72 percent of the vote in 2012, when she earned her first full term, and 67 percent in november. her last campaign came as gillibrand navigated intraparty divisions over how to handle the #metoo movement.

roughly 20 million americans have health insurance through the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. the measure became law in 2010 without the support of any republicans in congress. the trump administration eliminated a financial penalty for noncompliance and cut funding for programs that help sign people up. biden says he would protect what remains of the law, and expand it.
although known for her fresh legal arguments, kaplan was comfortable working in a large firm. she seemed unlikely to go out on her own. in many ways, it's the boldest professional move she's made.
james parrish, executive director of equality virginia, said robinson's sponsorship of the housing bill in the house could improve its chances for success. the gop controls both chambers by two votes apiece. it's clearly helpful to have a member of the party in power introducing legislation, especially in election years, he said. we believe for many reasons, from the work we've done to the polling that we've seen, to the commitments that we've had from delegates on these two issues, that these bills should move forward.
i'm ready. i'm excited, says kaplan. in the carroll case, kaplan believes that trump's proclivity for false and misleading statements — with more than 30,000 of them during his white house term, according to the post — will be tested when he is under oath. during a 2007 trump deposition, lawyers caught him making exaggerated claims 30 times, according to a 2016 post investigation.
obama is also a buttigieg fan. in his 2017 new yorker exit interview, the former president named buttigieg as one of four democrats who would lead the party forward. they've met at least once to discuss the future.
look, biden began. i just think — that — the good news is — he set his elbows on the table and interlaced his fingers, almost prayerlike. same-sex marriage, he explained, came down to a simple proposition: who do you love? he repeated it for emphasis: who do you love? and will you be loyal to the person you love? he explained that most people believed that was what all marriages were about, whether they're marriages of lesbians or gay men or heterosexuals.
he knows that the effort might add up to nothing more than one more instance of winning by losing — raising his profile for whatever else might lie ahead. but he's calculating that the whole bundle of firsts he represents will make him stand out from the pack of senior citizens — joe biden, elizabeth warren, bloomberg, sanders — and the football-team's worth of middle-aged members of congress harboring white house dreams.
the biggest attacks on warnock's candidacy from his opponent and national republicans were also tied to his activism and rhetoric as a pastor. an attack ad focused on a clip of warnock preaching that it is not possible to serve god and the military at the same time. that's a popular passage among liberal christians who find many conservatives' fervent support for the military to be in conflict with some christian teaching.
as the 2016 election campaign heated up, leo became president of three new nonprofits whose tax filings and incorporation records illustrate how his network sometimes operates. the groups — called bh fund, the freedom and opportunity fund and america engaged — were formed by an employee at holtzman vogel josefiak torchinsky, a warrenton, va., law firm with deep ties to the conservative movement. the nonprofits reported having no employees and no websites. they had virtually no public presence. leo's role as president of all three groups was not disclosed for nearly three years because of lags in how nonprofit groups report their annual operations to the irs.
i am very proud of the support amazon has provided to the lgbtq community, both with internal policies like the expansion of transition health benefits to fully cover transition surgeries for transgender employees and with external support of policies like our fight against the bathroom bill in washington state that targeted transgender residents, he said. ultimately, i think amazon wants us to do what is right for lgbtq employees.
that night represented everything we were trying to build together: a community, a family, with the best of those we were born to and those we chose. they were the ones we'd rely on as we embarked on the parenting journey some day, those who had raised us, and those who would soon be having babies we'd want to help raise, too.
the post's shayna jacobs explains how state and local investigations of president trump are expanding to his tax write-offs. (the washington post)
jcn, the group that has office space on the same hall as the federalist society, launched a $7 million media campaign to bolster the republican-controlled senate in preventing obama from filling the seat, according to a jcn news release at the time. working on the campaign was creative response concepts, a firm that was hired by multiple nonprofits in leo's network, tax filings show.
and then in late 2003, as his profile grew ever larger, ­mccloskey was gone. not disappeared exactly, but nowhere to be seen, at least in any official capacity. he left, he told some friends and associates, for an opportunity to study in england. the work of the catholic information center would continue, but without the direction of the man who had reignited its flame.
nevertheless, goldberg nodded along to mccain's request, as did the other co-hosts. of course they were on board with holding politicians' feet to the fire on this issue. they had been doing so for a long time.

on this night, mcadams's ankeny army was composed of those relative newcomers. here was kelsie goodman, a 35-year-old high school assistant principal who had returned home because there were so many more options in this area than there had been before. she was proud to be from a state that was the first in the midwest to legalize same-sex marriage, a place that helped to springboard the candidacy of the first black president. but as her state was slowly diversifying, she had become concerned that trump was empowering voters who resented those very distinctions.
sunday's announcement is hardly a conclusive end to his political career. if buttigieg were to run for president in 2056, after all, he would be younger than biden is now.
rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii), who is running for president in 2020, released a video on jan. 17 apologizing for past statements regarding gay rights. (tulsi gabbard)
advocates behind the letter, among them actors alan cumming and omar sharif jr., former democratic pennsylvania congressman peter h. kostmayer and former new york city mayoral candidate christine quinn, say that doing the best for its employees can't include putting 50,000 of them in any of 11 final locations: atlanta; austin; columbus, ohio; dallas; indianapolis; miami; nashville; northern virginia; philadelphia; pittsburgh; or raleigh, n.c.
luckily, that was the low point. during their romantic dinner, after hearing once again about why colton decided to remain a virgin, hannah shared her own story about a previous relationship: she wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, but that didn't work out, and now she feels a tremendous amount of guilt.
citing logistical challenges that were better served by local counsel, kaplan's firm no longer represents heard in the defamation case, which is scheduled for trial in may.
the revelation about mccloskey's actions and the reason he was sent away stunned many who knew him at the height of his powers in the capital.
the comment angered local democrats, who came within five points of ousting upton. the grumbling underlined a paradox of the 2020 democratic primary: even as biden leads in speculative polls, even as some senior democrats insist he could roll past president trump, few in the party — including his rivals — are treating him like a front runner. no major candidate is waiting on biden to decide; none of them believes he can clear the field.
a house democrat accused the white house of inaction amid the shutdown:
a dentist's office? one of the young women replies. and i think a massage parlor.
in california, gay marriage battle is a family feud california assemblyman pete knight, r-palmdale, appears weary during more than three hours of hearings regarding his bill banning same-sex marriages. (ap)
biden's promised union members he'd be the strongest labor president you've ever had. while serving as vice president, he got out ahead of president barack obama in publicly supporting same-sex marriage.
leo's behind-the-scenes activism came at the same time he was helping to grow the federalist society, which describes itself as nonpartisan. leo told the post he has taken steps to avoid any conflict.
i remember saying to her one time, 'don't change your mind so fast — learn the issue first,'  mccarthy said.
• give the 21 million americans who work for the federal government and state governments the right to unionize, which currently exists only in some states.
instead, in the summer of 2017, kaplan launched her own boutique firm, still a rarity among female corporate lawyers, creating an unusual model that combines lucrative commercial litigation with a progressive public-interest practice. free from the agendas of risk-averse institutional clients, kaplan and her colleagues could take on any case they believed had merit.
the vibe: the city resembles an active ant colony, with bodies disappearing inside the malls and metro station or marching home. people do gather for a midday coffee or happy hour before returning to their respective corners. despite the transient nature, longtime residents still exist, including freddie lutz, owner of freddie's beach bar, who will happily take you on a nostalgic ride of crystal city involving a drugstore soda fountain and a drive-in movie theater.
what makes a good litigator and lawyer is being a pessimist and risk-averse because you need to be looking at problems around the next corner, says karlan, who helped prepare kaplan for the supreme court argument. robbie has been as successful as she is because she doesn't appear to be that kind of thinker. she's an optimist.
we also have limited parking on our road. we can accommodate eight to 10 vehicles, but if 70 people show up, there will probably be 35 cars to find parking for.
as we proceed through virginia, interstate traffic, as it's wont to do, repeatedly bottles up for no apparent reason. we've still got plenty of time to get to fairfax county for the first event up there, but the creeping pace is driving buttigieg to distraction. let's find an alternate route, he says.
i'm going to run for president of the united states because, as a young mom, i'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as i would fight for my own. which is why i believe that health care should be a right and not a privilege, she said. it's why i believe we should have better public schools for our kids because it shouldn't matter what block you grow up on. and i believe that anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class.
this newsletter usually stays away from blind quotes, but the best way to capture a conversation that's happening all the time among democrats was to let these operatives speak freely. in general, you can identify three reasons why they believe biden, unlike previous front-runners, was not scaring anyone. these people are paid to elect somebody else, but this is the chatter happening when democrats turn off the microphones.
i couldn't fight them, i didn't have the tools, she said.
democrats responded furiously to trump's cancellation and accused the president of acting like a child. lawmakers' visits to war zones are typically kept secret for security reasons, and house intelligence committee chairman adam b. schiff (d-calif.) said trump's decision to disclose pelosi's travel plans was 'completely and utterly irresponsible in every way.' … things could spiral further: though pelosi asked trump to reschedule his state of the union address, her office made clear that she was not, at this point, denying him an invitation. the house and senate must pass a resolution to formally invite trump to come to congress, and if pelosi blocks the measure this year, it would almost certainly deny trump a traditional state of the union platform.
many observers believe that an equal rights amendment would provide ironclad, irreversible guarantees of women's rights. that's what rep. carolyn b. maloney (d-n.y.) suggested in a statement after the virginia vote: a constitutional amendment is forever. it cannot be repealed, rolled back or expire. it is not subject to the whims of who controls congress, a statehouse, or the white house. advocates believe it would strengthen legislation on issues ranging from pregnancy discrimination to equal pay to violence against women. opponents fear it would be used to overturn abortion restrictions.
realizing he'd strayed into controversial territory, biden stressed he was speaking for himself personally, not for the white house. i — i — look, i am vice president of the united states of america. the president sets the policy, he observed. and he elaborated on his own view: i am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another — he slowed down now to make his point perfectly clear — are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. and quite frankly, i don't see much of a distinction beyond that.
last week, she said her shifts reveal political courage.
title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 states that employers must reasonably accommodate the religious practices of employees if that can be done without undue hardship. the problem with davis's case was that she didn't seek just to exempt herself, said douglas laycock, a professor at the university of virginia law school. instead, she sought to exempt the whole county. laycock said he believes that exemptions in government offices should be narrower than those in businesses because the government must treat all citizens equally — but that myrick's case seemed like a win-win compared with davis's case.
i've ridden along with candidates for decades and have long since grown accustomed to the interview pausing when they approach the next event. this is the time for a tense, whispering huddle with aides, reviewing talking points and notes on the pols and donors who need impressing. buttigieg, by contrast, grows practically giddy the closer we get to the first event in northern virginia, taking only a minute to quiz mckenna on the essentials of the fundraiser for jennifer wexton, a young virginia state senator challenging republican barbara comstock for her u.s. house seat.
-- congress has adopted a morose outlook on resolving the impasse after a bipartisan senate proposal to reopen the government failed to gain steam a second time. politico's burgess everett and heather caygle report: 'i feel like i'm going to strangle you,' quipped one senator who's tried in vain to find a breakthrough when a reporter asked about their state of mind. that lawmaker was joking, probably, but the vibes in the capitol are funereal at best. and with most members headed home for a long weekend, the partial shutdown is essentially guaranteed to enter into its second month. … rank-and-file lawmakers can make noise and try to create momentum, but trump has dismissed everything they've come up with — leading some members to wonder what they're even doing.
that's not the case anymore, apparently.
sarratt, who holds an mba from the university of virginia, left the corporate world after she felt called to ministry and obtained her master's in theological studies from emory university.
in meklat's case, at issue are nearly two dozen tweets he posted under the name of marcelin deschamps, which he says was inspired by the dada artist marcel duchamp. ostensibly to parody the average lower-middle-class french voter, meklat used the account to attack any number of public targets, but the remarks against gays and jews elicited the most outrage.
the challenge here is to protect the rights of both sides as much as possible, and more often than not, that is entirely possible if we had just a smidgen of goodwill on both sides, laycock said.
shop hop: long island city is thin on retail. moma ps1 and the noguchi museum have well-curated gift shops, of course. more than a year ago, book culture, an independent bookseller with three manhattan outposts, expanded into queens. the two-level store sells more than just reading material: pick up a frida kahlo paper doll, backpack by sweden's fjallraven kanken or dachshund-print notecards. freed of london, the dance shoemaker, dresses the feet of washington ballet performers and appeared on the big screen with natalie portman in black swan. the english company's sole u.s. store resides in long island city and stocks items by japan's chacott, too. the attire is suitable for anyone who frequently bends their knees, even if it's just to pick up a dropped m&m. slovak-czech varieties specializes in toys (homemade wooden animals and trucks), edibles (three kinds of flour, chocolate galore) and glassware made in the homeland. matted blurs the line between high and low art by combining a gallery (the current show features photos developed from vintage negatives) with anti-kondo baubles, such as sequined stuffed animals and duct tape art kits.
a tough q&a with the man who, more than anyone, could shape the social media conversation about 2020.
we talked. he seemed engaged in the work of redemption, and he apologized for the extremely violent, and notably anti-semitic tweets. but i don't know if it was sincere or a kind of opportunism, finkielkraut said, noting that he disapproved of how meklat presented himself as a victim. he was between penitence and accusation.
why janet reno fascinates, confounds and even terrifies america? by liza mundy
you saw this with sen. rob portman (r-ohio), who only began to support same-sex marriage when his son came out as gay. or with jared kushner, who decided to make criminal justice reform a signature issue because of his father's experiences being convicted and imprisoned for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering. chris christie — who, incidentally, had prosecuted charles kushner as new jersey's attorney general — recently filmed a video begging his constituents to wear masks, but only after he'd contracted the coronavirus after attending a white house ceremony, maskless.
when one asked zaun about a bill that would make it illegal for institutions to ban guns from their parking lots, another recorded footage of zaun saying he was a strong supporter of the second amendment. this was potential footage to show he didn't want gun control.
all of this comes amid fundamental changes to northern ireland itself. changing demographics are making irish unification more plausible in the near term, as nationalists, who wish to have northern ireland leave the u.k. and unite with the republic of ireland, become more dominant. nationalists make up a majority of legislators in northern ireland for the first time. if the government were to hold a referendum on unification, as the good friday agreement provides for, polls suggest that unification would pass with a slight majority. there is no guarantee that such a referendum will take place, or would pass, but even the possibility could reignite tensions or even lead to violent conflict between the communities.
the people who grew up with playboy magazine are starting to fade away, husni said, so they will have to figure out what the millennial generation wants in the 21st century if they are going to survive.
it is unfortunate that congresswoman gabbard based her misguided opinion on the far-right wing manipulation of these straightforward questions, hirono spokesman will dempster said in a statement.
politics was the impetus, but the thing mcadams and others felt they were missing most was community. the old institutions for gathering neighbors — churches, union halls, country clubs — were all playing less of a role in american life. politics, and the discussion of it, was the suburbs' new social club.
anyway. to even touch it is rude to everyone, tracy said. i feel like she's here to date a guy and the majority of the rest of us are here to fall in love with someone. probably! she confronted demi, and a feud was born, and then amplified when tracy was later interrupted by a bathrobe-wearing demi, who led colton upstairs telling him she wanted to show him her fantasy closet. which, incidentally, was another thing from beauty and the beast.
as early favorites such as sens. kamala d. harris (d-calif.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) built multistate organizations, buttigieg and his husband, chasten, along with smith and another staffer, max harris, would pile into the car, drive west from south bend, and try to find iowans willing to listen to buttigieg.
divided into three periods, 1958-63, 1964-69 and 1969-74, it ranges over a variety of subjects: sex, censorship and morality; art, literature and movies; race, class and youth; poverty, affluence and commerce; education, welfare and crime; feminism, consumerism and environmentalism; beatles, hippies and yippies. in addition there are accounts of the dramatic events in each period and each country: the civil rights movement, student strikes, urban riots, political crises. in a work of this scope there are inevitable omissions and peculiar emphases. why so much emphasis on the popular culture (on movies especially) and so little on the high culture, which was complicitous in creating, sustaining and, more important, legitimizing the cultural revolution? (it would have been useful to be introduced to lionel trilling's concept of the adversary culture, which originated with the literati earlier in the century and was democratized and popularized in the course of the '60s.) why half-a-dozen pages on gore vidal and toni morrison and no mention of saul bellow? why, in a long discussion of race, is there no account of the moynihan report on the black family in 1965, which was so prescient in pointing out a crucial aspect of the racial problem in the united states: the breakdown of the black family (signified by the then-startling illegitimacy rate of 25 percent)?
in the wake of harvey weinstein's sexual misconduct revelations, kaplan co-founded the time's up legal defense fund, which offers financial assistance for plaintiffs filing harassment cases, and she now serves as chair of the time's up organization. many women who say they have been sexually harassed or assaulted have come to her. the actress amber heard sought kaplan's representation in ex-husband johnny depp's $50 million case involving a 2018 washington post opinion piece by heard; he alleges she defamed him by implying that he domestically abused her. (the op-ed does not explicitly name him.) in the complaint, the actor denies any abuse took place.
-- politico magazine, how jared kushner tried to stop me from running the trump transition, by chris christie: i'd been around politics long enough to grasp what was happening. jared was trying—and not so subtly—to derail my appointment as transition chairman. the issue wasn't the rushing. the issue was the guy. donald didn't sound as convinced as jared did. 'jared,' he said, 'why would we have to wait on this? it's going to be a great announcement for him and a great announcement for us.' jared let a beat pass before he spoke up. but when he started talking, he sounded like a person who'd been holding poison inside himself for a very long time. 'you really want to know why?' jared asked. 'yeah,' trump said. 'because i don't trust him to have this, and you know why i don't trust him to have it.'
as i have, indeed, been growing my hair out for a few years now, i am quite aware that it is longer than it used to be.
stanford university law professor pamela karlan says of their frequent legal conversations: robbie's not calling about feelings. she wants to fix it first. she's the least diffident person i've ever met. plenty of smart people worry about failing. they worry about every little thing. robbie doesn't worry about that. in a really disarming way, she doesn't care if people view her as hyperaggressive.
women's march inc. is plowing ahead, cognizant of how the controversy has altered its role. it's no longer part of the cadre of liberal groups that democrats will comfortably line up with.
buttigieg can come off like a combination boy scout and lovable dork. you can easily imagine him in silicon valley, deeply debating the future of artificial intelligence with his college friend mark zuckerberg before leaving work to feed the homeless. but politics has always been his main obsession. as a senior and student-government officer in high school, he won the 2000 jfk profile in courage essay contest, earning a trip to boston for the annual ceremony. his subject was as millennial as it gets: bernie sanders.
asked who, if anyone, intimidated him over the years in annapolis, mr. miller, without hesitation, said, i was never afraid of anyone.
while i oppose the nomination of brian buescher to the u.s. district court in nebraska, i stand strongly against those who are fomenting religious bigotry, citing as disqualifiers buescher's catholicism and his affiliation with the knights of columbus, gabbard said in the op-ed.
soon after, he turned things over to his husband, the first openly gay candidate to win delegates in a primary, a candidate who fared so well that he pushed out of mind notions of just how improbable his success was.
i have a very distinctive beginning story, randy barnett told me over eggs at a diner in logan circle a few days before the society's annual national convention in november. there was no federalist society when i was a law student, so i didn't know anything about it. i heard about it, and my impression of it was it was going to be a very right-wing organization, and i'm a libertarian — i'm not a conservative.
house minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.). cheney was censured over the weekend by the wyoming republican party for supporting trump's impeachment by republicans in wyoming's carbon county . she's gotten only lukewarm suppor t fromhouse minority leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.).
gomez called the continued injustice of abortion a preeminent priority.
to be sure, the abortion debate in the americas has hardly been put to bed. just as roe v. wade inaugurated the modern era of partisan sparring over abortion in the united states, this issue, and others related to gender and sexuality, may increasingly become a political battleground throughout the region.
today's suburbs aren't like the ones that existed 30, 20 or even four years ago. between rapid population growth, shifting demographics and anti-trump sentiments, they have become key to democratic hopes of compensating for the defection of many working-class white voters to the gop.
on the other side of the capitol, sen. scott surovell (d-fairfax) had long proposed giving undocumented immigrants a driver privilege card, which would include a notice that it could not be used for voting — something offered in neighboring maryland and in the district.
believing that trump's justice department seemed unlikely to seriously investigate and prosecute the people responsible for the violence during the unite the right rally and counterprotest — he infamously claimed there were very fine people, on both sides — kaplan announced, and this was her precise language to friends and colleagues: i want to sue nazis.
others, like biden and buttigieg, argued for adding more government-run insurance options alongside existing private plans, a more incremental approach that signaled moderation.
when kerry's arizona experiment floundered, they pulled us, a month out from the election. i got reassigned. in classic campaign fashion, i thought i was supposed to go to denver, so i drove eight hours to denver, turned up at the office, introduced myself, carved out a desk space somewhere, called washington and said, 'okay, now what?' and they said, 'oh, denver? we actually wanted you to go to albuquerque.' so that's how i learned what a presidential campaign was actually like.
democrats say they have marching orders from last fall's elections, which gave them full control of the legislature for the first time in a generation, with majorities of 55 to 45 in the house and 21 to 19 in the senate. in concert with democratic gov. ralph northam, the caucus is empowered to enact sweeping change.
robinson drew attention to her bill with an afternoon news conference organized by equality virginia, the lgbt rights group that is marking its 30th year. two polls commissioned by equality virginia over the past year found a majority of gop primary voters in virginia say anti-lgbt discrimination should be outlawed in housing and public employment — results that line up with public polling on the topic nationwide.
while buttigieg frames his sexual orientation as part of his next-generation appeal, he finds it uncomfortable to talk about why it took him so long — until he was 33, and back from afghanistan — to accept the plain fact that i'm gay. when he spoke to axelrod for his podcast, the axe files, in march 2017, his silver tongue abandoned him as he tried to explain. if willpower alone could make somebody straight, you know … i would've —. he didn't complete the thought but acknowledged that his struggle had something to do with his political aspirations and his desire to serve in the military while don't ask, don't tell was still in effect.
they drove through neighborhoods of bosnian refugees and met black and south asian families who had moved for better jobs. even as the city's median income continued to rise, the suburbs had become more diverse and more stratified.
gabbard also previously worked for an anti-gay-rights organization in hawaii led by her father.
in my past, i said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were hurtful to people in the lgbtq community and to their loved ones, gabbard says to the camera. i'm deeply sorry for having said them. my views have changed significantly since then, and my record in congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart.
survivors of the homes have been telling their stories on irish television, too.
nonetheless, some african americans chafed at what they regarded as mr. miller's dictatorial control over local politics. he appears to be with you, former state senator tommie broadwater jr. (d-prince george's) once told the post. if you don't know him, you'll think he's the best of buddies. but he will stab you in the back.
most recently, portman was part of the bipartisan coalition that crafted and called on president trump to sign a coronavirus relief bill. but even as far back as 2013, portman became the first sitting republican senator to publicly support same-sex marriage after his son told him he was gay.
maybe everybody has the same idea about janet reno that janet reno does. maybe everybody sees this quiet, modest, determined person who loves the law and public service. what, then, about the jokes, what about all the images of her that the popular culture has produced? after much discussion among her aides before the interview, reno declines to watch the snl videotape. but she does agree to listen to a couple of the jokes told about her. to this one, from the jay leno show: the white house christmas tree was cut down yesterday at a tree farm in north carolina. eighteen-and-a-half-foot fir. i guess the tree was driven to the white house, and then strapped to the back of janet reno, who carried it up. to this one, from bill maher's politically incorrect monologue: janet reno is really being called on the carpet. she and the fbi director are working together on this. she's saying it just seemed like a match when she went over to the fbi and all of j. edgar hoover's dresses fit perfectly. to this one, from david letterman: i have to go down to the costume shop and pick up some more shoulder pads for my janet reno outfit. i think that people are having fun, she says, listening but not laughing. they're not particularly funny. but are they not interesting? are they not telling? what about jay leno's remark that the independent counsel call was janet reno's toughest decision since boxers or briefs?
with votes still to be counted in the georgia runoff elections, democrat raphael warnock declared victory over sen. kelly loeffler (r-ga.) on jan. 6. (reverend raphael warnock youtube)
the north carolina law has some similarities to the utah law, but utah's law didn't specifically allow government officials to opt out of performing marriages. utah made it so that the state would perform marriages using willing clerks or others in the community authorized to marry people. and if a same-sex couple comes into the office for a license and no willing clerks are available, then the elected town clerk does the service.
one of the three scc judges stepped down more than a year ago, and lawmakers had been unable to agree on a replacement. the senate, in particular, has slowed the process as majority leader thomas k. norment jr. (r-james city) feuded with a handful of republicans who jumped ship last year to join democrats in voting to expand medicaid.
adverse consequences of targeting transgender youth
the israeli prime minister parodied a popular social media trend with photos of his country's border wall:
if other catholic clergy members were circumspect about sharing their views, mccloskey didn't hold back. a liberal catholic is oxymoronic, he told slate in 2002. the definition of a person who disagrees with what the catholic church is teaching is called a protestant.
-- trump was startled to hear his attorney general nominee william barr describe mueller as a close friend during his confirmation hearings. cnn's kaitlan collins, kevin liptak and jeff zeleny report: while barr said during his hearing that trump 'was interested' in hearing about the friendship, the details that emerged this week caught the president off guard, [three] sources said. he bristled at barr's description of the close relationship, complaining to aides he didn't realize how much their work overlapped or that they were so close. there is no indication trump's surprise will jeopardize the nomination, however.
acknowledging the bumps along the way, obama said he would have preferred to have had it all evolve a little more smoothly.
for two decades, leo has been on a mission to turn back the clock to a time before the u.s. supreme court routinely expanded the government's authority and endorsed new rights such as abortion and same-sex marriage. now, as president trump's unofficial judicial adviser, he told the audience at the closed-door event in february that they had to mobilize in very unprecedented ways to help finish the job.
-- the fda has decided to furlough more employees to focus its dwindling funds on drug reviews. laurie mcginley reports: with money for drug reviews rapidly diminishing as the government shutdown drags into its fourth week, fda commissioner scott gottlieb said in an interview thursday that he plans to curtail 'discretionary activities' and call for additional furloughs in areas in which workloads have been reduced due to the shutdown. 'what we are trying to do is to keep the review process continuing because of important drugs in the pipeline,' he said. yet the cost-saving measures will buy just weeks, not months, of extended life for the fda's drug-review process, gottlieb added.
surfacing judicial candidates to be appointed when conservatives are in power is just one byproduct of the society's work — and maybe not the most important one.
in 1960, student sit-ins at segregated lunch counters and restaurants were exploding across the south. that october, at one such protest in atlanta, king was arrested and jailed.
it was a clear, heroic story line: first women marched, then they organized, and then they won. they drew a direct line from the 2017 rallies, organized by women's march, to the 2018 campaign, which the women's march engaged in through rallies and voter registration drives, to the victory that created the largest class of women in congress.
-- it will be fairly sunny in washington before this weekend's expected storm. the capital weather gang forecasts: clouds and fog slowly try to dissipate, and we begin to dry out with light westerly breezes. high temperatures should make it into mid-40s, with perhaps some upper 40s slightly possible, especially south of town. clouds may increase a bit again late afternoon, but we should stay rain-free. but some schools are operating on a delay this morning because of yesterday's snow.

kaplan's close friend sharon nelles, head of litigation at sullivan & cromwell, says: if you can come at the world the way she does, you are not reined in by whether there are social constructs or boundaries. you can create your own mold. lawyers for the most part react. robbie acts.
the harder she tries to get by without calling attention to her physical appearance, the more people wonder what she's doing. some people think it makes her more authentic; others think it makes her look provincial; still others think it's a sexual signal. more likely, her demeanor is in many ways the legacy of her mother, jane wood reno. jane reno, a newspaperwoman for the old miami news, was a woman who lived large in the way that many american communities permit and washington, mostly, doesn't: she loved the outdoors, she scuba-dived and went on days-long seaside hikes and swam naked, she built the reno house with her own hands, she got stopped for drunk driving, she collected eccentric characters as family friends. she let the wind and the weather age her naturally; photos of her in later years show a woman, worn and wrinkled, full of character, full of interest. this last characteristic, this unadorned quality, this respect for one's natural face, seems to be a legacy that reno has inherited. at the same time, she notes, mother and i were different in so many ways. her mother was, to use a southern expression, a catbird; reno isn't. instead, what you see when you see her is the girl in high school who sits in the front row. the responsible one, as her sister says; the one who sat on her siblings when they misbehaved. the chemistry major, who, despite her mother's distaste for lawyers, applied to harvard law.
legal advocate shannon minter argues that after the supreme court's 2015 decision in obergefell v. hodges, which opened legal marriage rights to same-sex couples across the 50 states, anti-gay activists switched their focus to transgender issues. minter explains that conservative groups argued that marriage is, by definition, a reproductive union that ought to produce children — a theory of marriage that treats it as biologically determined rather than as a social or personal union. in the same way, he argues, this new legislation reifies a biological theory of binary sex to obscure the way these bills authorize discrimination against transgender people. in this view, the uptick in anti-trans legislation is a continuation of conservative strategies aimed at rolling back the rights of lgbtq people based on the conservative idea that there are two sexes with different, biologically determined roles.

that community now includes more than 200 student chapters at law schools, where federalists are a minority presence, but a significant one. the georgetown chapter has more than 100 members out of about 2,000 in the law school. the federalist society is one of our most active student organizations, law school dean of students mitch bailin told the society's national student symposium on campus in march. of particular impact and importance to me, they regularly, happily, engagedly partner with our student organizations across the viewpoint spectrum to ensure the widest range of ideas are explored on the issues of the most urgent consequence.

that was true even when controlling for other factors that might influence justices, including ideology, the percentage of women on the bench, whether a state ratified the federal era, and the kinds of litigation being considered. of course, these results need updating. but if we rely on these findings, we would expect that a national era would increase the likelihood that supreme court justices would apply a higher level of scrutiny to sex discrimination cases and would eradicate all sex-based classifications — treating sex the way that race is treated now.

-- huffpost, jack dorsey has no clue what he wants, by ashley feinberg: a conversation with twitter ceo jack dorsey can be incredibly disorienting. not because he's particularly clever or thought-provoking, but because he sounds like he should be. he takes long pauses before he speaks. he furrows his brow, setting you up for a considered response from the man many have called a genius. the words themselves sound like they should probably mean something, too. dorsey is just hard enough to follow that it's easy to assume that any confusion is your own fault, and that if you just listen a little more or think a little harder, whatever he's saying will finally start to make sense. whether dorsey does this all deliberately or not, the reason his impassioned defenses of twitter sound like gibberish is because they are.

neither harris nor warren will participate in a women's march event this weekend. representatives for most of the democrats seen as likely 2020 candidates said that they would not be at the events — not citing the controversy, but tacitly acknowledging that the march was no longer the sort of event they must participate in. sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) said in a short interview that she will be attending a funeral; a spokesman for sen. cory booker (d-n.j.), who attended the 2017 march in washington, said he will be traveling saturday.

but having allies on the highest court of the land is just the top layer of the federalist society's expanding sway. for one thing, there is the judicial nomination process itself. when trump was campaigning in 2016, he made the shrewd and un­or­tho­dox move of publicizing a list of 11 conservative legal stars that he promised to draw from if he got a chance to pick a supreme court justice. leonard leo, executive vice president of the federalist society, played a key role in suggesting the names, along with trump's future white house counsel, don mcgahn (also a society member), and the conservative heritage foundation. the list was expanded twice to include gorsuch, kavanaugh and others. leo took a leave from his job at the federalist society to advise the white house on the confirmation process for gorsuch and kavanaugh — reprising a role he played for the george w. bush white house in putting roberts and alito on the court.

gillibrand overhauled her political identity during this period, abandoning the conservative positions that made her popular upstate and embracing or even moving further left than the liberal consensus on guns, immigration, wall street and same-sex marriage. as the democratic party itself moved left, she staked out positions popular with the party's swelling base of liberals, a posture most evident when she called for abolishing the immigration and customs enforcement agency. she has voted against president trump's agenda more than any other senator.
the group's president, daniel casey, has worked closely with leo for years. casey receives no pay from jcn or three other nonprofits in the network that he helps to lead, tax filings show. he received more than $1.5 million in fees from the federalist society over nine years for media training through a firm based at his home in front royal, va.

leo's work to influence judicial nominations has made him a hero to some conservative activists. the esteem was evident in february at the closed-door meeting of the nonprofit council for national policy, where leo serves on the board of governors.
the next most important segment of the judiciary — the federal appeals courts — is also filling up with federalist society members: twenty-five of the 30 appeals court judges trump has appointed are or were members of the society. our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the president has outsourced his selection of judges, mcgahn quipped to a federalist society gathering in 2017. that is completely false. i've been a member of the federalist society since law school. still am. so, frankly, it seems like it's been in-sourced.

now, they are on the cover of parents magazine. a recent report from rewire.news suggests that becoming fathers is easier than it once was for gay men. but the evidence is largely anecdotal. there is no clearinghouse, for example, that reports on the clientele of private adoption and surrogacy agencies, heterosexual or otherwise, or how long couples wait to become parents. and there is still plenty of resistance to gay parents, as the petition by one million moms against the cover of shaun t and husband scott blokker in parents magazine attests.
after his clerkship, leo joined the federalist society as one of its first paid employees. but he delayed the start date to help thomas through his contentious confirmation process for the supreme court.
he paints his potential presidential campaign as a kind of blown-up version of his first run for mayor. buttigieg announced his 2011 campaign two weeks after newsweek featured south bend as one of america's dying cities. people had been promised a return of manufacturing jobs for almost half a century, buttigieg says — a little like trump in coal country. from 1902 to 1963, the city was the home of carmaker studebaker, which employed nearly 25,000 local workers at its peak, before going belly-up. the city never recovered. when he was growing up, a lot of people would still talk about the closure like it happened yesterday, he says. when i ran, we had to paint a picture of the future that did not translate into nostalgia.
if drug abuse got out of control, it can, however, be seriously questioned whether the recreational use of drugs, and certainly cannabis, is any more reprehensible than the recreational use of alcohol. if brutal things did happen in the sixties, yet there was a remarkable balance between this humanism [tolerance and rationality] and the extremes of innovation. if ever there was justification for violence, the appalling, utterly inhumane story of 'soledad brother' george jackson [of black panthers fame] provided it. some rioters were vandals, but practically every violent episode could be traced back to some stupid or brutal (often both) action by the police. many of those caught up in violent situations were intensely peace-loving . . . the student uprisings demonstrated on the one hand, the dedication, the idealism, the bravery of those who participated in them; on the other, the folly of their obedience to the great marxisant fallacy, the absurd faith that there was a promised land ready -- given sufficient protest, sufficient violence, sufficient unconventionality, sufficient vulgarity -- for the taking. lest marwick's own view of these students be in doubt, he adds: i do not mock the protesters; i salute them, recognizing that they never had a hope of success in their revolutionary aspirations. i do mock commentators since, who, looking for the revolution decreed in the marxist scriptures, have gone on and on picking over their failure, missing the real cultural revolution.
political scientists lee epstein, andrew d. martin and i examined all state-level constitutional sex-discrimination cases that reached states' top courts between 1960 and 1999, looking at both the legal standards the courts applied and how the cases were decided. we find no evidence that simply having an era directly affects how sex discrimination cases are decided — but it affects those decisions indirectly. in the united states, courts can choose the standard they will use to determine whether a law is constitutional. if a law violates a fundamental right, such as free speech or the 14th amendment, it will apply the highest standard of review, known as strict scrutiny. our research shows that having a state-level era significantly increases the likelihood that judges will apply a higher standard of law in sex discrimination cases. that leads state-level courts to rule more often in favor of the person claiming sex discrimination.
buttigieg has told me and other reporters that he's just laid back, with a talent for compartmentalizing. but gay men like buttigieg and me, who choose to stay in the closet well into adulthood, often develop the kind of strong, silent and non-demonstrative form of masculinity that we thought we had to adopt to survive, or to hide, or both. when you're in the closet, every moment of every day is a calculated performance — the way you walk, the way you talk, what you wear, the way you look at girls, the way you deal with boys, what you tell your parents about your day.
i mention that the day before, biden, on his own book tour, had proclaimed himself the most qualified person in the country to be president. buttigieg laughs. so was hillary, he says. game on.

we've got over 10,000 individual donations, and a lot of that is from the church of latter day saints. we've also got muslims coming on board and conservative jewish support--the kinds of people that normally don't sit together in a room and talk. one strategy of the initiative's opponents is to hang the measure around the neck of its sponsor, by suggesting that sen. knight is fixated on homosexuality for personal reasons having to do with his estranged son and dead brother. the no on knight group also is reminding visitors to its web site that in 1993, when he had been recently elected to the california assembly, knight distributed a poem to fellow gop members that many considered racist and inflammatory. the poem was, in essence, about how illegal immigrants from mexico were lazy abusers of this country's welfare state. stutzman, spokesman for the marriage measure, describes all this as a red herring and says that his opponents' strategy is that they don't want to talk about the initiative, so they go after the conservative white guy who introduced it. © 1999 the washington post company back to the top
his conservative values stood out. when a classmate protesting apartheid in south africa threw a chocolate cream pie into the face of the university's president, leo expressed outrage in a letter to the student newspaper. although some will dismiss tuesday as only a pie-throwing incident, it is representative of a more hostile form of expression that has become more common, he wrote.

-- giuliani attempted to clean up his comments that he cannot say with certainty that people besides trump on the 2016 campaign did not collude with russia. he released a statement saying he has no knowledge of any collusion by any of the thousands of people who worked on the campaign. trump's attorney added in an interview with the post: with regard to the president, he was not involved in any collusion in any way, and he has no knowledge of any collusion. … the rest i can't be responsible for, except i can tell you the state of my knowledge, which is that i have no knowledge that anyone on the campaign illegally colluded with the russians. (philip rucker)
in 2015, legislatures suddenly began paying a great deal of attention to transgender issues. although lawmakers introduced only two bills using the word transgender in 2014, that increased to nine in 2015, 22 in 2016, 26 in 2017, and 15 in 2018. the vast majority of these bills outlined some kind of ban against transgender people using sex-segregated public facilities, primarily bathrooms. for instance, north carolina's controversial hb2 overturned local transgender rights ordinances and banned transgender-identified people from using public restrooms corresponding to their gender identification unless their birth certificates were updated.
yet buttigieg did not make the trailblazing nature of his campaign central to his pitch, and it often got lost in the realities of day-to-day campaigning. not until buttigieg won the iowa caucuses did interviewers begin asking him more directly about america's readiness for a gay president and what his candidacy might mean to gay americans.
what's his age again? this came up again and again: biden would be the oldest nominee of any major party, and his nomination would set up a contest of two men in their late 70s, with implications that biden's supporters have not seriously processed.
the wisconsin primary falls in the middle of the nominating process, usually boiling down to a do-or-die choice between two candidates. it's highly unlikely that the ballot, next year, will include every name on this list. what's interesting is how much room for growth there could be for lesser-known candidates. more than 90 percent of democrats start with opinions of biden and sanders and 70 percent start with an opinion of warren. a majority of wisconsin democrats have no opinion, right now, on the rest of that field.
when myrick, who attends a southern baptist church, raised her discomfort with performing a same-sex ceremony, her supervisor suggested she could remove her from the duties of performing marriages altogether. however, a higher-level supervisor said her schedule could not be adjusted to excuse her from marriage duties.

-- the antiabortion march for life will be held today on the mall. julie zauzmer reports: the march, which draws thousands of people annually, many of them youthful participants bused in from catholic and other religious schools across the country, will also feature democrats this year. … but some liberal-leaning antiabortion activists criticize the march for life for alienating democrats by embracing polarizing figures, from the president and vice president to this year's featured speaker, ben shapiro, a popular conservative commentator.

as the post's marissa j. lang has reported, a number of marches that never relied on women's march inc. for support have issued statements saying they have nothing to do with sarsour's group. the democratic national committee and nearly 300 other organizations that endorsed the 2017 march are no longer affiliated with it. few actual or potential democratic 2020 candidates are planning to wade into the crowds.
after the kerry campaign, buttigieg went back to washington for six months, biding his time before the rhodes scholarship kicked in. when he graduated from oxford, he decided to give the business world a try and took a job at mckinsey, the prestigious global consulting firm. i knew that i really didn't understand the way the world worked, he says. how do people make money, operate and move around the world? how does this stuff work?
duncan had no idea he'd stepped into a minefield. he hadn't watched the sunday talk shows and missed the ensuing brouhaha. reflecting later, duncan said he was pleased at the way he answered the unexpected question. like biden, he'd spoken from the heart. i did it without thinking, he said. i was actually very relieved that i just told the truth. he didn't want to sound like a washington politician who equivocated or dodged an issue. that's not who i wanted to be, he said.
one of its members, lisa figueroa, a short dark-haired girl with a pierced nose, introduces reno with a moving speech in which she tells the saatchi & saatchi execs about how she grew up surrounded by drugs, how her father drank, how she started smoking pot, how under the influence she got pregnant, how she dropped out of school, how she has been straight for three years, how janet reno proved to me and all the teenage women in the country that i can do anything and being a woman won't hold me down . . . she has proven once again that women got it going on! the attorney general speaks, offering statistics to counter stereotypes (if you look at juveniles as a whole, it is only one-half of one percent that are arrested for any violent crime in a given year), and leaves, as she entered, to a standing ovation. an hour later, on the top floor of the saatchi & saatchi building, lisa figueroa is watching the snl skit and seeing, with amazement, that in it the attorney general of the united states is played by a man wearing a nightgown. oh no! she says with a wail. that's wrong! it is! it's like me taking lisa, says her friend cory kadamani, also of youth force, and taking out her mind and her voice, and her attitude, and saying what i think she is, based on looking at her.
the nine house managers walked the article to the senate last night, setting in motion trump's second impeachment trial scheduled to begin february 9th.
nobody's entitled to the right to insult someone or deny someone to their face, said ira lupu, a law professor emeritus at george washington university who specializes in the first amendment. people have a right to be accommodated in the workplace so long as there's [no] harm to the people being served.
for the past three years, government ministries have been running on autopilot. but now the dup, sinn fein and the three other, smaller parties in the executive will have to deal with the backlog of neglected issues. they face pressure to reform the health care, education and welfare systems; invest in infrastructure and public services; address policing issues leftover from the troubles; and devise new funding schemes to pay for all of this, possibly by taxing water. these mundane politics of governing are all complicated by the fact that the parties have multiple, competing agendas and little experience of trust or cooperation.
she asked volunteers to knock on doors. if they did not want to knock on doors, she asked them to make phone calls. if they did not feel comfortable making phone calls, they could write postcards. if not postcards, she'd ask volunteers to drive so others could knock on doors.
that night also provided a moment of trailblazing, when buttigieg joked with cnn host jake tapper that he and his husband seemed to disagree on how to pronounce his last name. an openly gay presidential candidate had talked about his husband on national television as if it were nothing.
in a statement, gabbard spokeswoman lauren mcilvaine said gabbard will always fight for religious freedom and oppose religious bigotry — no matter where it comes from or to whom it's directed.
• make two years of community college tuition-free for all, and all public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose family incomes are below $125,000.
her questions in high-profile senate hearings flustered attorney general nominee jeff sessions, stumped supreme court nominee brett m. kavanaugh and left another attorney general nominee, william p. barr, stumbling for words.
then again, for now there is still the pandemic. there is still racial injustice. there is still a desperately broken health-care system ineffectively serving desperate people.
reminding them of their mothers' admonition (if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all …'') seems a bit much. i notice that gentlemen who shave, or add, facial hair are often subjected to the same insensitive observations. any thoughts on how best to respond?
but soon enough he realized his role in the rising storm. now both biden and duncan inadvertently had pressured the president on same-sex marriage. it may have caused short-term pain, duncan observed. but i knew where the president's heart was on this. you know, he hadn't said it publicly, but i knew down deep exactly what he thought. frankly i think the vice president and i actually accelerated getting him to where his heart was.
i really do believe with all my heart that a statutory agency is one that can be — i mean, we defer to what you want. that's the job of a judge. the general assembly tells us what the priorities are, what the policies are, and then we apply the facts that are presented to us, west said.
yet that ignores a central facet of gillibrand's policy changes: she has swung left in line with and occasionally ahead of democratic voters, the sort of moves voters typically reward, not punish. the share of democrats who want stricter gun laws has risen by 20 points since she embraced that view in 2009. what were once liberal views on immigration and lgbt rights have become mainstream.
jonathan tasini, a labor activist and supporter of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) who weighed a primary challenge against gillibrand in 2010, said the democratic left should not reflexively turn its back on candidates who have changed positions.
steven universe was set in fictitious beach city, partly inspired by the delaware shores that the sugar siblings visited as kids. but it was real-life events that occurred in rebecca sugar's 20s that especially affected the trajectory of the series.
we balance our budgets, we save for a rainy day, and then we get handed this shutdown! de blasio said.
sugar's sense of the business was partly formed by what she saw during her senior year in high school, when a cultural controversy erupted in 2005 over pbs's partly animated arthur spinoff postcards from buster. an episode titled sugartime! showed real-life vermont families, including two lesbian couples. secretary of education margaret spellings decried the episode as inappropriate for children's programming and a misuse of public funding — a denouncement that sugar calls absurd.
the party is made up of the people. it's the people first. and i think as people, we are understanding issues more and more because the information, the access to the details is readily available to us every single day, said deidre dejear, a longtime voting rights advocate in des moines who was heartened to see voter suppression taken seriously during the midterm elections. and i think that's what's helping to shape the party is the people who are part of it — and i think that's how it's supposed to be.
the president and his aides had not yet sorted out their strategy. on monday, press secretary jay carney gave an uncomfortable briefing at the white house where his reply to reporters' questions was a monotonous: i have no update on the president's personal views.
the whole thing seemed like a lark to seasoned political analysts; buttigieg was 37, barely old enough to be president, and he had never even held statewide office. that changed on march 10, when buttigieg took the stage for his first nationally televised town hall on cnn. within the buttigieg campaign, staffers later referred to it simply as the cnn town hall, although he had since conducted many others.
buttigieg struggled to win support from black voters, a key pillar of the democratic coalition and a vulnerability that was emphasized saturday in south carolina, where he finished fourth.
the federalist society's leonard leo, having helped create a list of supreme court candidates, is one of trump's judge whisperers.
he was 11 when his maternal grandmother took him on a life-altering six-month world tour.
the democratic party's biggest successes in those years came in a part of the state that was overwhelmingly white, well educated and affluent — home to some of the fastest-growing cities in the united states.
while others might see his age and inexperience as fatal liabilities, buttigieg recognizes that the path to the white house often evolves. it's actually been a very long time since democrats recaptured power without a candidate who didn't represent a departure from political norms: the young, catholic jfk; the up-from-nowhere southerner jimmy carter; the new democrat bill clinton; and barack obama, the african american just a few years removed from being an illinois state senator.
old playboy was a lifestyle bible, buzzfeed culture writer anne helen petersen jabbed. current playboy is a caricature of itself.
along the way, younger, more liberal democrats progressives often saw him as a compromise. they felt he relied too much on high-dollar fundraisers to be trusted to change the system. they watched him struggle to amass minority support. and they felt his medicare for all who want it plan, his sliding scale for college tuition relief, and his relatively less expensive plan to combat climate change didn't go far enough.
leo's remarks: 'we stand at the threshold' the washington post obtained audio of leonard leo speaking to members of the council for national policy. listen (2:03)
men and women talk of love, can anyone describe it? can any one give the reason why one person loves another to the exclusion of every one else. . . . i know many ladies, who are amiable kind, talented and refined, all that a man can wish, and yet i cannot love them or do not love them as i love you, and they may be like you, but to me they are different. . . . so i say reason or no reason, some undefinable force attracts me to you, and i have no means of resisting it and would not if i had.
peter, among others, saw bush v. gore and recognized that we'd been snookered, caroline fredrickson, president of the acs, told me. the left had been sleeping on its laurels, still living in the warren court and all of the sudden we were going to have the roberts court. and so the idea was to found an organization that would help organize progressive lawyers to protect the core fundamental values that we see in the constitution.
like others, chang and estey went to therapy in preparation for becoming fathers. therapy helped us clarify our thoughts, and any holdovers from our childhoods. it helped us to think about how we might navigate two busy careers, and the division of labor, chang said.
through persistent mobilization, female activists persuaded public officials and fellow citizens that the prohibition on abortion had failed — and that only legal access could address the serious public health crisis afflicting argentine women, primarily those who are poor.
i'm sorry, i wanted to guest star on 'the goldbergs,' and i got this.
-- here's why these kinds of stories matter a great deal: impressions of most democratic candidates are both soft and fluid. an npr-pbs-marist poll released yesterday underscored just how unknown most of the 2020 candidates are at the grass-roots level. the national survey asked democrats and democratic-leaning independents if they have a favorable or unfavorable impression of 10 likely candidates. with the exceptions of joe biden, sanders and, to a lesser extent, elizabeth warren, rank-and-file progressives don't have strong impressions of the people that washington insiders are buzzing about. for example, 22 percent of those surveyed have a positive view of gillibrand, 14 percent have a negative view, and 65 percent either have never heard of her or don't know enough to offer an opinion. the never-heard-of, or unsure, number was 49 percent for cory booker, 52 percent for beto o'rourke, 54 percent for harris, 71 percent for amy klobuchar and 72 percent for julián castro. the pollsters didn't event test gabbard.
they should have broken his legs, meklat wrote, that son of a whore.
the pandemic president: biden said he believes the united states will have made significant progress toward achieving herd immunity by summer and reiterated his administration is aiming to have 100 million vaccinations administered within the first 100 days of his presidency, felicia sonmez reports.
sugar says that during the run of steven universe, she also began seeing a therapist who helped her understand the lasting emotional and physical effects of an assault she had endured in her early 20s — insights into her own anxiety that she says informed the latter half of the show.
it's also a menschy practice. what's unusual is the sheer amount of contact she has with her clients, karlan says. kaplan celebrated passover with windsor, who died in 2017. she's available at all hours for phone consultations. gifts of food are constant. she sent heard a box of chicken soup, lox and bagels.
the guide recommends several policy steps. one requires schools to notify parents if their child expresses a different identity at school — a vague directive that aims at the fact students often come out as transgender, lesbian or gay to school counselors before they tell their families. another suggests girls' physical safety and athletic opportunities can only be ensured if teams are separated by sex rather than gender identity. the latter argues for limiting participation in sports on the basis of sex assigned at birth, which would formally exclude transgender boys and girls from school sports.
i don't think ice today is working as intended. . . . i believe that it has become a deportation force, and i think you should separate the criminal justice from the immigration issues, gillibrand said on cnn's cuomo prime time.
either way, it seems i'm stuck in a tidal wave of drama. is there a way i can at least lessen the storm?
the changes have touched off extreme responses in some gop quarters, from the massive pro-gun rally that shut down richmond streets last month to the suggestion that liberal places such as arlington and alexandria should rejoin the district of columbia and rural red counties should secede to west virginia.
• increase the number of employment-based visas beyond the current annual cap of 140,000.
the house approved a bill allowing collective bargaining for public employees, but carved out exceptions for legislative aides as well as for employees of hundreds of constitutional offices around the state: sheriffs, commissioners of the revenue, treasurers, commonwealth's attorneys and circuit court clerks. virginia is one of only three states, along with north carolina and south carolina, that forbid collective bargaining for the public sector.
maternity and paternity leave in the united states are far from ideal. for families with two dads, the decision to take paternity leave is often made more difficult by their unusual situation.
she hadn't taken much stock of her country, either. republicans were sweeping state houses and blocking obama's agenda in washington. young african americans had grown so exhausted with police violence that they were taking to the streets to assert that their lives, too, had value.
i think it's important to know when you're wrong and to do what's right. and i will do what's right, and i will fight for what's right, and i don't back down from those fights, she said wednesday at a news conference in troy, n.y.
placing hq2 in one of these states would not only be morally wrong, but also inconsistent with your stated values. we are asking you to only consider states that would protect your lgbtq workers, their families, and your customers, the group writes in the letter, a draft of which was obtained by the post.
the profound portrayal of longing caused by the distance between the two lovers makes the letter compelling, bair said.
biden may yet have to turn to a partisan procedure known as budget reconciliation if he can't get republican support (which looks unlikely) for his relief package. that would allow him to ram it through with 50 votes.
the anchors then cut to roberts stationed after the interview in front of the white house. she provided a little background on the week then obama came on the screen, his voice calm and reflective, quite in contrast to the hysterics of the past three days: i have to tell you, as i've said, i've — i've been going through an evolution on this issue. i've always been adamant that gay and lesbian americans should be treated fairly and equally. … i've stood on the side of broader equality for the lgbt community. and i had hesitated on gay marriage — in part, because i thought civil unions would be sufficient. … but i have to tell you that over the course of several years, as i talk to friends and family and neighbors. when i think about members of my own staff who are incredibly committed, in monogamous relationships — same-sex relationships — who are raising kids together. when i think about those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained … because they're not able to commit themselves in a marriage. at a certain point, i've just concluded that, for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same-sex couples should be able to get married.
once students graduate, they can pick from more than 90 lawyers chapters around the country. kaytlin roholt graduated from the university of pennsylvania law school in 2014, clerked for two federal judges, served as a special counsel to senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley during the gorsuch nomination, and now practices at jones day and is a member of the steering committee of the federalist society's d.c. chapter for young lawyers. regardless of where i am, i know that a federalist society event is a place where i can go to sort of stay current in the legal issues, to continue learning while practicing, she told me. what we really try to do on the young lawyers chapter is create spaces for people to engage with these issues that they wouldn't really be able to do during their day-to-day life as a lawyer. panel organizers try to include advocates of liberal perspectives so ideas get a good workout. together, the student and lawyers chapters put on about 1,500 programs a year.
and if a personal experience does bring a specific experience of suffering into focus, have the humility to outsource your ideas about what needs to be done to experts and activists who have thought and cared about the terrible thing for longer than you have.
buttigieg's departure may help add some clarity to a democratic presidential field that at one point included more than two dozen candidates, including an array of senators and governors, but has dwindled to just a handful.
at the federalist society, leo took a leading role in the conservative legal movement, part of a burgeoning effort to counter the influence of the 1960s and liberals on education, law and politics.
i've been moved to tears at so many [fan] cons by kids who are there with parents, sugar says of families who have bonded over her show's representation of marginalized groups. that's something that so many people have been denied for so, so long.
gillibrand has gone against her own party on a number of matters related to women. she crossed fellow democrats with her bipartisan push to remove the adjudication of military sexual assault cases from the chain of command. the plan failed to advance to a final senate vote in march 2014.
later, in response to written questions about the interlocking nonprofits, leo described the network as an effective and highly successful judicial coalition that's organized just about the same as the left's, except that their coalition is significantly bigger and better funded.
the two women were representative of the people who were fueling the activism in ankeny: young professionals and mothers with older children. they were horrified most by what they saw as the trump administration's poor treatment of the vulnerable — separating immigrant families, restricting food stamps, banning refugees — and were desperate to post some wins. so they decided to play hard.

-- programming note: in honor of martin luther king jr., we will not publish on monday.
if the republicans said we are ending same-sex marriage, but we promise democrats a vote later; or we approve of oil drilling in every national park, but you'll have a vote later — do you think the democrats would say yes? this shows me that when it comes to immigrants, latinos and their families, democrats are still not willing to go to the mat to allow people in my community to live in our country legally, said gutierrez, one of capitol hill's most vocal advocates for dreamers, in a statement.
-- given the conservative bent of marino's district, democrats don't expect to flip the seat in a special election. from david weigel: the words 'special election' and 'pennsylvania' are enough to induce terror in republicans after their disastrous 2018 performance in the state. the year began with them losing a once-safe district to rep. conor lamb (d) and ended with them getting blown out statewide while dropping three more seats — and holding three more by single digits. but it would take a true political disaster for marino's 12th congressional district to become competitive. as drawn by a panel of judges last year, it covers a large rural swath of north and central pennsylvania that was never very friendly to democrats and has grown downright inhospitable.
but are there others it might upset? anybody else at the breakfast table? that person hiding behind a newspaper or tablet counts, as there could still be a peek. you would be safer drinking that last bit when you take the bowl into the kitchen.

there's a lot of publicity around the democrats, but we live in a great community, and it hasn't changed that much, zaun said in an interview. i'm up for reelection this year, and i'm not too worried.
some of the judges were treated as rock stars, especially amy coney barrett, named by trump to the 7th circuit. more than one convention speaker got a rise out of audiences by recalling democratic sen. dianne feinstein's gaffe of telling the catholic barrett during her confirmation hearing that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern. the lunchtime panel on stare decisis (the legal doctrine that calls for courts to respect precedent) was full — and several attendees told me it wasn't the topic that drew them, it was the presence of barrett moderating the panel. judge, welcome back to washington — and i hope you'll come back for good sometime soon! one of the panelists, kannon shanmugam, an appellate advocate and partner at williams & connolly, said to barrett, drawing cheers from the audience.
don't expect a swift reversal of trump's america first policy. biden pledged on his campaign website, there is no going back to business as usual on trade.
in late june, gillibrand denounced ice as a deportation force and joined calls by liberal activists to abolish it. she was the first u.s. senator to take the position, and at the time, her language put her further to the left than her potential democratic presidential rivals. abolishing ice and replacing it with a different agency is now a position shared by much of the field.
but many racial justice activists felt harris did not take advantage of her groundbreaking role as the first woman of color to serve as attorney general of california. they assert that when harris had unprecedented power, she did not push hard enough to overhaul a criminal justice system long tougher on racial minorities.
helena metzger, a longtime volunteer and former board member at the catholic information center, said she was surprised when mccloskey left and shocked when she found out the reason a few years later from another opus dei priest.
and some house democrats raised the possibility of impeachment:
ms. st. james said she enrolled in law school in part to appeal her conviction, which was ultimately overturned. by her account, she began taking money for sex to pay her tuition. she did not complete law school and said that at various points she earned income by working as a process server, private detective, car parker, restaurant hostess and deckhand on a dinner-cruise boat.
he also referred to the pioneering nature of his run, saying, we sent a message to every kid out there wondering if whatever marks them out as different means they are somehow destined to be less than. [they saw] that someone who once felt that exact same way can become a leading american presidential candidate — with his husband at his side.

in birmingham, warnock was ordained by the rev. john t. porter, a pulpit assistant of king's at dexter avenue baptist church in montgomery, ala. in harlem, n.y., warnock was assistant pastor at abyssinian baptist church, where king once spoke to an interracial clergy group.
political analyst david axelrod recalled hearing almost immediately from two donors asking how they could get in touch with buttigieg. by the end of the month, democratic megadonor susie tompkins buell had agreed to host a fundraiser for buttigieg.
to all the 'dreamers' watching today: don't give up, he said on the senate floor. i know your lives are hanging in the balance.
i was just thinking, this can't be happening. am i crazy, this can't be happening, she remembered. he knew what buttons to push and then just let me go and glided serenely in his cassock to his desk and asked, 'when would you like to make the next appointment?'
one major area that has seen little public action so far is the state's two-year, $135 billion budget, which is on a different schedule than other types of bills. lawmakers have proposed hundreds of amendments to the spending plan proposed by northam, but the measures are making their way through committees and have yet to get to the floor.
at a time when trump and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell are rapidly reshaping federal courts by installing conservative judges and supreme court justices, few people outside government have more influence over judicial appointments now than leo.
the president's shift on same-sex marriage was promptly sucked into the journalistic maw — reported, debated, discussed in print, online and on television. nbc broke into its regular programming, running its competitor's scoop. cnn also rushed onto the air with its breaking news logo accompanied by a sizzling sound and wolf blitzer crying out, truly historic and potentially watershed moment. … with the election less than six months away, the political implications are enormous.
you have to imagine that the women your brother chooses must have some awareness of his womanizing, because — presumably — he is cheating on someone else when he takes up with them.
the two catholic nonprofits launched a third organization called catholic voices. its stated mission was to train catholic lay members to advocate for religious and conservative causes, some of whom later wrote letters for publication in major newspapers condemning the affordable care act and roe v. wade, the 1973 supreme court decision that made abortion legal.
dear miss manners: i am at a loss to come up with a polite reply to a rather common observation. friends and acquaintances who have not seen me in a while seem to feel compelled to tell me that your hair is long.''
bezos has been an ardent defender of gay rights for years. he and his wife, mackenzie, donated $2.5 million in support of same-sex marriage in washington state in 2012, and he received a national equality award last year from the human rights campaign, a prominent lgbt advocacy group.
what made biden so appealing — that on the public stage he was more heart than sense — also made him infuriating. in his most authentic moments, the polished senior politician was not much different from the impulsive, sometimes reckless, schoolboy he once was. back in scranton, pa., at age 8 or 9, joey accepted a dare from a friend to run under a dump truck as it moved slowly back and forth at a construction site. the friend never thought joey would do it, but young biden was fearless. the dump truck was loaded to the gills and backing up — not too fast — and joey was small, wrote richard ben cramer in what it takes, his 1992 book on presidential politics, and he ran under the truck from the side, between the front and back wheels … then let the front axle pass over him. if it touched him, he was finished — marmalade — but joey was quick. the front wheels missed him clean. in his portrait of biden's abortive run for the presidency in 1988, cramer saw the child in the adult: joe biden had balls. lots of times, more balls than sense.
i'm running because of los angeles — if i run, garcetti said at a thursday news conference. i'm running because i can accelerate [the work we're doing] on homelessness. i'm running because i can accelerate the work we're doing on the environment. it would be a positive thing for my city.
in 2015, north carolina passed a law that allows magistrates (who work as lay judges) to opt out of performing all marriages based on a sincerely held religious objection. the law requires counties to make other magistrates available to handle marriage licenses and same-sex weddings if they have recusals.
the station aired mr. miller's comments, causing a furor that dogged him for decades. mr. miller cited the incident as his sole political regret.
in 2014, after same-sex marriage was legalized in north carolina, gayle myrick resigned from her job as a magistrate in the state because she believed that performing civil marriages for same-sex couples went against her faith.
yet kaplan remained in the closet until law school graduation.

as president, obama now owned the issue. if biden had stolen his thunder briefly, the vice president now receded into the background. by speaking up, biden had thrown a sharp spotlight on the civil rights of gays. but now the accolades were all obama's. it has always taken strong national leadership to expand equal rights in this country, the new york times wrote, and it has long been obvious that marriage rights are no exception. president obama offered some of that leadership on wednesday.
mccloskey harnessed that entrepreneurial spirit to persuade people, mostly men, to become catholics. in new york in 1997, he converted kudlow, who was recovering from addiction. mark belnick, a former general counsel of tyco international, who described mccloskey as a great friend in a new york magazine article, soon followed. they would be among the first in a long line of high-profile conversions that mccloskey facilitated.

but then they heard about agencies in mumbai and delhi that were actively advertising to gay couples in the u.s. and europe. they were able to offer the matching processes and medical lab and fertility process — and to do it at about a quarter of the cost of the u.s., depew said. that would make it possible to both have a child and buy a house for their family in san francisco.
-- treasury secretary steve mnuchin refused a request to testify before congress on how the shutdown will affect tax season. reuters reports: in a letter to house ways and means committee chairman richard neal, the treasury department offered to send senior officials 'who are most knowledgeable' about the department's plans during the shutdown. … neal responded sharply to mnuchin's refusal to appear. 'with more than 70,000 treasury employees furloughed and missing paychecks, i strongly believe secretary mnuchin himself should appear before our committee and answer members' questions,' neal said in a statement after mnuchin declined the invitation to appear on jan. 24.
on gun rights, for example, gillibrand told maddow that her eyes were opened as soon as she began talking to her new constituents in new york city. i traveled to brooklyn, and i met with a family who had just lost their daughter, she said. i just knew i was wrong.
you progress, he said. we always call ourselves progressives because you can kind of change your mind about some things if you want to learn more about what actually works.
he'd endorsed hillary clinton after her nomination in 2016, as any aspiring party leader must, but he clearly won't be writing any laudatory essays about her campaign. i organized a union hall event for her in south bend, he says, and shakes his head. you could just tell the enthusiasm wasn't there. the problem, he says, was partly that the stakes seemed too low. we need a bigger scope of ambition for people to rally around. a return to the clinton and obama style of centrist incrementalism, he says, will invite disaster just as surely in 2020. change is something we need to face with clear eyes. it's scary, but it's also exciting.
harris goes out of her way to speak the names and ideas of those who came before her — not the generations of men who reached the vice presidency, but the generations of women who fought so someone like her could join them some day.
conor gaughan, manager of the no gay no way campaign, said the search for a second headquarters — the biggest economic development prize in decades — is so consequential that it could become a model for other companies' choices.

raised in a privileged business family, mr. wofford attracted national media attention as a teenager during world war ii. he helped launch the student federalists group, an organization that sought to unite the world's democracies in a battle against fascism and to keep the postwar peace.
my brother and sister-in-law divide the work day into two four-hour shifts, taking turns working with their 18-month-old baby, taking calls with him on their hips, feeding him lunch during zoom calls, stepping away from their laptops to handle tantrums. i coo to my nephew over facetime, and when we hang up, i sigh with gratitude that that's not my life right now.
-- but many interpreted giuliani's original comments as a warning: it's everyone for themselves, as politico's darren samuelsohn writes. 'ya think!!!' one former trump campaign official wrote ... when asked if giuliani was trying to protect the president at the expense of everyone who worked for him. … the sniping can have long-term legal consequences, and the president and his former aides have used press interviews, social media posts and court filings to take shots at each other in the interest of protecting themselves and their reputations.
yellen, 74, will now play a key role advancing biden's economic agenda, starting with an ambitious $1.9 trillion economic relief package that is already facing resistance from gop lawmakers, the wall street journal's kate davidson reports.
in early interviews and campaign speeches, buttigieg was fond of saying he was the only left-handed, maltese-american, episcopalian, gay millennial war veteran in the race — a tongue-in-cheek way of condensing his biography but also of introducing himself to the public.
a hallmark of kaplan hecker & fink is crafting complaints in layman's language that packs a wallop. the mary trump brief is a doozy. for donald j. trump, his sister maryanne, and their late brother robert, fraud was not just the family business — it was a way of life, the complaint begins, before alleging three duplicitous schemes, the grift, the devaluing and the squeeze-out.
conventional practice used to be that local elections were strictly nonpartisan affairs. no more. in 2018 and 2019, the polk county group dispatched fliers to registered democrats that showed the name and picture of every person in their party running for office, from the congress to the school board.
with the #metoo movement, support for the era surged. some observers hope ratification would strengthen legal protections against violence against women. this is unlikely. the constitution — and the rights and equality that it guarantees — applies only to what the government does, not to private actors. laws that discriminate against women are unconstitutional, but the constitution does not protect citizens from harms committed by private individuals or organizations. and in most domestic and sexual violence, individuals' wrongs are the main concern. as i argue in defying convention: u.s. resistance to the u.n. treaty on women's rights, this means that an era would not provide a constitutional right to protection against intimate-partner violence.
there was a brashness about him that i always associated with the wall street ethos, the rev. john paul wauck, an opus dei priest who knew mccloskey, wrote in an email. you could say that, as a priest, he maintained an entrepreneurial attitude. for some, this was off-putting; for others, it was, i'd say, invigorating and even entertaining.
she carries the weight of being the first, the promise and peril of being different. she will be dodging the vitriol of those seeking to derail her future ambitions, while shouldering the expectations of those who hope for her to rise even higher.
as soon as we've broken free of bottlenecks, buttigieg starts searching the side of the highway for a lunch spot. south of fredericksburg, he spots a low-slung, ramshackle series of structures: hey, there's two things i've never seen paired: restaurant and thrift shop. in a split second, he's making a quick swerve left. let's check it out! he says, as mckenna lets out a little groan.
rob depew of san francisco experienced the nicu as a new father as well, but in india. depew said when he and his co-parent david augustine began researching surrogacy options in 2007, they learned the average budget for working with a surrogate in the united states was $150,000.
still, buttigieg doesn't much care for being identified primarily as the first gay anything. millennials are supposed to be obsessed with identity politics, but buttigieg thinks that democrats make a serious mistake when they slice-and-dice their message to appeal to particular identities. along the way, the party fell into this pattern of thinking we should have a message for each constituency, he says. but the reality is that people care about issues that aren't 'their' issues, quote unquote. elderly residents care about education. suburban women care about racial justice. young people care about social programs for the elderly.
colton: you say, let's make a toast to . . .'
he had more political contacts at 18 years old than i've ever had any time i've been alive, thomas farrington, who worked alongside mr. miller in the young democrats in the 1970s, once told the washington post.
leonard leo's work in the nonprofit world has proved lucrative.
it has been replaced by confidence — whether real or mistaken — that a more liberal and populist democratic party can form a majority out of voters who either support the sweeping changes candidates have proposed or will vote for anyone other than president trump.
heart. i am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings. overwhelmed with grief, every fibre of my frame distended ­beyond its natural powers to bear, i would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no more to feel or to fear.
the measures would empower the state lottery to oversee casino gambling, but they differ on many details, including the amount of tax revenue that would come back to the state and localities. both chambers on monday also approved versions of a bill that would allow sports betting and the online purchase of lottery tickets.
that same year, she was the first senator to call for the resignation of sen. al franken (d-minn.) after he was accused by eight women of groping or forcible kissing. dozens of colleagues followed; franken, who denied some allegations and said he remembered other encounters very differently, said the next day that he would leave the senate.
as the nation spent 2½ centuries growing increasingly multicultural, its leaders remained startlingly homogeneous, resembling a smaller and smaller slice of its population. when kamala d. harris raises her hand on the steps of the capitol on jan. 20, all that will change.
i will stand up for what i believe in, especially when it's hard, gillibrand said wednesday. with sen. franken, it's sad for many people, but after eight allegations of sexual harassment and groping, credible allegations at the time, i just couldn't stay silent. my job was not to stay silent. i couldn't defend it. . . . if some wealthy individuals — that makes them angry, that's on them, she said.
among the flash points in the state's turn to the right has been immigration, an issue that alienated some iowans, particularly white voters without college degrees, from the democratic party.
in any other city in america, the photo opportunities alone would ruin a political career, a washington post reporter wrote in 1996, describing that year's attendees as clad in attire largely constructed of leather thongs and neoprene, with lots of cutouts.
the question is whether voters let him play by a different set of rules or not, said one operative. i hear people bring anita hill up a lot, so it'll be interesting to see how much apologizing he has to do. he does not start in a good position on women's rights. but he's in a better position to explain it than someone democrats have never heard of.

the parties will also have to deal with the politically vexed question of language politics — specifically, the status of irish (a gaelic language) and ulster scots (a scots dialect that is related to english) as official languages. although lithuanian and polish are, after english, the most common first languages spoken in primary schools, the irish and ulster scots languages are important symbols of culture and identity for nationalist/catholic and unionist/protestant identities respectively. indeed, the dup's refusal to back the irish language act, which would have recognized the irish language as an official language in northern ireland, was almost as central as the public works scandal was to the 2017 collapse of government.
i'm glad too! he says, and does the politician thing he has perfected despite his innate shyness: he trains his full attention on everyone in turn, peppering them with questions about their lives, the power outages, the poll numbers, how folks are responding when they come knocking, the provenance of this bland office suite. what did this place used to be before the campaign? he asks.
the students announced a national symposium to be held at yale in the spring of 1982. word spread ahead of the conference, and so many letters came from students at other schools asking how to start a chapter that otis says she and another co-founder quickly drafted a guide. daniel kelly was a senior at the college of the holy cross and applying to law school when he heard about it. thrilled at the prospect, he and some friends drove 100 miles from worcester, mass., to new haven, conn., and slept on the floor of a friend's yale dorm. they were saying something that seemed completely plain sense and true to us, kelly recalls, which is when you look at the constitution, you should look at the way the framers wrote it and interpret it as best you can based upon the intention of the framers. kelly is now head of the federalist society lawyers chapter in boston, where, in late october, sessions gave one of his last speeches as attorney general.

in a letter dated feb. 19, 1855, stone wrote:
the standard parents are held to in this country — that they should buck up and get by without the help of paid leave, subsidized child care, and continuous public health insurance, or they shouldn't have had kids — is something we've both fought against throughout our careers. we knew we could never be fully insulated from crisis, and that's an unrealistic bar to meet to responsibly have children. for our own sake, we wanted to be prepared financially and in jobs that would support us, especially through those early years.
in the run-up to the 2008 caucuses, most democrats talked carefully about immigration, stopped short of endorsing same-sex marriage and assured gun owners that no one would challenge their second amendment rights. tommy vietor, who traveled with obama as his iowa press secretary, recalled that even at democratic events, the candidate was asked about the specter of immigrants taking american jobs.
they started reading clubs, drinking clubs, women's groups. deshara bohanna, who would become the first black woman on ankeny's school board, started a meetup group to discuss racism and diversity.
but it's true that other young minorities have been scrutinized out of public life. a prime example is mennel ibtissem, a 22-year-old singer who dazzled with a rendition of leonard cohen's hallelujah on france's version of the voice competition. but viewers scrolled through her social media history and found comments that appeared to excuse the july 2016 terrorist attack in nice, when a man drove a truck into a crowded promenade. under pressure, ibtissem withdrew from the competition.
by his own account, mr. miller's crowning achievement was the legalization of casino gambling and the subsequent launch of gaming in prince george's, despite fierce opposition from church leaders and civic groups. in a show of political gamesmanship, mr. miller forced two special sessions of the assembly, after which the fate of what became the mgm casino at national harbor was left to voters to decide in a 2012 referendum. it passed by 100,000 votes.
often — always — i say that i'm sorry. because it's true. my apologies are extremely sincere. but sometimes, i feel that there's still a suspicion, he said in an interview with the washington post. in france, i think that essentially it's different for someone who's called medhi to say he's sorry.
of all the governors who presided during his reign, mr. miller said his favorite was marvin mandel (d) because he knew how to build support for legislation and would reward you for working with him. the worst governor, he said, was schaefer, because he didn't understand governance. he wanted to spend money that we didn't have to spend. he thought he could print money in the basement of the state house.
at his peak, mccloskey was a central figure in political washington.
gillibrand responded that it was her job to represent new york and its people, which includes those employed on wall street.she noted that she has called for more regulation of the banking industry and voted against the government bailout of banks. nearly a year ago, gillibrand stopped taking money from corporate political action committees, following the example of sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.).
-- bringing the government shutdown no closer to an end, trump canceled house speaker nancy pelosi's planned trip to afghanistan in retaliation for her suggestion that he postpone his state of the union address. erica werner and john wagner report: hours before pelosi and top democrats were set to depart for a visit to military leaders in brussels and to see troops in afghanistan, trump released a letter canceling what he termed a 'public relations event.' 'i also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown,' he wrote. 'we will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the shutdown is over.' …
the 2017 women's march was a seminal event for democrats, especially those with presidential ambitions. in speeches and memoirs, many of them have referred to the event as the beginning of a real resistance to the trump presidency, even more than the surprisingly successful health-care rallies that took place before the inauguration.
during our day trip in october, buttigieg was coy about his plans for the future. but on dec. 20, three days after announcing that he wouldn't run for a third term in south bend, he spoke at the annual progress iowa holiday party in des moines — signaling his intentions to political observers. in january, he hired marcus switzer, hillary clinton's 2016 deputy finance director. and in february, following the release of his book, shortest way home: one mayor's challenge and a model for america's future, buttigieg plans to strike out across the country on what will likely amount to an exploratory campaign for the presidency.
a local school board trying to figure out how to fund a teacher program or a city council working to fix a street should not be a partisan issue, nunn said. what they are doing is, in a word, frightening.
calls from the speaker of the house of commons to regain order were repeatedly ignored:
eichner's best moments came from his own quippy one-liners, peppered over scenes of the women competing in summer camp style contests. fine, you get an award! eichner yelled in what can only be described a billy eichner-esque yell, after colton said, for the millionth (i'm rounding here) time that he plans on giving his virginity to a woman he loves.
it sends a bigger signal to states across the country that lack protections, that the biggest companies, the most innovative companies, aren't coming to your state unless you fix this, he said.
we are not going to stop until republicans don't even want to run candidates here, said mcadams, 54, a molecular geneticist turned singer-songwriter with a fondness for alliterative phrases. we are going to make this place too blue to bother.
in what seemed like no time at all, mccloskey — a member of opus dei, a small, ultra-conservative and controversial catholic community — made his mark. the center moved to its current k street nw location, just two blocks from the white house, and became a bustling gathering place for conservative academics, politicians, journalists and young professionals. weekday masses in the center's chapel were always packed. ­mccloskey was an energetic evangelist for his unyielding vision of the church, welcoming strangers and political celebrities alike to commit to its radically conservative beliefs.
the president's lawyers, in an effort to have the case tossed, claimed that the complaint is laden with conspiracy theories.
when cartoon network would flag dialogue or moments for removal, it would often be the most down-to-earth simple interactions, she says. not so much the fantasy aspects, but just ruby and sapphire saying a kind word to one other or wanting to be close to one another.
gillibrand is also a vocal critic of trump, and she has voted against his political appointees and positions at a higher rate than most democrats. the president responded in december 2017 by attacking her in a tweet that she called a sexist smear.
her quest for nuance drew criticism from some democrats but was in keeping with harris's career-long approach.

like biden, francis focuses on catholicism's broad call for the disenfranchised and suffering, and less on catholic doctrine about topics such as abortion, gender identity and sexuality. biden's catholic image has angered many u.s. bishops, who last year created a special committee in response to the reality of a catholic u.s. president who supports abortion rights and same-sex marriage.
mr. wofford, who had been a lawyer for the u.s. commission on civil rights before joining the kennedy presidential campaign, wanted to help but understood the political risks. knowing that any overt sympathizing with the jailed leader might alienate southern white voters, kennedy's top strategists ruled out any action. his opponent, vice president richard m. nixon, also was staying out of the fray.

-- the doj posted job listings for lawyers to handle property seizures related to the border wall. politico's ted hesson reports: the two advertised jobs, based in mcallen and brownsville [in south texas], will pay between $53,062 and $138,790, according to a posting to a federal jobs website. … the attorneys likely will deal with eminent domain property seizures and quarrels with landowners over what their land is worth, according to chris rickerd, [aclu's] senior policy counsel on border and immigration issues.
the senate on tuesday passed a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $11.50 by july 1, 2023, then divide the state into regions where the wage would vary based on the cost of living. the house voted along party lines, 55 to 45, to approve a bill raising the wage to $15 an hour by july 1, 2025.

his senior advisers told him what they saw, knowing buttigieg wouldn't linger if the prognosis wasn't good. he didn't, and was out of the race less than 24 hours later, the upstart candidate so many democrats said they were waiting for who couldn't quite transform into the unifying force they were hoping for.

even when the crowd simmers down, it's so hard to hear in the cavernous hall that the words of retiring sen. orrin hatch of utah — who is receiving an award — are mostly lost to history. whatever he's saying, i'm sure it's good, says lew olowski, who, like me, has crept closer to try to hear. he was a human rights activist studying at georgetown law a decade ago when, he tells me, joining the federalist society expanded his mind to see both sides of issues. now he's general counsel for an organization helping poor pregnant women get a leg up and, not incidentally, keep their babies. his ears prick up at isolated morsels of hatch's talk: … religious freedom … administrative state. … see what i mean? olowski says. music to my ears.

the irish times called the findings a condemnation of irish society in past days, its rigid rules and conventions about sexual matters, its savage intolerance, its harsh judgmentalism, its un-christian cruelty.
but what substance will emerge from the breakthrough is not yet clear, for absent a few issues, harris has become better known for what she is against than specifics about where her passions lie.

-- since announcing her long-shot bid for the presidency last friday night, for example, rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii) has been unable to talk about anything other than her past hostility toward gay rights as a state legislator. trying to jump-start her flailing campaign after its failure to launch, the 37-year-old recorded a four-minute apology video yesterday in which she insisted that her views have changed significantly.

sunday, january 25, 1998; page w06 and here, ladies and gentlemen, is the attorney general of the united states. or rather, here is one image of her. she is a man. more startling, she is a man dressed in women's clothing – boudoir gear consisting of nightie and dressing gown, lacy and long, but not long enough to reach all the way to the floor and cover her lanky shins or her large slippered feet. in this installment of the running saturday night live skits featuring janet reno as the central character, the attorney general, played by actor will ferrell, is lounging tummy-down on a frilly bed, watching a video of president clinton as he hits up chinese coffee-drinkers for cash. yuck! she says, appalled. she is hulking and at the same time girlish, peering at the tv set through those trademark large-lensed glasses that make her eyes look obscure and remote, like tiny fish swimming in a fishbowl. on the bed is a pan of jiffy pop and a stuffed tiger named simba. when the fund-raising video ends, the president himself appears, clambering through reno's bedroom window. as played by actor darrell hammond, this clinton is ingratiating, simpering, expansive, shorter than she is. he drops to his knees, tells reno he loves her, begs her not to appoint an independent counsel to investigate his campaign fund-raising.
for some, especially in the jewish community, meklat embodies what in france is called the new anti-semitism, a hatred of jews particularly among immigrants and their offspring. twelve jews have been killed in france since 2003, more than any other country in europe. in most of those cases, the suspects were young men of arab or west african descent.

mccarthy did not name names, but within days, the new york post and the washington examiner had published columns asking why, if republicans could condemn king, democrats could not condemn new rep. rashida tlaib (d-mich.), a palestinian american who had asked whether supporters of legislation to punish boycotts of israel forgot what country they represent.
according to people familiar with the matter, trump only aborted the plan after doj officials threatened a mass resignation.
i just felt convicted that i had done the wrong thing, gillibrand said.
[meklat] incarnates a part of the mentality of the difficult neighborhoods, where there is a strong strain of anti-semitism and an obsession with jews, said noémie halioua, a french journalist and author of a book on one of the recent anti-semitic killings, in which she called the likes of meklat a bigger threat to jewish safety than the rise of the far right.

but the shutdown's continuing into monday meant that hundreds of thousands of workers stayed home and key federal agencies were affected. federal contractors will see payments delayed, and the internal revenue service will slow its preparations for the coming tax season.
in all the hours i've spent talking to buttigieg, this is the first time i catch a whiff of disingenuousness. companies like mckinsey, a little like their silicon valley compadres, are magnets for high-achieving ivy leaguers who like to talk about making the world better while raking in some serious salaries.
unfortunately, this does not keep you out of the tidal wave of drama — it means you would be surfing on the first wave. and — i assure you — if you tell a woman your brother is cheating on her, she could find a way to blame you (or hate you), anyway.

trump himself visited iraq after the partial government shutdown began dec. 22, raising questions about his stated rationale for blocking pelosi's travel. but the president thursday canceled a u.s. delegation's trip to the annual economic conference in davos, switzerland. treasury secretary steven mnuchin, secretary of state mike pompeo and other top officials had been slated to attend.
buttigieg accumulated 26 delegates in the race — the most ever for an openly gay candidate, and far more than anyone expected at the beginning of his longshot bid. after strong showings in predominantly white states, buttigieg's results began to dimish as the race moved to more diverse electorates. ultimately, he decided they were unlikely to improve.
-- mitch mcconnell is trying to recruit secretary of state mike pompeo to run for the open senate seat in kansas. sean sullivan and josh dawsey report: senate gop leaders have been so dedicated to recruiting pompeo that mcconnell directly urged him to consider it in a recent telephone call … by the time sen. pat roberts (r-kan.) announced this month that he was retiring, gop leaders were eyeing pompeo. in the hours ahead of roberts's announcement, their allies were talking up [the former kansas congressman]. but trump does not want to lose pompeo and sees him as his favorite cabinet member, according to two people familiar with his thinking. it was unclear whether he was aware of the conversation between mcconnell and pompeo. … privately, pompeo has left the door open, according to associates, although his attention is on his current job and he is not in a rush to reach a verdict, they said.

this isn't just a theoretical debate. biden's ambitious first-term agenda — which includes a $1.9 coronavirus relief bill — is at stake.
it's a blow when you're losing serious people in government who want to focus on policy rather than running to a cable news hit and appealing to the base, the source added, noting that the upper chamber has become more like the house in recent years. it's telling about the direction of where the republican party might be going.
democratic lawmakers demanded an immediate investigation into the report that trump allegedly told cohen to lie to congress. from the chairman of the house intelligence committee:
in january 2003, leo called white house officials, including kavanaugh, to object to a plan by bush to weigh in on affirmative action. bush was going to criticize the practice but praise racial diversity. leo complained that praising diversity would disgust any conservative who thinks that this is a matter of principle, according to a previously unreported email by a white house official describing one of the calls.
because of his prominence, he marketed his ability to convince unsophisticated, very poor americans to invest, says kaplan, who was indignant that trump would exploit people like this to line your own pockets.
but president biden shouldn't break out the champagne over a new era of bipartisan unity. portman's decision not to seek reelection in 2022 means there will be fewer hill republicans willing to partner with the white house in the future. sens. patrick j. toomey (pa.) and richard burr (n.c.) — one of a handful of republican senators who actually talk to democrats — are also leaving in two years.

• make the u.s. electricity system carbon-free by 2035, meaning if there are any emissions, they will be captured. that will require much more solar and wind power and a revamp of the electrical grid. coal and natural gas still produce more than 60% of u.s. electricity.
and some days, that looks like the storming of the capitol, and it seems as though we've all been catapulted back 200 years. and some days, that looks like kamala harris, a daughter of immigrants, standing in front of that same capitol with her hand on a historic bible, and it feels like we've arrived someplace new that will soon be old.
he idolized king, sometimes mimicking the cadence and timbre of the civil rights leader's voice, said people who knew warnock as a child. like king, he attended morehouse college, a historically black school in atlanta. in 2005, at age 35, warnock became the youngest senior pastor at ebenezer baptist church, the spiritual home of king, which has for decades been at the symbolic center of activism in atlanta. under warnock, the church has continued to exist at the intersection of piety and racial justice. lewis's funeral was held there in july. and from the same pulpit, warnock eulogized rayshard brooks — a black man shot by police who encountered him sleeping in the drive-through lane of an atlanta wendy's. atlanta's police chief resigned the next day as protests engulfed the city.
this, combined with legislation to address a bevy of other issues — long-term spending levels, disaster relief and funding for opioid treatment and community health centers — would create unstoppable pressure on the house, he said.
biden would reshape how america powers itself in the name of fighting global warming, an epic conversion requiring a $2 trillion down payment over his four-year term. it would surely be a heavy lift to get through congress, even if he argues that it's a good way to stimulate the economy. biden's climate agenda drives his approach to energy issues. he has vowed to ban new oil and gas permits on public land and water. many planned oil, gas and mining ventures -- even those on private land -- face heightened risk of rejection or longer approval times.

maddow asked gillibrand whether she's embarrassed by her previous positions on immigration. gillibrand said yes. well, i don`t think it was driven from my heart, the senator said. i was callous to the suffering of families who want to be with their loved ones, people who want to be reunited with their families. and so, looking back, i just really regretted that i didn't look beyond my district.
for the past three years, the full senate has approved legislation to protect lgbt virginians from discrimination in housing and public employment, but the bills have always died in the house.
hot on the left: activist who met with congressmen about 'dna' posted about black 'violence gene,' from nbc news: an alt-right activist who met with two republican congressmen to discuss 'dna' and 'genetics' posted on facebook that he believes muslims are 'genetically different in their propensity for violence or rape' and linked to stories about how african-americans 'possessed a 'violence' gene.' chuck johnson met with reps. andy harris of maryland and phil roe of tennessee on thursday. after a huffington post reporter tweeted a photo of johnson with the two congressmen, and the photo attracted media attention because of johnson's far-right views, roe released a statement saying he and harris had met with johnson because he was representing a company advocating for 'increasing the number of sequenced genomes for research.' hot on the right: women's march setbacks reveal what can go wrong for progressive movements protesting trump, from frances stead sellers and emily wax-thibodeaux: after a leader of women's march inc. attended an event at which nation of islam firebrand louis farrakhan criticized powerful jews, the public reaction was swift and fierce. … in the months since, a movement that once bragged about its inclusivity has been roiled by reports of battles over diversity, hate speech and branding. the impact is not yet clear, but less than a week before the third-annual women's march, some regional events have been canceled.
t he idea there are any 'moderates' on either side in politics in 2021 is a fallacy, a gop strategist told power up. i think you'll be seeing fewer people who actually want to get things done involved in federal politics.
mr. miller, who regarded himself as the curator of state house history, hung portraits on his office walls of past maryland governors, including segregationists. he also had a rendering of the trial of mary surratt, a clinton native and a co-conspirator in president abraham lincoln's assassination.
still, mcadams remained in a state of suburban bliss. she raised children, put on open-mic nights. she figured things couldn't be that bad; after all, the country had elected a black president.
in march 2016, leo met with trump and federalist society member donald mcgahn at the washington law firm jones day, just as trump was beginning to prevail in his quest to be the republican nominee, leo told the post.
i think a lot of us felt like we had racism under control, that white supremacy was gone, that we'd solved a lot of problems, mcadams said. i think we grew complacent. i know we did. i did.
half of them are women. which says a lot about how things have changed, how the law has changed, in this country, subsequent to reno and ginsburg and o'connor's generation. in the initial wave of feminism, it seems the first thing women did, after burning their bras and declaring their freedom, was, in a rather contradictory gesture, to enroll in law school. none of this, white marvels, has changed the way women are depicted and seen – in washington, or really anywhere. does anyone, white asks rhetorically, talk about what orrin hatch wears? white has focused on a portion of the snl skit where reno gets a phone call from rep. john conyers jr. (d-mich.) and, in a gidget-like moment, asks conyers what he's going to wear to congress the next day. a suit, he sighs. what are you going to wear to the justice department? my one blue dress, says reno. it's a predictable joke, a jab at the much- remarked fact that reno does seem to wear a blue dress every day, except for days when she wears a blue suit. for a male, such behavior would be less remarkable, expected. for reno, the dress and the brush 'n' go short haircut receive more attention than probably any law enforcement initiative she's ever proposed. like her unmarried status, they raise a red flag: people say, `oh, bad glasses, bad hair, bad this, bad that,'  says consultant neel lattimore, former press secretary to hillary clinton.
gillibrand first ran for office in 2006, beating a four-term republican in a conservative congressional district that includes the albany suburbs. in the house, gillibrand joined the blue dog democrats, a centrist group, and embraced many conservative positions. her support of gun rights legislation earned her a 100 percent approval rating from the national rifle association. she opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants and voted to cut off some federal funding to new york city until the city cracked down on illegal immigration.she opposed legalizing same-sex marriage.

on a cold, bright, saturday morning, something special was happening, sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) wrote in her own memoir, about a women's march in boston. i knew that we had tens of millions of people with us and that this fight would be our fight.
we have found it so easy to fall in love with calvary and its long-standing commitment to be a voice of justice and compassion for those who perpetually find the wholeness of their humanity disregarded and maligned, the couple said to the congregation sunday, according to the church.
we're finding a whole new vocabulary for why people should vote, buttigieg is saying. we're reclaiming some territory that our party, in my opinion, foolishly left to the other side. like freedom, right? the so-called freedom caucus, as you know, has the most fanatical members of congress. but they don't seem to know that you're not free if you can't change jobs because you'll lose your health care. and that you're not free if you can't sue a credit-card company that's ripping you off. and you're certainly not free if somebody you've never met gets to tell you who you can and can't marry based on their interpretation of their religion.
biden has also lagged some lower-polling candidates in the trackable metrics of enthusiasm. to cite just one: sanders has 7.5 million followers on facebook and elizabeth warren has 3.1 million, while biden clocks in at 1.5 million. sanders and warren have used that network to launch legislative pressure campaigns and organize bustling campaign events; biden has not.
depew brought his daughter home from india in 2012. he opted to use a mix of sick time and paid time off that his employer offered for new parents. i took a full five months off and i remember my boss was shocked and unhappy. i definitely remember the expectation being that dads don't actually take leave, whether they're gay or straight, he said.
it should not take a difficult childbirth/a gay son/a wife with non-hodgkin's lymphoma/a transgender parent to realize that medical bankruptcy or discrimination are terrible, dehumanizing things. people deserve empathy not because we see our own suffering in theirs but because they are people who are suffering.
what about his gaffes? speaking of those votes: biden's potential rivals are extremely well aware of his long voting record, which put him on the record for everything from the antiabortion hyde amendment (now officially opposed by the democratic platform) to crack/cocaine sentencing disparities to legislation that made it harder to declare bankruptcy.
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and a measure of how much the federalist society had already shifted frames of reference was the liberal response. acs was very explicitly founded to do the same kind of work that the federalist society has done, fredrickson says. we, too, have chapters across the country. … we also organize events. we have a group of scholars and experts who work with us on efforts to explain the constitution and our laws to the broader public. but the acs still lacks the reach of the federalist society, as measured in chapters and budgets. fredrickson attributes the gap to legal institutions and opportunities on the left being more diffuse than on the right. also: they do get a lot more corporate support than we do because it's in the interest of the corporations, she says. they want to get rid of regulations.
it became obvious that a large portion of the country — 74 million, as donald trump keeps reminding us — wanted to travel not forward but back: way, way, way back. make america great again was always its own time machine. the phrase raised questions. great for whom, exactly, and when? but never mind that: they wanted us to go back. to 2014, maybe, before same-sex marriage was legalized. to 1972, before women could end unwanted pregnancies, or to a pre-voting rights act 1964.
by that point, she had made a national name for herself by channeling her prosecutorial background into pointed interrogations of some of president trump's appointees, becoming one of the faces of the trump resistance.
every modern shutdown eventually gets to this point: some conservative speculation that voters will learn how little they need the government and urge congress to shrink it.
a republican aide involved in the talks said that mcconnell and his team were considering putting their plan in document form with more detail as a way of convincing some democrats to support the short-term bill.
he admitted that he had once viewed same-sex marriage, which was legalized in a landmark 2015 u.s. supreme court ruling, as a political impossibility. but, as he reflected in the essay, the dramatic social and political change he had witnessed decades earlier should have banished such pessimism.
the view: if long island city had the pitching arm of mariano rivera, it could play catch with midtown, which sits directly across the east river. (the landmass between the two shores is roosevelt island, which is accessible by tramway from manhattan and ferry from lic.) for a river-level view, grab an adirondacks chair in the 12-acre gantry plaza state park and shout out the names of the buildings across the way: united nations headquarters, empire state building, chrysler. nearby, long island city community boathouse at anable basin leads free paddles during the summer. higher up, on the z hotel's 12th-floor rooftop, watch the manhattan skyline twinkle against the night sky like a not-so-distant planet.
a shrewd tactician, mr. miller controlled the senate under six governors and endured as opponents derided him as an autocrat, as demographics in his home base of prince george's county shifted, and as maryland's political culture drifted left.
the democrats who are going to march this weekend have also had to tread carefully. a spokesman for los angeles mayor eric garcetti noted that he will be attending a march that is not affiliated with women's march inc. sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.) will attend a women's march-affiliated event in des moines; asked first by buzzfeed's ruby cramer, she responded to the anti-semitism controversy by emphasizing that local organizers were running the event she'd be attending.

gillibrand's evolution seemed to reach its apex last week when she introduced herself as a candidate for president and a fighter for liberal values. but her shift in views from a decade ago is already raising questions among democrats and provoking attacks from republicans eager to define her as a flip-flopper.
pete buttigieg, nominee for secretary of transportation
-- immigration has become a third rail during the trump era in a way it was not previously. democrats increasingly oppose the president's demand for a border wall as immoral, not just as an ineffective and wasteful idea. even bernie sanders, perhaps the most ideologically consistent among the potential 2020 candidates, has vulnerabilities on this issue and has been trying to make amends since opposing the comprehensive overhaul package in 2006.
although her tactics at times seemed high on entertainment value — she once made her entrance at the hookers' ball astride an elephant — her mission was deeply serious, part of a broader movement to gain greater health services, legal rights and financial security for sex workers.

• require more fbi criminal background checks. biden would stop exempting private sales unless the transaction is between close family members. he also wants to allow the government 10 days, up from three, for the checks to be carried out.
as his reputation grew, ­mccloskey opined often on matters of faith and church and culture. he criticized lay groups that wanted more control over investigations of clergy sexual abuse. he advocated forcefully against abortion and said married catholic couples using birth control should refrain from taking communion. he argued that american men suffered from friendship deficit syndrome and said wives should encourage their husbands to spend more time with their male friends and less time at home. he added that men were afraid to go out in groups in big cities, because observers would think they were gay.
yet even in that wide-open race, harris found it hard to craft a unique brand. she began the primary as an on-paper favorite, drew one of its biggest crowds to her campaign launch in oakland, calif., then foundered so profoundly that she dropped out of the race before any votes were cast. she could not dislodge biden as the voice of democrats hunting for practicality and normalcy. she did not have the progressive track record to pry away loyalists to sens. bernie sanders of vermont or elizabeth warren of massachusetts, and she did not foster the newcomer zing of then-south bend., ind., mayor pete buttigieg.
-- federal law enforcement agencies say the shutdown is harming ongoing investigations. devlin barrett and mark berman report: most travel and training among the law enforcement agencies has been canceled. many law enforcement officials said some undercover cases, including corruption probes, have been stymied in recent weeks because supervisors feel they cannot approve travel or cash for those operations. … senior law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned that the anger among the rank and file is growing exponentially and could skyrocket next week if a second straight paycheck is skipped. those who are charged with protecting the nation from criminals and terrorists could be facing enormous external financial stressors as they try to stay focused on their work.

surfacing promising judicial candidates who can be nominated when conservatives have electoral power is just one byproduct of the network, and on its own maybe not the most important one, teles explains. there's a supply-and-demand relationship between the judges and the network. the judges need scholarship and arguments extending federalist principles into new areas. where new legal theories depart from the status quo, they need them to be vetted and legitimized through public debate. they require targeted cases raising questions that provide an opening to move the law. without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, teles says, you're not going to maximize what you got through the electoral process.
quoting a robert frost poem about love at first sight, he wrote in his new york times essay: twice in my life, i've felt the pull of such passionate preference. at age 90, i am lucky to be in an era where the supreme court has strengthened what president obama calls 'the dignity of marriage' by recognizing that matrimony is not based on anyone's sexual nature, choices or dreams. it is based on love.
i didn't want grasset to become an instrument of rehabilitating some hypocrite, olivier nora, grasset's president, said in an interview. but after reading the manuscript and meeting meklat, who was then working as an assistant in a perfume shop, nora overcame his reservations. (he skipped the usual step of presenting the concept to grasset's editorial board, which he knew would pan it.)
the early episodes of the bachelor are always rife with infighting as the season works out who will be its sweethearts and who will be its villains. because women who have watched the show before know that the latter is an easy ticket to bachelor in paradise, they're eager to take on the role at any cost.
• enact a payroll tax of 12.4% on income earned above $400,000 to boost the solvency of the social security system and expand benefits. currently, only wages up to $137,700 are taxed to fund the social security program.
millennials became the country's largest voting-age cohort in 2018, displacing baby boomers — and their politics break sharply with their parents' and grandparents'. (opinions vary as to where the millennial generation technically begins and ends, but the pew research center defines it as those born between 1981 and 1996. buttigieg was born in 1982.) this group not only leans heavily democratic, but emphatically leftward. of course, they overwhelmingly tell pollsters, gay people should be able to marry. of course black and brown people have been shortchanged throughout history and continue to be. of course immigrants do nothing but make the country stronger. of course the government owes every citizen decent health care. and of course climate change is humanity's greatest peril.
mr. wofford, by then a widower, described how he met matthew charlton, an interior designer 50 years his junior, and the two became a couple. the essay ended with mr. wofford's announcement that he and charlton would soon exchange marriage vows. they wed that year.
the discussion in washington has gotten so abstracted from reality, he says. he wants to drive politics back toward the lived experiences of the citizenry, which don't divide them the way ideological abstractions do. what makes a country great, really? we like to talk about 'freedom' and 'security' and 'family values' or whatever, he says. but the measure of a country's greatness is whether it helps people lead better lives, with less worry.
and yet the parenting question has opened up again. can we really still do what we'd planned? will we be ready to have a baby in a year? with an erratic economy and the barely existent child-care system crumbling? as a same-sex couple who just moved to the worst state when it comes to child-care deserts? and what if things get even worse? are we sure this is what we want? (and how does one even safely obtain sperm during a pandemic?!)

he had more broad appeal in those early, mostly white states than any of the other candidates, said dan pfeiffer, a former adviser to then-president barack obama. but ultimately, he was never able to make any gains with nonwhite parts of the electorate. and there's no path to the democratic nomination and the presidency that doesn't include that.
thomas vincent mike miller jr. was born dec. 3, 1942, in clinton, md., where his grandfather founded b.k. miller's, a general store that mr. miller's father eventually took over. at the intersection of old branch avenue and woodyard road, the store was a center of prince george's life, a few yards from the church where the miller family attended services and down the street from the modest brick building where mr. miller eventually opened a law office.
the same question seemed to underscore all of it: are you serious?
another speaker was future solicitor general ted olson, who was then an assistant attorney general in the office of legal counsel. i didn't have any idea how far it would go or what it would become, olson told me, but i did feel at the time … this is something interesting happening here. in his address to that first symposium, he said: i sense that we are at one of those points in history where the pendulum may be beginning to swing in another direction. of course, we do not know now, and no one will really know until many years from now, whether the 1980 elections have wrought a significant and long-lasting change. but i think that there is an opportunity here; and the organization of this society and this symposium is a cause for optimism and a sign that perhaps something is happening.
this due process isn't a bad thing, said julian chang of san diego, who adopted his son four years ago with his husband, wade estey. if everyone had to be fingerprinted and produce their tax records in order to become parents, there would be a lot more wanted children in this world, chang said.
the people putting that plan together were thinking of bringing physicists from poland, but a lot of iowans who saw the plan though we were talking about people from central america, said vilsack. you could give people data that new immigrants weren't taking their jobs, and they wouldn't be convinced.

her aides are particularly sensitive to her record on same-sex marriage and how it is described. gillibrand started to vocally support same-sex marriage when she was appointed to the senate. under criticism at the time, she noted that she had backed a new york gay-marriage bill the previous year.
he got his introduction to politics in 1962 as a driver for frank small jr., a republican gubernatorial candidate who lived next door to the millers. mr. miller befriended small's press consultant, lawrence j. hogan sr., who would become a u.s. congressman and prince george's county executive. hogan's son, larry, for whom mr. miller babysat, became maryland governor during the last years of mr. miller's reign in annapolis.

when she arrived in the senate in 2017, harris told her tiny team that she wanted her staff to look like california, according to two former senate aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. as the only black woman in the senate, harris has lifted women, particularly women of color, of historically black colleges and universities, and others to senior staff positions. she did the same on her presidential campaign.
justice scalia had just died, and the men were mulling the implications. mcgahn had come up with the idea of generating a list of potential supreme court nominees that trump could disclose to win over moderates. leo said he briefed trump about the current composition of the court, the ideology of the justices and the like.

during her reelection campaign last year, gillibrand promised that she would serve my six-year term and not challenge trump in 2020. her republican opponent replied: honestly, i don't believe that.
in this affluent outpost of the state capital, local democrats are done playing iowa nice. they are mounting aggressive recruitment campaigns, mocking opponents and organizing to try to push republicans out of elected seats, including offices that are traditionally nonpartisan.
sarratt has also been filling the role of part-time associate minister at greenville unitarian universalist fellowship.
harris, meanwhile, found herself stuck in between. she spent the early months of the primary race advocating medicare-for-all as an early signatory of sanders's landmark bill. but as the months went on, she seemed to tiptoe around the role of private insurance.
the move was met with a mix of ridicule and confusion.
davis predicted that the housing measure will have a good opportunity to get through [the house] this year.
because there is a baby in the picture, the stakes are different now, and you might give your wonderful brother a heads up by telling him, i just want you to know that the next time i find out you're cheating, i'm not going to keep your secret for you. you could also say to the woman, my brother has a history of cheating on his partners. i hope he behaves differently with you.
early in the primary, the issue of health insurance emerged to define harris's sometimes fluid positioning. warren and sanders supported medicare-for-all and the resulting end of private health insurance — which aligned them with the more liberal wing of the party and showed a willingness to stiff-arm corporate america.
a green new deal act with stricter environmental guidelines died in house committee. there was no similar version in the senate. the house did pass a bill restoring some powers of the state corporation commission to oversee dominion's rates.

a majority of democrats had forced the shutdown with demands for a vote on legislation to protect deferred action for childhood arrivals recipients, known as dreamers, from deportation after trump canceled the program. the final bill did not include these protections, nor any specific guarantee of a vote.
also the youngest candidate in the democratic race, buttigieg formally launched his campaign last april from a formerly shuttered studebaker plant in south bend. his pitch was that his youth and lack of washington political experience were assets, not drawbacks — and something about that resonated.
although my analysis ended just a few months into 2018, to date none of those bills have been signed into law. further, in 2017, north carolina lawmakers repealed the bathroom provision of hb2 in 2017.
we have a responsibility to consider the effect of remaining in this race any further, buttigieg told the crowd in south bend, adding, and so we must recognize that at this point in the race, the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideas is to step aside and help bring our party and our country together.

biden sees the u.s. at the head of the table, leading the world to address the most urgent global challenges. under trump, the u.s. retreated from its historic leadership role, creating a vacuum that china tried to fill. biden vowed to recommit the u.s. to multinational institutions, including the north atlantic treaty organization.
hirono's office responded wednesday that gabbard was mischaracterizing her questioning of buescher, and that the senator was voicing her concerns about the nominee's past public statements rather than his religion.
(in a business insider story, a trump organization spokesperson responded to the suit by saying, before enrolling with acn, every participant acknowledged in writing that they are 'not guaranteed any income.'  in that story, acn co-founder robert stevanovski claimed the plaintiffs were told that trump was getting paid to endorse the company. i think it's politically motivated that they're going to sue him and the family and not us, he said.)

dear amy: caring friend reported that her dear friend was about to enter into a green card same-sex marriage. i disagree with your response. these marriages are wrong, and illegal. this friend should call him out.
got it, buttigieg responds. wow, this needs resurfacing. there's a nobel prize waiting for someone who can figure out how to make asphalt last longer than 12 years. i'm not kidding. i really think there ought to be a manhattan project for this. it's classic market failure.
on its own, attending or skipping one march shouldn't say much about a candidate, and schedule conflicts can be real. sen. bernie sanders (i-vt), who spoke at the 2017 march in burlington, has not ruled out attending a march this weekend, but just two weeks ago he hosted sarsour and women's march co-founder bob bland at his senate swearing-in party. (sarsour worked on sanders's 2016 presidential campaign.) and gillibrand has never distanced herself from the national organization.
while support for same-sex marriage is unanimous among high-ranking democrats now, her position was common at the time among party leaders. only two senators publicly supported same-sex marriage as of early 2008, according to baptist press, the news service of the southern baptist convention. gillibrand was among about six senators, all democrats, who supported it at the time of her appointment, the news service reported. (as president, barack obama didn't formally support same-sex marriage until 2012.)
mr. miller often attributed his political endurance to his ability to see what's going to happen before it happens. despite his own reservations, he facilitated the abolition of the death penalty in maryland in 2013 after polls showed the public supported the ban. even as he voted no, he allowed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage to move forward in 2012, a shift he attributed not only to political pragmatism but to his friendships with people who were gay.
so in june, instead of spending our money on a big wedding, we bought a three-bedroom house just outside st. george, with a view of the red cliffs of snow canyon from our front window. with the permission of our employers — one based in d.c. and the other in new jersey — we are working remotely for the foreseeable future. we are immensely privileged and relatively stable — with our work, our incomes and our family support.
his answer was so striking — coming from a sitting president — that abc news broke into the network's afternoon programming with a special report, anchored by george stephanopoulos and diane sawyer. sawyer announced, big breaking news from the white house. this is a historic political and cultural moment in this country, and the issue: gay marriage.
most people do not equate mayor of a town in flyover country as presidential material, but pete is special, schmuhl said then. once people get to know pete, they are intrigued, interested, supportive right out of the gate.
mr. miller, when asked about broadwater's description, replied: that's not a bad analysis.
eventually, we arrived at an answer. we would try for a baby after a year or so of marriage, with just a few preconditions: we would keep two salaries so we could afford a two-bedroom place. both of us would need paid leave through our jobs; we'd have to be able to afford (good!) child care, maybe even a nanny-share; and we'd need to have friends and family nearby so we wouldn't feel alone if something went wrong.

a devout catholic, leo said he is driven by his faith and a literal interpretation of the constitution. he also defended the practice of taking money from donors whose identities are not publicly disclosed, comparing his effort to shape the courts to those of abolitionists, suffragists and civil rights activists.
biden acknowledged that he had indeed evolved on the issue — faster and further than the president. several weeks earlier, biden had admitted in a private meeting in los angeles with 30 advocates for gay and lesbian rights that his view differed from obama's, and he'd told the group that he had to keep his opinion to himself. but now, on national television, he spoke from the heart.
official trump litmus tests: plans to provide the ideological ammunition to sustain trump's political movement after his departure from the white house are in the making by former trump administration officials, report axios's hans nichols and lachlan markay report:
you going to come? asks conway, referring to a recruitment meeting planned for the next day.
in the mid-2000s, gabbard said publicly that democrats should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists. that view may be disqualifying in today's democratic party. she also worked for an anti-gay-rights group led by her father. in the damage-control video, she defends herself by noting that she grew up in a socially conservative household where i was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman.
as she seeks a foothold in a crowded democratic field, gabbard, 37, has been viewed suspiciously by many on the left because of her opposition to civil unions for same-sex couples while a state legislator in the early 2000s.
if buttigieg becomes president, you sense, the future will be chock-full of manhattan projects. but first he has to overcome the considerable odds and find a way to win. he has clearly made a close study of how barack obama, bill clinton and john f. kennedy took their nontraditional paths to the presidency at young ages. when you run young, your face says you represent change, he says. but he doesn't want to stop at symbolism: his message for 2020 will be centered on a clean, sharp break with the lite republicanism that democrats embraced in the 1990s. while older voters still tell pollsters they favor keeping taxes low and ambitions modest, millennials overwhelmingly support medicare-for-all, free college, heavy spending to tackle poverty and climate change, and major infrastructure investments — social democracy, in a nutshell.
ever the pragmatist, he had reached out months before to four newly elected senators, progressives who had defeated his more moderate lieutenants in the 2018 democratic primary. he understood that his style of politics — dealmaking and consensus-building — had become an antiquated art form in an era dominated by president trump and extreme rhetoric.
one of the common threads all my life, he said, has been a disagreement with those who see politics as primarily focused on their own psychic or ideological satisfaction, those people that want to vote or to protest or be witnesses [without being interested] in the art of persuasion or what the results will be. the protest movement of the late 1960s ended by appalling me.
prisons medical tents for inmates with the coronavirus are set up on outside san quentin prison in san quentin, calif., on july 9. (melina mara/the washington post) can biden end era of mass incarceration? by justin jouvenal a series of bills that joe biden helped write as a senator about three decades ago became the template for a tough-on-crime era that swelled the nation's prison population. now, as president-elect, biden says he will pursue an ambitious agenda to essentially undo what he supported, but he faces skepticism from foes and friends alike. read the full story arrow-right
just before 10 on a balmy sunday morning in mid-october, right on time, pete buttigieg marches into a squat brown building on the edge of colonial williamsburg, ready to fire up a group of door-knocking volunteers for elaine luria, a former navy commander challenging a scandal-plagued republican for a u.s. house seat from virginia. inside he comes upon a mere half-dozen bleary-eyed folks milling around luria's headquarters. they seem not quite sure just who this perky young dude in the crisp white shirt, blue tie and neatly pressed slacks might be.
as an intern in mr. miller's office in 1977, evans learned that his boss could be unreasonably demanding. at mr. miller's urging, evans suggested legislative ideas, including a bill allowing victims of domestic abuse to seek compensation.

senator hirono asks all judicial nominees — particularly those who have expressed very strong personal ideological views in conflict with supreme court precedent — if they can be fair, dempster said. she asked mr. buescher, who has a clear record of anti-choice activism, whether he could separate his personal beliefs from decisions he would make if confirmed for a lifetime appointment on the federal bench.
leo's only other publicly known employer is an obscure for-profit start-up called the bh group. it was registered in virginia on aug. 22, 2016, by the same law firm employee who incorporated the bh fund and the two other nonprofits leo started earlier that year. the firm is based out of a virtual office suite used as a shared mailing address and meeting space for unrelated companies.
• resurrect the semiautomatic weapons ban and another on high-capacity magazines. this time, biden says, manufacturers wouldn't be allowed to skirt the law by making minor changes that don't limit the weapon's lethality, as was commonly done to undermine the effectiveness of the ban from 1994 to 2004.
mr. wofford became one of the first white students to graduate from the historically black howard university law school in washington. he was an early supporter of the rev. martin luther king jr. and marched alongside him in the civil and voting rights flash point of selma, ala. robert f. kennedy, the president's brother who served as u.s. attorney general, once referred to mr. wofford as a slight madman in his zeal for advancing civil rights.
this is a social movement, a decentralized protest movement, focused on building institutional power and capacity, wong said. trump and his cronies are doing a good job of derailing what the new house had wanted to focus on. the shutdown has been a massive distraction. and so, once again, the women's march is leading and bringing the focus where it should be, while democrats have been sidetracked.
the traditional liberal response to the federalist society has included pointing out how suspiciously convenient it is that the jurisprudence advocated by society members so often yields conservative results. the conservatives reverse-engineered their preferred methodologies of interpreting the constitution and legal statutes to reach the ends they want, goes this line of attack. those methodologies are known as originalism and textualism because they are said to be founded in a search for the original meaning of the constitution and the literal texts of legal statutes.
three years later, the discursive former college president lost his seat to rep. rick santorum, the hard-charging conservative who helped the gop take control of the senate. after leaving office, mr. wofford served six years as chief executive of the corporation for national and community service, the agency that administers the americorps program and was one of his chief legislative achievements as senator.
buescher was a republican candidate for nebraska attorney general in 2014.
he points with particular pride to the massive infrastructure projects he undertook: refashioning the old, decaying studebaker building into a hub for small creative industries like tech start-ups, and pledging that 1,000 homes in 1,000 days would either be razed or refurbished to rid neighborhoods of the crumbling vestiges of the past. the word 'again' was not part of our vision, he says. the message from the start was, 'the studebaker plant isn't coming back, but we are, and here's how.' 
federal district court appointments despite president trump's record pace of appeals court appointments, at the federal district court level he lags behind some recent presidents at the same point in their administrations.
within hours, cardinal blase j. cupich, the archbishop of chicago and an ally of francis, issued a sharp rebuke to gomez and his supporters in putting together the statement.
the partnership for america's health care future, launched with some ballyhoo in december, is an all-hands effort by insurance and drug companies to suppress support for medicare-for-all before it's too late. efforts like this have been brutally effective in state elections, with hundreds of millions of dollars raining down to block health-care ballot measures.
their strategy has upended the live-and-let-live atmosphere that often permeates the suburbs, where some democrats said they used to be content to focus on their families and leave local politics to the other party. republicans have gained more power in rural areas and manufacturing towns, turning a state that twice voted for barack obama into a place where republicans have total control of the capitol and president trump won easily.
she knows her shoulders have to be wide and strong because we're standing on her shoulders, rep. brenda lawrence (d-mich.), a member of the congressional black caucus, said after harris was named to the ticket. we're so proud of her. and she knows we can have her back. and she has quite a task in front of her.
but once he finally abandoned the struggle, buttigieg was characteristically all in. he came out in the south bend tribune during his mayoral reelection campaign, soon after then-gov. mike pence signed his infamously anti-gay religious freedom restoration act. and in short order he met chasten online and quickly fell in love. when the two wed in june 2018, they timed it for pride week. the ceremony was live-streamed on youtube — and afterward, the couple joined revelers at a pride block party, with a new york times reporter in tow.
for much of her career, there was little in kaplan's professional bio to suggest she would become an attorney suing behemoths. kaplan, known to all as robbie, is a self-described traditionalist, in pearls, pumps and, pre-coronavirus, superior blond highlights, who long worked as a top commercial litigator at paul, weiss, one of the nation's preeminent firms, where the fees tend to be if-you-have-to-ask-you-surely-can't-afford-us.
but in a general election, one on one against an out-of-control bully like trump, buttigieg's calm and calculated approach would make him a very dangerous challenger. a contest between buttigieg and trump would present a clash between two distinct — and distinctly old-school — ways of projecting masculinity. it would be like a comically over-the-top wwe hall of famer entering the ring against a 21st-century gary cooper, whose secret weapon is his steely self-possession.
ultimately, of course, to the distress of most federalists, the supreme court upheld the law in 2012. yet to barnett and others, it was still a victory for future deployments of the commerce clause argument against federal overreach, because a majority of the court agreed with the commerce-based critique. instead, in his opinion upholding the measure, chief justice roberts found other grounds to support the law.
today, barnett is a professor of constitutional law at georgetown and an influential voice in the legal wars over the affordable care act, medical marijuana and the like. but his first encounter with the federalist society came in 1986, two academic postings ago, when he was a relatively junior professor at chicago-kent college of law. a student invited him to speak on a panel at one of the early federalist society national student symposiums. barnett was reluctant because he thought his perspective would be unwelcome, and anyway, he taught contracts, not the constitution. but he was ambitious enough to want to rub shoulders with the legal celebrities who would also be invited. so he said yes.
during an on-camera interview for a post documentary, leo called himself a leader of the conservative legal movement and said, i have no idea how many groups i've been involved with over the years.

and given former president donald trump's grip on republicans, it could be a staunch ally with the lead to replace portman: rep. jim jordan (r-ohio), who trump awarded the presidential medal of freedom before leaving.
while we would be issued an event permit, we will not be permitted to have a dj play past 9 p.m. that hasn't phased my niece, who asked, what would the police do, arrest me? i told her at the very least they would cite my husband and me for noise violation.
the publisher added: i have a number of authors in my catalogue who i know when they were young wrote some indefensible things which embarrassed them today but which i know they've made disappear.
the key point for me with kamala is, she has wide experience. she's encountered a range of personalities and topics and that makes her very well prepared to assist the president, said brown, who swore harris in as san francisco's district attorney.
peppering her impassioned arguments with saucy humor, she fashioned herself a grande dame of what is often dubbed the world's oldest profession and became an irresistible subject for the local, national and international media in her heyday.
-- 'their job is to scare me': jason rezaian describes first terrifying hours inside iranian prison, by jason rezaian, who was held inside an iranian prison for 18 months: 'do you know why you are here, mr. jason?' 'no,' i said, turning my head in the direction of his voice. 'you're the head of the american cia station in tehran,' he said. he never raised his voice, but he was accusatory: 'we know it. and you have a choice. tell us everything, and you'll go home. you'll get on that flight to the united states on friday as planned, but you'll be starting a new life working for the ministry of intelligence of the islamic republic.' the offer was absurd in its directness and so i didn't think he was completely serious. 'if not, you must change your clothes. when you put the prison clothes on it's not clear how long you're going to be here. the odds are you will spend the rest of your life as our guest. you'll never get out of here. so tell us everything.'

documentary: pathways to power conservatives are winning the battle for america's courts, a triumph decades in the making. this is the story of the ideologues, activists and undisclosed donors who made it happen. at the center of the movement is leonard leo, executive vice president of the federalist society, who has helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for nonprofit groups that work behind the scenes to promote conservative judges and causes. now a private judicial adviser to president trump, leo has extraordinary influence over the third branch of government.
and this is perhaps where donald trump is making his greatest, longest-lasting effort. but he's doing it based on a lot of the work by leonard leo. and today i'm so pleased to introduce him, she said. welcome him to the stage, and thank him for all the work that he is doing to help save america.
other possible white house contenders who voted against the bill included sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.), kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.).
there is a long tradition of lawmakers evolving as they pursue higher office, to use the euphemism that's been long favored by ambitious pols. after all, ronald reagan and donald trump were both registered democrats a decade before they ran for president. and many pundits now assume flip-flops are less perilous than in the past, primarily because trump has easily gotten away with so many. but that conventional wisdom will be tested as the democratic nominating contest heats up over the coming months.
the south bend chapter of black lives matter began protesting buttigieg. national publications dug into his record on issues of race in south bend, and they found he had struggled to diversify its police force. a national narrative coalesced: black voters did not like buttigieg.
that husband, chasten, would emerge as something of a cult hero for buttigieg supporters, who often clamored for pictures with him. an active twitter account and numerous personal appearances showcased chasten's earnest, often humorous style.
he was on a panel about freedom of association. most people consider it a hallowed right — yet it is one that is not mentioned in the constitution. some legal theorists fret over assorted rights being smuggled into the constitution by activist judges. on the panel, barnett knew he was seated beside a conservative advocate of judicial restraint. and so, barnett told me, i said at the end of my little talk, 'i know what you're thinking: what gives lifetime-appointed judges the power to protect a right that isn't actually mentioned in the text of the constitution?'  he recalled that he paused dramatically. and then, as i had prepared, my next thing was to read the text of the ninth amendment, which says the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. and when i said that, this huge roar [of approval] came up from the audience.
when it comes to laws adding the concepts of 'sexual orientation' and 'gender identity,' we have seen full well by now that these laws have the direct effect of weaponizing governments with the ability to punish those with a viewpoint that runs contrary to its own when it comes to marriage and human sexuality, the foundation's president, victoria cobb, wrote on the group's website.

kaplan experienced a rare episode of depression, which led her to consult a therapist named thea spyer, who referenced her lesbian relationship in an effort to comfort kaplan — and whose death in 2009 left a punitive estate-tax bill to her partner, edie windsor, because their marriage wasn't legally recognized, sparking the supreme court case that helped define kaplan's career.
he's a positive, unifying figure, and he's as kind and thoughtful and reflective as trump is the opposite. his whole history is so different.
-- many government agencies are scrambling to continue or resume basic operations to limit the shutdown's fallout, even though that often means sending people to work without pay. damian paletta and josh dawsey report: the state department ordered its employees to return to work next week, saying it has found money to cover a half-month in salary … the tsa acknowledged thursday that the lengthy shutdown had affected its employees' ability to come to work, with many calling in sick. … and some agencies have had to deal with small-scale rebellions among the employees they are requiring to continue showing up for work. these employees have recently refused to put any work-related travel expenses on their personal credit cards, unsure when they will be repaid. other agencies are ordering employees to return to work, without pay, to minimize the shutdown's impact on a variety of industries, including agriculture, ranching, logging, banking and fishing.
the local field organizer is full of apologies. we had 10 people email this morning and say they couldn't come because of the storm, she says. a surprise weather system had blasted through two nights earlier on the tail of hurricane michael, felling pine trees and downing power lines. it was like, 'i haven't had a shower in days and i just can't.' but we're so glad to have you!
but warnock's race began to attract far more headlines given how contentious it became and how much was at stake. democrats failed to overtake republicans for the majority in the senate despite high expectations in the november elections, and a majority-gop senate stood to block a significant amount of president-elect joe biden's agenda.

by march, we'd finished all the major plans for our august 2020 wedding in a national forest outside salt lake city, near where i'd grown up and most of my family lives. then covid-19 changed our lives overnight. after two weeks of working from home in our studio, we'd had enough.
among those questioning buescher over his membership in the knights of columbus were hirono and sen. kamala d. harris (d-calif.). in response to one question, buescher defended his membership in the organization, which he said does not have the authority to take personal political positions on behalf of all of its approximately 2 million members.
from 1966 to 1970, mr. wofford served as president of an experimental branch of the state university of new york at old westbury on long island. he spent the next eight years leading bryn mawr as the second male president since the women's college was founded in 1885.
still, some democratic senators said the deal created the conditions for success.
her convictions were tested almost immediately when a man fatally shot a san francisco police officer and many of the state's highest-profile officials pressured her to pursue the death penalty. at the officer's funeral, sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) declared his death the special circumstance called for by the death penalty law. the crowd stood and cheered.
from the back of the room, something was hard not to notice: when members of the trump administration arrived to speak to a bipartisan group of mayors, they did not mention the shutdown. and they got very little applause.

like the sorority girl who once fought her for a virgin, tracy found her role reversed: she was older, wiser, and a protector of the rose. perhaps she had confused the show with another rose-themed romance, beauty and the beast, where the object is enchanted and forbidden to the beautiful woman who would one day become a bride (the beast was probably a virgin, too).
sleepy time: choose among 3,200 rooms in 33 hotels, with several dozen more properties on the way. rates are significantly cheaper than manhattan properties, and room size is generous. example a: the paper factory, a quirky boutique hotel that honors its 100-year-old industrial history. a superior queen starts at $129 and measures 181 to 298 square feet. example b: the boro, where a 250-square-foot king or queen room starts at $122. visitors with tighter budgets and no stranger danger can book a shared dorm at the local or q4 hostels for less than $40 a night.
buttigieg launched his presidential exploratory committee on jan. 23, 2019, with a video in which he wore a flannel shirt and sweater, his hair not yet as tightly cropped as it would be by the time he announced he would be leaving the race. the unmistakable flecks of gray hadn't bubbled up there yet. his face wasn't quite as gaunt.
even as leo counseled trump on judicial picks, he and his allies were raising money for nonprofits that under irs rules do not have to disclose their donors. between 2014 and 2017 alone, they collected more than $250 million in such donations, sometimes known as dark money, according to a post analysis of the most recent tax filings available. the money was used in part to support conservative policies and judges, through advertising and through funding for groups whose executives appeared as television pundits.
critics of legislation banning gender-affirming medical treatment point to statistics like these to argue that such legislation can actively harm transgender and gender-nonconforming youth, both physically and emotionally. pediatricians who care for gender-nonconforming or transgender-identified children and adolescents regularly describe transition-related care as lifesaving.
of course, argentina's move may galvanize abortion opponents, as well. the christian right has been jolted by the recent wave of change. and just as ni una menos inspired activists in other countries, so, too, have conservative social movements. #conmishijosnotemetas (don't mess with my children), founded in peru in 2016 to oppose feminist gender ideology in schools, has been spreading around the region, including to argentina. in 2021, chileans rewrite their constitution — and both leftist and rightist social movements at the convention are likely to lobby on sexuality politics.
the real cultural revolution -- by the end of the book that revolution has taken on dimensions and attributes that even its most ardent supporters rarely claim for it. the essence of the cultural revolution, marwick writes, was its involvement of vast numbers of ordinary people, from peasant families in rural italy getting the basics of civilized living to black children in the ghettos of the american south being admitted for the first time to properly equipped schools; from paraplegics whose needs as integrated members of the community were for the first time being recognized, to women everywhere freed from the confinements of the feminine mystique; from italian, french, british and american workers with freshly negotiated wages and conditions of employment to young people in once-dreary provincial cities, now provided with boutiques and discos. and so on, with a medley of other tributes, large and small: the end of segregated housing, the increase of social welfare, the liberalization of marriage and divorce, the abandonment of fictions about the nature of beauty and the arrival of body-hugging clothing (or no clothing for sun-bathers), the inauguration of the new universal language of rock [that] was genuinely liberating, and not just for the young . . . there even emerged a new measured judgment on the part of authorities, so that tom hayden, the leader of the radical sds, and the many others who suffered grievously at the hands of the most reactionary elements in the 'justice' system were all finally acquitted.
that episode reflects just one issue that sorcher believes resonated with a devoted audience across steven universe, plus steven universe future (in which steve is a 16-year-old coping with ongoing changes in his powers) and last september's steven universe: the movie, which drew more than 1.5 million viewers in its original telecast.
biden's remarks put obama in a tough position. plouffe feared the political repercussions of the president altering his view on gay marriage, and he had persuaded obama to keep quiet on the issue. in plouffe's estimation, a direct obama statement favoring gay marriage was too risky ahead of the 2012 general election.

for angel maldonado lopez and leonard norton of boston, who welcomed their then 7-year-old son jesse home through foster care, paternity leave was not ideal, they said. norton, who is self-employed, took the summer off to be with their new son. lopez, who is the primary breadwinner, could only afford to take two weeks of paternity leave. it was too short, he said. jesse struggled to see me as the paternal figure — i was just the guy who went to work and came home from work later. that's a struggle for most dads whether gay or straight — but i wish i had gotten more time just to bond with him.

(joshua lott/the washington post) biden, longtime ally of police, will urge reform by mark berman and tom jackman some say president-elect joe biden's previous work makes him uniquely qualified to connect policing groups and reform advocates. but he will face immense pressure from both sides as he tries to bridge the nation's bitter divide over policing. read the full story arrow-right
law enforcement is investigating who might be behind the blast, although there is no indication that activists protesting the church were responsible for the attack, el monte police chief david reynoso told the washington post. obscene messages in spray paint on the building found by responding officers were not related to the anti-lgbtq teachings, reynoso said.
was it everything you imagined? yes. in a lot of ways. it was hard not to breathe a sigh of relief when president trump absconded off to mar-a-lago, when president biden took the podium and said he would fight against white supremacy, poverty, illness and inequality — when he said, my whole soul is in this.
he got more than that, outlasting senators, governors and others far more seasoned.
five years later, mr. wofford helped arrange and underwrite a month-long tour of india for martin and coretta king to meet many of gandhi's disciples. the trip widened king's vision and gave him a more sophisticated view of how social injustice and evil could be combated by the method of nonviolence, historian david j. garrow wrote in his pulitzer prize-winning biography of king, bearing the cross.
with the negotiations focused on the senate, trump remained on the sidelines for much of the weekend, using twitter to interject his opinions.
now, it is republican politicians who are fighting for their political preservation. in urbandale, the republican mayor switched parties. state house majority leader chris hagenow, seeking reelection, switched neighborhoods.
-- a recent court filing from special counsel bob mueller's team suggests paul manafort continued working on a russia-related issue after he was indicted. rosalind s. helderman reports: the four words of unredacted text suggest that in february 2018 — four months after manafort was first charged with crimes related to his work as a political consultant in ukraine — he still appears to have been working on a peace initiative for ukraine, a topic of intense interest to russia. and it suggests he was doing so in concert with konstantin kilimnik, a russian employee of his consulting firm who is alleged to have ties to russian intelligence. the revelation, potentially inadvertent, comes as manafort and mueller's legal team have been battling in court over whether manafort lied to prosecutors after he pleaded guilty in september to conspiring against the united states with his ukraine work and agreed to cooperate with the probe.
but he does grant the point: if the attorney general were a man, would we be doing this sketch? probably not. and let's say if a madeleine albright, a short little, quote `normal' woman was the attorney general, i don't know if we . . . it's weird. i hate to break it down into something as simple as the fact that she's tall, but it's almost as simple as that. she is, yes, tall. and she's 10 minutes late, which is uncharacteristic. one universally accepted truth about janet reno is that she starts meetings on time. this day, though, something has held her up. while she does not explain what that something was, she walks out of her office with hand extended, unapologetic but not at all arrogant, walking with a slight stoop that seems intended to de-emphasize the six-foot-oneness of her. `miss reno' is fine, she says. or maybe she said ms. reno. it's hard to tell. she talks softly, not tough, not xena, not terminator, not the person you imagine from the high-octane confrontations, sort of mumbling the comment into her shoulder as she walks head-down back to her office, having answered a question that's often put: what to call her. it's become a regular shtick between her and members of congress, who persist in calling her general, perhaps because they still don't know, after five years, exactly what they should be calling her. reno doesn't want to be called general.
soon, the telegenic priest was sharing his views as a regular on political talk shows such as crossfire and meet the press, and on the eternal word television network, a catholic cable channel. political washington didn't just take notice, it embraced him. he kept company with a rotating cast of right-of-center bigwigs, including judge robert h. bork, sen. sam brownback (r-kan.), economist larry kudlow and former house speaker newt gingrich (r-ga.), all of whom he helped convert to catholicism. articles described him as the catholic church's k street lobbyist, a firm voice, fostering faith and a crusader.

reno threw an arm around him, told him that she liked big, strong, handsome, kind, sensitive, intelligent men, and added, i understand why you might be confused. it was an adroit, sensitive parry of a label – dyke! – that many women are confronted with at some point or other, one that's so difficult to handle because, in responding, one runs the risk of protesting too much, or implying that there's something wrong with homosexuality. moreover, it's a label that's impossible to disprove. women, often, are polarizing, says political consultant carter eskew, something that will come as no surprise to working mothers, or to stay-at-home mothers, or to single mothers, or to unmarried women, or to women without children. everybody has an opinion about the most personal choices a woman can make, and naturally these opinions get translated to the public arena. reno thus remains an easy target despite her olympian disregard of the rumormongers. in washington, moreover, she also unnerves people because she is so introverted, such an inveterate non-schmoozer. during the week, she works. on weekends, she works, and, when she has a chance, hikes the c&o canal or kayaks the potomac – behavior that baffles the a-list crowd. washington, particularly in the corridors of power, is a very normative environment, jamie gorelick says. so wonderful qualities that are endearing in another community are deemed unacceptable here.
the republican party right now is in a bit of an identity crisis within the beltway in washington, d.c., gaetz told reynolds. the establishment is trying to reconstitute a lot of the power they lost in the party during the trump era, and those of us who've embraced the energetic populism of president trump want to be able to maintain that going forward. in wyoming, you have the clearest example of an establishment figure who didn't like the president, who opposed many of his policies, and is doing all she can to seize power in washington.
most of the babies who survived were offered up for adoption, including in the united states, often without full consent by the mothers.
but others are fearful that such laws could give government workers license to discriminate.
• raise social security benefits for people over the age of 78, for those with low income and for widows and widowers.
even federalists come down on both sides of some of these questions. in 2013, years after he spoke at the founding federalist society symposium, and after he won bush v. gore, ted olson returned to the supreme court to overturn a california proposition banning same-sex marriage. for their part, many liberal scholars and lawyers continue to reject originalism in favor of a vision of the constitution flexible enough to embrace changing times and evolving notions of human rights. still, even critics of originalism are forced to acknowledge the new reality: despite recent work demonstrating the bankruptcy of these [originalist] approaches, liberal lawyers trying to get progressive results at the supreme court have already begun trying to pick off conservative justices through a calculated embrace of the theories, richard hasen, a professor of law and political science at the university of california at irvine, wrote recently in slate.
the senate passed a bill giving localities the option of allowing public-sector collective bargaining. how the two versions will be reconciled is uncertain.
-- a latino marine veteran who was born in grand rapids, mich., was detained by ice for possible deportation. eli rosenberg reports: jilmar ramos-gomez, whose service as a lance corporal and tank crewman included time in afghanistan, was born in the michigan city of 200,000. … 'i immediately called ice and shouted at them,' [immigration lawyer richard kessler] said. 'and they called me back and said, kind of, oops, yeah, come and get him. they didn't say, our bad, but kind of implied that.' ramos-gomez's story rocketed to national attention on wednesday after the [aclu] called for the county to investigate how an american citizen and decorated veteran was taken into ice custody.
the sheer volume of legislation democrats unloaded this year has been staggering, leading to an unusual number of long floor sessions and late-night committee meetings.
-- the third annual women's march on saturday is expected to draw far fewer attendees than the past two years. marissa j. lang reports: allegations of anti-semitism, secretive financial dealings, infighting and disputes over who gets to own and define the women's march have dogged organizers for months and led to calls for national co-chairs to resign. … several high-profile supporters and progressive organizations declined to participate in the rally this year. women who previously went out of their way to attend are opting to stay home and support independent groups. jewish women remain torn about attending at all. even the weather seems to be conspiring against the event.
key quote: he added americans who want to receive a vaccination should be able to do so by this spring, but cautioned it's going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we've ever tried in this country.
teresa wolff, a longtime democratic organizer in the sioux city area, said her two grown daughters are often enlightening me on things i have held firm on. even though wolff has long considered herself a feminist, she said her daughters will sometimes reprimand her for hesitating to speak out or privately saying that a female candidate needs to wait, learn her place before running for office.
heather higgins, the group's president and chief executive, expressed doubts on fox news about the memory of the woman accusing kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades ago. if you have a weak standard of evidence, then what you are doing is guaranteeing that future nominations will all be last-minute character assassinations and circuses, said higgins, who records show is paid $311,000 as the leader of independent women's voice.
long before steven universe's emmy nominations and a peabody award, the animator didn't think her bisexual journey was relevant because i had been so isolated from anyone who would understand her experience. she says there wasn't fodder on kids' television to bond over, while growing up in her silver spring, md., neighborhood before attending new york's school of visual arts.
now bezos, who also owns the washington post, is being asked to put the enormous economic power of his company behind the effort. amazon plans to hire up to 50,000 people in another city and has narrowed the field to 20 locations. eleven of the locations are in nine states — florida, georgia, indiana, north carolina, ohio, pennsylvania, tennessee, texas and virginia — that have not passed comprehensive legal protections for people based on their sexuality or gender. some additionally restrict adoption rights for gay couples, bar transgender people from using the bathrooms of their choice or have banned cities from instituting equal rights protections of their own.
in kaplan's third trump case, she represents participants in acn, a multilevel marketing company promoted on the celebrity apprentice. they're suing not acn, but the former host and his three oldest children, accusing them of committing fraud in endorsing the company as a promising business opportunity.
we are trying to funnel sex workers into the mainstream, she told the globe and mail. we've got to demystify it. we've got to accept them as human beings.
the 'let's hold hands and be bipartisan' shtick will not work, one operative said.
there's so much more willingness now to go to a single-payer system, said bret nilles, the democratic chairman in linn county, a population center in finkenauer's district. ten years ago, i thought we'd never get to that point.
-- a u.s. law firm briefly entangled in mueller's probe agreed to pay $4.6 million for failing to report its work for ukraine. matt zapotosky and tom hamburger report: the firm — skadden, arps, slate, meagher & flom — conceded it should have registered as a foreign agent in 2012, when it was hired in a deal facilitated by [manafort] to prepare a report about the prosecution of former ukrainian prime minister yulia tymoshenko.
content analysis shows most of these measures use the words sex and gender interchangeably and define both as strictly biological, determined by chromosomes and based on physical anatomy at the time of birth. this contrasts with more contemporary understandings detaching gender — determined by social and legal norms — from biology, or sex. collapsing sex and gender together thus allows opponents of transgender rights to assert biology determines gender.
demi used her speech to aggressively kiss colton in front of everyone — which, had the gender roles been reversed, would have raised many, many eyebrows. then demi went on to commit a cardinal sin during the group date: she touched the rose.
to close the gala, mcgahn and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell settle in armchairs below the giant madison heads for an onstage tete-a-tete, during which they all but spike the football over the current pace of appointing conservatives to all levels of the federal judiciary — the judges project, as mcconnell calls it. at the appeals court level, in particular, trump has made more appointments than all other presidents at the same point in their presidencies, according to research by russell wheeler, a visiting fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution. (at the district court level, however, trump's pace lags behind that of george w. bush and bill clinton.) my goal … is to do everything we can for as long as we can to transform the federal judiciary, because everything else we do is transitory, mcconnell says. the closest thing we will ever have an opportunity to do to have the longest impact on the country is confirming these great men and women and transforming the judiciary for as long into the future as we can. mcconnell notes that the judges list played a big part in getting trump elected. the majority leader looks out over the gathering almost mistily as he concludes: i hope you are proud of what we've done.
buttigieg, who was elected south bend mayor in 2011, will not run for a third term.
in the two years following its formation, the bh group received more than $4 million from the judicial crisis network, a related group called the judicial education project and a third nonprofit in the network called the wellspring committee, all of them connected to leo through funding, personnel and the same accountant, irs filings show. the groups described the payments in irs filings as consulting, research and public relations fees.
sanders's consistency was one of his greatest assets in 2016, but the next democratic field will probably include several candidates who've never really changed. neither warren nor john delaney had run for office before 2012. sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) has always been a center-left politician, evolving on only same-sex marriage; sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) has a voting record that doesn't start until january 2017, though she is already taking fire for her record as a california prosecutor. many others with longer résumés will have changes to account for.
crc's president, greg mueller, describes himself as a friend of leo. mueller's firm gained prominence during the presidential campaign of 2004 for helping to promote the swift boat allegations, unsubstantiated claims that democratic candidate john f. kerry's war record in vietnam was exaggerated. among its clients now is the federalist society.
that reality, which cost harris an opportunity to fight for what mattered to her, has left her priorities far from clear.
his time, he said, had come and gone.
i've watched democrats being accused of different crimes, house republican leader kevin mccarthy (r-calif.) said after stripping king of his committee assignments. i've watched democrats say things that are offensive to all americans. the real challenge here: i've watched the speaker be silent.
and that was on top of earlier action to pass gun control, ease abortion restrictions and enact the equal rights amendment.
it's a remarkably successful example of what political scientists call a political epistemic community — an interconnected network of experts with policy-relevant knowledge who share certain beliefs and work to actively transmit and translate those beliefs into policy, as amanda hollis-brusky argued in her 2015 book, ideas with consequences: the federalist society and the conservative counterrevolution. hollis-brusky documented the impact of such a community: focusing on key recent supreme court decisions on hot-button issues such as campaign finance, gun control and state sovereignty, she found that as many as two dozen people with federalist society connections played some role in crafting the arguments, arguing the cases, clerking for the judges or issuing the rulings.
while wolff says she has always supported same-sex marriage, she remembers a time when it was just not an issue that was publicly discussed — and now her daughters are coaching her on lgbtq issues and helping her understand gender matters.
the church's teachings condemning same-sex marriage have attracted criticism and protests. an online petition by keep el monte friendly, a group that organized the protests against first works baptist church, to expel the church from el monte has received more than 15,000 signatures.
trump is a classic case study of what psychologists call masculine overcompensation. after future vanity fair editor graydon carter called him a short-fingered vulgarian in 1988, trump reportedly spent 25 years sending him pictures of his hands, digits circled in gold sharpie, to prove otherwise. when marco rubio picked up on the theme in 2016, trump turned the next republican debate into a nationally televised member-measuring contest: he referred to my hands — 'if they're small, something else must be small.' i guarantee you there's no problem. i guarantee.
with the election of george w. bush, leo began working as an outside adviser for the white house on initiatives related to judicial nominations. among his allies was kavanaugh, then white house associate counsel.
i was never management, she declared.
by the time she was an experienced showrunner on steven universe, she had a front seat to the ideas that i had been fed indirectly as a child. it felt like i had all this radiation from a distance, and now i was right up close to the sun.
this thrust buttigieg into a whirlwind of attention and travel that spat him out in los angeles a week later, where he sat in the back of a black suv headed through west hollywood on his way to shake hands with stars such as greg louganis and billy eichner. buttigieg said that day he didn't think the rigors of campaigning for the presidency would require much of an adjustment, but he admitted, i don't love repeating myself.
elizabeth warren. as first reported by the post's jeff stein, she will unveil a plan with a new tax on americans with more than $50 million in assets.
he would go to events with some of the most progressive people in the state, and someone would stand up and ask: 'what are you going to do about illegal immigration?'  vietor said. he'd start with the whole litany of punitive proposals, from people 'going to the back of the line' to how they needed to learn english.
in december 2016, while leo worked on trump's transition team, bh group donated $1 million to trump's inaugural committee, according to a campaign finance disclosure.
the obvious answer here is to tell my niece and her fianc that they will have to make other plans. can you suggest how to do that?
warnock received less than 33 percent of the vote in the november special election featuring 20 candidates. the two leading gop candidates — loeffler and rep. douglas a. collins (r.-ga.) — earned nearly 46 percent of the vote combined. no one reaching 50 percent meant that, under georgia law, that race and the race between ossoff and perdue would go to runoffs.
he later told the philadelphia inquirer that he returned to seventh grade as a know-it-all foreign policy expert. his fascination with activism was ignited. within a few years, he had organized the first chapter of the student federalists, which later merged with other groups to form what is now citizens for global solutions.
at 35, warnock became the youngest pastor of ebenezer after holding leadership positions at churches in birmingham, ala., baltimore and new york.
a normal politician might be miffed at the low turnout. a regular human being might not be looking quite so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed under the circumstances. but normal and regular are not adjectives that apply to the son of a maltese immigrant father and an army brat mom who grew up in decaying south bend, got himself into harvard, summer-interned for ted kennedy, worked for john kerry's presidential campaign, won a rhodes scholarship, learned arabic in tunisia, landed a jet-setting consultant's job, left it to return to his beat-up hometown and become the youngest mayor of a midsize u.s. city, transformed that city into a national model of renewal, and then — deep breath — volunteered for active duty in afghanistan while serving as mayor, came out as gay in the local newspaper, married a schoolteacher live on youtube, turned heads in a dark-horse bid to lead the democratic national committee, and had the new york times's frank bruni gushing about him as potentially the first gay president— all by age 36.
i t's unclear whether mr. trump will target her seat, or simply her leadership post in the house, but advisers said they anticipated that he would take opportunities to damage her, per haberman and epstein.
some said they felt harris was trying to have it both ways — pushing for change only when it was politically expedient. while she was a prosecutor, harris opposed legalization of marijuana and argued for higher bail fees as a deterrent to crime in san francisco. harris is now a staunch opponent of cash bail, arguing that it penalizes the poor, and a prominent advocate of legalization, which has grown more politically popular since her prosecutor days.
no queens-born developer had just been elected straight from tv, as a reality star, and then one was, garcetti said.
her experience in politics, she argued, was greater than many voters realized.
-- two other top democratic recruits to keep an eye on: will stacey abrams take on david perdue in georgia? does tom vilsack challenge joni ernst in iowa? both are keeping the door open.
she is doubtless the best-known attorney general since robert f. kennedy; citizens who couldn't pick william barr out of a police line-up approach her in airports to confide some personal outrage. but even now – or maybe especially now, with the spin and finger-pointing that followed her decision not to appoint the independent counsel to investigate clinton and vice president gore – the images of janet reno are dizzyingly multifarious. in today's political climate, with the parties battling for any incremental advantage, it's probably not surprising that the democrats are spinning her one way and the republicans another – that she's been portrayed, alternately and with equal conviction, as a flinty individualist and a pandering white house loyalist: a paragon of public virtue is how rep. tom lantos (d-calif.) put it, not long after jim nicholson, chairman of the republican national committee, had gone on record saying how sad it was to see janet reno shredding her last remaining bit of credibility. and given her earlier career as state attorney in dade county, fla., and her current position as head, and figurehead, of the justice department – which is to say, the main justice facility, the u.s. attorney operations, the bureau of prisons, the immigration and naturalization service, the fbi, the drug enforcement administration and the u.s. marshals service – it's probably also not surprising that she has attracted the ravings of a subterranean lunatic fringe.
derry, the state representative, knew most of the activists at the forum. after all, she had hosted them at a late-in-the-season holiday party the night before. the activists, all women, ate cookies and cheesecake and sat around her christmas tree, speckled with blue ornaments — a tradition that started in 2016 as a symbolic protest of trump. they discussed the pop star lizzo and their husbands and how to come up with a strategy to get another friend elected to zaun's seat.
on tuesday, the president's staff — realizing his silence was untenable — reached out to robin roberts, anchor of abc's good morning america. the president, roberts was informed, wanted to tape a one-on-one interview with her the following day — but what exactly the president wanted to say wasn't made clear.
limbaugh took the bait. the next day on his show, he claimed that buttigieg was mad about his comments, and said trump had called to encourage him to never apologize for them. now that buttigieg had apparently lured trump into the mix, he delivered the coup de grace at a town hall in las vegas on tuesday: i mean, sorry, but one thing about my marriage is it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse with him or her.
but his campaign has also been realistic about its poll numbers, which allowed him to declare victory in iowa before official results came in. his sunday exit suggests his campaign's internal numbers showed buttigieg would not be able to stay within striking distance of sanders.
