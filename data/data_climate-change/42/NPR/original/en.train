donald trump's messy ideas for handling the national debt, explained\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jason redmond/afp/getty images jason redmond/afp/getty images\n\nthe u.s. has $19 trillion in debt, and donald trump is upset about it.\n\nonce upon a time, he said he would get rid of all of it in eight years. he walked that back, but his positions on how to handle that debt are still making headlines. just a few days ago, it seemed like trump wanted to renegotiate america's debt with the nation's creditors — a potentially disastrous policy. then it seemed like he was offering a subtler solution. then he said the u.s. government could print money to stave off default.\n\nnothing — not even policy positions — sit still for long in the 2016 election. this same weekend, trump clarified his positions on two other major economic policy areas. if you haven't been keeping up, here's a quick recap of trump's changing statements:\n\nwhat did trump initially say about debt?\n\non cnbc's squawk box on thursday, andrew ross sorkin initially brought up the idea of renegotiating debt repayment, in the context of trump's past business dealings. here's a video and transcript, emphasis added.\n\nars: do you believe that we in terms of the united states need to pay 100 cents on the dollar? or do you think there's actually ways that we could renegotiate that debt? dt: i think, look. i've borrowed knowing that you can pay back with discounts. and i've done very well with debt. now of course i was swashbuckling, and it did well for me, and it was good for me and all of that. and you know debt was always sort of interesting to me. now we're in a different situation with a country, but i would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal. and if the economy was good it was good so therefore you can't lose. it's like you make a deal before you go into a poker game. and your odds are much better.\n\nthat bolded bit, about making a deal on debt, caused mass freakout in the financial press, and for good reason. suggesting that u.s. creditors accept haircuts on u.s. debt (that is, accept lower payouts than they agreed to) would be an unheard-of, potentially disastrous policy proposition.\n\nbut then his meaning got muddier. anchor becky quick asked him twice if he really meant he wanted to renegotiate debt. on his second answer, he seemed to change positions:\n\nbq: you're not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds that the u.s. has already issued. dt: no, i don't want to renegotiate the bonds, but i think you can do discounting. i think depending on where interest rates are, i think you can buy back. i'm not talking about with a renegotiation, but you can buy back at discounts, you can do things at discounts. i'm not even suggesting that we don't borrow money at very low rates long term so we don't have to worry about when they come due.\n\nso what exactly was he saying?\n\ngreat question.\n\nin that first answer, he seemed to say he would want creditors to accept lower payments.\n\nand that's not just a big deal; that's a gargantuan deal. the prospect of investors in u.s. debt accepting less on the dollar than they are owed could tank the economy (more on that later).\n\nbut even then, his later answer made muddier exactly what he meant. trump went on to say he didn't want to renegotiate but rather wanted to discount or refinance u.s. treasurys. that could very well mean he still wanted to offer creditors lower rates, said one economist. but there's another reading.\n\nhe keeps mentioning interest rates, so being charitable, he could mean that the united states should buy back debt when its price falls, said michael strain, economics fellow at the right-leaning american enterprise institute.\n\nwhat's the fuss?\n\nif the government asked investors to accept less on the dollar than they are owed, it would be phenomenally bad for the economy.\n\nthere are no merits to it, strain said. he added, the extent to which u.s. treasurys are kind of the foundation on which the global financial system is built is really hard to overstate.\n\nfor one thing, it would send interest rates on treasurys soaring and destroy the u.s. treasury's risk-free status. that's what strain means by foundation; right now, everyone knows and trusts that u.s. debt is a safe investment. treasurys are used in all sorts of financial transactions worldwide. they're in many people's retirement accounts as a low-risk asset. rattling faith in that treasury would introduce massive amounts of uncertainty into the economy.\n\nplus, it would cause interest rates on u.s. debt to soar. that would mean higher borrowing costs for the u.s. government — making the very fiscal situation trump is worried about even worse.\n\nall of this could dry up credit markets, as the uncertainty could make banks far less likely to lend money. cut back on borrowing and lending, and you deliver a huge blow to the economy.\n\nit's not even clear how this idea would work, says one financial expert — creditors wouldn't have much of an incentive to take the deal, with the u.s. currently on firm financial footing.\n\ntypically the goal of a sovereign default is for a country to reset its borrowings base in order to make sure it can be fiscally sustainable going forward, said guy lebas, chief fixed income strategist at janney. and creditors or lenders have an interest in participating in that process, because they believe they can get the best return from negotiation.\n\nwhat is trump saying now?\n\nhe says that all along, he just wanted the u.s. government to buy back debt at lower prices.\n\nif there's a chance to buy back debt at a discount, interest rates up and the bonds down, and you can buy debt. that's what i'm talking about, he said, as reported by politico.\n\nso if that's what trump wants, how would this work? it's a complicated proposition, but dean baker at the left-leaning center on economic and policy research explains in a blog post:\n\nif interest rates rise, the situation trump described, the market value of long-term debt falls. for example, a 30-year bond issued in 2015 at an interest rate of less than 3.0 percent, might sell for less than 70 percent of its nominal value if the long-term interest rate crosses 6 or 7 percent, which it certainly could. the treasury could buy up long-term debt in the market at its current market value, and replace it with new debt that paid a higher interest rate. this won't change the interest payments owed by the government, but it would reduce the nominal value of the debt outstanding.\n\nlong story short: it would lower the debt level but raise the interest rate the u.s. is paying altogether, essentially trading one problem for the other. why would we do that? in baker's telling, this is a solution only insofar as someone cares a lot about nominal debt levels and debt-to-gdp ratios (and it's not clear that trump does).\n\nas lebas told npr, unless somehow the u.s. were running a surplus, buying back debt at a discount wouldn't do much good.\n\nif the u.s. were running a deficit and interest rates rose, the government could buy back its debt at discount prices, he said. but then it would have to issue more debt at a higher interest rate to fund the buyback, which would be a wash.\n\ntrump has also created new shock waves by saying — in this case quite clearly — that the u.s. can't default, because it prints money. that's true, but that doesn't mean it's good policy (as in, it could easily cause massive inflation).\n\nwhat exactly has this whole exercise taught us?\n\naside from the economics lesson, it provided a picture of one of the trump campaign's biggest recent weaknesses. his clarifications on the u.s. debt also came in the midst of a weekend in which trump clarified his position on two other major economic issues: trump said he thought the minimum wage should be raised on a state-by-state level. in november, he had said in a debate that he thought wages were too high.\n\nand in the same weekend that he wrestled with how to tackle the debt, he explained, then re-explained, his tax plan (which the tax policy center said would raise deficits by $9.5 trillion over 10 years): he at first in an interview with nbc seemed to say he would raise taxes on the wealthy.\n\nbut then he clarified that he meant that after negotiating with congress, taxes might end up higher than the low rates he initially proposed, but they would end up lower than they are now.\n\nall of which is to say that it's not clear the trump campaign has settled positions on a range of economic policy issues. these kinds of clarifications and policy shifts give the clinton campaign ample ammunition for attacking trump in two ways: one, for potentially harmful economic policies, and two, for not having firm policy principles.\n\nthat's bad for trump. any time that a candidate has to spend playing defense — explaining policies or wording choices, for example — is time he or she is not spending playing offense.
stimulus cash payments may take up to 20 weeks to reach some americans\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption drew angerer/getty images drew angerer/getty images\n\nupdated at 8:28 a.m. et\n\npeople who do not have direct deposit information on file with the internal revenue service may have to wait up to 20 weeks to receive cash payments included in the $2 trillion coronavirus relief legislation, according to a memo drafted by house democrats.\n\nthis time frame is longer than the estimate that treasury secretary steven mnuchin gave when he negotiated the program for cash payments with congressional leaders. he acknowledged it would take more time for those who didn't have addresses on file but suggested on sunday that he expected payments to go out by mid-april.\n\nthe irs is expected to make roughly 60 million direct deposit payments in mid-april, but paper checks will take significantly longer, according to a copy of the memo obtained by npr. the irs is expected to begin issuing paper checks about three weeks after the direct deposits are completed and can issue about 5 million checks per week. the timeline is subject to change, the memo states, but the estimates are based on extensive conversations between staff on the house ways and means committee, at the treasury department and at the irs.\n\nthe checks will be distributed to people with the lowest adjusted gross income first with the highest earners receiving payments last, according to the memo. the irs is encouraging people to file their 2019 taxes quickly to ensure that their latest direct deposit and address information is on file. there will eventually be a portal to allow taxpayers to find out the status of their rebate and update their direct deposit but that may not be ready until the end of april or early may.\n\nat the coronavirus task force briefing on thursday, mnuchin denied the 20-week timeline, and said if we don't have your information, you'll have a simple web portal. you'll upload it. if we don't have that, will send you checks in the mail. he said that process would take weeks and not months.\n\nhe said the administration was working with digital companies, prepaid debit cards, and others to make sure we have a process that every american gets their money quickly. this money does people no good if it shows up in four months, and we will deliver on that promise.\n\nconcerns over the delivery of the cash payments come as democrats rush to create a system for holding agencies accountable during the rollout of the massive relief bill. house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif, announced thursday the creation of a bipartisan select committee on the coronavirus crisis that will be tasked with oversight of programs like the cash payments.\n\nthe committee will be empowered to examine all aspects of the federal response to the coronavirus to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being wisely and efficiently spent to save lives, deliver relief and benefit our economy, pelosi said in a letter to democrats.\n\nsome democrats have already begun calling for a broader investigation into the trump administration's handling of the crisis so far. pelosi did not rule out the possibility of launching a backwards-looking investigation similar to the 9/11 commission but said the priority now is making sure the new federal funds are spent appropriately.

from 'once' to 'sing street': director john carney infuses movies with music\n\nthe irish director and screenwriter talks to fresh air about his new film, which tells the story of a young teenager in 1980s dublin who discovers pop music and starts a band.\n\ndave davies, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross. music often plays a part in the work of our next guest, irish film director john carney. his 2007 independent film once, about two struggling musicians in dublin, was a surprise hit, winning an oscar for best song and inspiring a tony award-winning broadway musical.\n\ncarney's new film, sing street, loosely based on his own life, is about a young teenager in dublin in the '80s who discovers pop music and starts a band. the main character, connor, is having a difficult time. his parents are constantly fighting and possibly splitting up. because of their financial troubles, connor is forced to change schools. in the new school, he's bullied by other boys and by the catholic brothers who run it. one day, he spots a girl and to impress her, tells her he's in a band. he isn't but quickly puts one together.\n\nproducer ann marie baldonado spoke to john carney and they started with a clip. connor's band has made a cassette recording and he's playing it for his older brother, brendan, who's been schooling him on '80s pop music. brendan doesn't like what he hears and is aggravated that it's a cover and not an original song and he starts pulling the cassette apart. connor is played by ferdia walsh-peelo and his brother brendan is played by jack reynor.\n\n(soundbite of film, sing street)\n\njack reynor: (as brendan) that was bad, bad music. and there is nothing as bad in this world as bad music.\n\nferdia walsh-peelo: (as connor) you know you can record over tapes?\n\nreynor: (as brendan) no. that was a novelty act. you want to have actual sexual intercourse right?\n\nwalsh-peelo: (as connor) yeah - wait, what?\n\nreynor: (as brendan) the girl. it's all about the girl, isn't it?\n\nwalsh-peelo: (as connor) yeah, the girl, yeah.\n\nreynor: (as brendan) and you're going to use somebody else's art to get her - are you kidding?\n\nwalsh-peelo: (as connor) we're just starting. we need to learn how to play.\n\nreynor: (as brendan) did the sex pistols know how to play? you don't need to know how to play. who are you, steely dan? you need to learn how to not play, connor. that's the trick, that's rock 'n' roll. and that takes practice. and you're not a covers band, by the way.\n\nwalsh-peelo: (as connor) really?\n\nreynor: (as brendan) no. every school has a covers band. every pub has a covers band. every wedding has a covers band. and every covers band has a middle-aged member who'll never know whether they could've made it in the music industry or not because they never had that the [expletive] to write a song for someone else. rock 'n' roll is a risk. you risk being ridiculed.\n\nwalsh-peelo: (as connor) but i don't know how to write a song.\n\nreynor: (as brendan) close that door and sit down.\n\nwalsh-peelo: (as connor) really?\n\nreynor: (as brendan) it's going to be a long night.\n\nwalsh-peelo: (as connor) i have school in the morning.\n\nreynor: (as brendan) this is school.\n\nann marie baldonado, byline: john carney, welcome to fresh air.\n\njohn carney: nice to be here.\n\nbaldonado: can you describe what dublin was like in the '80s, in the time that your movie takes place?\n\ncarney: i felt that the '80s were the '60s in dublin in a sense, if you know what i mean. ireland didn't really have the '60s, the sexual liberation and the - you know, that the rest of the world had - or certain parts of the world. and so it came sort of 20 years later.\n\nso the '80s felt as a young kid that there was something going on, you know, a feeling that the, sort of, the church were finally sort of losing their grip. people were beginning to experiment with sexual identity. they were beginning to experiment more outrageously with clothes.\n\nand i think i was in school right in the middle of that period. and it was a very interesting place to be 'cause it really felt like a very backward place and it felt like it was just beginning to sort of change and come into its own.\n\nbaldonado: well, speaking of the catholic church's influence, the parents in the story - connor's parents - are kind of in the process of ending their marriage. they wish they could divorce but historically, i guess, at this time period divorce wasn't legal in ireland, in the 1980s, is that right?\n\ncarney: correct.\n\nbaldonado: yeah, so people who wanted to get divorced still had to stay together and that's sort of a tension in connor's household.\n\ncarney: i think that was the case in so many households, actually. i mean, firstly the church wouldn't have permitted it. it was very, very rare that you would know of a street with a particular house that was like, oh, that's the couple who split up because everybody else stuck together. and it was part of what you said and believed when you got married, but also it was supervised by the church and state.\n\nand it was also - there was another factor in all of this, which was money. nobody had any cash. you couldn't afford to have two cars or two lives or two flats or two houses. you stayed together because it's cheaper to run a family, right? it's cheaper to run one family under one roof than it is to run two.\n\nbaldonado: yeah, there is a scene at the very beginning of the film where connor, the main character, is in his room writing a song, just fooling around on his guitar and his parents are fighting outside and he starts sort of incorporating the argument that they're having, like, if we didn't share mortgage i would leave you.\n\nand then he turns that into a lyric for the song and it's kind of, like, you get the sense that the character is kind of processing what's happening through the music but kind of escaping through the music as well.\n\ncarney: yeah, right, exactly, it's kind of like standup or something.\n\nbaldonado: so the band that the group of kids start is called sing street and they go to a school called sing street and i think you shot there, is that right?\n\ncarney: correct.\n\nbaldonado: so you shot in the school that you went to when you were in high school. what was that like, shooting back there?\n\ncarney: it was like a prisoner coming back to alcatraz now that it's a sort of a tourist spot. school to me was like a prison. i didn't want to go and i was a fish out of water. i wasn't a good student. so it felt very much like restraint.\n\nand so coming back as an adult and also kind of particularly as a film director - you know, film director is, you know, it's a very hierarchical kind of thing and you're at the top of the tree and, you know, you kind of have a megaphone and jodhpurs and a whip. and you're the boss in a sense. so it was kind of funny being back in a position of complete authority from one of completely subservient student life, you know, 30 years earlier.\n\nbaldonado: now, the original songs in sing street are just wonderful and in many of your films you work with collaborators on the music. could you give us an example from one of the songs where you and gary clark - and let me just say that gary clark was in the band danny wilson, which maybe in the u.s. their biggest hit was mary's prayer in the '80s, just to give a little background...\n\ncarney: yeah.\n\nbaldonado: ...can you describe how the two of you came up with any song in particular and if you could sort of point to the elements - the '80s elements - that you wanted to make sure that were in that song?\n\ncarney: my songs are the songs that i had sort of half-written. he kind of pushed incredible choruses on them or great hooks, lyrically. i can give you a good example. there's a song in the film, which is one of the first songs connor writes, and it's called the riddle of the model and the film is about a guy who sees a girl who claims she's a model, this young kid who's sort of a 16-year-old. so i wrote that name, the riddle of the model. i thought it was very pretentious and very sort of appropriate for a young kid in the '80s. and he started adding in words like, you know, she's so indefinable, she holds the key to the missing code.\n\nand we started to form this song, which was sort of, like, it's hard to describe. but there was a kind of like an art college movement in the sort of late '70s, early '80s in england of sort of i'm too good for pop music. i'm kind of an artist and i'm an intellectual but oh god, here we go. i have to be in a band. and to imagine being sort of 18 and you're still little bit spotty, you've got a little bit of acne but it's, like, 1981 and you've learned some big words from reading albert camus and you're now writing a song.\n\nwe just - we started from there and we put words like stipulation and we tried to put lots of long words and cram them into sort of poppy sort of choruses and key changes and stuff. and we just had a blast. and it was very good fun trying to actually write from that perspective. but also to try to keep it catchy and fun and try and keep the song sort of - to have a sort of - a kind of an '80s feel to it.\n\nbaldonado: well, why don't we take a listen to the song the riddle of the model from the movie sing street. it can also be found on the soundtrack.\n\n(soundbite of song, the riddle of the model)\n\nunidentified singer: (as character, singing) she's standing on the corner like an angel in disguise. and as i little closer she's got dangerous eyes. she tells me she's a model of international reputation, she's lightning in a bottle but there's a stipulation. she's so indecipherable. she holds the key to the missing code. just the thought of her touch my mind explodes. so desirable, time never will unfold. oh, oh, oh, the riddle of the model.\n\nbaldonado: that was the riddle of the model from the movie and soundtrack sing street. now, videos were very important to the character, connor. and of course the '80s was sort of the birth of mtv and other kinds of music television.\n\nand there's this great scene where the main family is watching a duran duran video and, you know, dad's saying, oh, this is rubbish. and the kids are sort of focusing on the video. do you remember the first video you saw and did it make an impact on you?\n\ncarney: i mean, i certainly remember the moment around the sort of tv when top of the pops would come on on a thursday evening where my entire family and my grandmother included - you know, who was born in 1913, you know, and i was born in 1972 - and we'd kind of sit around looking at the tv like we were sort of looking at fire. and in a sense it was like sitting around the fireplace of an irish country cottage, all gathered looking into the fire.\n\nthis thing suddenly came on air and in it, the traditional idea of a music show where you would get a live band or a band miming to playback in an audience - or, you know, on a stage with an audience - was gone because bands were touring around the world. and somebody came up with this great idea of let's shoot, like, a video, which represents the band and we can just replay that whenever we want, which is a great marketing idea.\n\nbut for the first 10 years of that, just nobody knew what they were doing. and they had a lot of money and a lot of cocaine and they were making videos around the world in these exotic locations. and there was this great sense that, like, aliens had taken control of the tv and were, like, beaming in this stuff, these little escapist three-minute sort of films.\n\nbaldonado: do you think videos were important to you becoming interested in filmmaking? i notice that connor's character, even - for the first video he has storyboards, you know, those illustrations that show each shot - that he wants to get for the video. did you make videos for your bands?\n\ncarney: i did make videos for bands, but i think kind of the opposite in a way. it was very much - i looked at videos just as a means of representing the music, not as a film in and of itself, not really anything to do with filmmaking. so when i moved from music into filmmaking, it was because i wanted to be friends with truffaut or, you know, martin scorsese or whatever.\n\ndavies: john carney speaking with ann marie baldonado. we'll hear more after a short break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ndavies: this is fresh air. we're listening to fresh air producer ann marie baldonado's interview with irish filmmaker john carney. his new movie is called sing street. before he got into filmmaking, carney was a musician.\n\nbaldonado: was there a time for you when you felt like you had to choose between music and filmmaking?\n\ncarney: yes.\n\nbaldonado: you know, you obviously use filmmaking as a way to examine music and the process of making music. but did you sort of have to consciously make a decision...\n\ncarney: yeah.\n\nbaldonado: ...to give it up?\n\ncarney: i did and i remember the location of it, and i remember the feeling of it, and i remember my age. i was 20, and i was sitting on a bed in the columbia hotel, which is a very famous rock 'n' roll hotel in london. and i was in a band and we had a record deal. and i had a - you know, i had a per diem. i had money in my pocket. and i was - you know, really as a young musician in school i had arrived. this was sort of perfect.\n\nwe were touring in england and i just was - had this incredible feeling of dissatisfaction. and i had bought a super 8 camera and i was starting to shoot silent movie footage, and i had a camcorder back in dublin, and we were doing sort of slasher videos and comedy sketches.\n\nand i remember being faced with this sort of decision that if i go with this band any further it's going to be harder each year or month to turn back and do a new - you know, reinvent myself or have a new career in filmmaking, which was really calling at me. and i remember quite distinctly sort of being faced with the decision of do i leave this band, and there's money in this band.\n\nand it's kind of what i always wanted - as a kid coming up - was to be in a band. that was sort of the dream. but at the time, actually, it was quite interesting. it was a no-brainer. the hard decision was only, oh, i'm going to be broke again.\n\nbaldonado: i want to ask a question about your 2007 movie once. it's a critically acclaimed film and even became a broadway show. and i always wonder, did you expect that this movie that you made, i think, for around 100,000 pounds would become this huge thing, this you know...\n\ncarney: yes, of course, i planned it exactly the way it went...\n\nbaldonado: yes, you totally knew it'd be a broadway show, a tony-winning...\n\ncarney: ...as you do.\n\nbaldonado: what was your reaction to all that?\n\ncarney: it was funny. last night, i met a very nice man called paul haggis at the screening of the film sing street and we were talking about that idea of, like, well, what's your obituary going to say? what will you always be associated with? and i was laughing at the once thing, which is, like, i think i could make anything.\n\nmy opening line is always going to be, oh, he's the guy who did that once thing. and paul haggis laughed. for him, it's crash. it's always, oh, you're the guy who did crash, and owning up to that and realizing, ok, i've made a film that meant a lot to a bunch of people at a certain time. that's a wonderful thing and you should never underestimate that. and you should never question it and if that's the thing that you're remembered for, god blessed. and that's fantastic.\n\nand i really do believe that and i'm aware that once is going to be that thing. i mean, that film - everything that was happening to the story of once was just an incredibly funny, wonderful, page-turning episode in its story. we went to sundance. getting into sundance to me as an irish independent filmmaker was like winning the booker - it was just like i couldn't believe it.\n\nand then we won an award there and then we went and we won an independent spirit award and people liked the film. and the soundtrack got a deal. and glen's career went on to just do beautiful things and marketa and everything seemed beautiful. i won an academy award.\n\nall this crazy stuff just kept unfolding in the story of that film. and then these guys were like we want to turn it into a broadway show and i was like, ok, fine, you know, as if anything else good could happen to this little film.\n\nbaldonado: i'd love to close with one of the original songs from sing street. would you like to pick one, a song that was written by the band in the film and performed by the band?\n\ncarney: yeah. i think a beautiful sea is a nice song to end. that's the one where they become cure heads. you know, people who know the cure and maybe even don't know the cure will instantly recognize the comparisons to in between days, which is one of my favorite cure songs.\n\nso there's a sort of an uplift in this song, a sort of an acoustic guitar-led (ph) sort of optimism and speed about its playing, which i really sort of enjoy. and it is - it gives the film a great sort of sense of forward motion and sort of uplift that i really like. that'd be a nice way to end on.\n\nbaldonado: john carney, thank you so much.\n\ncarney: thank you.\n\ndavies: john carney's new film is sing street. he spoke with producer ann marie baldonado.\n\n(soundbite of song, a beautiful sea)\n\nunidentified singer: (as character, singing) fake deals in the supermarket. tvs selling what you can't get. she laughs, nowhere is as pretty as this. green cars crawling in slow lane, lost stars waiting for the dark train. she smiles, turns and blows the city the kiss. under the waves i feel her pull my body down. under the waves she takes me where i want to drown. ah, give me miles away, she calls to me. this girl is a beautiful sea.\n\ndavies: on tomorrow's show, china scholar frank dikotter says newly opened archives document the chaos of the cultural revolution of the '60s when chairman mao urged students to take to the streets.\n\nfrank dikotter: you see teachers who have their hair torn out, pummeled by red guards or people being caned literally to death.\n\ndavies: dikotter says the years of violence destroyed the credibility of the communist party and led to economic changes in the country. his book is the cultural revolution: a people's history. i hope you can join us.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump's overhaul of federal family planning program faces multiple lawsuits\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption spencer platt/getty images spencer platt/getty images\n\ndays after its official publication, a new trump administration rule dramatically overhauling the federal title x family planning program is facing multiple legal challenges. several medical and reproductive rights groups, as well as 21 state attorneys general, have filed lawsuits challenging the rule, which bans any organization that provides or refers women for abortions from receiving funds through the program to provide services such as contraception and std screenings.\n\nthe latest lawsuit, filed wednesday by the center for reproductive rights, aims to block what abortion rights advocates are describing as a gag rule. crr is filing the suit on behalf of maine family planning, the sole title x grantee in maine.\n\ntaking the rug out from under them will basically decimate them, emily nestler, senior staff attorney for crr, said in an interview with npr. and because they essentially are family planning services in maine, will really decimate family planning services throughout the entire state, not to mention dramatically cutting back access to abortion.\n\nnestler said the maine group, which provides abortion services as well as family planning, heavily relies on title x funds to serve patients across the largely rural state.\n\nbecause they essentially are family planning services in maine, [this rule] will really decimate family planning services throughout the entire state.\n\nthe new rule, first proposed last year, is popular with social conservatives who have long campaigned to cut public funding to planned parenthood. federal funding for abortion is already illegal in most situations, but many abortion-rights opponents have cheered efforts by the trump administration to redirect funding for family planning services to organizations that do not provide or refer patients for abortions.\n\nreproductive rights groups argue a dramatic shift in the title x program could devastate networks that provide reproductive health care, including contraception, for low-income people.\n\nthe filing by crr follows a pair of related suits filed in federal court in oregon this week, one by planned parenthood and the american medical association, and another by the group of 21 state attorneys general. they argue the rule is unconstitutional and interferes with doctor-patient communication in a way that violates federal law, including the affordable care act.\n\nannouncing their suit in a conference call with reporters on tuesday, planned parenthood's president, dr. leana wen, said the rule compromises the ability of health care providers to provide full and accurate information to their patients. wen has said that planned parenthood, which serves about 40 percent of title x patients nationwide, will not be able to participate in the program if the rule stands.\n\nwe are fighting back on behalf of our patients and the ability of our doctors, nurses and health care professionals to practice compassionate, ethical and evidence-based medical care, wen said.\n\nthe national family planning and reproductive health association has announced plans to file its own suit in the coming days on behalf of its member clinics in conjunction with a clinic in washington state. on monday, essential access health, which administers title x grants in california, announced a lawsuit challenging the rule on behalf of patients in that state.\n\nthe legal battle could be a tough one, as julie rovner of kaiser health news has reported, because the supreme court has upheld similar rules in the past. but reproductive rights advocates believe the legal landscape has shifted over nearly three decades, and they're optimistic challenges to the trump administration rule will prevail.\n\nin a statement this week, marjorie dannenfelser of the anti-abortion rights group susan b. anthony list said, planned parenthood's allies are running to court to ensure taxpayers are forced to continue filling the coffers of the abortion industry and called for disentangling taxpayers from the big abortion industry.\n\nunless a judge blocks the new rule, it's set to take effect in a little less than two months.
biden leads in virginia poll ahead of super tuesday, edges past sanders, bloomberg\n\ntoggle caption daniella cheslow/wamu\n\nupdated at 12:56 p.m.\n\nvirginia sen. tim kaine (d) endorsed joe biden on friday in his run for the democratic presidential nomination. the hefty lift, just days before super tuesday, comes as a new poll shows the former vice president with a slight lead in virginia, ahead of rivals sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and former new york city mayor mike bloomberg.\n\nkaine, the former governor of virginia and hillary clinton's running mate in 2016, took aim at president trump in his endorsement of biden, writing, we deserve better in the oval office.\n\namerica is afflicted by a president who delights in division, cruelty, lies, and chaos. we deserve better in the oval office. in virginia's primary, i will proudly vote for @joebiden. joe has exemplary heart, character, and experience—and he's a leader our kids can look up to. — tim kaine (@timkaine) february 28, 2020\n\nbiden has received endorsements from a handful of other prominent democrats in virginia, including u.s. rep. donald mceachin and rep. elaine luria.\n\nkaine's endorsement came shortly after a poll by the wason center for public policy at christopher newport university showed biden gaining 22% of likely voters in the democratic primary. that's four points higher than biden scored in a feb. 18 poll conducted by monmouth university. sanders declined in support to 17%, but is still close behind. bloomberg, meanwhile, slid to 13%; he and sanders had previously been tied in first place.\n\nstill, biden faces an uphill battle, particularly as bloomberg threatens to attract notable support, potentially tipping the scales toward sanders.\n\nwere going to see a pretty competitive contest at the top three, biden, sanders and bloomberg, said poll co-author rachel bitecofer, assistant director of the wason center. there's potential for bloomberg to pull enough votes from biden, or vice versa, that sanders could thread the needle.\n\nformer south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren each earned 8% of likely primary voters in the poll. minnesota sen. amy klobuchar had 5% and billionaire tom steyer 1%. the remaining voters said they were undecided or chose another candidate.\n\nthe poll surveyed 866 registered voters, including 561 likely primary voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%.\n\nauthors of the poll caution that it was conducted throughout the month of february, a tumultuous month of campaigning, debates and early primary contests in iowa, new hampshire and nevada. biden placed poorly in those early states, trounced by sanders and buttigieg. polling ahead of south carolina's saturday primary shows biden could reverse his losses; he leads there by double digits, fueled by strong support from african american voters.\n\nameshia cross, a democratic strategist who served in the obama administration, said virginia's political dynamics hue closely to south carolina's.\n\nconsidering the diverse landscape of virginia and the strong black caucus leadership and advocacy there, the latest poll numbers aren't surprising, cross wrote to wamu in an email. virginia voters are pragmatic, realistic and want to carry the nation. many don't see democratic socialism as a winning policy ideology specifically for downballot races and maintaining the seats moderates won in trump districts in the midterms.\n\npoll co-author bitecofer said bloomberg has altered the playing field.\n\nbecause bloomberg suddenly enters this race and appears to be competitive in it, i really don't think that biden can win south carolina and suddenly win the nomination, bitecofer said. i think the party faces a real problem ... it's quite possible that sanders will become the nominee because the moderate flank is divided between two candidates.\n\nalthough biden secured the most prominent endorsements in virginia, the state's black leadership and the wider party have no clear favorite. various members of the virginia legislative black caucus endorsed biden, bloomberg and warren; and all six top presidential contenders have garnered endorsements from state lawmakers in the general assembly. congressman don beyer supports buttigieg, comparing him to former president obama at a recent rally in arlington.\n\nvirginia will send 99 delegates to the democratic national convention, fewer than heavyweight states like california and texas. nevertheless, the commonwealth is seen as an important indicator ahead of presidential elections and is a key campaign stop for candidates. bloomberg announced a saturday morning event in manassas, sanders was set to rally saturday afternoon in leesburg, and biden said he would meet supporters in norfolk. klobuchar planned to speak friday in falls church. buttigieg and warren also made earlier february stops in virginia.\n\nthe early contests give sanders 45 of the delegates to biden's 15. biden will likely narrow that gap in south carolina saturday, but super tuesday could shift the landscape once more. with 14 states voting, tuesday's primaries will determine how a full third of delegates to the democratic national convention will vote in july.\n\nthe friday poll revealed that voters in virginia continue to support tighter gun control, legalization of marijuana and expanding access to healthcare. however, bitecofer said she noticed those positions were tempered. a full 60% of respondents, support maintaining the current system of private health care insurance. cancelling all student debt was popular among just 15% of voters.\n\ni saw a preference for moderation and centrism in the policy preferences of the issues that i tested that are being talked about in the democratic primary, bitecofer said. medicare for all and student loan forgiveness, for example, the preference for virginia voters are modest reforms, not the full monty that the sanders campaign is offering.\n\nthe poll found virginia primary voters evenly split on whether they valued electability or agreement on issues, which bitecofer said was surprising given that sanders polls at 17%. if there were only one moderate candidate, she said, that person would likely far outpoll him.\n\nwhomever democrats choose, virginians surveyed appeared unlikely to vote for trump. in the wason center poll, 59% of voters said they would choose someone else over trump, and 82% said they would support the eventual nominee in the general election.\n\ndespite deep red southern and rural areas, virginia will likely be a challenge for trump in november; obama won twice in virginia, and clinton took the state by more than five points in 2016. over the past three years, the state has continued to shift blue, with democrats claiming the governor's office and flipping both chambers of the general assembly. the change is most pronounced in the northern virginia suburbs, where onetime republican strongholds have turned into democratic bastions.\n\nat a steakhouse in mclean this week, ads for bloomberg played on large tv screens mounted above the bar. marc steckel, a retired federal employee, said in 2016 he voted against republicans for the first time, choosing a third-party candidate. steckel, 63, said if he votes in the primary, he will likely pick klobuchar. he said in november, he would support any democratic nominee against trump – except sanders.\n\njust can't do it, steckel said. i'm afraid he'll turn this country into venezuela.\n\nsteckel said he was particularly concerned that public health insurance and other sanders ideas would raise taxes for his children.\n\nhair stylist rebekah harrington, 30, said she voted for republican presidential candidates until 2016, when she sat out the election. ahead of super tuesday, harrington said she was watching debates closely and favored buttigieg and steyer for their environmental programs. however, she wanted primarily to send a signal against the current occupant of the white house.\n\ni'm upset enough with trump and the republican party that i just want something that's not that, she said.
after iowa debacle, tech experts who aid progressives call for a strategic shake-up\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption daniel acke/bloomberg via getty images daniel acke/bloomberg via getty images\n\ndemocrats could avoid another tech meltdown like the one that afflicted the iowa caucuses with a better strategy for building the tools they need, progressive technology specialists say.\n\nthe origins of the iowa debacle are in a boom-and-bust cycle that places technology in competition with other priorities as time-crunched campaigns grapple with how best to spend as they hurtle toward an election.\n\nthe easy way to spend money, that's reliable, is on advertising, says evan henshaw-plath, a technologist who has built applications for progressive causes and was an early employee at twitter. spending money on technology is riskier and may or may not pay off.\n\nwhen campaigns commence, they hire staff, open offices, buy ads. when the campaign ends, the contracts end and the offices close. code that is written is often abandoned and forgotten.\n\nwe're rebuilding everything from scratch each cycle for everything that isn't finance and compliance, henshaw-plath says.\n\nwe aren't funding organizations that can survive from one cycle to the next, he adds. we aren't funding the technology to be maintained from one cycle to the next. and we aren't releasing the code in a maintainable way and picking up again on the next cycle.\n\nlight falls on shadow\n\nafter the iowa caucus, the spotlight swung to shadow, the small tech company that built the glitchy application that precinct chairs were supposed to use to report results.\n\nshadow's primary business is operating two applications for the progressive movement: a messaging product and a data integration tool.\n\nthe caucus app's lackluster performance brought scrutiny of the connections between shadow, its main investor acronym, and various figures and campaigns in the democratic party.\n\nsuch connections are no surprise in this corner of the tech world: it's common practice for democratic candidates and democrat-aligned causes to use political tools and technologies developed specifically for the left.\n\nthere are essentially separate, parallel universes of tech vendors that develop tools for either democrats or republicans — but not both.\n\nit is a pretty deeply held value within the progressive community that you want to put your money where your values are, says brady kriss, the founder and executive director of ragtag, a company that corrals tech workers who want to volunteer their skills to help progressive causes.\n\nit's not just about political competition. you don't want your money in any way, directly or indirectly, to go towards supporting issues or candidates that you find morally problematic.\n\nsome tech experts have said that using popular mainstream applications like google forms might have been a better choice for iowa, rather than relying on a custom-designed app built on a small budget under time pressure.\n\nusing products already in wide commercial use has another benefit: they're likely to be supported and maintained.\n\nif you're building on top of that, you don't have to worry about that infrastructure, kriss says. that really helps with the cyclical nature of campaigns and campaign tech. because it's very, very hard to keep a small application like a phone app or a large database base application updated when every other year, no one cares.\n\nbuilding beyond the campaign cycle\n\nadvocates and entrepreneurs have tried to target the boom-bust dynamic.\n\nhigher ground labs — a venture capital firm with the mission of supporting progressive tech companies for experimentation and iteration that's no longer dependent on election dates — was an investor in the company went on to become shadow.\n\nbut ann lewis, chief technology officer for moveon.org, says that cyclical fundraising cycles continue to affect progressive tech vendors.\n\none particular challenge she has noticed: a lot of the money for tech arrives in september, just two months before a november election.\n\nthat's often not enough time to really take advantage of the surge of funding in software teams, she says.\n\nwhat more money often buys is more staff — but adding engineers to a tech project only a few months before launch actually can hinder the team's speed and efficiency, lewis says.\n\nrecurring donations can smooth out spiky funding. but when it comes to structural change, lewis has one big request: open-source software, frameworks and collaboration spaces.\n\nopen-source software means anyone can access and build on the code. the most common place for developers to share their code and collaborate is the online platform github.\n\nif political tech developers did make more software open source, lewis says they might be able to break free from election-driven peaks and valleys — and sustain applications long enough to make them relevant for more than one campaign cycle.\n\nnot all projects will be successful and not all projects will live forever. there's a constant evolution in the frameworks and tools that we use to build any kind of software, she says. but i think investing in open source early is a way to let the best software rise to the top and live past that campaign horizon.
bread shortages in sudan mark a fragile period for the country's government\n\nthe soaring price of bread led to the toppling of sudan's long-time dictator, omar al-bashir. now a fragile interim government is in place, and eyes are once again on the rising price of bread.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\na couple of years ago, the price of bread doubled in sudan. that's led to mass protests and the ouster of the longtime leader omar al-bashir. sudan's now in the middle of a fragile transition as it navigates towards a civilian government and democratic elections. and once again, people are looking at the price of bread, as npr's eyder peralta reports.\n\neyder peralta, byline: this neighborhood in khartoum was the epicenter of protests during the uprising in 2019. on a recent weekday, it's mostly quiet, but there are a couple dozen people crowded around a bakery. imadaddin taja is 70 years old, and he's been here since 8 in the morning.\n\nimadaddin taja: i need only five breads. i am waiting here for five hours.\n\nperalta: five hours?\n\ntaja: yes.\n\nperalta: taja has lived through periods of war, military coups, through three decades of islamist rule. but he says nothing compares to what's happening now.\n\nis it only bread, or is it everything?\n\ntaja: everything. in sudan, we are suffering.\n\nperalta: in sudan, we are suffering, he says. they can't get fuel. hospitals and even vegetables have become too expensive. the price of bread has doubled. but as we talk, a baker finally hands taja five baguettes.\n\nyou've got your bread.\n\ntaja: you see this bread?\n\nperalta: yeah.\n\ntaja: this is not for a human being.\n\nperalta: there is so little wheat in the country that the flour to make bread is mixed with sorghum. sudanese eat flat bread - soft, puffy goodness that almost tastes buttery. but you can't make flat bread out of this wheat and sorghum mix.\n\n(soundbite of protest)\n\nunidentified protesters: (chanting in non-english language).\n\nperalta: back in december of 2018, the government of omar al-bashir was facing a huge budget shortfall, so they cut the subsidies on bread and the price doubled. sudanese took to the streets to call for his ouster.\n\n(soundbite of protest)\n\nunidentified protesters: (chanting in non-english language).\n\nperalta: by the spring of 2019, bashir was gone. and sudan began a transition into a more democratic and a more secular country. it was a moment of great expectations. but one thing did not change.\n\nkhalid ali: the government is broke, essentially. there is no money - right? - because we are not exporting anything. we are not producing anything.\n\nperalta: that is political analyst khalid ali. he says this transitional government has plugged the budget shortfall by printing money. and that has triggered massive inflation. it means workers can't afford basics with their salary. it means imports have become expensive or nonexistent.\n\nali: people are finding it more difficult to get by on a day-by-day basis.\n\nperalta: protesters have once again taken to the streets. but they have stopped short of calling for the ouster of the government. ali says that's because unlike when bashir was in power, sudanese right now have hope that things can change.\n\nali: if it wasn't for that glimpse of hope, our life would be really difficult here. it would be really, really difficult.\n\nperalta: back at the bakery, the owner, hamid zaid abdulrahim, gives me a short tour.\n\nhamid zaid abdulrahim: (speaking arabic).\n\nperalta: in the good days, he says, these shelves would be totally full of pillowy flat bread.\n\nis this the best bread in the neighborhood?\n\nabdulrahim: (speaking arabic).\n\nunidentified person: he said he used to be the best, but now he's not.\n\nperalta: so what happened?\n\nabdulrahim: (speaking arabic).\n\nperalta: it's the ingredients, abdulrahim says. like everyone in sudan these days, he's just trying to make the best out of what he's been handed.\n\neyder peralta, npr news, khartoum.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump's call to georgia election officials sparks debate over legality, ethics\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alex brandon/ap alex brandon/ap\n\ndepending on whom is asked, president trump's saturday phone call to georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger — during which he urged state officials to find votes that could overturn his loss in the state during november's election — may have violated state and federal law.\n\ntrump and white house chief of staff mark meadows told raffensperger they wanted him to track down more than 11,000 ballots to flip the state that went to president-elect joe biden by nearly 12,000 votes.\n\nlegal experts and former white house officials took to social media through the weekend when news and audio of the phone call between trump and raffensperger were released by the washington post on sunday.\n\nlaw did trump's call to georgia's secretary of state break election laws? did trump's call to georgia's secretary of state break election laws? listen · 4:34 4:34\n\nkim wehle, law professor at the university of baltimore and author of how to read the constitution — and why, told npr's steve inskeep on morning edition on monday that it's a crime to request, solicit or ask someone else to say falsify returns or falsify reports of votes, and arguably that's what we heard on the call.\n\nshe added, whether this is prosecutable is a different question from whether it's antithetical to the rule of law and the constitution and democracy itself, and i would say clearly it is. it's very disturbing.\n\ntrump, meadows seek election data\n\nmeadows, who joined trump on the call, asked state officials to share private election data, protected by law, to help the white house make its case that the election results were fraudulent, a claim that has been disproven repeatedly.\n\nyou would be respected if this thing could be straightened out before the election, trump said, referring to tuesday's senate runoffs in georgia.\n\ntrump also appeared to indicate to raffensperger that he may be engaging with other state officials about election results in other parts of the country.\n\ni mean there's turmoil in georgia and other places, he said. you're not the only one, i mean, we have other states that i believe will be flipping to us very shortly.\n\nbob bauer, an election lawyer and senior adviser to biden, said sunday the recording was irrefutable proof of trump's pressuring and threatening of a republican official to rescind a state's lawful, certified vote count, according to the associated press.\n\nyet for trump supporters, it's raffensperger and his team who broke the law despite trump's legal team repeatedly failing to prove any widespread election law or malfeasance.\n\ndavid shafer, chairman of the georgia republican party, claimed trump, meadows and raffensperger were engaged in a confidential settlement conference related to two pending lawsuits the white house filed against georgia over the election. he argues anything shared in the call was for those purposes.\n\nit's unclear, however, who sent the recordings to the washington post or who originally recorded the phone call.\n\ngeorgia and washington, d.c., however, only require that one party on the phone call consent to recording. eleven states require that all parties consent.\n\nmost of trump's detractors on social media said the president's intentions were clearly to intimidate georgia officials to change the state's election results. his critics argue trump violated a federal law that criminalizes the actions by election officials or by someone in federal office that knowingly and willfully intimidates, threatens, or coerces another during the election process.\n\nthe federal code also criminalizes actions that knowingly and willfully deprives, defrauds, or attempts to deprive or defraud the residents of a state of a fair and impartially conducted election process.\n\nformer u.s. attorney general eric holder cited that federal criminal statute in a tweet sunday.\n\nmichael bromwich, a former inspector general at the department of justice, tweeted that trump's best defense would be insanity.\n\nrick hasen, a law professor at the university of california, irvine, wrote in an article in slate on monday that trump likely broke both federal and state law in the phone call and that he certainly committed an impeachable offense that is grounds for removing him from the office he will be vacating in less than three weeks, or disqualifying him from future elected office.\n\nrichard w. painter, a professor of corporate law at the university of minnesota and former associate counsel to republican president george w. bush, agreed, calling for trump's impeachment, so he can never hold public office again.\n\nhowever, it is extremely unlikely that the house of representatives would attempt another impeachment with so little time remaining in trump's term.\n\ntrump's message during the call also violates georgia law, according to anthony michael kreis, a georgia state university law professor, who spoke with politico on sunday.\n\nthe georgia code says that anybody who solicits, requests or commands or otherwise attempts to encourage somebody to commit election fraud is guilty of solicitation of election fraud, kreis said.  'soliciting or requesting' is the key language. the president asked, in no uncertain terms, the secretary of state to invent votes, to create votes that were not there. not only did he ask for that in terms of just overturning the specific margin that joe biden won by, but then said we needed one additional vote to secure victory in georgia.\n\nchris krebs, the republican cybersecurity and election security official hired by and then fired by trump, called the president's actions un-american and anti-democratic.\n\nhe said sunday, an incumbent should never be able to put their thumb on the scale of national elections.

no. but i think given where we are, i think this is a useful set of tools that if used in the right hands could be effective.\n\nhere is a q&a about the law that trump has invoked:\n\nwhat exactly is the defense production act, or dpa?\n\n\n\nthe dpa is a law that has its origins in the war powers acts of world war ii, which granted the executive branch broad powers to direct industrial production for the war effort. those authorities were allowed to expire when the war was over, but in 1950, after soviet-backed north korea invaded south korea, president harry truman revived those lapsed powers by persuading congress to enact the dpa.\n\nbut this is not a war — this is a health crisis. how does the dpa relate to the coronavirus pandemic?\n\n\n\nthe law contains a section that authorizes the president to control the production and distribution of scarce materials deemed essential to the national defense. in his executive order, trump specifically cites protective equipment (presumably face masks) and ventilators as meeting the criteria in this provision.\n\nhow do the broad authorities in the dpa work for stepping up industrial production?\n\n\n\nthe u.s. government is able to make contracts with industry under the law prioritizing the production of goods in scarce supply. it can also provide loan guarantees or lend money directly to targeted industries, and it can shield them from anti-trust actions resulting from firms cooperating and planning with one another. and if those incentives prove insufficient, administration officials can also use what's called an allocation authority — namely, telling firms that the government has the right to purchase their products above anyone else.\n\nyou could use the prospect of these things to get them to agree to what you want to do — it's a sword of damocles authority, if you will, says bialos. fundamentally, this is a set of tools the administration can use to negotiate with companies in an industry. so if you're short of some product — ventilators, face masks, whatever — you call in the company, survey their capabilities quickly, understand what they can and can't do, and then you start dealing.\n\nwho will be in charge of implementing the dpa to boost output of masks and ventilators?\n\n\n\nin his executive order, trump delegates his authority to carry out the law to the secretary of health and human services with respect to all health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of covid-19 within the united states. hhs secretary alex azar is directed to consult with commerce secretary wilbur ross and the heads of other agencies to determine the proper nationwide priorities and allocation of all health and medical resources, including controlling the distribution of such materials for responding to the coronavirus crisis.\n\nwhat prompted trump to invoke the dpa?\n\n\n\ntrump did not explain why he waited until now to exercise this authority to invoke the dpa. he had come under increasing fire from congressional democrats in recent days for not doing so. one of his critics, sen. jack reed, d-r.i., reacted favorably to trump's change of heart. instead of saying we have 'tremendous supplies,' the trump administration should start coordinating with the private sector to ensure america actually has the life-saving supplies we need, reed said in a statement. invoking the dpa is a needed step in the right direction.\n\nhow quickly might the dpa powers spur increased output of scarce supplies?\n\n\n\nthose powers apply only to u.s. companies, wherever they operate, according to bialos. he says this could prove problematic if those companies have foreign firms in their supply chain. and not all companies are able to quickly shift production to what the government requires. for a company that already makes the widget, it's easier to say, 'ok, let's put your lines to full capacity, let's repurpose your lines,'  says bialos. it gets a lot harder the less substitutable the production mix is.\n\nstill, bialos expects the law will make a difference.\n\ni think in the short term, it's a tool to effectively squeeze and mobilize the industrial base, he says, to get the most out of it.\n\nhe also thinks the dpa could prove useful in preparing to face the next crisis. we obviously need a stockpile of certain kinds of things for these pandemics that we should put in place and don't have sufficiently set up, notes bialos. and you could use this authority to buy things to stockpile so that five, six months from now we're not in the same situation again.
fda seeks to expand treatment for coronavirus as part of white house response\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption chip somodevilla/getty images chip somodevilla/getty images\n\nupdated at 3:37 p.m. et\n\nthe food and drug administration is trying to clear the way to expand the types of medicines or treatments available during the coronavirus pandemic, president trump said thursday.\n\nearly trials have begun for a prospective coronavirus vaccine, and the fda also is working to permit patients to have access to medicines approved for use in other countries or for other uses.\n\nfda commissioner stephen hahn stressed that the agency is moving as quickly as it can while still following protocol to ensure safety standards are met.\n\nthe white house briefing comes as the administration continues to ramp up its response to the virus, including providing economic relief and mobilizing the federal emergency management agency. trump met with governors about their needs.\n\ntrump also said thursday that he would support the prospect of the government taking an equity stake in companies as part of a big stimulus for the economy.\n\nthe particulars are being negotiated in congress as part of another bill that could lead to hundreds of billions or $1 trillion in cash or other support for individual americans, small business and big companies.\n\ntrump's answer on thursday suggested that he would be open to a situation in which the government might buy a percentage of the stock of a big company in order to provide it with equity to continue operating through the economic shock associated with the pandemic.\n\ntrump said the amount of spending would depend on the virus.\n\nif social distancing and the clinical response could stop the coronavirus in its tracks, about $1 trillion would be plenty, the president said. if that won't do, more negotiations might be required.\n\nfda fast track\n\nfda officials want to expand the treatments available during the pandemic in a way that's both fast and responsible, trump said, so that authorities can monitor what works as soon as practical.\n\nimmediately — like, as fast as we can get it, the president said.\n\ntrump said the measures he announced on thursday could be a game-changer, but maybe not.\n\nhahn, of the fda, said he wanted to assure americans that the agency would work as fast as it could to broaden access to new medicines and treatment but that it remained bound by its mission to ensure that those products would be safe.\n\nwe are looking at everything that's coming across our desks as treatment options for coronavirus, hahn said. we need to make sure this sea of treatments will get the right drug to the right patient at the right dosage at the right time.\n\none first step in the short term, hahn said, is to examine medications already in use for other purposes.\n\ndoctors will look at an anti-malaria drug, for example, to see how it might be applied to coronavirus sufferers, he said. another option might be to take blood from patients who've recovered from a coronavirus infection and inject it into sick patients to help their immune response.\n\nhahn said the fda's work would be a continuous process and might take three to six months. a vaccine might not be complete for about a year.\n\noverall, it was not clear on thursday that beyond officials' emphasis on doing lots of assessments quickly, when the work that has begun would start to pay off at significant scale.\n\nthis is an unprecedented situation, hahn said. this is a really significant time.\n\nmore testing\n\ndr. deborah birx, the white house's coronavirus coordinator, told reporters in the same briefing that she recognized that the number of coronavirus cases in the united states would likely continue to rise as more tests become available and it takes less time to process them.\n\nthe number of infections has topped 10,000, as of thursday afternoon, according to the latest reports.\n\nbirx said the rate of positive results is between 10 and 11%, meaning that about 90% of people receiving tests don't have the coronavirus.\n\neven so, a more robust testing regime likely will reveal more cases, officials said.\n\nconference with governors\n\ntrump traveled from the white house to the federal emergency management agency on thursday. he spoke with a group of governors about the need to be able to care for what is expected to be a wave of people needing treatment for the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nfema is accustomed to responding when natural disasters like hurricanes and tornadoes overwhelm local resources, but the scope and scale of the coronavirus pandemic presents huge logistical challenges.\n\ngeorgia's republican gov. brian kemp told trump to leave the directives for the national guard with the governors.\n\nresponded trump: that's done. i like it.\n\nkemp also asked trump to consider maintaining staff at a military base used for quarantining cruise ship passengers in order to handle people from the metro atlanta area.\n\nlouisiana's democratic gov. john bel edwards said he was worried that his state's medical facilities would be overwhelmed in a week. edwards said the state would like to be able to send some patients to a hospital run by the department of veterans affairs.\n\ntrump said he would work to approve that quickly.\n\nvice president pence urged governors to place orders for n95 masks after a new change to liability laws made it possible for hospitals to use industrial masks, normally targeted for construction sites.\n\npence also told governors that a survey was being done to determine the supply of ventilators. birx, the response coordinator, urged them to ensure that coronavirus test results are reported centrally so that supplies can be surged to the right areas.\n\nnebraska's republican gov. pete ricketts said he was concerned about the supply of reagents for processing tests.\n\nricketts also said there was an urgent need for pop-up alternative day care, especially for first responders and health care workers. he asked trump for assistance with streamlining the process of clearing day care workers.\n\nwe need a waiver from the fingerprint requirement to be able to do that quickly, he said.\n\nricketts also asked that the education department relax free appropriate education requirements because recent guidelines created concerns. he said some school attorneys have told teachers they cannot teach because they could be sued under those appropriate education requirements.\n\nmassachusetts democratic gov. charlie baker said his state has put in orders for personal protective equipment supplies, as trump had previously directed. but he suggested the federal government was crowding out other buyers.\n\non three big orders, we lost to the feds, baker said, asking trump to look into the issue.\n\nmaryland's republican gov. larry hogan said the federal government should give at least half of stimulus aid funding to the states, saying that state government could get money out faster to where it's needed.\n\npressure for results\n\ntrump is under pressure to show that his administration has the situation in hand as americans see their day-to-day lives dramatically change.\n\nschools are closed, people are heeding warnings to stay away from others, and many have lost their income as the economy has been shocked to a near-halt.\n\nmeanwhile, trump's administration is negotiating with congress on a new package of aid to help people and businesses through the huge economic losses from the crisis. it will be the third round of aid in two months. trump signed the second package into law wednesday night.\n\nbut the virus is making it hard for lawmakers to do their work.\n\non wednesday evening, two congressmen said they had tested positive for the virus, and others who had met with them — including rep. steve scalise, the no. 2 republican in the house — said they would self-quarantine, to be safe.\n\nno decision on olympics, trump says\n\ntrump acknowledged at the white house that japanese prime minister shinzo abe discussed the upcoming summer olympics, set to occur in tokyo, in a call with world leaders earlier this week.\n\nabe hasn't decide whether to cancel the games, trump said, but we'd live with his decision if he does.\n\ntrump was asked on thursday when he thought life would get back to normal.\n\ni hope very soon, he said. we'll see. this is uncharted territory.
venezuelan opposition leader guaidó declares himself president, with u.s. backing\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption fernando llano/ap fernando llano/ap\n\nupdated at 9:30 p.m. et\n\nvenezuelan opposition leader juan guaidó declared himself the country's interim president amid nationwide protests wednesday, in a bid to seize power from sitting leader nicolás maduro.\n\nthe u.s. swiftly proclaimed its support for guaidó. maduro responded by announcing a break in diplomatic relations with washington.\n\nguaidó, the 35-year-old recently elected head of venezuela's national assembly, took the oath of office on an outdoor podium in caracas, flanked by yellow, blue and red venezuelan flags. he raised his right hand as a crowd erupted in cheers. he promised to serve as interim leader and call for general elections.\n\nthe people of venezuela have courageously spoken out against maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law, president trump said in a statement. he pressed other governments to recognize guaidó and pledged to use the full weight of united states economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of venezuelan democracy.\n\nmaduro has not agreed to cede power. he announced wednesday afternoon that u.s. diplomatic personnel had 72 hours to leave venezuela. in a televised address from the presidential palace, maduro accused guaidó and washington of staging a coup.\n\nin a statement issued late wednesday. u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo said the trump administration does not recognize the maduro government or its authority to break diplomatic relations with the united states or to declare our diplomats persona non grata.\n\nwe welcome interim president guaido's directive to all diplomatic missions in venezuela that venezuela intends to maintain diplomatic relations with all countries. the united states maintains diplomatic relations with venezuela and will conduct our relations with venezuela through the government of interim president guaido, who has invited our mission to remain in venezuela. ... we call on the venezuelan military and security forces to continue protecting the welfare and well-being of all venezuelan citizens, as well as u.s. and other foreign citizens in venezuela. we call on all parties to refrain from measures that are inconsistent with the privileges and immunities enjoyed by members of the diplomatic community. the united states will take appropriate actions to hold accountable anyone who endangers the safety and security of our mission and its personnel.\n\nearlier in the day, guaidó issued a statement urging all foreign embassies in the country to disobey maduro's 72-hour deadline and not to remove their diplomats.\n\nwhen asked by a reporter whether the u.s. is considering military options, trump replied: we are not considering anything, but all options are on the table. ... all options, always, all options are on the table.\n\nin addition to the u.s., canada and nine other governments in the western hemisphere, including brazil, argentina and colombia, recognized guaidó as interim president, the ap reports. the organization of american states also backs guaidó.\n\nthe government of mexico said it would follow the principle of non-intervention and not withdraw recognition from a government of a country with which it maintains diplomatic relations, in effect siding with maduro.\n\nmany protesters on the streets of caracas on wednesday were happy, but not ecstatic.\n\nthis government, they destroy our democracy, and i want our democracy back, carlos gonzales, one of those in the crowd, told npr. i want our rights back. it's all i want.\n\nguaidó was empowered to try to take the reins of government after venezuelans answered his nationwide call to rally for regime change. the demonstrations were timed to coincide with the anniversary of a 1958 coup that toppled military despot marcos pérez jiménez.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption fernando llano/ap fernando llano/ap\n\nearly wednesday, guaidó tweeted that protests were underway in caracas and the coastal cities of carúpano and maracaibo, showing that his movement had reached distant locations. he used the protest hashtag #gritemosconbrio, which means let's cry out loud and also is part of the chorus of the venezuelan national anthem.\n\nin 2017, maduro snuffed an attempt to oust him. months of protests nationwide ended after more than 120 people were killed, mostly by security forces.\n\njason marczak, the director of the atlantic council's adrienne arsht latin america center, said guaidó's movement was stronger than previous pushes to unseat maduro because the opposition was united around one leader and enjoyed strong support from the u.s. and other nations.\n\ni think in 2017, the protests — there was support for the protest and the opposition, but there wasn't a tangible mechanism to be supporting. now there is something to be supporting. now the international community can recognize the national assembly as the only legitimate democratic institution, marczak told npr.\n\nthis round of protests began after maduro took the oath of office for a second term on jan. 10. observers said his election was illegitimate after his main opponents were barred from running.\n\ncitizens burned trash and clashed with troops late tuesday in some 60 working-class neighborhoods nationwide, reuters reports. the venezuelan observatory of social conflict, a body that monitors violence, says that a 16-year-old was killed overnight in caracas.\n\nunder maduro's rule, venezuela's economy has nose-dived, inflation has soared and basic foods and medical supplies have grown scarce. millions of venezuelans have fled the country, mostly to neighboring colombia and brazil as well as ecuador, peru and other latin american countries. most opposition leaders have been exiled, imprisoned or banned from running for office, john otis reports for npr.\n\nguaidó breathed new life into the opposition, bringing together followers in town hall meetings called cabildos and pledging to bring about open, free elections. he has urged the military to abandon its loyalty to maduro, offering amnesty to officers who turn against the president. on wednesday, he repeated his call: to all the armed forces, our call is very clear, from this parliament we shake your hands and ask you to stand with the constitution and the people, your people, guaidó wrote.\n\nmuch of the military has so far remained loyal to maduro even though troops' salaries have shrunk because of inflation and their equipment has decayed amid the years-long economic crisis, reuters reports. maduro also has cultivated senior officers by lavishing them with privileges, including key posts within the lucrative state oil monopoly.\n\nvenezuela's government said monday it had put down a rebellion within the security forces. officials said 27 national guardsmen were arrested after they allegedly kidnapped five officers, raided an outpost and stole weapons, npr has reported. these mutineers were low-level officers, however, reuters noted.\n\nmaduro exhorted his supporters to turn out in rival demonstrations on wednesday. men and women of the fatherland, be calm and mobilize the people to win peace and stability for venezuela, maduro wrote. the streets belong to the people!\n\nbolivian president evo morales, who like maduro is a leftist, tweeted his support: our solidarity with the venezuelan people and our brother nicolas maduro, in these decisive hours in which the claws of imperialism seek again to mortally wound the democracy and self-determination of the peoples of south america.\n\nmaduro has dismissed the national assembly as a group of little boys masterminded by washington imperialists and the far right, npr has reported. venezuela's supreme court, packed with maduro loyalists, has declared guaidó and the congressional leadership illegitimate. security forces also briefly detained the opposition leader last week.\n\nthe u.s., brazil and the organization of american states had lent their backing to venezuela's opposition before wednesday's protests, otis reports. vice president pence extended his support to the national assembly via a video with spanish subtitles that he posted to twitter on tuesday.\n\nthe united states supports the courageous decision by juan guaidó, the president of your national assembly, to assert that body's constitutional powers, declare maduro a usurper, and call for the establishment of a transitional government, pence said. on behalf of the american people, we say to all the good people of venezuela, estamos con ustedes. we are with you.\n\nvenezuelan vice president delcy rodríguez accused pence on tuesday of openly calling for a coup.\n\nyankee, go home, she added in a statement, according to the telesur news service, which is partly funded by the venezuelan government.\n\nrep. ro khanna, d-calif., criticized the trump administration wednesday for what he called hypocrisy after the president's refusal to condemn saudi arabia after the journalist jamal khashoggi was killed in riyadh's consulate in turkey. let me get this straight, khanna wrote. the us is sanctioning venezuela for their lack of democracy but not saudi arabia?\n\nnpr's isabel lara contributed to this

why some patients getting drugmakers' help are paying more\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption getty images getty images\n\nsince kristen catton started taking the drug gilenya two years ago, she's had only one minor relapse of her multiple sclerosis, following a bout of the flu.\n\nthanks to the medicine, she says, she's able to walk comfortably, see clearly and work part time as a nurse case manager at a hospital near her home in columbus, ohio. this is a big step forward; two drugs she previously tried failed to control her physical symptoms or prevent repeated flare-ups.\n\nthe drug is expensive — about $90,000 a year. novartis, the company that makes gilenya, helps defray that cost for catton and other patients by making their copayments directly to the patient's health plan; catton's copay for the medicine is roughly $3,800 a month.\n\nuntil recently those payments by the drug company helped catton save money on her medical out-of-pocket expenses, because they counted toward her family's $8,800 annual pharmacy deductible on their health plan.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of kristen catton courtesy of kristen catton\n\nbut his year, catton got a shock. her health plan changed the way it handles novartis' payments, and the money no longer counts toward that deductible.\n\ncatton is one of a growing number of consumers taking expensive medicine who are discovering they are no longer insulated by copay assistance programs that used to help cover their costs.\n\nthrough such programs, consumers typically have owed nothing or have had modest monthly copays for pricey drugs, thanks to a financial contribution by the drugmaker that chips away at the consumer's deductible and out-of-pocket maximum limits until the health plan starts paying the whole tab.\n\nunder the copay accumulator programs introduced by some health plans in 2018, the process has changed.\n\nin catton's case the change meant that after she hit the drug manufacturer's payment cap for the copay assistance in april, she's had to pay the entire co-payment herself — roughly $3,800 — and will have to continue to pay it until her health plan's pharmacy deductible is met.\n\nfor may, catton has put the $3,800 copay on a credit card. but, she says, her family can't afford to pay nearly $9,000 a year out-of-pocket for the foreseeable future.\n\ni'm talking to my doctor to see if i can i take it every other day, she says. i guess i'm winging it until i can figure out what to do.\n\ndrug copay assistance programs have long been controversial. proponents say that in an age of increasingly high deductibles and coinsurance charges, such help from the manufacturer is the only way some patients can afford crucial medications.\n\nbut opponents to such assistance say the programs increase drug spending on expensive brand-name drugs by discouraging patients from using more cost-effective alternatives.\n\nthat last argument misses an important point, according to bari talente, executive vice president for advocacy at the national multiple sclerosis society.\n\ngenerally the multiple sclerosis drugs are not substitutable, she says. most have different mechanisms of action, different administration and different side effect profiles. and generics, when they're available, are pricey too — typically costing $60,000 or more annually, she says.\n\nmost annual copay assistance limits for ms drugs, if available, are between $9,000 and $12,000, talente says.\n\nsome employers argue that the drug copayment programs are an attempt to circumvent their efforts to manage health care costs. there's also the issue of fairness, they say.\n\nfrom an employer perspective, everyone under the plan has to be treated the same, says brian marcotte, president and ceo of the national business group on health, which represents large employers.\n\nif someone needs medical care such as surgery, for example, that person doesn't get help covering his deductible, he says.\n\nin an nbgh survey of about 140 multistate employers with at least 5,000 workers, 17 percent report they have a copay accumulator program in place this year, marcotte says. fifty-six percent say they're considering them for 2019 or 2020.\n\nmarcotte says that if there is no other comparable drug available, drug copayment programs may have a role to play if they can be structured so that participating patients are paying some amount toward their deductible. but, he argues, assistance programs for drugs that are available from more than one source — such as a brand drug that is also available as a generic — shouldn't be allowed.\n\nin 2016, 20 percent of prescriptions for brand-name drugs used a drug copay assistance coupon, according to an analysis by researchers at the usc schaeffer center for health policy and economics. among the top 200 drugs (based on spending) in 2014, the study found that 132 were brand-name drugs, and 90 of them offered copay coupons.\n\nfifty-one percent of the drugs with copay coupons had no substitute at all, or only another brand drug as a close therapeutic substitute, the analysis found.\n\nadvocates for people with hiv and aids say copay accumulators are cropping up in their patients' plans and beginning to cause patients trouble. drugs to treat hiv typically don't have generic alternatives.\n\nthe biggest impact for the community their organizations serve may be for prep — a daily pill that helps prevent hiv infection, says carl schmid, deputy executive director at the aids institute, an advocacy group. a 30-day supply of prep (brand-name truvada) can cost nearly $2,000. gilead, the drug's manufacturer, offers a copay assistance program that covers up to $3,600 annually in copay assistance, with no limit on how much is paid per month.\n\nthey're at risk for hiv, they know it and want to protect themselves, schmid says. it's a public health issue.\n\nearlier this month, the aids institute was among 60 hiv organizations that sent letters to state attorneys general and insurance commissioners across the country asking them to investigate this practice, which has emerged in employer and marketplace plans this year.\n\ncompounding advocates' concerns is the fact that these coverage changes are frequently not communicated clearly to patients, schmid says. they are typically buried deep in the plan documents and don't appear in the user-friendly summary of benefits and coverage that consumers receive from their health plan.\n\nhow is a patient to know? schmid asks. they learn of the change only when they get a big bill midway through the year. and then they're stuck.\n\nkaiser health news, a nonprofit news service covering health issues, is an editorially independent program of

saturday sports: serena williams is pregnant\n\nmary louise kelly, host:\n\nand it's time for sports.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkelly: twenty weeks - that was the caption of a photo serena williams shared on snapchat on wednesday. her spokeswoman confirmed the news that night. she's pregnant. i'm joined now by howard bryant of espn and espn the magazine. hi there, howard.\n\nhoward bryant: good morning, how are you?\n\nkelly: i am well, thank you. i'm sitting here doing some back of the envelope math. serena - she won the australian open back in january, less than 20 weeks ago, which means when she won it - when she dominated it, by the way - she didn't drop a set - she was two months pregnant.\n\nbryant: she was, which was - technically, it was a doubles tournament.\n\n(laughter)\n\nkelly: on one side of the net at least.\n\nbryant: on one side of the net, yes. who knew that that final between venus and serena was actually a family affair - mother, child and aunt.\n\nkelly: more than we knew. yeah, i mean...\n\nbryant: she's incredible. it's absolutely an incredible story for her. and once again, i think when we were on this program, scott and i talked about this before the australian open began, and we took a lot - well, i took a lot of criticism for this because people were asking about what serena's prospects for the year were going to be. and i thought that we were going to see a major change. and we were criticized, at least the show was criticized, because she had gotten engaged. and we don't do that for men.\n\nwe don't say that because a man is being - is about to get married that, suddenly, their entire life is going to change. but if you watch serena over the past couple of seasons, especially last year, she'd only played eight tournaments. she played the majors. she played the olympics, and she played a couple of smaller tournaments. and then this year, she gets engaged, and now it turns out that she was pregnant. she has been signaling for a while that there's a new chapter for her, that this is - that tennis is not forever for her. and she's made it very clear in a lot of sort of vague ways. but if you're paying attention to her, you can sort of understand where she's coming from.\n\nkelly: ok. but i got to - i'm got a jump on you there because she is 35. as you said, you wouldn't say this about a man. she's going to have take maternity leave, but has she said she's not coming back?\n\nbryant: well, she said she is planning on coming back. however, the difference is that roger federer has four children. he never took any time off. of course, you have to take time off if you want to start a family, and that is the difference. but the one thing that's been really interesting about serena is that she hasn't really hidden the fact that there's life after tennis for her, and there's life during tennis for her.\n\ni mean, one of the interesting things for a female tennis player is - victoria azarenka is another example who actually did take time off. she had a baby boy, and she's supposed to come back this year. at 35...\n\nkelly: which is what serena is, yeah.\n\nbryant: which is what serena's going to be 36 after having done everything that you could possibly do. let's have a little perspective about her, too. she's been playing tennis since she was four years old. she turned pro in 1995. she's been doing this her entire life. and my attitude has been that if, indeed, serena comes back, then it would be an amazing story.\n\nshe could be like kim clijsters who had a baby at 23, 24 and came back and won two majors. she came back and won the u.s. open back to back. but if she doesn't, look at what serena williams has done for tennis and for the american story. she has given everybody everything they could ask for and more.\n\nkelly: we've just got a few seconds left. but in those few seconds, howard, what's this going to mean for the women's tour? i mean, serena has been the ticket - the people - the person people come to see.\n\nbryant: yeah, she's the main draw, and that's the big thing. obviously, maria sharapova coming back from suspension - i think the wta could use that. but let's face it, both american tennis and the wta has been dreading the day that venus and serena are no longer there because they are what makes the game go. but it's a great sport.\n\nkelly: yeah, we'll see if there's baby pics (ph) at the (unintelligible) in a few years. howard bryant...\n\nbryant: wouldn't that be something?\n\nkelly: yeah, it would be. howard bryant of espn, thank you.\n\nbryant: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
schumer says he'll oppose gorsuch nomination, sets up filibuster showdown with gop\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mandel ngan/afp/getty images mandel ngan/afp/getty images\n\nupdated at 5:45 p.m. et\n\n\n\non the final day of the confirmation hearings for judge neil gorsuch, the senate democratic leader announced his opposition to the supreme court nominee.\n\nin a speech on the senate floor, chuck schumer said gorsuch will have to earn 60 votes for confirmation, setting up a showdown with republican leaders who may attempt to change senate rules.\n\nif gorsuch cannot earn 60 votes, a bar met by each of president obama's nominees and george bush's last two nominees, the answer isn't to change the rules, schumer said. it's to change the nominee.\n\ndemocrats changed senate rules in 2013 to require a simple majority on most presidential nominees, but they left in place the supermajority requirement for supreme court nominees.\n\nrepublicans control 52 senate seats and would need eight democrats to join them to move gorsuch's nomination forward under current senate rules. short of that, republican senate leaders may trigger the so-called nuclear option, changing the rules to allow a simple majority to proceed.\n\nthe gorsuch nomination has put democrats in an excruciatingly difficult position. they do not have the votes to vote down the trump nominee outright, as they are a minority in the senate. but they are being pressed hard by liberal groups and their base to do the impossible — stop gorsuch. the task is impossible because senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has made clear that if there is a filibuster, republicans will change the senate rules, just as the democrats did for lower court judges in 2013 when they were in the majority.\n\nsenate democrats' essential bind is this: they can mount a filibuster of gorsuch because republicans don't have 60 votes to put an end to any filibuster. but if democrats were to do so, then mcconnell could simply change senate rules and lower the threshold for moving the nomination forward. to change the rules mcconnell would need only 51 votes, and the senate republican caucus has 52 members.\n\nin short, the democrats have few cards to play, and several democratic senators and their aides say that schumer's filibuster announcement was an attempt to strengthen his hand in negotiations with mcconnell.\n\ndemocrats are seeking a face-saving way to oppose gorsuch, knowing they cannot defeat him. but when mcconnell announced this week that he intended to get gorsuch confirmed by the senate's easter recess on april 7, that was a clock that forced the democrats' hand.\n\nan april 7 deadline does not allow time for more than a few days of debate once the nomination is sent to the senate floor after a committee vote on april 3, nor does it allow time for more than one vote to cut off debate, known as a cloture vote.\n\nso, either the democrats have to alienate their own base by casting enough votes to kill their own filibuster, or the likelihood is that republicans will change the rules to get rid of the filibuster on supreme court nominations. and democrats would dearly like to preserve that tool, knowing that there is a strong possibility there will be at least one more supreme court vacancy during the trump presidency.\n\ndemocratic sources say the leadership would not mind losing the cloture vote, but they would have to lose eight of their 48 members to do that. in days gone by, it would have been easy for senators to say, in essence, that they will not vote to continue a filibuster, that the nominee deserves an up-or-down vote. but as one democrat put it, this place is so polarized right now, and our constituents are so polarized, it's hard to sell that.\n\nthere is, of course, the possibility of a deal. among the proposals offered by democrats is an agreement to vote on gorsuch if republicans would agree to preserve the filibuster for the next high court vacancy, should it occur. sources say that offer was immediately rejected.\n\nthere are still some other deal permutations possible. some democrats would be willing to vote to end the filibuster on a second cloture vote, which in the past has been common, to allow more time for debate. some would even agree to forgo a filibuster if the vote on gorsuch is scheduled after the easter recess later in april. but they say that so far mcconnell has not been interested.\n\nthe republican leader has been a tough advocate of using judgeships to bolster the republican vote. in 2013 when democrats were in despair over gop delaying tactics on lower court judgeships, sen. john mccain worked out a deal with them to avoid changing the filibuster rule. the deal centered on three vacancies on the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit. president obama had nominated three people for those vacancies, and all had cleared the senate judiciary committee. under the deal worked out with mccain, the democrats would forgo a change in the filibuster rule if the republicans would allow a vote on one of those nominees. mccain brought the deal to the republican caucus. but it was rejected, whereupon the democrats voted to get rid of the filibuster for lower court judges and executive branch nominees.\n\nschumer said gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me he'd be an independent check on president trump. he said gorsuch was not a neutral legal mind, but someone with a deep-seated conservative ideology.\n\nprogressive groups have been urging democrats to uniformly oppose all of trump's nominees. but several are facing tough re-election campaigns next year in states that trump won in november. one of them, bob casey of pennsylvania, announced thursday he will oppose gorsuch, saying he does not think judge gorsuch's judicial approach will ensure fairness for workers and families in pennsylvania.\n\ndemocrats have expressed frustration with gorsuch's testimony before the judiciary committee, in which he sidestepped most of their questions aimed at getting a sense of how he might rule on the high court. many are also still angry that president obama's nominee for the vacancy created by justice antonin scalia's death, judge merrick garland, was never given a hearing by republicans.\n\nif enough democrats join schumer in attempting to block gorsuch's nomination, at least one republican seems ready to go nuclear. sen. lindsey graham told the mike gallagher show that he is willing to do whatever it takes to get gorsuch on the court. graham's comments were first reported by cnn.\n\nmcconnell has yet to tip his hand about whether he would call for a rules change, but he told reporters this week, if judge gorsuch can't achieve 60 votes in the senate, could any judge appointed by a republican president be approved with 60 or more votes in the senate? and mcconnell has vowed gorsuch will be confirmed by the senate before it takes its easter recess on april 7.
meet the white house's new chief climate change skeptic\n\ntwenty five years ago, william happer had an encounter with the white house that ended badly.\n\nat the time, in 1993, the princeton professor was taking a break from academia to direct scientific research at the u.s. department of energy. he turned a skeptical eye toward one of then-vice president al gore's favorite issues: the risks posed by chemicals eating away at ozone in the stratosphere and letting in dangerous ultraviolet radiation. as the story goes, happer went to the white house and told gore's staff he saw no evidence that the ozone hole actually was hurting anyone.\n\ngore was annoyed, and happer lost his job.\n\ntoday, happer is back in the white house, still fighting against what he considers unfounded claims that our globe is in danger. but this time, his cause is backed by the man in the oval office.\n\nhapper, 79, joined the staff of president trump's national security council last fall. and according to documents first leaked to the washington post, he appears to be pushing the white house to mount a challenge to the government's official assessment of climate change, which calls climate change a serious national security threat.\n\non thursday, the chairs of four different committees in the house of representatives sent a letter to president trump expressing concern about recent reports that the national security council (nsc) is planning to assemble a secret panel, led by a discredited climate change denier, to undermine the overwhelming scientific consensus on the nature and threats of climate change.\n\nthe four democrats called it deeply concerning that dr. happer appears to be spearheading that effort.\n\nhapper is an intriguing and controversial figure. he was born in india when it was a british colony, the son of a scottish military officer and an american medical missionary. his mother, with young will in tow, spent part of world war ii working as a physician at the secret manhattan project site in oak ridge, tenn. the family later settled in north carolina.\n\nhapper became a physicist. he taught at columbia university and joined the faculty at princeton university in 1980.\n\nhe is a damn good scientist, says steven koonin, a prominent physicist who is now a professor at new york university and who has known happer for 30 years. there are two really significant contributions associated with him.\n\none of them made it possible to capture much better images of people's lungs; the other allows astronomers to see the stars more clearly.\n\nat the same time, happer acquired a reputation as a contrarian, quick to challenge conclusions that struck him as unproven — especially when it came to environmental science.\n\nthat reputation was cemented by happer's confrontation with gore's staff over risks posed by the ozone hole. the incident was widely covered in scientific publications — physics today ran an article headlined happer leaves doe under ozone cloud for violating political correctness.\n\nkoonin thinks happer was doing what a scientist should, demanding better evidence. i think it sensitized him to the squishiness, if you will, of a lot of the environmental science, he says.\n\nsome of happer's scientific critics, though, see it as something more: a visceral distrust of scientists who study environmental risks.\n\nover the past decade, happer has waged a fierce campaign aimed at debunking fears of global warming caused by emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.\n\nin a speech to a 2015 conference organized by the heartland institute, which has railed against restrictions on emissions from fossil fuels, happer scoffed at these fears, calling them an alice-in-wonderland fantasy. when i got into this area and started learning about it, i learned that when i looked at co2, i should assume that it caused harmful warming, extreme weather, noah's flood, you know. i remember thinking, 'are they mad?' \n\ncarbon dioxide is actually good for the planet, happer claims; it's like fertilizer and makes crops more productive.\n\nwe've got to push back vigorously on the demonization of fossil fuels, he said in his speech. they're not demons at all. they're enormous servants to us.\n\nsome of happer's colleagues at princeton are reluctant to talk publicly about him; it's like discussing a relationship that got messy.\n\ni mean, i liked him. we went off for coffee after our committee meetings a couple of times, says michael bender, an emeritus professor of geoscience and climate researcher.\n\nbender says he wouldn't do it now, though. it's partly because of the scientific dispute, because he thinks happer is misreading the evidence. but it's also because of happer's style — he's labeled climate science a cult and accused other scientists of whipping up climate fears to boost their own careers. most offensive for bender: happer once said the demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the jews under hitler.\n\nyou know, there came a point where he attacked my colleagues' integrity, bender says, and i felt like i couldn't have a cordial relationship with him after that.\n\nhapper, who last fall went to work in the white house as a senior aide to the national security council, wasn't authorized to comment for this story.\n\nrobert socolow, another princeton colleague, has mixed feelings about happer's post. socolow's own biography — first a physicist, then a specialist on the environment — makes him a kind of bridge between happer and the environmental scientists on princeton's campus. he doesn't doubt happer's technical grasp of climate science but says that everybody has areas of irrationality.\n\ni think the environment in general, and climate change in particular, is an area of will's irrationality. but nonetheless, i think he can accomplish something in his current job, socolow says.\n\nsocolow hopes that while in the white house, happer will behave less like an argumentative physicist and more like the kind of person who has to prepare for every possibility — including those that strike him as unlikely.\n\na military person doesn't underestimate the enemy. a business person doesn't underestimate the competition, socolow says. and even if, as happer insists, there's uncertainty about the course of climate change, the u.s. can't afford to underestimate those risks.
tech giants join corporate reckoning over political spending\n\nenlarge this image alfred gescheidt/getty images alfred gescheidt/getty images\n\nfacebook, microsoft and google have joined a growing list of big banks and other major companies that are pausing their political spending following last week's violent attack on the u.s. capitol.\n\none after another, corporate responses have escalated. some companies have suspended donations to lawmakers who objected to the certification of the presidential election. many have halted all of their political donations for a few months. a few have gone so far as to support the removal of the president.\n\nthe outgoing president incited violence in an attempt to retain power, and any elected leader defending him is violating their oath to the constitution and rejecting democracy in favor of anarchy, said national association of manufacturers ceo jay timmons, urging vice president pence to consider invoking the 25th amendment, which allows removal of a president deemed unfit to serve.\n\nmoney-in-politics groups have welcomed this unusually widespread — and self-initiated — reckoning by corporations over their own role in contributing to the nation's current political state.\n\nyou just can't really overemphasize the role that donors play in the current political calculation, said meredith mcgehee, executive director at issue one, a nonprofit that works to reduce the influence of money in politics.\n\nin this moment of crisis, they sent a really important signal that the actions of the objectors were unacceptable ... because what they were doing was voting to overturn the will of the voters, mcgehee said.\n\nfacebook told npr on monday that it was pausing the spending of its political action committee for at least the first three months of the year, while we review our policies.\n\nmicrosoft said it's assessing the implications of last week's events, adding: the pac regularly pauses its donations in the first quarter of a new congress, but it will take additional steps this year to consider these recent events and consult with employees.\n\nindeed, right now — the start of the year right after an election is concluded — is when many companies conduct this kind of review of political spending anyway.\n\nalso, public campaign spending by corporations is much more restricted than spending by super pacs and especially tax-exempt advocacy groups that don't disclose their donors. plus, a lot of corporate money in american politics flows from individuals, corporate executives and other employees.\n\nearlier, goldman sachs, jpmorgan chase and citigroup told reporters they would suspend all political donations. airbnb, comcast and others said they were suspending pac donations to republicans who objected to the electoral college vote. the newsletter popular information is tracking such corporate responses, also adding marriott and bluecross blueshield to the list.\n\nsimilarly, kansas city, mo.-based hallmark has asked sens. josh hawley of missouri and roger marshall of kansas to return $7,000 and $5,000, respectively, in employee donations from the last two years, according to the kansas city star.\n\ni think they have to take a look long and hard at what role has their political spending played in sort of the buildup to this crisis, said bruce freed, the head of the center for political accountability.\n\nthe question is — does this have staying power, or is it going to be a move of the moment? freed said. what do they do in six months? ... is this a real epiphany moment in terms of a change in how companies approach their political spending?\n\nlast week, facebook suspended president trump from both its main platform and instagram indefinitely. twitter has disabled trump's account permanently.\n\nonline merchant platform shopify shut down two stores affiliated with the trump organization and trump's campaign. the pga of america's board of directors has voted to pull next year's pga championship from trump's golf course in new jersey.\n\neditor's note: comcast, facebook, google, microsoft, goldman sachs and jpmorgan chase are among npr's financial supporters.\n\nnpr's shannon bond contributed to this report.
alan alda on 'm*a*s*h*' and his 'tremendous education' growing up in a burlesque club\n\nalda, who spoke to terry gross in 1997, is being awarded the lifetime achievement award by the screen actors guild on sunday for his humanitarian efforts and acting roles.\n\ndavid bianculli, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. on sunday, alan alda will receive the life achievement award from the screen actors guild. the sag award acknowledges both alda's humanitarian efforts and his long list of acting roles for the large and small screen. his starring film roles include california suite, crimes and misdemeanors and the seduction of joe tynan. but his most famous role is on tv as dr. hawkeye pierce. he was drafted during the korean war and assigned to a mobile army surgical hospital, a mash unit. alda won several emmys for that series, for writing and directing as well as acting. in the very first words we heard alan alda speak as hawkeye in the 1972 pilot, he was reading from a letter he was writing to his father back home.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, m*a*s*h)\n\nalan alda: (as hawkeye pierce) dear dad, hawkeye here. you said i sounded a bit callous about my job in my last letter. well, let me see if i can put it another way. this particular mobile army hospital, we're not concerned with the ultimate reconstruction of the patient. we only care about getting the kid out of here alive enough for someone else to put on the fine touches. we work fast, and we're not dainty because a lot of these kids who can stand two hours on the table just can't stand one second more. we tried to play par surgery on this course. par is a live patient.\n\nbianculli: alan alda in the pilot episode of m*a*s*h. when terry gross interviewed alda in 1997, she asked him about that pilot.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nterry gross, byline: what were your first impressions of the script?\n\nalda: i thought it was an extremely good pilot when they sent me the pilot. i was in the utah state prison at the time...\n\ngross: filming - filming a movie.\n\n(laughter)\n\nalda: yes. well, yes. i was trying to work on the image there a little bit.\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\nalda: i was shooting a movie for about three weeks in the utah state prison, and they sent me the script of mash, and it was the best script i had read while i was in prison, certainly. but it was also the best script of any television show i'd ever seen, i think. larry gelbart had written it. and it was really sharp, you know? but i was concerned that - i was concerned about what would happen after the show went into production. i didn't know if larry would be part of it. and i was worried that it would become a high jinks at the front and that the war would just sort of exist as a pretext for silly stories.\n\nand in fact, some of the early scripts done by freelance writers, who didn't know what the possibilities were and were sure that on television you don't go for anything substantive, wrote, in essence, mchale's navy in korea. you know? and mchale's navy on the ground. and it really scared me at that point. but by then we had already had an agreement because before i agreed to do the show, i had a midnight meeting with larry gelbart and gene reynolds, who were producing the show. and we all agreed that we wanted to do a show in which the war was seen for what it is, as a, you know, a place where people are badly hurt. and the humor came out of the reaction to that. the humor came out of the crazy pressure everybody was put under.\n\ngross: i guess the thought of things turning out badly, of it not being the script that you wanted, during the vietnam era was pretty scary. i mean, you know, a war tv series during the vietnam era that gave a kind of high jinks on the front message probably would have made you particularly uncomfortable.\n\nalda: i think it would. yeah. it probably would have been even more so then than it would be at any other time. but i always felt strongly about wars. and i...\n\ngross: you were in the military, weren't you?\n\nalda: yeah. i was in - well, i was in the reserves. i don't know if you call that being in the military. they put me in charge of a mess hall at one point, and we had to feed 200 people three meals a day. and i had six guys who sort of stared blankly at the wall and played with the liver. they were - i don't know how we fed those people. but i wouldn't call that being in the military. but, you know, i had to face the idea of it, which was interesting. i mean, when i was - i saw myself, i watched myself as i was teaching people. that was one of my jobs, to teach people how to kill the greatest number of people with a mortar shell. and i would keep them interested and, you know, i wanted to be a good teacher. as long as they gave me a job, i did the best i could.\n\nand i was, like, getting good at making them learn how to do this. and i, (laughter) - you could have long discussions into the night, especially if you're a sophomore in college, about whether that's a moral thing to do. but the interesting thing about it is, i understood just from doing that that when you're in a war, it's real. it's the real thing. people are going to get killed or lose their arms and legs. and when we did mash, i wanted to make sure that at least that understanding that i had came out - that that's what we dealt with, and that we didn't gloss over that and make the show about how funny things were in the mess tent.\n\ngross: i want to ask you about your formative years. you grew up in show business. your father was robert alda, who, among other things, originated the role of sky masterson in the broadway production of guys and dolls, played george gershwin in the 1945 film rhapsody in blue. what was he doing before the movies, when you were a young boy?\n\nalda: well, when i was born, he was in burlesque. and i spent the first three years of my life standing in the wings watching strippers and comics and chorus girls. and it was a bizarre beginning to a life. probably a lot of - most of the questions you ask me today can be answered by that, i think.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: what did you make of it, as a very young boy, watching strippers? did you have any idea what that was about?\n\nalda: i didn't. i didn't. but i do remember - you know, children are so much more aware than everybody gives them credit for. i remember thinking - 'cause when the chorus girls would take me up to their dressing room, you know, they would take me up, and they would comb my hair and talk to me. and i was like a mascot, like a little pet. and then they'd say, ok, ally (ph), we're going to change our clothes now. turn your back. and i'd stand with my face pressed against their costumes hanging on the wall, and i'd smell the perfume and i'd hear them behind me.\n\nand i remember thinking, they don't think this means anything to me. (laughter) you know? but this is really interesting. and it had to make, had to have a tremendous impact on me. it was a very unusual beginning to a life.\n\ngross: growing up on the burlesque circuit, you must have grown up thinking that one of the most important things you could do is have a good gag, good jokes.\n\nalda: i really had a tremendous education watching the greatest comics that we had at the time - rags ragland, phil silvers, red buttons. all these people were - hank henry. he was another great burlesque comic. he was my father's partner, and my father and hank would write their own sketches. watching them from the wings, and then later watching sam levene when he acted with my father in guys and dolls, i would stand in the wings twice a day for two years watching them. and i'd especially watch sam.\n\nall of these people were a tremendous education for me. i stood on the side. and watching from the side, you see not only what their performance is, you see where it comes from. 'cause you're only a few feet from them. and you hear the audience reaction, and you see the way they play the audience. they have the same material every day, but they play the audience in a different way, depending on what the audience gives them back. and that interaction gives you a clue into the way their brains work.\n\nit was a tremendous education for me, and i think i grew up with that interaction with the audience in my head. so when i would write for mash, for instance - which we didn't do in front of a live audience - i would know when i wrote the comedic moment. i would know what the audience reaction was. i could hear the reaction. in most cases, that would be true. i mean, i would - then if i'd see it played in front of a live audience, i'd be happily surprised to see that i had guessed right.\n\ngross: just about everyone i've ever met who grew up in the '50s or '60s was in some production or another - high school, junior high school, summer camp - of guys and dolls. were you ever in a production of it?\n\nalda: yeah. i was in a - not in school. i mean, it was after i was out of school that they were doing productions of it. but i got a - when i was a young, out-of-work actor, only about six or seven years after i stood in the wings watching them do it every day, every week, i got a call. a little theater in illinois was doing it and, would i come out there and do it? did i know the show and did i know the part? and i said, of course, i do. you know, when you're out-of-work actor, you say yes to everything.\n\nwell, i'd only seen it. i hadn't learned it. i didn't know the songs really well, you know. and i didn't know the words. and they had lost their leading man and had to do it in two days. i had two days to get out there. and my hands were shaking when i got on the plane. and i didn't stop shaking until the plane - i never stopped shaking. i mean, i went on opening night with two days rehearsal. i didn't know what i was doing. and i was...\n\ngross: which part was it?\n\nalda: pardon me?\n\ngross: which part?\n\nalda: i was playing my father's part.\n\ngross: sky masterson.\n\nalda: yeah, sky masterson. and i was out in the opening scene. and i didn't - i couldn't even afford my own suit. so they loaned me a suit that had been hanging on a rack for six months someplace. and i kept my hands in my pockets because they were shaking so hard. and i started - i was so nervous i was playing with a piece of lint in my pocket. and, you know, i'm out there on stage playing the scene with the mission doll. so i - halfway through the scene, i take my hand out of my pocket with the lint in it. and i - you know, i casually look down at the lint, and it's not lint. it's a cockroach.\n\ngross: oh, no (laughter).\n\nalda: yeah. and it was very - the sight of that cockroach brought me back to reality with such a jolt that i lost all my nervousness. and i really looked at the woman i was talking to and really talked to her. and i opened my mouth, and a song came out. everything was great. i mean, i'm surprised they don't bring a cockroach on with me, you know, every time i go onstage as a result of that.\n\ngross: now, you were going to go to med school, then became, i think, an english major. what was the turning point where you said, well, forget that; it's show business?\n\nalda: i never really wanted to go to medical school. my father wanted me to go. he always wanted me to be a doctor.\n\ngross: and you were but just on television.\n\nalda: yeah, he was finally satisfied with that. but here's the thing. doctors were civilians. i was in the arts. i was in show business. that was my life. that was my identity. i didn't want to do anything else. and when people ask me for advice - young people who want to be actors or writers - especially if they want to be actors, i say to them, if there's anything else you can do, you should do it. if there's any hint that you can do something else, don't waste your life trying to be in show business because you have to have an all-consuming need to do it - an all-consuming passion. and i did have that. there was nothing else that i would consider being.\n\ngross: what kind of career did you see for yourself when you started in show business?\n\nalda: i wanted to be able to work in material that i cared about. i wanted to work with actors that i respected. and i wanted to do that in front of an audience that would get it - you know, that would appreciate the, you know, rich material, something that wasn't just a lot of foolishness.\n\ngross: and do you feel like you got it?\n\nalda: yeah, i got - i was very lucky. i got it. i would have been happy if i could do that even in a small theater in - you know, out in the boondocks. it didn't matter to me as long as i had those three things - and as long as i could, you know, support a family. but i got it. i got this one-in-a-million opportunity to to do those three things in the big leagues. i mean, that usually doesn't happen.\n\nbianculli: alan alda speaking to terry gross in 1997. this weekend, he receives the life achievement award from the screen actors guild. coming up, i review the upcoming tnt mystery miniseries i am the night, starring chris pine. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of the adam price group's storyville)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
against the odds, a royal wedding worth watching\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption phil noble/ap phil noble/ap\n\ni belong to a generation of americans for whom the idea of not only a royal wedding but a royal marriage was largely established by charles and diana, the prince and princess of wales. their staid ceremony and their seemingly joyless marriage (aside from the births of their children) made marrying into the royal family look less like a fantasy than like a march into oblivion — a grudgingly accepted transformation into a wealthy but hollowed-out target for photographers hoping to catch you at your worst.\n\neven william and kate's wedding in 2011, while a considerably happier affair, wasn't particularly surprising. it felt — from my perspective on the street outside — like a beautiful but utterly traditional event. perhaps even beautiful because it was utterly traditional, but carried out with some actual pleasure.\n\nfrom the time prince harry and meghan markle — now the duke and duchess of sussex — got engaged, their relationship was considerably less expected. markle is an american. her mother is black. she's an active feminist. she's an actress. she's divorced. she took such abuse in public in the early days of their relationship that harry issued a statement explicitly calling out its sexism and racism — calling it sexism and racism, in those words.\n\nand by the time the wedding started saturday morning, commentators were talking about elements of the ceremony that wouldn't be traditional for royal weddings: that markle would walk herself down the aisle before being joined by harry's father, prince charles, for the final leg. (an act that's still considered rebellious even by some who are not british royalty.) that harry would wear a wedding ring. that an american episcopal bishop named michael curry would give the address.\n\noh, we will come back to him.\n\nthe ceremony began as you might expect: with a lot of emphasis on great hats. british weddings may offer americans their best opportunity to look at the kinds of hats that we, regrettably, don't wear all that often. and perhaps because markle is an american actress, there were even more celebrities to look at than usual. actress priyanka chopra wore a sculpted lavender number i could have looked at all day, and serena williams had a divine stand-up fascinator. camilla parker-bowles, the duchess of cornwall and charles' wife, wore a broad, flat swirl of feathery peach.\n\nbut then markle herself appeared for the first time, making public a dress that had been treated as a secret only slightly less important than spycraft. and while she had an elaborate veil, with flowers from every country in the commonwealth embroidered on it, her dress was very simple. aggressively simple, even, other than the boat neck. her hair and makeup were simple as well: her hair was in a low bun that was a touch loose, and her makeup was natural-looking enough that it didn't obscure her freckles. even in a tiara, she looked like an american actress might look when marrying anyone — not just a prince. it will be a snap to copy the dress for its look, if not its quality.\n\nbut nothing felt fresher than the address from bishop michael curry, who's the first black presiding bishop of the u.s. episcopal church. curry is a longtime activist on matters of justice, and he opened by quoting dr. martin luther king, jr. on the redemptive power of love. he moved quickly to stress that romantic love is transformative, but so are other kinds of love: the love between neighbors, and potentially in a new human family. (by all means, read the whole thing.)\n\nbecause curry was a black minister in an overwhelmingly white church at an overwhelmingly white event, the cadences of his speech — unusual for a british chapel but utterly familiar in an american black church, as commentators from both countries noted just before the bbc america coverage signed off — embraced parts of markle's public identity that she's been adamant about maintaining. its very presence at the ceremony acknowledged her, and her mother, doria ragland. it acknowledged the rest of her family, and even the racism that she's faced in public.\n\nat the same time, though, broadening the ceremony beyond the walls of the chapel to encompass the idea of a broader responsibility for each other provided a vital link to how harry's mother, diana, saw the world and her role as a royal. she was an activist always, and her charitable work often seemed to be the only thing she liked about being a princess; the only part of it that brought her any happiness. while curry offered one link between this very british ceremony and markle's american blackness (a gospel choir offered another), he also offered a link between this obscene world of wealth and a man who was raised by a mother who seems to have desperately wanted him to know more of life than that. so both of their mothers felt especially present in that moment, even if only meghan's was seated nearby.\n\nthe case against monarchies is not a hard one to make, particularly from afar. why on earth allow public funds to support such a spectacle? what is a tiara for, in the grand scheme of things? and, of course, the old standard: who cares? (often spoken by those in the process of caring quite deeply, if in the negative.)\n\nbut i couldn't forget, as i watched harry get married, that my first real memory of him as a fully formed human was seeing him as a gutted 12-year-old redhead, walking behind the carriage that carried his mother's casket, his goodbye letter to her in view. he's talked about how agonizing that experience was, and how broken he felt for years after diana's death. so how can it not be some relief to see him and his brother, joking and grinning, not only happy but seemingly at least a little normal, marrying women who looked happier to be marrying them than their mother looked when she married their father? how can it not be a relief to see their father lean over to chuckle with william, and to see him step in to walk markle the rest of the way after her own father tagged out? i empathize with other people's sympathy, i suppose: if one family is to be born into a completely bizarre set of duties and rituals, better that they invite a fiery speaker who advocates for justice; better that they marry people they seem to like and mutter sweet nothings to each other when they don't have to. better that they place conviction on that platform than simply tradition.\n\nof course, the parts of this ceremony that felt modernizing were only symbolic for everyone except the couple themselves. it doesn't actually modernize the monarchy, let alone a country, to invite one minister rather than another; it doesn't change anything for poor people to have a gospel choir singing.\n\nbut everything the monarchy does — except, perhaps, spend money — is symbolic. messaging is, at this point in history, most of its purpose. harry himself has acknowledged its magic but also that nobody would really want to be king or queen if it weren't a duty. even if the monarchy moves with the speed of a sloth on benzos, if it must exist with all this pageantry and absurdity to accompany it, why not some joy as well? why not some interest in the wider world? why not some gospel music and some beautiful cello performance?\n\nit's hard to defend a royal wedding as anything other than a lark. but it's not hard to understand why for a lot of people, this one was more pleasurable — and perhaps more moving — than they expected.
north korean leader kim jong un kicks off new year with address and a warning to u.s.\n\nin his new year's day address, kim jong un said he's committed to denuclearization, but warned north korea will take a new path if the u.s. maintains sanctions against his country.\n\naudie cornish, host:\n\nsitting in a leather chair in a wood-paneled room, north korea's leader kicked off the new year with an address to his nation and a warning to the u.s. kim jong un said he's willing to meet with president trump a second time but threatened that if international sanctions against north korea continue, he'll have no choice but to take a new path.\n\nnpr's anthony kuhn joins us now from seoul to talk about what this could mean. and, anthony, since president trump met kim jong un in singapore for that historic summit last year in june, the nuclear issue has been somewhat stalled. so can you tell us what new information you heard in kim's speech?\n\nanthony kuhn, byline: actually, most of the speech was not about the nuclear issue. it was for a domestic audience, news about the economy. but he did repeat his pledge to denuclearize and mend fences with the u.s. now, let's hear one of the more optimistic, upbeat parts of his speech.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nsupreme leader kim jong un: (speaking korean).\n\nkuhn: it is our party and republic's unchanging position and my unwavering will, he said, to establish a new relationship between the dprk and the u.s. that meets the demands of the new century and to establish a permanent, stable peace regime on the korean peninsula and move towards complete denuclearization. by dprk, he meant the democratic people's republic of korea, which is its formal name.\n\nanalysts point out that there was actually something significant elsewhere in the speech. he said that north korea would stop building atomic bombs, basically cap his country's nuclear program. but as you mentioned, there was also this warning that if the u.s. tries to sanction north korea into submission or just runs out their patience, then all bets are off, and there could be a return to confrontation.\n\ncornish: you mentioned a warning. did kim provide any specifics of what he wants from president trump?\n\nkuhn: i think it's pretty clear that he mostly just wants the meeting at this point, and we know this because north korea has refused to engage in working-level talks with the u.s., particularly mike pompeo and u.s. special envoy steve biegun have basically been shut out. so analysts believe that north korea is betting everything on a second summit with trump, where they will try to manipulate him into making more concessions.\n\nand the - north korea's point has been pretty consistent in past months. they say, look, since the summit, we have dismantled some of our nuclear and missile testing facilities, and now we expect the u.s. to reciprocate by providing security guarantees and easing sanctions. the u.s. wants to start off as a first move by providing an inventory of all its nuclear assets, but north korea refuses to do that.\n\ncornish: what about the relationship with south korea? the two leaders met, i think, about three times in the past year. did kim jong un say anything about south korea in his speech?\n\nkuhn: yes. he talked about continuing the thaw in relations with south korea. now, at times, the u.s. has seemed nervous that this sort of inter-korean rapprochement is getting out too far ahead of the nuclear issue. but lately, they seem to have had a change of heart. they seem to have decided that it doesn't really cost them anything at this point. there's only so far they can go with those sanctions still in place. and they hope that this will just improve the atmosphere and maybe make talks a little bit easier.\n\nand that is why the u.s. gave its blessing to last week's groundbreaking on a project to connect railways between the two koreas. and the u.s. says it will try to ensure that the sanctions that are in place do not prevent u.s. aid groups from delivering humanitarian assistance to the north.\n\ncornish: it's interesting. i understand kim talked about an end to u.s.-south korean joint military exercises. and at the same time, the u.s. and south korea failed to meet a deadline to renew a funding agreement for u.s. forces in south korea, right? so there's this little dispute going on between the u.s. and south korea. how does that affect this conversation?\n\nkuhn: well, these - the two sides were supposed to come up with a new agreement before the old one expired last night. but the u.s. reportedly wants south korea to increase its contribution by 50 percent, and seoul says no. the trump administration wants all u.s. allies to pay more, and it's focusing on south korea first. the south koreans are also somewhat unnerved by the resignation of defense secretary mattis because he was a consistent advocate for the alliance. it's not clear that the u.s. congress would allow any sort of pullout of u.s. troops, but any sign that the u.s. commitment to the defense of south korea is wavering has seoul very concerned.\n\ncornish: that's npr's anthony kuhn in seoul. thank you for your reporting.\n\nkuhn: sure thing, audie.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
new technology aims to take the sugar out of gelato — not the flavor\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption irina marwan/getty images irina marwan/getty images\n\na lick of cold, creamy gelato isn't just magic. it's mathematics.\n\nyou have to respect the range, emphasizes gianpaolo valli, a senior instructor at carpigiani gelato university in bologna, italy, who has spent decades drilling aspiring gelato chefs on the right ratio of solids to water in any given recipe. (fyi: solids need to be between 32 and 46 percent.) if your numbers are off, you're likely to end up with a disaster instead of a dessert.\n\nthat's particularly true if you skimp on sugar, which is considered critical for achieving a smooth consistency. too little, and the result is a hard, icy mass.\n\nor, at least, that was what used to happen.\n\nin january at sigep, the annual mega trade show in rimini dedicated to gelato (and pastry, chocolate and coffee), carpigiani — the leading manufacturer of gelato machines — unveiled a new technology to defy the law of balancing. come to a demonstration, the company beckoned, to see how to make previously impossible gelato or sorbet: flavors made with zero added sugars.\n\nthink you've seen that before? nope, you haven't, says valli, who's been teaching a special class for the past four years on lowering the glycemic index of gelato. because of that darned range, sugars have always had to be replaced, usually with substitutes such as stevia or sugar alcohols. that doesn't necessarily lead to bad gelato, but most folks agree there's room for improvement. for instance, consuming sugar alcohols can lead to bloating and diarrhea.\n\nthis new innovation instead tackles the issue with precisely calibrated cold and hot gas and advances in computer algorithms. machines have long relied on temperature control to maintain the small ice crystals that give gelato its signature structure. with carpigiani's latest program, the machine's batch freezers have become smarter and more responsive, so they're able to recognize an unconventional mixture and make whatever adjustments necessary to keep those small crystals.\n\nbasically, the machine fixes the balance for you, explains carpigiani gelato university's technical director luciano ferrari, who notes the development is the product of years of research and head-scratching. the diet of the world is going toward a reduction of sugars overall, he says, and that's a problem for a company whose mission is to keep people eating gelato, and often promotes it as a smarter alternative to ice cream, which has a higher fat content.\n\nwalking around sigep — despite the freshly made waffles and cappuccino foam artist demos — there was no doubt the industry has customer health in mind. (although some claims of nutrition benefits were dubious.) across the exhibit hall from carpigiani sat a booth dedicated to an asphalt-hued flavor called black hawaii. made with vegetable carbon, coconut water and raw cocoa, it's marketed as detox effect. (though the evidence that detox diets work is lacking, cutting back on sugar is a good idea.) it's also available in cake form! just a few feet away, visitors could sample alvena's abbronzatissimo, a new base for chocolate gelato spiked with hot pepper, paprika and carrots, as well as the natural antioxidants from olives. and there was vegan stuff absolutely everywhere.\n\ntoggle caption vicky hallett for npr\n\noffering flavors geared toward specific diet concerns broadens a gelateria's appeal, explains giampaolo pelli, co-owner of le botteghe di leonardo, a small italian chain of shops that emphasizes its use of only seasonal fruit, fresh cream and organic eggs. because there are, we know, a lot of problems that people have, he says, its menus always include several dairy-free options and at least one stevia-sweetened flavor, which is a hit with diabetics.\n\nbaby steps\n\nbetween meetings with suppliers, pelli was searching sigep for ways to improve his products. every year, you can do a little step, he says.\n\nthat seemed to be the mindset of most of the gelato insiders crammed into one of the carpigiani workshops. valli launched the session by jokingly lamenting, in the last days, and weeks, i'm sad for myself. and he explained how his beloved range was no longer necessary — if you're using the gelato 0+ setting only available on carpigiani's high-end, high-efficiency line of products. (a single machine costs between $30,000 and $40,000.)\n\nwhy are we thinking to cancel sugar? because we know about metabolic disease. because we don't eat very well, said valli, who then presented the simple no-sugar-added base he would turn into hazelnut gelato. he poured it into the machine, which did its magical balancing act while he gave a quick rundown on prepping a similar fruit sorbet.\n\nminutes later, he had a tray of something that looked, well, like gelato. he proudly opened the machine to reveal that no ice had gotten stuck inside. an assistant began distributing cups of the dessert, each stabbed with a tiny spoon.\n\ndoes it stay creamy? a distributor wanted to know. valli replied that it does, for up to two days, but noted it should never get too cold because this gelato must be kept a few degrees warmer than traditional varieties. this gelato is unique, like a baby, said valli, who wants people to remember that there are still a lot of unknowns. (this knowledge arrived not years ago. just one month ago.)\n\nindeed, anyone itching to find this gelato at a neighborhood scoop shop should probably chill. the technology is just rolling out — through new machines and software updates on older ones — and recipes will require finessing and experimenting. plus, because of the temperature issue, shops selling the stuff will need a separate display cabinet.\n\nand there was something else worth noting: all of the recipes carpigiani presented at sigep, including the fruit sorbets, featured a tiny bit of what valli calls intensive sweetness, in this case, an italian product called diete.tic. the structure is perfect without it, he promises, but one consequence of cutting all of the sugar out of a recipe is that the taste suffers. so, in his 3,500-gram batches of gelato — which would normally have 700 grams of sugar — there were just 10 grams of this intensive sweetness.\n\npolling a few pros in the crowd after the session, they said lack of flavor was a problem even with the additional ingredient. to get to the perfect product, it still needs a lot of work. but i love the idea of it, said sonja ruppert, who works at a gelato shop in newton, mass. so did her 10-year-old daughter, nadin, who couldn't wait to get home and tell her grandmother, who's diabetic. she's going to appreciate this so much, she said, between bites of a no-sugar-added mango sorbet.\n\ndessert is not health food\n\nstill, don't expect gelato to ever be classified as a health food, warns allison sylvetsky, an assistant professor at the george washington university's milken institute school of public health who studies the consumption and affects of sugar-sweetened beverages and artificial sweeteners.\n\nyes, it's good to cut added sugars from your diet, she says. but dessert is still dessert, even if it's made with fewer calories. people think it's a get-out–of-jail-free card, sylvetsky notes, pointing to the example of the hugely popular halo top ice cream. its packaging promotes its low-calorie count, and then uses that to encourage people to devour an entire pint at a time. she also calls out bottled smoothies that are 100 percent fruit juice, and pack in 300 calories a bottle. sylvetsky's advice is to still watch how much you're eating, and consider the potential unintended consequences that might come from consuming sugar substitutes.\n\nas for valli, he predicts the real future of this technology isn't to banish sugar from gelato completely, but to make it possible to cut the amount by a half or a third. after checking out the carpigiani workshop, that's what appeals to monica maccioni, who runs bobboi natural gelato in la jolla, calif., with her husband, andrea racca. they have wanted to find ways to reduce sugar, but are wary of substitutes that clash with their philosophy of working from scratch with real ingredients.\n\nthe italian phrase they like to use when discussing portion size, racca explains, is poco poco, which translates as just a little bit. maybe that's the best way to change gelato, too.\n\nvicky hallett is a freelance writer based in florence, italy.

click here.\n\nevery vote will count, of course. but the investments that the campaigns make in certain areas could be especially important.\n\nmilwaukee saw a decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 of 41,000 voters. so if a democratic candidate could invigorate many of those voters who stayed home, that could be decisive. in july, the democratic national convention will come to milwaukee, in part with the hope of energizing some of those voters.\n\nmeanwhile, the state's republican party has opened its first field office in the city — on its predominantly african american north side.\n\nas this plays out, the role wisconsin's voter id law has had in suppressing or turning out voters is also still up for debate. supporters say same-day registration and free voter ids make those concerns moot, but larger cities have expanded early voting with an eye toward combating what they insist is an effort to depress turnout among voters of color and those who are younger and lower income.\n\n— ann-elise henzl, wuwm news director, and kyla calvert mason, wisconsin public radio assistant news director\n\norange county, calif.\n\norange county democrats are patting themselves on the back these days for turning the longtime republican stronghold blue. republicans there lost congressional districts in 2018, and the number of registered democrats in the county recently overtook republicans for the first time since the 1970s.\n\nthe state of our party is stronger than ever, ada briceño, chair of the democratic party of orange county, recently said.\n\nthat change was, in part, ushered in by recent demographic shifts – especially a growing share of latino and asian residents.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above? click here.\n\nbut nothing is a done deal. democrats also acknowledge they'll have to recruit and fight like hell to keep up their momentum, as democratic rep. gil cisneros put it.\n\nrepublicans in the county say they are also fired up, especially those who opposed president trump's impeachment trial.\n\n[i]t's not a moderate thing to do, said randall avila, executive director of the orange county gop. i don't see [democrats] addressing the issues that orange county families really are focused on and care about. — libby denkmann, kpcc politics reporter\n\npensacola, fla.\n\npensacola is the western gate to the sunshine state was a greeting beloved former mayor vince whibbs gave to visitors for years. it's a patriotic community, with the largest concentration of military veterans in any congressional district. here, you would be hard-pressed to pass five houses without seeing a flag flying properly.\n\nnorthwest floridians have a heart as big as their love of old glory and the military. here, you'll see dozens of cars pulled over to pay respect as a funeral procession passes.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above?

click here.\n\nthe suburbs around philadelphia had been growing less and less republican over the decades, but democrats are hoping the 2018 and 2019 elections were the tipping points for making those areas blue. in 2018, four democratic women won congressional seats, most of them from the philly suburbs. and the delegation is now evenly split with nine from each party in the u.s. house. in 2019 local elections, governments in three suburban counties flipped from republican to democrat – one for the first time since the civil war.\n\npresident trump's support in pennsylvania doesn't follow strict party lines. those who flock to his rallies (he has held at least seven here since his election) include voters who like his brash style and those who may not, but credit him with adding jobs and making the stock market soar.\n\nwhen trump makes his pitch to african american voters, he often does it in pennsylvania. he made a high-profile trip to philly in september 2016 to try to attract african american voters. and his supporters have been organizing in the city, even though democrats outnumber republicans about 7-to-1 in philadelphia. — eugene sonn, whyy news director\n\nsouthwest washington state\n\nsouthwest washington state is a part of the country that has shifted over the past 30 years from a reliably blue democratic area of working and middle-class voters to a solidly purple region that significantly favored donald trump in 2016.\n\nthat shift can be partly attributed to job decline in traditional western extractive industries, such as timber and mining. in recent years, there have also been clashes over culture as rising housing costs along the west coast have pushed urban residents from seattle as well as oregon and california into the quickly growing region. at the same time, clark county — southwest washington's most populous county — has seen significant growth in white-collar sectors like technology and finance.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above?

despite huge backlogs, the government shutdown halts most immigration court hearings\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption daniel ochoa de olza/ap daniel ochoa de olza/ap\n\nthe federal government shutdown — caused in part by disagreements over immigration policy — is delaying immigration court hearings across the country.\n\ncourt appointments scheduled during the shutdown will be reset to new dates in the future, per a notice from the department of justice dated dec. 26. the only exception are courts operating in immigration detention centers, where federal immigration authorities hold immigrants pending deportation. however, court staff may not be paid while continuing to hear those cases.\n\nin addition, some emergency motions in nondetained cases can still be filed to the judges that are working during the shutdown.\n\nshutting down the country's massive system of immigration courts will gum up an already congested judicial process, immigration judges and attorneys say.\n\nwe don't have time to adequately consider the cases that we do have, much less have to spend extra time to think about what we're going to do with all the cases that have to be rescheduled.\n\nin federal immigration court, judges often hear cases in quick succession, a process some have compared to hearing death penalty cases heard in traffic court settings. a swift deportation may become a death sentence if a person is forced to return to a violent homeland.\n\neach day of the shutdown means thousands of cases will be pushed back indefinitely, according to ashley tabaddor, president of the national association of immigration judges. tabaddor said she currently has around 2,000 cases before her court in los angeles, while some judges have upwards of 4,000.\n\nwe don't have time to adequately consider the cases that we do have, much less have to spend extra time to think about what we're going to do with all the cases that have to be rescheduled, she said.\n\ncalls to the u.s. department of justice asking for more information about the rescheduling went unreturned, and emails to department press officers returned auto replies saying they were furloughed.\n\nin recent years, the backlog of immigration court cases in the u.s. has swelled, as processing times lagged. the average case making its way through immigration courts today has been there for 718 days, or almost two years, according to the transactional records access clearinghouse at syracuse university, which compiles statistics on u.s. immigration. that's up from 430 days a decade ago.\n\nsome administration officials and immigration hard-liners have criticized long processing times as contributing to practices that allow immigrants without strong cases to stay in the u.s. for years, rather than be swiftly deported.\n\nto try to move cases through more quickly, the trump administration imposed quotas on immigration judges in 2018, requiring them to clear 700 cases a year or get docked points on their performance evaluations. however, under former attorney general jeff sessions, the department of justice also changed policy so that more than 300,000 closed immigration cases could be reactivated. if reopened, those claims would swell the backlog of cases from upwards of an estimated 768,000 cases to more than 1 million.\n\nboth policies drew criticism from judges such as tabaddor, who called the quotas indefensible and a sign that immigration court should be made independent of the executive branch.\n\nit's quite ironic to shut down the immigration courts because of the differences on immigration, she said, referring to president trump's desire for funding additional barriers at u.s.-mexico border.\n\nit's hard to generalize how delays generated by the government shutdown could change the outcomes of the cases themselves.\n\nrescheduling a case can be devastating for some individuals. for others, it may actually be a blessing in disguise, said maurice goldman, an immigration attorney in tucson, ariz.\n\nfor example, pushing back a hearing could mean an immigrant who qualifies for status now may not in the future if immigration policies are restricted. or, if an immigrant doesn't have a strong claim for status, a delay means more time in the u.s. and maybe even qualifying for another form of immigration status in the interim.\n\nevery immigration attorney who is honest will tell you that sometimes getting cases delayed is the best thing for the case, said philadelphia immigration attorney matthew archambeault. in either instance, unexpected delays can be confusing for clients because they have nothing to do with the facts of their cases and because the shutdown could end at any time.\n\nthe thing i tell them is, something's going on, their hearings may not go forward, but to prepare like they're going to go forward, said archambeault. i don't get into it too much.
14 states will participate in super tuesday's nominating contests\n\nnpr's david greene talks to karen finney, a spokesperson for hillary clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, about whether the democratic race will be more defined after super tuesday states vote.\n\ndavid greene, host:\n\nwell, the race for the democratic presidential nomination is finally going national this week. it has been state by state until now, but tomorrow, voters in 14 states will have their say. if we look at the delegate count, the front-runners are bernie sanders, who has won two of the four contests so far, and joe biden, who secured a big victory in south carolina over the weekend. they will be up against one fewer candidate after pete buttigieg ended his campaign last night. he addressed his supporters in his hometown of south bend, ind.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npete buttigieg: i hope that everyone who has been part of this in any way knows that the campaign that you have built and the community that you have created is only the beginning of the change that we are going to make together.\n\n(cheering)\n\ngreene: so what, if any, impact could buttigieg's departure have? i want to begin that conversation with karen finney, who is with us this morning. she was director of communications at the dnc, also a spokesperson for hillary clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. and we should say, she's been skeptical of bernie sanders' electability in the past and has criticized the behavior of some of his supporters online. karen, thanks for coming in again. we always appreciate having you here.\n\nkaren finney: great to be with you.\n\ngreene: so who, if anyone, do you see benefiting from buttigieg's departure?\n\nfinney: it's most likely that it will be biden, given that he had such a big night on saturday, which has, i think, refueled his campaign but also have - made a lot of donors and, i think, voters take a much more serious second look. and with mayor buttigieg out of the race, biden looks - and since it's looking like it's going to come down to biden and bernie, i think his voters will likely move over to senator - former vice president biden.\n\ngreene: well, let me just ask you about that if - and why you believe that because, you know, i was looking at this morning consult poll recently - 21% of those who backed buttigieg said they would turn to sanders; just 19% saying biden. so what makes you confident that they're going to go for joe biden here?\n\nfinney: well, i wouldn't say i'm confident. it just (laughter) - because i - you know, one thing i always say, after having been in politics a long time, you never know what voters are going to do. it's...\n\ngreene: right. and that's...\n\nfinney: ...human behavior.\n\ngreene: ...the beauty of a democracy, right? yeah.\n\nfinney: exactly (laughter). exactly. right, as much as we try to predict. no, i - look - i think if you - for the people who are looking for a moderate solution, you know, vice president biden is the person in this race who offers that. now, it may be the case that we come out of super tuesday with it being much more clearly a biden-senator sanders competition and, you know, that there are more splits within some - you know, we've got some tom steyer supporters out there, as well as pete buttigieg supporters out there.\n\ngreene: or couldn't it be sanders running away with this, possibly? i mean, he has tremendous financial advantage right now. he also won big with latinos in nevada, and there are latino voters that are going to be voting on super tuesday. i mean, is it fair to say that he has the advantages right now, that biden still has a lot of work to do to get back in this race and make it a two-person race?\n\nfinney: oh, no question. i mean, look - i think for vice president biden, i think he said this; he's got a lot of work to do. he - you know, he was fortunate that south carolina - it was a pretty delegate-rich state. and i think it's important that we remember, in addition to the number of votes, this is really about the delegate count right now. and we know that, you know, tomorrow's super tuesday - texas, california, two of the biggest hauls, and the first four early states represent 4%, actually, of the total number of delegates you need. so it just gives us a very early picture.\n\ni think we could come out of super tuesday with a clear front-runner. it could be, you know, separated between three people, four people. that's the beauty of it. we just don't know.\n\ngreene: i want to ask you - i mean, there are bernie sanders supporters - and you could say the candidate himself - who has talked about the party kind of being against his candidacy. but, you know, i look back to 2016. i mean, you had former dnc chair donna brazile writing extensively about these discoveries that the dnc had been financing hillary clinton's campaign at the cost of bernie sanders in 2016. can you reassure sanders supporters that the party is not lining up against him to try and stop him from winning this nomination even if he gets the votes?\n\nfinney: well, couple of things, though, on that, actually. the - that is - what donna wrote about was actually a little bit different than how you just described it. and remember that the party did change the rules so that he could actually run as a democrat.\n\ngreene: but, i mean, she said that a lot of the finances were being controlled by clinton allies, is that fair?\n\nfinney: well, it's because the dnc was broke, and they were going to really not be able to make payroll, and they asked both campaigns to do joint fundraising agreements. senator sanders didn't want to do it; hillary was willing to put the money in.\n\ngreene: i mean, i don't want to relitigate that.\n\nfinney: no.\n\ngreene: but what can you tell sanders supporters....\n\nfinney: yeah.\n\ngreene: ...to convince them that the world is different today?\n\nfinney: well, look - i mean, senator sanders and - had a number of people involved both in the platform process but also, more importantly, in the reform process that happened after the election. that is why there were some changes to the caucus process that - you know, senator sanders wanted caucuses. there were people who wanted to do away with caucuses. there were - you know, he wanted to do away with superdelegates. there were some people who wanted to do - away with superdelegates and wanted to change the rules.\n\nand so the rules that we're operating under now he had a big say in creating, and so i think that's part of why you heard elizabeth warren and others suggesting that his taking a - you know, changing his position is problematic, given that there was such a process that he was involved in this time to create these rules.\n\ngreene: the few seconds we have left - what's the one state you're looking at most tomorrow to see where this race is going?\n\nfinney: texas, both because, you know, based on just what we're seeing in polling but turnout. i mean, one of the things is - for democrats, we're most concerned about is we've got to see bigger turnout and enthusiasm for turning out in the fall.\n\ngreene: karen finney was the spokesperson and head of communications for the dnc and a spokesperson for clinton's 2016 campaign. thanks so much for joining us.\n\nfinney: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

republican rep. don young sees a 'road back to greatness'\n\nrep. don young of alaska has had a pretty good year. he talks with npr's michel martin about his role in getting the new tax bill passed and opening up the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling.\n\nmichel martin, host:\n\nwe've been talking about the government shutdown which comes on the anniversary of donald trump's inauguration as president. thousands of people took to the streets today as they did a year ago in women's marches in cities like new york, houston, chicago, denver, los angeles and here in washington, d.c.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified protesters: (chanting) hey, hey. ho (ph), ho. donald trump has got to go. hey, hey. ho, ho.\n\nmartin: to mark this day, we wanted to take a few minutes to reflect on president trump's first year in office, speaking to people on both sides of the aisle about the president's legacy and lasting imprint so far. earlier in the week, before the shutdown took effect, i spoke with two members of congress about the president's first year in office. we start with republican don young of alaska, the so-called dean of the house. that's a title reserved for the longest-serving representative. it's been 45 years in congressman young's case. we went to his office on capitol hill, and i asked him for his take on donald trump's first year.\n\ndon young: well, president trump's year has been probably more exciting. one thing though i have to stress that i've always said i don't care who the president is, the job of the congress is to lead this nation. we've lost that over the years since 1935, when we started transferring power to the president and to the executive branch. most people are controlled by regulatory law, not legislative law. but overall, for alaska, with secretary zinke, we've undone a lot of what the presidents in the past have done. and i think it gives us more freedom and a chance to take it and improve our nation's and our state's economic bases.\n\nmartin: so let's talk a little bit about productivity. i mean, the president has talked and tweeted about a lot of legislative accomplishments, but really, there's only been one - the tax bill. do you consider this a productive first year?\n\nyoung: well, i do because that's not the only one. you know, the cras - i think there's 11 of those - which are very, very important undoing other laws. and you've got to remember...\n\nmartin: you mean regulatory actions or executive orders?\n\nyoung: executive orders, regulatory actions that were unconstitutional and, very frankly, that we had to do it because otherwise they could undo it. and it could have been done again by another president in the future. so i think that site is very productive. and you look at the stock market where it was before, where it is now. and general attitude, regardless of what you in the media may think, the general attitude in the public's arena think that this country is on the road back to greatness again.\n\nmartin: last year, legislation passed to open the arctic national wildlife refuge to drilling, which is something that has been a goal of yours - if i have this right - for your entire career.\n\nyoung: not entire, 37-and-a-half years.\n\nmartin: thirty-seven-and-a-half years, i stand corrected.\n\nyoung: that's right. but that's a pretty good close deal.\n\nmartin: it was attached to the tax bill, which was controversial. you were part of the reconciliation committee to reach agreement between the house and senate versions of the bill. and i just have to ask you how it felt when it finally passed after you've had this goal for so long?\n\nyoung: well, it was a happy feeling. i have to say that because i, you know, i've argued this so long that i knew i was correct. and my m.o. is - and i've said it many times - that perseverance overcomes intelligence any day of the year. if you decide to do something, you can get it done if you stick with it.\n\nmartin: so let's talk about the politics of the moment, particularly as somebody who's been here for a long time and has seen a lot of - has served him a lot of people in a lot of different environments. i mean, there are some people who call the atmosphere up here toxic. do you think that's true? do you use that word?\n\nyoung: it's not toxic in the sense that it's toxic because we're not getting things done. the chairman used to run the congress, not the president, not the speaker. now, everything's run through nancy's office or run through ryan's office. and in doing so, it becomes a party policy instead of solving a problem. there is no problem that's a republican problem or a democrat problem or a progressive problem, depends on what you want to call them. but there is a problem, and no one can solve it 100 percent their way. they have to do it together or it'll never get solved. and what's happened now, it has to be 100 percent republican or 100 percent democrat. no wants to sit down and say, ok, well, how can we solve the problem? you have to give up a little bit. i have to give up a little bit. the problem's solved.\n\nmartin: i was going to ask you about that because you've got big pieces of legislation only being passed by one side. is this the new normal?\n\nyoung: well, i can't say it's the new normal forever because it may change. right now, it's normal. and it was a - it's a, again, a result, i think - and i'm very critical of the media because we do not get news anymore. we get opinions. it's opinionated information. and so they don't really look or read or understand that there is another side to the issue. and again, we are a reflection - the congress is a reflection of the people they represent. that's all we are. and if the public has this feeling we can't work together, the congress is not going to work together.\n\nmartin: and what about president trump's role in this? do you think he has a role in this? some people see him as the symptom. some people see him as the cause. how do you see him?\n\nyoung: well, i see him as an individual that, very frankly, would make me a lot happier if he didn't tweet or twitter or whatever you call that. i don't do that, by the way. so, you know, i don't know. i think, very frankly, he's doing a great job. he was not my candidate. he knows that. but he's my president. i'm not going to try to crucify him for every little thing he says.\n\nmartin: that's congressman don young, the dean of the house. he was kind enough to host us in his office on capitol hill. congressman young, thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nyoung: my pleasure. good to have you here.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
saturday sports: robert kraft, zion williamson\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nand it's time for sports. there are more charges of misbehavior in the nfl - this time by an owner. a major college star sprains his knee when his nike comes apart - so did their stock prices. we're going to turn now to howard bryant of espn the magazine and espn.com. howard, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nhoward bryant, byline: good morning, scott. how are you?\n\nsimon: fine, thanks. robert kraft, owner of the super bowl-winning new england patriots, faces misdemeanor charges of solicitation at a day spa in palm beach county, fla. he denies the charges. they are serious because police say that the solicitation at this spa is tied to human trafficking. now how likely is it the nfl will discipline maybe its most powerful owner?\n\nbryant: well, i think it's pretty likely that he'll be disciplined at some level. the severity of the discipline i would tend to doubt is going to be particularly harsh. i could be wrong about this, but i think when you look at the history of owners dealing with their own - it's not like they're dealing with a player because you have an owner-management-labor relationship where they are - they took a long time to go after their greatest superstar, tom brady, over a couple of years' worth. but i don't think they'll ever do that to another owner. you remember robert irsay the - i'm sorry, jim irsay, the owner of the colts, had his drug issue, and he didn't really - i mean, he got a little bit punished but not really punished i think.\n\nlet's also not forget the washington redskins had the - in 2013, they had forced their own cheerleaders to go on a business trip to costa rica and be escorts for some of the ownership group, for some of their executives. so i think, obviously, owners are not going to be as harsh on other owners. let's not forget that the commissioner may discipline ownership, but the owner works for the commissioner. so we'll see what happens, but i have a hard time believing the billionaire class is going to be that hard on itself.\n\nsimon: i want to tie two stories of the week together, if i can. thirty seconds into the duke-carolina game, president obama in the stands, zion williamson, duke's transcendent player, sprained his knee. his nike came apart like a cheap suit in a rain storm. and then usa today reports the nba has proposed lowering the league's draft age to 18. zion williamson is 18. isn't it only fair to him and other great 18-year-old athletes to be allowed to play pro ball? so if they're going to risk a career injury, they do it while being paid gobs of money.\n\nbryant: yeah. well, in my opinion 15, 16, 17 and 18-year-old players - and you watch tennis - tracy austin was 14 years old when she played up against chris evert. and so to me, it's always been collusion. you always look at what's taken place between the leagues and the colleges. if you have the ability to play a certain sport, you should be able to play it. i think that we remember not too long ago - it was only about 15 years ago - where they had the rookie age limit when they raised it because they didn't think that the players were mature enough for their millions because they didn't like the look of the new hip-hop generation walking around with gold chains instead of three-piece suits. and so there was a lot of consternation about that.\n\nand then they are the ones that created this one-and-done situation that you have now where you have these great players who are eligible - zion williamson could play in the nba right now, and the only reason that his shoe blew up and he's playing for no money and risked an entire future in the nba is because the nba doesn't let him play in the league right now. so the fact that they're finally going back to lowering the age limit to 18 is a good thing. and i think it's a smart thing that they should have never raised it in the first place.\n\nand once again, i think, when you're looking at this - obviously, you can look at this from an amateur standpoint that the - this is another example that amateurism in the college game has to go. it's not - especially because the irony of this, scott, is that mike krzyzewski, he's the one who controls the shoe contract for the players. so the players have to wear his shoe, he makes the money off of it, and they risk the injury and have no recourse.\n\nsimon: oh, mercy. and i wonder - i - does coach krzyzewski even wear nikes on the sidelines? he usually wears a suit, right?\n\nbryant: yeah, but those checks cash, that's for certain. and so zion williamson has an $8 million insurance policy now. the bottom line is that this has to change, and the nba should do its part. if you're good enough to play in the league, go play in the league.\n\nsimon: howard bryant of espn the magazine and espn.com. yeah, i mean, ballet dancers, right? they - you know, nobody says to them one and done. howard bryant, thanks very much for being with us.\n\nbryant: thank you, scott.\n\n(soundbite of eric vloeimans and gatecrash's piccolo david)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
fauci says u.s. needs more time to 'catch up' on vaccine rollout\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption patrick semansky/pool/afp via getty images patrick semansky/pool/afp via getty images\n\nhealth experts warned that the coronavirus pandemic would get worse before it got better. and that is happening. december was the deadliest month of the pandemic in the united states. the vaccines have made people optimistic, but the process has been slow.\n\ndr. anthony fauci — head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institutes of health, who will be president-elect joe biden's chief medical adviser — said thursday that the initial rollout of covid-19 vaccines has been slow because it came during the holiday period.\n\ni think it would be fair to just observe what happens in the next couple of weeks. if we don't catch up on what the original goal was, then we really need to make some changes about what we're doing, he said in an interview with npr's morning edition.\n\nfauci also said that a more contagious variant of the virus first identified in the united kingdom and now spreading in the u.s. underscores the need to follow public health measures such as wearing a mask and social distancing. and he said that while the u.k. has implemented a lockdown, he doesn't see any enthusiasm for similar nationwide measures in this country.\n\nbelow are highlights of the interview.\n\nwe talked less than a month ago. the u.s. at that point had just reached 300,000 deaths. we are now at more than 360,000 americans dead. should we expect this trend to continue?\n\ni believe, unfortunately, that it will. as we get into the next couple of weeks in january, that likely will be a reflection of the holiday season travel and the congregate settings that usually take place socially during that period of time. we've seen following most events that require travel and ... have people, you know, understandably getting together in a social setting. so we believe things will get worse as we get into january.\n\nhopefully, if we really accelerate our public health measures during that period of time, we'll be able to blunt that acceleration. but that's going to really require people concentrating very, very intensively on doing the kinds of public health measures that we talk about all the time. now's not the time to pull back on this.\n\nis there something that the biden administration can do in 13 days when that presidency begins, something that has not been done yet?\n\nwell, yes. i think that what we're going to be hearing, and you heard the president-elect mentioned this, is to really put a lot of effort into making sure the rollout of the vaccine program accelerates. we want to get it to 1 million vaccinations per day, as the president-elect has mentioned. the idea about having everyone for at least 100 days — at least — wear a mask. everyone uniformly, so we don't have disparities where some people are adhering to public health measures and others are not. and then also a greater interaction, cooperation between the federal government and the states, instead of letting the states in some respects do things on their own to help them not only with plans, but with resources.\n\nwhat do you think is the main reason behind the fact that the vaccine rollout has gone more slowly than expected? and how should the biden administration make it faster?\n\nwell, first of all, i think you have to look at the circumstances of where we are with the rollout. it's the very beginning. and whenever you take an undertaking of a magnitude of trying to vaccinate essentially most of the country, there's always going to be a bump in the road or a hiccup that we see. that's not an excuse, we can't make excuses. but i think that's something to be expected.\n\nthe other thing that in some respects was unfortunate is that it got started right in the middle of the holiday season between christmas and new year's. and that's the reason why things start slow. i think it would be fair to just observe what happens in the next couple of weeks. if we don't catch up on what the original goal was, then we really need to make some changes about what we're doing. but right now, i think we just need to give a little bit slack — not a lot, but enough to say, well, we're past the holiday season, now let's really turn the afterburners on.\n\nmany people, including health experts, are concerned about this more contagious variant of the virus first identified in the u.k. it is now in the u.s. how much does this worry you?\n\nwell, you always have to be concerned when you see mutations that have a functional capability. most mutations of rna viruses in many respects are meaningless. the virus changes a bit, but there's no functional change. we know from the experience in the u.k. that this particular virus is spreading much more rapidly. this just underscores the need to adhere to the public health measures that would prevent the spread of any virus, whatever the mutant is. but the bottom line answer to your question, it's serious enough we have to pay attention to it. we can't just blow it off.\n\ndo you think we need more aggressive lockdowns? the u.k. instituted one this week. should the u.s. do the same?\n\nyou know, at this point a total country lockdown, i don't think there's any enthusiasm for that. there's such a fatigue, a covid-19 fatigue, that just people would have a real tough time with that. short of that, you can do a lot of things. also, in certain regions of the country, for example, california is suffering terribly. they're having a stress on the system with beds, an exhausted health care group. i mean, understandably, these people have been working day and night. when you get to the point where the system is stressed like that, as the governor of california has said, you may look at selective lockdowns in certain parts of the state. i don't think this is something that we're ready for on a countrywide basis. but, you know, you have to keep your eye on everything that's going on and always keep all options open.\n\nwe try to avoid always asking you to predict the future. but if americans did abide by the public health measures — measures like social distancing and masking — when could things get back to normal?\n\nwell, you know, you can't look at that in a vacuum because as we're trying to get people to adhere uniformly to public health measures, we're having the rollout of the vaccine. we have a highly efficacious vaccine, 94% to 95% effective. as the months go by, i would expect by the time we get to april, it will be what we call open season on vaccines. everyone will be able to get a vaccine. so i think by the end of the summer, if we get 70% to 85% of the population vaccinated and get a good herd immunity, i think by the fall we could start to approach some form of normality.\n\nphil harrell and steve mullis produced and edited the audio version of this story. avie schneider produced for the web.
'ambitious girl' reminds kids: your dreams are not a drawback\n\nmeena harris and marissa valdez/little, brown and company books for young readers\n\nwhen now vice-president-elect kamala harris was accused of being too ambitious on the campaign trail, it spurred her niece, activist and author meena harris, into action.\n\nit really just stopped me in my tracks. ... i had had enough, harris says.\n\nso she wrote a children's book called ambitious girl, in the hope that no young woman in the next generation would have her dreams characterized as a liability.\n\ni was thinking about my kids ... harris says. like, are we still going to be doing this with my daughters? telling them, you know: you can be ambitious but not too ambitious. stay in your lane. stay in your little box.\n\nthe book, which is illustrated by marissa valdez, is a celebration of ambition. it was really about reclaiming that word, redefining it, reframing it for the next generation, harris says.\n\ninterview highlights\n\non what inspired her to write children's books\n\nbecoming a kids' book author is never what i imagined. it was never on my my bucket list. i'm sort of an accidental author. ... [i remember] reading the classics to my older daughter and wondering, you know, where the black children were. they were not represented on the pages of books. we would color the skin color in with a brown marker; often we would change pronouns from he, to she, to they.\n\nand i saw, you know, firsthand ... this idea that you can't be what you can't see. ... now [my daughter] says she wants to be a president and an astronaut when she grows up — and that is because she saw a family member running for president. it's because she read a book about [astronaut] mae jemison.\n\nmeena harris and marissa valdez/little, brown and company books for young readers\n\non the idea that you should not let anyone else define you\n\ndon't let anyone tell you who you are. you tell them who you are. ... that is actually something my grandmother used to say often to my aunt, my mom and to me. ... you are the only person who has power to define who you are — what your ambitions are and what your impact on the world will be. no one else should have the power to do that. and i think inherent in that is, again, claiming your ambition.\n\nlittle, brown and company books for young readers\n\non daring to be the first\n\nwe need to continue to elect women leaders and to appoint women to positions of leadership ... my grandmother had another saying, which was: you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you're not the last. ... daring to be the first woman elected to do something, or the first black woman to be elected is, by definition, ambitious. and it's also not only ... achieving representation, but in doing so, you know, people are not able to tell us: oh, it can't be done — it's never been done, so it can't be done. it's about challenging the status quo.\n\non where she gets her creative spark\n\nmy grandmother was such an influential figure in my life. and when you say that spark, i mean, i immediately think of her. that's the life that she lived — just unapologetically her — and encouraged all of us to pursue our dreams in the same way.\n\ni come from this family of social justice lawyers and i had these incredible role models. right? but i was always encouraged to pursue my dreams — not to be corny — but that's how i was raised ... and i'm super thankful for that.\n\nenlarge this image meena harris and marissa valdez/little, brown and company books for young readers meena harris and marissa valdez/little, brown and company books for young readers\n\nkalyani saxena and william troop produced and edited this interview for broadcast. beth novey adapted it for the web.
trump is worried about the trade deficit with germany. he needn't be\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption philippe wojazer /afp/getty images philippe wojazer /afp/getty images\n\nat the g-7 summit last week, donald trump glad-handed and posed for photo ops with leaders including german chancellor angela merkel. tuesday, however, he had some harsh words for merkel's germany.\n\nwe have a massive trade deficit with germany, plus they pay far less than they should on nato & military. very bad for u.s. this will change, he tweeted on tuesday morning.\n\nthat massive trade deficit is what we're going to focus on here. trump often brings up trade deficits with other countries, but economists say that this is the wrong way to think about trade deficits. moreover, to cast trade deficits as uniformly bad — as some sort of score of who's winning and losing in global economics — ignores the substantial gains that countries make from trade.\n\na trade deficit results when a country imports more than it exports — that is, it buys more from the rest of the world than it sells to the rest of the world. trump is talking here about what is called a bilateral trade deficit — a trade deficit that describes only what two countries buy from and sell to each other.\n\nmassive may be in the eye of the beholder here. the u.s. ran a trade deficit of around $65 billion with germany in 2016. that's substantial — around one-eleventh of the total u.s. trade deficit — but it's not gargantuan. the u.s. deficit with china, by comparison, was $347 billion in that year. and the total u.s. trade deficit was around $734 billion.\n\nbilateral trade deficits aren't all that important\n\ncaring all that much about the u.s. trade deficit with germany in particular doesn't make much sense, said douglas irwin, professor of economics at dartmouth college, because germany is part of the european union.\n\nit's like saying our trade deficit with alberta is hurting us, he said. the economic union between european nations means it doesn't make sense to single out germany in particular.\n\nbut much more importantly, bilateral trade deficits just don't say much about u.s. economic health at all, as former u.s. trade representative carla hills told npr in april.\n\nbilateral trade deficits are not as relevant as your overall trade deficit, hills said. i have a deficit with my grocery, and i have a surplus with my clients. but i can't have a surplus with my grocer. i have to buy from them.\n\nwere you to look solely at hills' grocery bills, you might think she were in dire financial straits; it would look like she spends all her money there, and they never give her any back.\n\nbut the grocer is simply better at providing food than hills is, so she relies on him. and that grocer likely isn't trained to fill cavities, so the grocer goes to a dentist for that. and on and on and on — this is just how trade works. countries sell the things that they are good at producing, and they can simply buy the things they're not so good at producing from other places.\n\nlikewise, while the u.s. buys lots more goods from germany and china than those countries buy from the u.s., the u.s. also does run some trade surpluses with countries including hong kong, australia and brazil (among others).\n\nthe global trade deficit is a different story\n\nthe united states' total global trade deficit of $734 billion matters more than the u.s. trade deficit with germany (or china or mexico or whatever other country trump may be tweeting about on any given day). and that might sound bad — it sounds like the u.s. is consistently sending all of its money out into the world and getting no money back.\n\nmoreover, a trade deficit subtracts from the nation's total gdp. and because a lot of what the u.s. is buying from overseas is manufactured goods, a trade deficit hits american manufacturing harder than other industries, as economists gary hufbauer and eujin jang wrote earlier this year.\n\nbut a big trade deficit isn't necessarily bad. there are a few ways to see why this is. one is that a trade deficit doesn't say much about the overall current health of the economy — a surplus or a shrinking deficit doesn't necessarily signal a healthy economy, and a bigger deficit doesn't necessarily mean a failing economy.\n\nhere's one simple example of why that is: the u.s. trade deficit has tended to fall in recent years when the u.s. economy is doing worse. in the run-up to the great recession, the trade deficit shrank, going from around $816 billion in 2008 to around $500 billion in 2009.\n\nthat didn't signify good economic health and americans suddenly producing more compared to other countries; it signified americans buying less stuff from other countries.\n\nso all those dollars going out aren't necessarily a bad thing. and here's one big reason why: other countries are investing in the u.s. at the same time, as economist chad bown told npr's john ydstie in april.\n\nwe're essentially borrowing from the rest of the world at relatively low interest rates to be able to make the investments that we need without having to do the savings ourselves, he said.\n\nthat means americans don't have to sock away a bunch of money to fund that investing (which is good, because americans aren't saving enough to do that, as ydstie reported).\n\nthis does show a potentially dangerous flip side to a trade deficit, however: if all that investing is holding interest rates down, it can lead to bubbles. a big trade deficit may have therefore been related to the housing bubble of the mid-2000s, irwin explained.\n\nthe u.s. also has one more unique thing going for it: dollars are used all over the world.\n\nwe are the reserve currency of the world, irwin said. there's a shortage of safe assets in the world. the dollar's considered a safe asset, so it's widely used; it's widely popular; it's in demand.\n\nhe added, that's a burden and a privilege.\n\nall that demand for dollars makes the dollar stronger. and a strong dollar hurts exports, because it makes u.s. goods more expensive to foreign buyers. that can push up the trade deficit.\n\n(moreover, this implies that the u.s. economy needs to run a trade deficit to keep the global economy going.)\n\nbut then, for a factory worker whose plant has moved to mexico, it could be tough to make the case that trade isn't a destructive force. this is the hard truth of the trade-offs of trade: trade does bring widespread economic benefits (a wider variety of goods, lower prices) but it can also be harmful to particular people.\n\nand something similar is true of trade deficits: while it's easy to see them as some sort of an international scoreboard of who's winning or losing at trade, they are neither entirely good nor entirely bad.
hundreds injured in clashes over aid shipments in venezuela\n\nwe have an update on the situation in venezuela, one day after volunteers tried to force their way into the country with u.s. food aid.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nwe begin this hour in venezuela. after a day of bloody clashes, secretary of state mike pompeo has warned the u.s. will take action. vice president mike pence is headed to the region and will meet with juan guaido, the opposition lawmaker whom the u.s. recognizes as interim president. guaido is calling for nations to consider all measures to oust president nicolas maduro. npr's eyder peralta has been covering this story from the venezuelan capital of caracas. we'll get to him in a moment. but first, john otis is at santander bridge, one of colombia's crossings into venezuela, where many of yesterday's confrontations took place. and he joins us from there now. john, good morning.\n\njohn otis, byline: good morning, lulu.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so tell us - what is the scene there today?\n\notis: well, it's a lot quieter than it was yesterday. the colombian government has actually closed down the border to kind of take stock of what happened yesterday and try to get the bridge cleared off. there were aid trucks there that were burned yesterday that are still smoldering today as we speak. but the masses of people that filled this bridge yesterday are gone. i did run into about two dozen venezuelan protesters. but they were pretty quickly scared off by the venezuelan military. on the other side of the bridge, they shot off some tear gas and were actually throwing some rocks at the protesters. so it wasn't quite the violent scenes that we saw yesterday.\n\ngarcia-navarro: yeah. yesterday, the opposition tried to get aid into venezuela. and they were blocked. the hope was that the military would allow them in and that this - their support from maduro would crumble. but that didn't happen despite some defections. so where does that leave everyone?\n\notis: well, lulu, juan guaido is not calling for further efforts to get the supplies into venezuela today. he's not telling people to go back and protest and try to force the aid in. there were hundreds of people who were injured yesterday. and people came away really quite demoralized about what happened. you know, it kind of seems like juan guaido and the opposition lost yesterday's aid battle. but again, the optics were really bad for the maduro government. it's not often that you see aid trucks being set on fire when they're trying to get into a country where there are chronic shortages of food and medicine.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and what are you hearing from the venezuelans on the colombian side of the border that you've been able to speak with?\n\notis: well, you know, some of them have just gotten, you know, more radical. and some are calling, you know, for a u.s. invasion or some kind of a foreign intervention to help them out. after the violence broke out yesterday, i met a young lawyer named lizbeth (ph). she didn't want to give her full name because she still has a lot of family back in venezuela. after losing her job, she came to colombia with her husband and three children. and i met her under a bridge pouring sand, motor oil and gasoline into beer bottles. so here's this lawyer making molotov cocktails to throw at the soldiers. and this is what she had to say.\n\nlizbeth: (speaking spanish).\n\notis: she told me that the violence is now necessary to liberate the country and that she was doing this on behalf of her children and that it's never too late to learn new skills.\n\ngarcia-navarro: juan guaido is meeting with vice president pence tomorrow in colombia. guaido is calling, as i said, for action, suggesting he might want military intervention. what do we know?\n\notis: well, yes. tomorrow, guaido is scheduled to meet with u.s. vice president mike pence and other latin american leaders to try to figure out, you know, what's the best way to go forward. like trump, juan guaido says, you know, we're now - we're not ruling out any options which kind of suggests that he would like some kind of an intervention. but while much of the international community has turned against maduro and, you know, tries - is trying to help move in humanitarian aid, there's very little enthusiasm for military intervention in venezuela.\n\ngarcia-navarro: all right. that's john otis in colombia. and now we are going to go to npr's eyder peralta in caracas, the venezuelan capital.\n\neyder, what are you hearing there this morning about the meeting between the vice president and guaido?\n\neyder peralta, byline: well, you know, there was broad hope here that there would be some kind of swift resolution after yesterday - that guaido would call for some sort of international action. but that didn't happen because guaido seems to have put on the brakes a little bit, wanting more diplomacy. so i've heard a lot of disillusionment. but the government - it's worth noting - is jubilant. they believe they won this battle - that the coup, as they were calling this operation, has failed.\n\ngarcia-navarro: you've been talking to people there. what have they been telling you?\n\nperalta: yeah. i mean, yesterday was a really interesting day here in caracas because it was a huge planned confrontation. tens of thousands of venezuelans marched to la carlota, which is an airbase in the middle of the city. and they were at the fence staring at the soldiers. and there, i met sofia torres (ph). she's 19, and she was just holding a poster at the fence - trying to get any of the soldiers to talk to them. i asked her if she ever expected to have been out here, to be here confronting soldiers. and let's listen to what she told me.\n\nsofia torres: (speaking spanish).\n\nperalta: she was crying because she had given up on venezuela. she had decided to leave in december. and guaido declared himself president, and that gave her hope that things would change. and when i spoke to her, she was 100 percent sure that they could make reasoned arguments and that the military would side with the opposition.\n\ngarcia-navarro: but that didn't happen.\n\nperalta: no, not in caracas. here they came out in ski masks as the crowd started thinning. and they started taking pictures and eventually started giving people the middle finger. and at one point, collectivo, which is a paramilitary group here in venezuela, they zoomed past on motorcycles, and everyone started running. one protester, mayling keisling (ph) started asking the other protesters - how does this end? when does it end? let's listen to her.\n\nmayling keisling: (speaking spanish).\n\nperalta: so she says tens of thousands of venezuelans didn't manage to change a single mind at that airfield. so what are they supposed to do? she asked. she felt alone and at a loss as to what comes next.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and i guess that is the big question. what does come next? how does this end? is there a sense of that?\n\nperalta: we don't know anything for sure. but, you know, they're meeting. the leaders from the americas are meeting. and there is a sense that guaido will begin a process to ask for international help.\n\ngarcia-navarro: npr's eyder peralta in caracas, john otis from cucuta in colombia - thank you both so very much.\n\nperalta: gracias, lulu.\n\notis: thank you very much.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
black holes: where reality beats fiction\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption l. calçada/eso l. calçada/eso\n\nlast week, the pbs series nova presented an episode on black holes, these most mysterious and mind-boggling physical objects.\n\nhosted by astrophysicist janna levin from barnard college in new york, the episode was truly fantastic. very clear science and stunning graphics. levin was gracious and fun, the kind of benevolent teacher you want for your kids. the text was tight, with the narration closely following the quotes from the many invited guests. and the science, of course, was nothing short of amazing. as levin said, black holes are places where reality beats fiction. hands down.\n\ngo into an elementary school classroom and mention black holes. eyes will light up, a mix of awe and fear. to a child, the image of a hole in space that swallows everything that comes near is pretty awesome. a place to send off your worse enemies, i joke when i'm lecturing them.\n\nthat gravity alone can do that, create a chunk of space that is so curved that it closes up upon itself, clearly makes it the weirdest of the four forces we know. we all know that gravity is what makes things fall down. it never rests. the other day, my 6-year-old asked me if in space gravity is zero. before i could open my mouth to answer, my 11-year-old jumped in: of course not! there is always some gravity, unless you move infinitely far away from an object, which is impossible.\n\nright on.\n\neverything is connected, everything attracts everything else. unless — unless you are free-falling. when you fall, you don't feel your own weight and things work as if gravity didn't exist for you. this is a strange idea, but if you recall what happens when a fast elevator descends (you feel lighter the faster the elevator goes down; that is, gravity seems weaker to you), you know it makes sense.\n\nalbert einstein figured this out sometime between 1905 and 1910, when he was trying hard to expand his theory of relativity to objects that could accelerate. his original theory, the special, only considered objects moving at constant speeds. when einstein saw the link between gravity and acceleration, he was stunned. but it makes sense. if you go up an elevator, you feel heavier the faster the elevator goes up. gravity and acceleration are deeply linked. (my co-blogger adam frank explored gravity and elevators here some time ago.)\n\neinstein's general theory of relativity became a new theory of gravity, superseding issac newton's. not that newton's theory was wrong, far from it. we use it all the time, including when we send rockets to outer space. but einstein's works better in strong gravity. in science, works better means gives better results, closer to observations. and it does so by making an amazing conceptual leap: that gravity can be interpreted as the curvature of space around an object; the more massive the object, the more curved the space around it. so, close to a star, space is more curved than close to you. also, it's not just space; time is affected, too, ticking slower the stronger gravity is.\n\nquiz question: if you could put a clock on the surface of the sun, would it tick faster or slower than on the surface of the earth?\n\nif you answered slower, you are correct!\n\nin black holes, this effect becomes extreme. someone safely on the outside, watching a clock fall into the hole would see the time pass slower and slower and slower. how is that possible?\n\nstars are kind of like living creatures in that they also have a life cycle: they are born (in regions we call stellar nurseries, huge gas clouds in outer space), live dramatically, fusing hydrogen into helium for a long time until they die, when they run out of hydrogen. without the energy released from nuclear fusion to balance the imploding pressure from gravity, the star collapses onto itself, releasing a huge amount of energy in the process. large stars, at least eight times more massive than the sun, become supernovas. their core, what's left over after the explosion, is what could become a black hole.\n\nthere are two possibilities: roughly, stars with masses between eight and 20 times that of the sun become what's called a neutron star, a star made of neutrons, the particles that share the atomic nucleus with protons. why? well, in the frenzy of collapse, as gravity becomes tighter and tighter, protons and electrons get so squeezed together that they essentially fuse into neutrons. (the fancy name of this process is inverse beta decay.) these neutrons can get squeezed a lot and still resist gravity's pressure: a typical neutron star can have the mass of the sun and the size of a mountain!\n\nbut if the stellar core is too heavy, neutrons can't stop gravity. the neutrons in the core will keep getting squeezed, and gravity will keep getting stronger. with no brakes, the process just keeps going on until gravity is so strong that not even light can escape from its neighborhood, and a black hole is born.\n\nblack holes come in different sizes, a point well-explained in the nova episode. even tiny ones could, at least in principle, be created on earth, in particle accelerators such as the large hadron collider in geneva, where the higgs boson particle was discovered in 2012. but don't worry, these tiny guys are harmless, evaporating away in a fraction of a second; they won't grow to swallow earth.\n\nthe big ones are the ones that wreak havoc in the cosmos. we now know they exist, something that einstein was not pleased about. to him, an object that, at its very center, had a singularity, a point in space where gravity becomes infinitely strong and the laws of nature break down, was just unacceptable.\n\nsorry einstein, but black holes are here to stay. we now know that at the heart of pretty much every galaxy, there is a giant black hole. in our own, the milky way, there is a 4 million-solar-mass behemoth, capable of swallowing stars whole. at andromeda, our neighbor galaxy, the giant black hole at the center has an estimated 100 million solar masses.\n\nwe have also seen the gravitational waves generated when black holes collide with one another, a discovery celebrated with the nobel prize last year.\n\nwhat remains a complete mystery is what is inside them. once we cross the point of no return (also known as the horizon), things change in a curious way. in our reality, we are free to move in space, but time only goes forward. we can control where we go, but not how time goes. once inside a black hole, this role is somewhat reversed. now, there is only one place to go, the center of the hole, a one-way track to oblivion. however, as we dive into the center of the hole, we may see all of time at once, as in jorge luis borges' magnificent short story the aleph. it is also quite possible that there is no real singularity at the center, but something else. some theories speculate that a black hole is really a kind of tunnel to another spot in the universe (known as an einstein-rosen bridge, think a subway tunnel) or even to another universe. we don't know.\n\nanother possibility is that some new kind of physics goes into play when gravity becomes too intense, and the concept of a singularity is just a temporary bandage until we figure things out.\n\nin any case, we still have a lot to learn about gravity. it's ironic that this most familiar of forces is also the most mysterious to us. it brings to mind one of my favorite einstein's quotes, one that we would do well to remember:\n\nwhat i see in nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility.\n\nmarcelo gleiser is a theoretical physicist and writer — and a professor of natural philosophy, physics and astronomy at dartmouth college. he is the director of the institute for cross-disciplinary engagement at dartmouth, co-founder of 13.7 and an active promoter of science to the general public. his latest book is the simple beauty of the unexpected: a natural philosopher's quest for trout and the meaning of everything. you can keep up with marcelo on facebook and twitter: @mgleiser
transcript: npr's interview with chinese ambassador cui tiankai about the coronavirus\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption kisha ravi/npr kisha ravi/npr\n\nnpr's steve inskeep talked to cui tiankai, china's ambassador to the u.s. they spoke as china faces one of the largest crises of its history; the coronavirus is a public health problem but it's also economic and political. the full interview is below.\n\nwe have an editor who closely follows china, who regards this as china's worst crisis in years, because it is a health crisis, but also an economic crisis and a political crisis. how severe is this, in your view, compared to other crises that china has faced in recent years?\n\nwell, this is a very big challenge to us. and i think in a sense, this is very big challenge to the entire international community as we develop, as our economy grows, how we take care of public health needs. how do we respond to epidemics like this? so this is a challenge for the entire international community [and] for any government. and we are, somebody is saying...\n\n[at this point in the interview, there was a brief technical difficulty that was quickly fixed.]\n\n...the challenge and the response is also unprecedented. i think this is quite true. i know we are doing our utmost to contain, control the virus, and provide treatment to the people, and reduce its impact on economic and social activities, and we're still doing whatever we can do right now.\n\nasia china's coronavirus spreads health, economic and political problems china's coronavirus spreads health, economic and political problems listen · 8:55 8:55\n\nhas this become a test of the effectiveness of china's governing system?\n\nwell, as i said, this could be a big challenge to any government, to any governing system.\n\nbut it's your government that is facing the test.\n\nactually, you see, yeah, we are at the forefront. we are at the forefront. actually long before this outbreak, we already set a goal for ourselves, which is the modernization of our governance system and governance capacity. we believe this should be the overall goal for our reform process, and this epidemic has proved that we have set the right goal. so we have to do our best to reach that goal. but this is an ongoing process. you see, there will always be new challenges and we always have to make new progress. we should never stop. i'm sure we will learn more from this outbreak and do a better job.\n\nset the right goal, you said. and then there is the question of what went wrong that you would like to correct. i know the two top officials in hubei province, the center of this outbreak, have been relieved of their duties. what went wrong?\n\nfirst of all, this is a new virus. actually, nobody knew it very well at the beginning. so there was a process for people to get to know more about it, to identify the virus, to know its qualities, the transmission routes. all this has taken some time. and for everybody, i think, that there's some kind of a learning process.\n\noh, i understand. and health officials will say that that china's response has not necessarily been that slow, but something went wrong because two officials were removed. what went wrong?\n\nwell, everything we are doing now, including all these personnel changes, have one goal, to respond to the call of the people and meet the needs of the people. this is the only goal for everything we are doing now. so naturally, under such special circumstances, people who are, people who can do the job better should be given the responsibility to do it. and this is a very heavy responsibility\n\nis part of it that there was so much economic damage and also so much public unrest that you needed, your government needed to show that it was responding to public unhappiness?\n\ni think it's only natural that some people would be panicking under the circumstances. so we always have as one of our basic principles, openness and transparency. we believe openness and transparency will give people more confidence, will give them more awareness about this virus. what is the real, what are the real risks and how to prevent them? and we are providing, you see all the figures, the numbers on daily basis just to make people reassured that we are doing our most to confront it. and this will certainly help us to dispel any fake news, rumors or what people call pseudoscience.\n\nreassigning the officials, that was part of the reassurance?\n\nas i said, we are doing everything possible to meet the needs of the people. so anybody who can do their job better should be given the opportunity to do it.\n\nbecause you mentioned openness and transparency, i need to ask about dr. li wenliang who, as you know very well was a doctor who sounded the alarm late last year about the coronavirus, was detained by the authorities and made to retract what he had said. this got even more attention after he himself died of the virus. why was he detained and made to retract his statements?\n\nno, first of all, he was not detained. i think somebody talked to him, but he wasn't, he was not detained. otherwise, he could not be working in the hospital.\n\nhe was questioned, right? you're saying he was questioned, not detained. is that correct?\n\nyou see, he was a doctor. he was a good doctor. we really, all of us feel really sad for his death. but he was a devoted doctor. he was a good professional. and he saw some coming danger from the specific cases he dealt with. as a doctor, he was alerted, but not everybody quite understood and appreciated him at the very beginning because this is a new virus. nobody knew anything about it.\n\nyou're saying that's why he was made to retract what he had said, because people didn't understand what he was revealing?\n\nyou see, as a doctor, he could find things from specific cases. but for the government to make an alert, any announcement, they need more evidence. they have to base themselves on scientific analysis. so all this would take some time. but now, of course, with the benefit of hindsight, everybody knew that dr. li was right. and he continued to work in the hospital. and it was very tragic for us that he, in his work, he lost his life. but i think he was one of the good doctors. there are tens of thousands of them still working as a front line, still risk their own lives to save other people.\n\ndoes the government owe his family an apology for having made him reverse what he revealed at the beginning?\n\ni think that the city government made some announcement at his passing away. they expressed their condolences and there was such an expression of condolences, support to the family all over china.\n\nit seems from the amount of social media criticism that appeared in china on weiboand other other sites after his death, that people saw the specific story of dr. li as a symptom of a problem with china's system, of a lack of openness, of a lack of transparency. does this story reveal a problem with openness and transparency in china?\n\nactually, i think dr. li is also part of the chinese system. he's not alone. as i said, there are tens of thousands, even millions of health care workers, community workers still working on the very front line. dr. li was just one of them. maybe he was an outstanding doctor, but he is part of the system. maybe people are not aware, he was a member of the communist party.\n\nso you would like the party to have credit for what he called out? uh, i can respect that. but does it suggest that there --\n\ni think he, he is a good member of the party.\n\ndoes this suggest, though, that that the government that he served under was less open to a warning than it should have been?\n\nyou see, we believe in openness, but openness does not mean that you could say anything under any circumstances. the government has to respond in a responsible way. whatever action the government is taking, whatever announcement it is making, alert it is issuing, you have to base yourself on sufficient evidence and science.\n\none of the social media statements that was made in recent days after dr. li's death, in this moment of unusual criticism of china from within china, was a response to an official in hubei province, acknowledging they don't really know the scale of the problem, they don't truly know how many people have been infected with coronavirus. and someone wrote on social media. it's been over a month and finally, a truthful sentence. that suggests that the government has lost some credibility with the people. do you think that's true?\n\ni'm not in a position to explain everything on social media, and i don't think i should do that. people have that freedom to express their views. but i'm not responsible for their views.\n\ni understand. but can you answer that question? do you think that your government has lost some credibility with its people?\n\nwhen you talk about government there are different levels of government in china, like in the united states. you have the central government, you have provincial government, you have city government, you have village people. so you cannot talk in very general terms the government. sometimes government at a particular level makes some mistakes. this is possible. this is, i think it is all natural all over the world. but you cannot say the whole government in china is making a mistake. this is not true.\n\nin this instance, are you suggesting that local officials may have made mistakes, but that national officials did something different when they...\n\ni think officials all over the world could make mistakes, including here in the united states.\n\nwhat role is president xi playing? now that this --\n\nthe leading role. he's taken such a strong leadership.\n\nin what way?\n\nwell, he set up a central government mechanism to fight this virus and he had made tour in beijing, visited two communities, encouraged people, [and] gave people good hope. without his strong leadership, the nationwide effort would not be that strong. and he also talked with foreign leaders, many of them, including president trump on the phone. they had a very good conversation on the phone last week.\n\nis china prepared to welcome american health experts into china to help with this?\n\nof course we will welcome them. we welcome experts of all countries to come to help us. but you see, first of all, the world health organization is sponsoring such expert group.\n\nright.\n\nthey have already sent an advance team to china. they are working in china. secondly, people have to understand right now, people in china are so preoccupied with their work to combat this virus. so we have to have some ordered manner to have experts from other countries. and also there's a real risk that they might be exposed to the virus. we'll have to take good protection of them.\n\nwill american experts from the centers for disease control specifically be let into the country?\n\nthey i think that they have recommended a list of names to the who and this is all under the consideration of our communication with the who\n\nbut not yet, then.\n\ni don't know the latest progress, but the who is doing a good work in this regard. they have an advanced team already in china making all the necessary arrangements and actually some american experts, a professor from columbia university, i think professor lipkin, has already visited china and he's now back in new york. he has been working with a chinese counterpart for many years, ever since sars.\n\nsars, the sars epidemic of some years ago. ok. when americans look at china's effort to face this crisis, it is natural, i think, for some to compare the u.s. system to china's system and ask how things would be different if the crisis were here. americans might say it is impressive that china can shut down an entire city to try to stop the spread of a virus that would not very likely happen in the united states. but they will also argue that the american system is more open and would be a little more free about sharing information and trying to get reliable information to the public. that is the way that an american might look at strengths and weaknesses of china's system compared to the united states. how would you make that comparison?\n\nwell, as a diplomat, normally i don't compare the government of china, and the government of the united states, but you can have your own views because you also have had things like disasters, emergencies here, like the hurricane katrina some years ago. and you did not shut down the city, but there was total disorder in the city. i visited louisiana. people told me all kinds of stories. so we're shutting down some of the cities, especially wuhan to stop the transmission of the virus, to protect more people. we are doing all this of course, at high cost. but we are doing this in the larger interest of the entire world. if we fail to stop the virus, it could spread to other countries. then this will cause international crisis. so this is, i believe, a real example of one for all, all for one situation. we are doing this for the world, and we appreciate that the world is helping us.\n\nyou mentioned the high cost. there is a high economic cost, among other things...\n\nof course.\n\n... for china to shutting down major cities. is there a point at which china's government might have to decide the cost is too high, that this is a disease, it's endemic, some people will die, but you need to reopen cities and resume economic activity?\n\nfirst of all, people's well-being, their health, their safety, their lives, are the most important thing for us. so we'll do our best to protect people's well-being in a sense at whatever cost. at the same time, people also need economic development. they have to have the economy grow and more normal social life. so we are also trying our best to restore normal economic and social activity.\n\nhow soon might that happen?\n\nit would depend on how soon we can control the virus.\n\nso you're going to continue this effort until the virus is controlled. there is not a point at which you would say this is just too costly we need to go on about.\n\ni think we are working on two fronts. on the one front, we are doing our utmost and this is a nationwide effort to fight the virus. at the same time, we are doing whatever we can, to the extent that we can, to maintain some normal economic and social life. for instance, people's daily necessities have to be provided and some of the companies, factories have to resume their work after the lunar new year holidays. and we are looking at when and how schools could be reopened.\n\nshortly before we spoke, chinese authorities dramatically increased their reported number of coronavirus cases, which was an adjustment because of the way that the counting is done, not necessarily an increase in the number of cases, but that leads to a question. are you confident that you now know a reliable number of how many cases there are and have an idea of the full scope of the problem?\n\ni think it's extremely important to have reliable numbers. that's why we're updating the numbers every day. and as you said, there was a dramatic increase because of the change of the diagnosis criteria, and this is absolutely necessary. to use the words of some expert that this is an attempt to widen the net. so everybody who needs, who requires medical treatment will be included, would be covered. that will help us to get to the bottom.\n\ndo you now have the bottom? do you. do you feel you have — you feel confident that you have the [crosstalk]\n\ni don't know. i think this is a question for the specialists to answer, but i certainly hope that it will get to the bottom very soon.\n\ndo you think that you might have this crisis in hand in a matter of days, weeks, months? how long might it take?\n\nfor me, the sooner the better. but it would depend on our efforts, whether we are working in the right direction, whether the methods, the tools we are using are effective, but we are doing our utmost. i have confidence in our scientists, in our doctors and the medical workers.\n\nhave the broader strains in u.s.-china relations made it more difficult for the two countries to cooperate on this issue?\n\ni think clearly there is a need for the two countries to cooperate because this is a challenge to the entire international community. so in the phone call between president trump and president xi, they agreed that our two countries should really work closely together to combat this virus. and we appreciate very much the support assistance given to us by american people, american business, american nongovernmental institution and many others.\n\nyou think that collaboration is the same despite the difficulty in relations overall?\n\ni think as far as people-to-people cooperation is concerned, i don't see any difference. people-to-people cooperation is still very effective, very genuine. we are so impressed by the goodwill of the american people. but, but there's a big but. for some politician here in this country, maybe for some people need the media, i'm sorry to say that, because you are also from the media — they are not being so helpful. some are trying to take advantage of other people's suffering. i don't think this is a very good thing.\n\nwhat's an example of what you mean?\n\nwell. you could read the media. then you'll find out.\n\nwilbur ross, the u.s. commerce secretary, made a comment about the coronavirus the other day and he said he didn't want, ... anyway to be happy about the virus. but he said it, quote, gives business another thing to consider when deciding on their supply chains. i understood him to mean businesses have another reason to think about — american businesses — have another reason to think about going somewhere other than china.\n\nafter his remarks, i read a lot of comments from american media, from american economists. they have expressed their views. so i have nothing to add.\n\nwhich views do you mean?\n\nall kinds of views. and as far as i know, many people disagreed.\n\nwith him making that statement?\n\nyeah, of course, yeah.\n\nhe, of course, is talking in a broader sense about the idea of decoupling, about the united states making its economy much less intertwined with china. do you believe that's happening, whether you would like it to or not?\n\ni don't think that that should happen, and i don't think that that could happen. because we are the two largest economies in the world. we are so interconnected, so interdependent. and this interdependence has worked in the interests of both countries. both economies, both peoples have benefited a great deal from such growing economic ties. why should anybody try to cut it off, to have this so-called decoupling?\n\ndoes this mean that the trump administration's efforts to, for example, push back against huawei or other chinese companies or get american companies to turn to vietnam, that those efforts ultimately are not going to succeed, in your view?\n\nwell, the good news is we have concluded this phase one trade agreement. this is evidence that there's intention on both sides to solve our economic problem and maintain and develop our economic relations. there is a good attempt on both sides. at the same time, i think people have to follow the economic and technological logic. they cannot do anything against this logic. for american business, for american companies, they have to weigh the pros and cons, they have to aim at the most efficient allocation of resources and of their production. they have to follow the law of economics, not any wish of any politician.\n\ni'm thinking of the u.k.'s recent decision to use huawei 5g equipment and portions of its network despite american requests not to do that. is that an example of following economic logic as you see it?\n\nwell, i don't want to make any comment on people of other countries. but i think maybe, maybe you should learn something from the united kingdom. on some of the issues, i think that they made smarter decisions. for instance, they joined the asian infrastructure investment bank very early and now they're benefiting from it. they also took their own decision on 5g technology, on huawei. i think that they are smart people, they are smart people.\n\nbecause you mentioned the trade agreement, i'd like to ask about the general direction of u.s.-china relations. i think that we could have thought of them in the last couple of years as on the way down. after that trade agreement, are they on the way up or would you point in some other direction?\n\nithink, the phase one trade agreement is part of the achievement efforts by both sides to develop a stronger and more stable relationship between china and united states. and i certainly hope that this agreement will be implemented effectively and it will be a big plus for the overall relations. of course, we have other problems to solve, other issues to address — political security and others. but the, what we have learned from the trade negotiation could also be useful for other areas. i don't think the phase one trade agreement would be possible without the principle of mutual respect and equality. the two sides made genuine efforts to understand the other side, to respect the other side's legitimate needs and concerns and try to address the issues with a balanced approach and with a good sense of equality. if these principles could be applied in our efforts to address other issues in other areas, we could be equally successful.\n\njust one other thing to ask about, ambassador. i'm sure that you follow the president's impeachment and acquittal here in the united states. and there was a part of this that touched on china. the president was criticized for seeking investigation of a political rival, joe biden, in ukraine. when he was criticized for this, he said that was correct, that he sought that investigation and urged china also to investigate joe biden or his son, hunter biden, for investments that he was involved in in china.what did your government make of that remark?\n\nwe'd never get ourselves involved in american domestic politics, and we would never do that.\n\ndoes that mean when the president of the united states says china should investigate joe biden, china is not going to take that advice one way or the other?\n\ni don't think that this is included in any official communication between the two governments.\n\nah, so if the u.s. through official channels made a request china would give that some thought — otherwise it's not anything for you to address.\n\ni understand the whole process is part of the domestic political drama being played out here, so we are just observers.\n\nand forgive me, i know our time is about up, but i know you've been an observer of the united states for a very long time. and so now sitting with you, i have to ask what you've thought about as you've watched this drama of american politics the last few months.\n\nyou see our two countries, china and the united states, we are big countries, major powers in the world and we are the two largest economies. so i think we do have some similarities. as big countries, you have great responsibilities and very often we set great goals for ourselves. this is only natural for any major power. and then we also have our roots in different civilizations. but we both could run into some problems, big challenges from time to time. you have your own problems and challenges, we have our problems and challenges. i always believe whether china or united states can really grow stronger and have a better future very much that depends on our domestic governance. now, you may have problems to solve — to enhance your domestic governance. we have our own challenges to meet, to modernize our governance system and capacity. so if each of us can do a good job at home you always have a good future. so we are watching, of course, we wish american people good luck and a better future.\n\nambassador, it's always a pleasure talking with you. thank you very much.\n\nmy pleasure, thank you.
how latino players are helping major league baseball learn spanish\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nam y. huh/ap nam y. huh/ap\n\nwith the start of baseball season in sight, millions of latino fans in the u.s., the caribbean, and latin america will be rooting for their favorite players, many of whom are transplants from places like venezuela, dominican republic, and cuba. but spanish-speaking fans, millions of whom watch spanish-language broadcasts of baseball games, will have little idea of the lingering challenge some latino players in the states have long faced: inadequate language support from the minor and majorleagues.\n\nmuch of the issues surround the inability of the latino players to meaningfully communicate with the press. this can be the result of simply not speaking each other's language, a barrier in how cultural norms affect the use of language, or from poor reporting on latino players.\n\none such incident of lackluster coverage happened last year when brian t. smith from the houston chronicle wrote an article on the struggling performance of carlos gómez during his season with the houston astros. gómez, born in the dominican republic, speaks english, but not with native proficiency. when smith quoted gómez as saying, for the last year and this year, i not really do much for this team. the fans be angry. they be disappointed, the mangled language sparked a backlash about how the media can sometimes cover players in a way that demeans their intelligence or leaves them embarrassed.\n\nadrian burgos jr., a professor at the university of illinois who specializes in latino and sports history, says there is a history of english-language media being insensitive in the coverage latino players have received in the past. the practice of poking fun at the accents that latino players used has been a traditional exercise of the english-language press, burgos said. he says they tend to highlight the accents and fail to adequately convey the ideas that latino players are trying to express.\n\nwhen the backlash against gómez quotes began, freelance writer britni de la cretaz wrote an article pointing to the lack of diversity in newsrooms as contributing to the lack of sensitivity from both smith and the editors who did not address the grammatically-poor quotes before publishing the article. de la cretaz pointed to the 2014 associated press sports editors racial and gender report card which concluded that more than 91 percent of sports editors and 85 percent of reporters are white.\n\nfor me, what's important is talking to journalists in the community and trying to make sure that i am respectfully representing people, de la cretaz, who does not speak spanish, said about covering these players. i think the responsibility there lies with newsrooms and that's kind of part of the problem, too, she said. since i'm a white writer, who is writing and my editor is a white editor there's a huge blind spot there.\n\naccording to the 2014 ap report, there has been an increase in people of color in sports newsrooms, but most of the progress can be attributed to the diversity found at espn. for instance, if the male columnists of color employed by espn were removed from the total number of sports staffers at the over 100 newspapers and websites ap reviewed, the percentage of columnists of color would drop from more than 17 percent to three percent.\n\nsignificantly, espn has dedicated major resources to its spanish-language viewers and, by extension, to the coverage it gives spanish-speaking athletes in general.\n\nfreddy rolón, vice president and general manager at espn deportes, oversees the network's business and television's more than 4,500 live hours of spanish-language content every year. when we look at the marketplace for the hispanic audience, we see actually growth in both the english side and the spanish-language side. and we're seeing a big growth in the overlap as well with the bilingual audience, he said.\n\nrolón points out that while the bilingual market is growing, latinos tend to gravitate towards the spanish espn deportes network for sports like fútbol, soccer, and english espn for american football despite the complex overlap in the bilingual audience. that, rolón says, is the result of each english or spanish side of the network having cultivated more expertise through a longer history of covering the two different sports.\n\nbut covering baseball is complicated, in large part because of its astronomical popularity in and equally important fan bases in the u.s. and latin america. when you speak about baseball, it speaks to latinos on both sides of their being, rolón said. there's a question of identity and how that is mixed between your country of origin and the country that you are part of and you live in. that is very much a fabric of baseball.\n\nrolón says when espn deportes launched in 2004, they found a huge void at the intersection of spanish and baseball that was not being filled. this gap in spanish coverage led espn to realize there was an opportunity to get that coverage from the reporters to bleed into the english programming. by getting more candid conversations with the players, by letting them open up a little bit more because we're talking to them in their native languages, we got better stories and we were better at serving fans because we could tell them things they might not have heard if they were just looking at it from an english-language lens, rolón said.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption michael zagaris/getty images michael zagaris/getty images\n\nespn's pedro gomez, a bilingual journalist who has covered baseball for more than 20 years, says covering the players in two languages has improved the reporting and how the players express themselves. i remember when i started back in the late '80s, early '90s, i can't think of another bilingual reporter that existed on the baseball beat, gomez said. and now you walk into a club house and there are more and more bilingual reporters covering major league baseball. while there are more bilingual reporters, gomez says he would not go as far as agreeing that spanish-speaking players are not comfortable enough to approach the press more readily today than in the past.\n\nfor the 2016 season, mlb mandated that all teams provide interpreters for players with limited or no english proficiency. foreign-born latinos made up a quarter of the players on opening day of the 2016 season and come from countries where english proficiency may be limited and spanish is the primary language. gomez believes interpreters are a step in the right direction. players used to have to grab a coach, a teammate who spoke both languages and kind of use them as a translator and of course these people weren't trained as professional translators, gomez said.\n\npaul mifsud, an mlb vice president and deputy general counsel, says the interpreters the teams are required to hire, which are subsidized by the league and included in negotiations with the players union, will be in place for the next five years. there was initial skepticism about the value of it, but at this point all teams, i think, have really bitten into it and find it extremely useful, mifsud said. it's really started to improve the communication dynamic in the clubhouse and the ability of the players who may have felt uncomfortable talking to the media.\n\nozzie guillén, former white sox shortstop and manager, said there has been improvement but there is much still needed to help latinos when it comes to language. baseball [has] improved a lot, but it's hard right now to speak the language because you don't need to, guillén said. some players think, 'if i produce, i don't need to speak english and they have to figure [it] out to understand what i'm saying.'\n\nguillén also joked that when you're good you don't need to learn english, but if you're not you had better learn english. however, he did say it was important that players learn english. but he added that a language barrier is accompanied by a cultural barrier in how that language is used: what is being said and how it is interpreted by the public. guillén says that gap in cultural translation landed him in trouble because what is appropriate in spanish and his culture might not be perceived the same way in the u.s.\n\nin one instance guillén received backlash while managing the white sox for saying it was unfair for asian players to be given interpreters while latinos were left without them. in 2010, usa today reported him as saying:\n\nvery bad. i say, why do we have japanese interpreters and we don't have a spanish one. i always say that. why do they have that privilege and we don't? guillen said sunday before chicago played the oakland athletics. don't take this wrong, but they take advantage of us. we bring a japanese player and they are very good and they bring all these privileges to them. we bring a dominican kid ... go to the minor leagues, good luck. good luck. and it's always going to be like that. it's never going to change. but that's the way it is.\n\nthere was a divide in the media over what guillén said and how it was interpreted, leading to friction between him and the mlb.\n\nwhile there were some interpreters before the 2016 requirement was put in place, they were not mandated by mlb and were hired at the discretion of the teams. with just a handful of asian players in the league and on different teams around the country, coaching staff and fellow players were not readily available to translate.\n\nthis generalized lost in translation effect is being addressed by mlb with acculturation and language lessons to latino players while in minor league teams. players who are going to be successful major leaguers for many years, there's obvious advantages to having those players be bilingual and not just speak spanish, mifsud said.\n\nguillén agrees that there are missed opportunities for latino players to take up leadership roles because they cannot be outspoken about what they feel and think. that, he says, is a reason some great latino players never become managers or join a team's leadership ranks. guillén says learning english and acclimating to u.s. culture is most important for young players in the minors who have less money and support, both on and off the field. during the 2016 minor league baseball season, latinos accounted for more than 41 percent of the players.\n\nwhile long overdue, mlb's plan to improve language services and cultural acclimation, and the press's continued efforts to more accurately cover spanish-speaking players should result in players feeling more at ease with the press and their fans, and fans gaining more access to and insights into their favorites.\n\njorge encinas is a freelance journalist based in

unpacking what the american israel public affairs committee does\n\nwhen rep. ilhan omar, d-minn., criticized the american israel public affairs committee with anti-semitic stereotypes, she also may have inflated aipac's clout.\n\nmary louise kelly, host:\n\nwhen democratic congresswoman ilhan omar tweeted a few days ago about the american israel public affairs committee, or aipac, she repeated what are viewed as anti-semitic characterizations of the powerful lobbying group - that the group's money drives u.s. policy towards israel. but as npr's peter overby reports, as with all money in politics, it's a complicated picture.\n\npeter overby, byline: omar tweeted that it's, quote, all about the benjamins. and by that, she meant aipac. the pac in aipac, though, doesn't stand for political action committee. it's public affairs committee. josh block is head of the israel project and is a former aipac staffer.\n\njosh block: it's a lobby that represents americans who support the u.s.-israel alliance. it itself, as an organization, does not make endorsements. it doesn't contribute to campaigns. it doesn't contribute to candidates - none of those things. in fact, it doesn't even have a pac.\n\noverby: aipac has more than 100,000 members and the biggest lobbying budget among pro-israel groups - $3 1/2 million last year. among its activities, it regularly flies lawmakers to israel. members of aipac definitely make political contributions, block said, but aipac wants to focus on something more than that.\n\nblock: that's the thing about what it is that makes aipac so special, which is it's the relationships that exist - real ones between actual constituents, jews and non-jews and members of congress who understand the value of the u.s.-israel alliance.\n\noverby: aipac has always strongly backed the israeli government, but things have changed. these days, there are more liberal jewish groups, most notably j street, which takes a more critical view of israel's foreign policy. ben shnider is senior adviser to j street pac.\n\nben shnider: the perception has long been that - the consensus was that members of congress and that elected leaders should take a hard right, israel-is-always-right approach to these issues.\n\noverby: but then came the rift over the status of palestine.\n\nshnider: if you poll the jewish community, which j street has done every election night since our founding, you'll see that, in fact, a majority of american jews support pushing for a palestinian state alongside a secure israel.\n\noverby: and yet, another change - the role of political money. aipac has a small constellation of political action committees around it, but data from the center for responsive politics showed that the pro-israel groups have relatively small budgets in this era of super pacs and dark money. so while billionaire sheldon adelson, a strong backer of the israeli government, spent more than $100 million of his own money in the midterm elections, just two pro-israel groups listed by the center broke the $1 million mark. peter overby, npr news, washington.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
under apartheid, trevor noah's mom taught him to face injustice with humor\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption getty images getty images\n\ngrowing up in south africa with a white father and a black mother, trevor noah confronted prejudices on both sides. he tells fresh air's terry gross that both white people and black people would express fear and biases to him. then, he says, i'd have to explain to them, 'hey, you can't think like that. you can't hold these views, because you're generalizing everybody.' \n\nhis experience growing up enables him to see both sides of an issue — which helps when it comes to creating political satire on the daily show. i've understood multiple experiences simultaneously, he says. that's something i've always done and i continue to do till this day: i try and see the perspective of the other side.\n\ni can't trick myself into getting stressed by first world problems. things are going great. things are going very, very well.\n\nhe adds that while the pressure of creating a daily television show can be intense, those pressures pale in comparison with those he knew growing up in soweto during apartheid.\n\nwhen i think back. ... not 25 years ago, i was living in basically a very elevated hut with no running water or indoor sanitation. i can't trick myself into getting stressed by first world problems, he says. things are going great. things are going very, very well.\n\ninterview highlights\n\non his mother being jailed on and off for having a relationship with noah's father, who is white\n\nmy mom opposed the system as a whole, so she never let that stand in her way, and i think i have a lot of my mom's demeanor. even when she told me the story she was never angry, she just went, it's a stupid thing, and so i refused to listen to it.\n\nshe never came at it from a place of anger. if anything, she defied it and she didn't give it the credibility that it was trying to create in the world. so that's something that i inherited from my mom — that in my family we're not quick to anger, if anything, obviously there are moments where you find things ridiculous or ludicrous, but not quick to anger, rather find a way to laugh about it or to minimize it using humor. ...\n\nas much as there were the people on the forefront fighting, really every movement is also underwritten to a certain extent by the people who undermine the restriction or the laws that restrict people by just refusing to adhere to those laws.\n\non growing up in soweto during apartheid\n\nit was wonderful; it was electric. even today soweto is a beautiful community; everyone knows everybody's names, there's just a sense of togetherness. and i think because everyone was going through the same thing, it was a shared experience. it didn't feel like it was suffering.\n\nyou knew that there was a cloud hanging over a nation, but there were lots of moments of joy within that time period. the streets were dusty, there weren't many tarred streets. the houses were very modest, because the government would allocate land and that's where you could live. so everyone found a way to make ends meet.\n\ni'm very lucky in that i never look back at it as a tough upbringing because it was the only upbringing i knew, and everyone was doing it with me. essentially it's like being in a very stringent fitness class — if everyone is suffering together it doesn't seem so bad.\n\nthere were seven or eight of us at one point living in a one-room house or two-room house at some point. we had outdoor sanitation, every four or five houses would share one toilet outdoors, and then you would have one faucet outdoors that you could go and get your water from.\n\nbut this is how everyone lived, and because everyone was doing it, then it's normal. i'm very lucky in that i never look back at it as a tough upbringing because it was the only upbringing i knew, and everyone was doing it with me. essentially it's like being in a very stringent fitness class — if everyone is suffering together it doesn't seem so bad.\n\non the way his family coped after his former stepfather shot his mother\n\nwhen someone gets shot in the head and suffers no brain damage and is alive and needs to go through no surgery and a bullet completely passes through the head, then you almost have to concede. who was i to say i don't believe in miracles when i've seen this happen in my life?\n\nwe laughed about it, we joked — that's really the hallmark of my family is a few days afterwards in the hospital — my mom was the person who cracked the first joke. i was crying by her bedside and she said to me, don't cry. look on the bright side: now you're officially the best-looking person in the family.\n\nwe've overcome a lot because of laughter. i think that's why i love comedy so much, it's because it's the thing that has kept my family going through every single type of adversity.\n\non being aware of cultural differences in comedy\n\nit's a process of trial and error. you work through the material, you talk to the people. it also helps to live here, which is something i could only do with time. so for instance, in america there's a huge sensitivity around fat. if you say somebody's fat, because there's been a culture of fat-shaming and there's clearly an epidemic, partly because of the food and just because of the lifestyle and so on that this is no longer being seen as a choice thing anymore.\n\nwhereas where i'm from, you would be teased more for being skinny. fat and thin were two sides of the same coin; it was never something that could be held over anyone. ... it's not judged as much, it's just a statement of a fact. ... these are small land mines that you pick up as you go from one place to the next; you go, ok, this is sensitive here but it's not sensitive there.\n\non the criticism he received for a tweet from 2014, in which he retweeted: when a woman is loved correctly she becomes ten times the woman she was before, and then commented: so she gets fat?\n\ni'm not surprised by the response to any comedy taken out of context. comedy is all about context. if you think about the things that you say to your friends or to people you know, if a stranger hears them they would think you're the most horrible human being in the world. when you know someone, that's when it becomes comedy. that's exactly what comedy is: it's a familiarity that is combined with you breaking down a commonly held belief.\n\nso, what was ironic about that tweet that you're reading is that was me and my girlfriend at the time. that's something that no one even bothered to check. you go, who was he messaging? i was speaking to my girlfriend at the time in public, and we were both fat at the time. we had gained a lot of weight, we were both happy, we were both lazy, and so we were joking about it. but people don't bother, they go, you were fat-shaming a stranger on the internet! this is not a stranger, this is somebody that i live with and somebody that i love. ...\n\nwith the change in social media and sharing and videos and so on and sound bites, we now live in a world where people are part of conversations that they originally weren't really, so you're now overhearing everything that everybody's talking about and you're not part of the conversation.\n\non advice he received from msnbc's rachel maddow about dealing with the intensity of daily television\n\nthe quickest thing you have to learn is your best show only lasts for a night and your worst show only lasts for a night, and then you're back doing it tomorrow.
in flood-ravaged davenport, iowa, climate is a prime issue for some voters\n\ndavenport was devastated by 2019 floods in the upper mississippi. how are local business preparing for future floods, and what role does climate change play in their voting?\n\ndavid folkenflik, host:\n\nthe no. 1 issue for democratic voters in this presidential election season is health care. but trailing a close second is climate change. morning edition host rachel martin has been reporting in iowa this past week ahead of the caucuses. and she spent some time in the city of davenport, right along the mississippi river. the city was the site of record-breaking floods last spring. how does the rising river and the threat from climate change affect how people there vote? here's what she found out.\n\nrachel martin, byline: you talk to enough business owners down by davenport's riverfront, and you quickly realize that pretty much everyone has a flood story.\n\nannie stopulous: i get a call from my sister-in-law that said, i got to drop the kids off. i have to go downtown. the levee broke.\n\nandrew lopez: all the water started coming through the drains.\n\nstopulous: and i get down here. and we had 4 1/2 feet in our basement. it was coming up to our doors. and we just started sandbagging.\n\ntim baldwin: and it just caught my eye. and then i went, oh, my god. the river's coming in.\n\nmartin: that last voice is tim baldwin. he owns an upscale pub right on the waterfront. dan bush runs another restaurant a few blocks away. and we met them at lopiez pizza joint. andrew lopez is the owner there.\n\nlopez: the margherita - it's like a really chill pizza. our red sauce, it's got a really nice kick to it. so you really don't need much with it.\n\nmartin: all three of these guys took a financial hit after the flood last year. but they were the lucky ones. some of the businesses around the area had to shut their doors for good.\n\ni mean, here you are sitting couple hundred feet away from the riverbank - the mississippi.\n\ndan bush: yeah. it's right over there.\n\nmartin: so do you just write this off? or do you expect that this is going to keep happening?\n\nbush: i think we're forced to take it seriously.\n\nmartin: that's dan bush. after the disaster, he started a coalition of business owners to advocate for better flood prevention.\n\nbush: you know, the science shows, the statistics shows that this is going to progressively get worse and that we actually didn't - it didn't get as bad as it could have got this year. the last big event was in 1993. i don't expect it to be another 25, 27 odd years before it happens again.\n\nmartin: how does that affect your thoughts about climate change and your political choices, andrew?\n\nlopez: so i think it's a big deal. and it's been getting a little worse and worse every year. so i think it's time to take a step forward and try and do something about it.\n\nmartin: tim.\n\nbaldwin: you know, i love these guys. but we have a - different political views.\n\nmartin: where is the difference?\n\nbaldwin: well, the - climate change, as we hear about it every day through the national media, i don't believe is our problem. i believe climate's changing. and i believe climate's been changing since the inception of this planet, right? all i know is what is obvious to me. and that is when it rains, the water has nowhere to go except to the mississippi river. but is it related to - what? - driving cars and eating beef? i'm not convinced of that.\n\nmartin: dan.\n\nbush: i think this event definitely made me think more about climate than i ever have in my life. but yeah, i think we're at the point where the cause is not the conversation. it's, ok, we - tim and i agree it's happening. now how do we handle it?\n\nmartin: their answers for that question are different, too. it's going to shape dan's political choice this year. he says he'll caucus for elizabeth warren for a lot of reasons, including her plans to fight climate change. tim, on the other hand, is a conservative. his primary issue isn't climate change at all. it's the economy. and he's voting for donald trump. we say our goodbyes...\n\nbye, guys. take it easy.\n\n...then walk back along the river. we take a right near some retail shops and eventually find our way to east 2nd street, where we meet annie stopulous.\n\nstopulous: we've got a lot going on right now. so that's why - it doesn't normally look like this.\n\nmartin: annie runs a trendy men's clothing store just a couple blocks from the river.\n\nstopulous: i mean, the whole community came together. and it was - we were - our knees deep in water, sandbagging all this area to protect, you know, our space.\n\nmartin: how are you preparing for the inevitability of it...\n\nstopulous: yeah.\n\nmartin: ...happening again?\n\nstopulous: since i've lived here, we've only had one really big flood. and it was when i was a young girl. i don't remember it. so historically, the chances are not very high. but when you think of the environment and the effects and global - everything that is included and what's happening, the chances are a lot higher.\n\nmartin: do those issues motivate you politically?\n\nstopulous: absolutely.\n\nmartin: she doesn't want to say who she's going to caucus for monday. but her fiancee, kayla, is all in for elizabeth warren.\n\nstopulous: she's worried about our children and our children's children and what the environment and earth is going to be like at that point.\n\nmartin: do you guys have kids?\n\nstopulous: no, we're - yesterday, i just got my appointment. we're planning on it.\n\nmartin: yay.\n\nstopulous: it's - yeah. it'll - in time. yeah.\n\nmartin: yeah. a year after the flood, annie and kayla are looking to the future, like so many others we talked with here. and after tomorrow's caucuses, they'll have a better idea of what that future might look like. rachel martin, npr news, davenport, iowa.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
springfield, ohio: a shrinking city faces a tough economic future\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maddie mcgarvey for npr maddie mcgarvey for npr\n\nmuch of the anger and anxiety in the 2016 election are fueled by the sense that economic opportunity is slipping away for many americans. this week, as part of npr's collaborative project with member stations, a nation engaged, we're asking the question: what can be done to create economic opportunity for more americans?\n\nthere are plenty of springfields in the u.s. thirty-three, according to one government count. the springfield in ohio is a blue-collar city with a lot of history, pain and pride: a place with an uncertain future.\n\nwhen you look at what makes america great, what makes america not great, our ups and our downs, springfield represents all of that, says kevin rose, a historian with the turner foundation, a local philanthropy.\n\nfor years now, the not so great seems to have the upper hand. springfield is a rather typical small city that has grown poorer over the years, says roger baker, the city's mayor in the '70s and '80s.\n\npoorer — a lot poorer. median incomes fell an astounding 27 percent in springfield between 1999 and 2014, more than any metropolitan area in the country, according to the pew research center.\n\nmike calabrese has seen it closeup. he runs opportunities for individual change, a job skills program in springfield. throughout the '90s we lost in clark county, ohio, 22,000 high-paying blue-collar jobs. we've never recovered from it.\n\njobs have come back to springfield. the unemployment rate is pretty low — around 5 percent.\n\nbut wages have been stuck in a trough. for many in town, a middle-class life is out of reach. and it's hard to see a way out.\n\ntake one of the big employers in springfield — navistar, a truck manufacturer. jason barlow, who represents navistar workers for the united auto workers union, used to work on the assembly line.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maddie mcgarvey for npr maddie mcgarvey for npr\n\nwhen i hired in in 1995, i hired in at $17.65 an hour. ... now an employee hires in at $15.68, he says. and that doesn't account for inflation.\n\nif you haven't graduated from college — and only 15 percent of the city's adults older than 25 have a bachelor's degree — the best jobs in town are still in manufacturing.\n\nbut now they pay less than they once did, and they require more skills.\n\npeople need to have a little bit more to be able to do the things on the shop floor, says ross mcgregor, vice president of pentaflex, which makes parts for heavy trucks. we have processes ... that used to be completely driven by operators loading parts in and out. now we have transfer systems. we have robots.\n\nmcgregor points to a machine moving parts through a stamping operation. this is an automated assembly unit, he says. this is a process that required four operators before. now only one operator needs to run it.\n\nall of the automation and keeping a lid on labor costs allow manufacturers like mcgregor to compete with a low-cost country like vietnam.\n\nbut for workers, it's all part of what's put the squeeze on living standards. that squeeze on blue-collar workers — the march of automation and global competition — isn't just landing on springfield. it's happening throughout the u.s. and the industrialized world.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maddie mcgarvey for npr maddie mcgarvey for npr\n\ngregg mcgillivray has done different jobs at pentaflex, where he has worked for 31 years. now he loads and unloads trucks. he says he has made a good life in springfield. but he can't imagine how it will be the same for young people.\n\ni think it would be very hard to be starting out with a family now like i did 31 years ago, he says. mcgillivray chooses his words carefully, and they're pretty pessimistic. i don't think it's as good as it used to be. i just don't think it's as easy to get by in the world today.\n\nthere's no doubt it's harder to get by in springfield.\n\nwe're in a tough time economically, trying to figure out how the new economy filters down to the majority of the population, says warren copeland, springfield's mayor.\n\nas it transitions away from manufacturing, the city relies more on service jobs, like in call centers or nursing homes. but they don't pay well. so local officials are looking for something — anything — that gives the city an identity, a way to distinguish itself.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maddie mcgarvey for npr maddie mcgarvey for npr\n\none of them, quite modestly, is geography. some trucking distribution companies have come to springfield because it's convenient to two big interstates. and incomes did tick up last year. but that doesn't get springfield closer to the knowledge economy of tech or finance or design.\n\nquite honestly, that's a struggle, copeland says. in ohio, every city like us is in competition with columbus, which is the go-go growth city in ohio. they have the advantage of a large university, major medical facilities, a number of insurance companies. so they really have a lot of the well-paying paperwork jobs that are part of the economy that's performing well.\n\nspringfield's population is older, less educated and whiter than national averages. and that population has fallen over the years — from more than 80,000 in the 1970s to less than 60,000 today. many young people go to college and leave — the brain drain.\n\nto help end the exodus, springfield is banking on a revival of downtown. and on a recent warm weekday evening, a farmers market was in full swing as a good-sized crowd shopped for artisanal cheeses, locally grown produce and baked goods. the mood was friendly and relaxed. exactly the kind of scene tourism and development officials dream about.\n\nhundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in springfield's downtown. and it shows. there's a new hospital, an ice rink, museums, a new brewery and a performing arts center.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maddie mcgarvey for npr maddie mcgarvey for npr\n\nkevin rose, the local historian, says there's a big emphasis on cultural tourism that draws upon the city's history. back in the 19th century, springfield made more farm equipment than anyplace in the world. the wright brothers patented their airplane here. and there's some notable architecture.\n\nso one of the big things we've had recently was the restoration of our frank lloyd wright house, rose says. a lot of our cultural tourism enterprise activities are based through that.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maddie mcgarvey for npr maddie mcgarvey for npr\n\nbut less than a mile from downtown is a neighborhood where no tourist would venture. charles rollins welcomes me to many pathways, an addiction recovery clubhouse he runs with help from his twin brother, michael.\n\ndrug and alcohol abuse hinder the people of this community severely, charles says. the streets here are bleak, with dilapidated and abandoned buildings. guys walk around looking lost or haunted. some of them stop by many pathways for safety, companionship or to attend 12-step meetings.\n\ndefinitely, an increase in young caucasian men turning to heroin, charles says. it's part of the opioid crisis sweeping this part of the country. michael rollins says addiction isn't just battering young people and their families. it harms the local economy, since addicts spend their cash on drugs and can't be relied on for steady work.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maddie mcgarvey for npr maddie mcgarvey for npr\n\nan individual can't function on any level until they satisfy that need for the drug on a daily basis, michael says. the drug crisis, and not just heroin, is hitting springfield just as downtown revives and companies like the truck maker navistar are starting to hire again.\n\nemployers say it's gotten harder to find job applicants who can pass a drug test. and it's not only big, impersonal forces like automation driving people out of the middle class. self-destructive behavior holds people back.\n\nmike calabrese has as much perspective on springfield's challenges as anyone. he has worked for the jobs skills program opportunities for individual change for 39 years. and he says the multiple problems facing the city and young people here can be discouraging. but i get pumped back up when i hear a great story about a kid who got his ged and he's got job skills. he's legitimately working and bringing money into a household, calabrese says.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maddie mcgarvey for npr maddie mcgarvey for npr\n\nblake drummond is one of those great stories. he's 20, and a few years ago he was a high school dropout making $9 an hour in an unskilled factory job.\n\nwe were assembling corvette manifolds. and my only job was to just push two metal rods into the manifold, drummond says. every day, eight hours a day, two breaks and a lunch. but they wouldn't switch us around. every day, i'm putting the two rods in. i kind of felt like a robot, honestly, just standing there doing the same thing. it was bad.\n\nafter getting his ged and taking construction and building classes, drummond now earns $21 an hour. he's supervising a crew renovating a historic building downtown. he enjoys his work and doesn't feel like a robot anymore. i always say i feel like i was a carpenter in my past life because i can just pick up a tool sometimes and immediately know what it's used for, what to do with it and how to use it.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maddie mcgarvey for npr maddie mcgarvey for npr\n\ndrummond says he'd like to say in springfield, and

after pressure, mcconnell makes last-minute changes to impeachment trial procedure\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption julio cortez/ap julio cortez/ap\n\nupdated jan. 21 at 2:26 p.m. et\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell made last-minute, handwritten changes tuesday to the parameters for how president trump's impeachment trial process will play out. departing from a draft resolution he released monday night, the resolution now allows impeachment managers and the president's defense to have 24 hours to make arguments over three session days. the draft had stipulated 24 hours over two days. mcconnell also altered the rules for admitting the house evidence into the record.\n\nthe senate is debating the resolution tuesday. the majority leader made the changes after meeting with his colleagues.\n\nread the resolution here.\n\ndemocrats had slammed mcconnell's draft resolution, which they say will place time limits on arguments and departs heavily from president clinton's impeachment trial of 1999. the mcconnell resolution does have some similarities to the clinton-era resolution, however.\n\na spokesperson for republican sen. susan collins said she and others had raised concerns about the 24 hours of opening statements in two days and the admission of the house transcript in the record. her position has been that the trial should follow the clinton model as much as possible. she thinks these changes are a significant improvement.\n\nmcconnell needs at least 51 of the 53 senate republicans to support his rules if he wants them to pass. any senator can attempt to change the rules by offering an amendment before the vote to approve the measure. those amendments also need 51 votes, meaning all 47 democrats need to recruit four republicans if they hope to change any element of mcconnell's plan.\n\nwe have the votes, once the impeachment trial has begun, to pass a resolution essentially the same, very similar to the 100-to-nothing vote in the clinton trial, which sets up, as you may recall, what could best be described as maybe a phase 1, mcconnell told reporters jan. 7.\n\non the process for amendments tuesday, democrats say they expect to offer several amendments. the rule would allow two hours of debate on each amendment with each side controlling one hour of debate. democrats stress that they are not aiming to delay the trial; the amendments will be targeted at calling for witnesses and potentially changing the rules mcconnell has proposed.\n\nthe trial follows trump's impeachment last month in the house of representatives on charges of obstruction of congress and abuse of power. the white house has laid out a forceful rejection of those charges and called for an acquittal of the president. at issue in the impeachment is whether trump sought political favors from his ukrainian counterpart in exchange for the release of military aid. the white house denies any such link was made.\n\nthe new mcconnell resolution allows the house impeachment managers and president's lawyers to present their opening arguments beginning wednesday at 1 p.m. and gives them 24 hours each over three days to make their case. though the draft resolution only allowed for two days, the change brings the trump impeachment trial more in line with the rules of the clinton impeachment. late monday, the white house announced that eight house republicans would join the president's defense team: reps. doug collins, mike johnson, jim jordan, debbie lesko, mark meadows, john ratcliffe, elise stefanik and lee zeldin.\n\nfollowing those arguments, senators will have 16 hours to ask questions in the chamber, followed by two hours of arguments each by the house impeachment managers and the president's lawyers. this would be followed by deliberation on a question of whether to subpoena witnesses or documents.\n\nit would also allow an option for a motion to dismiss the case outright immediately after the resolution is adopted, a senior republican leadership aide said. it's unlikely, however, that such a motion would have the republican votes needed to pass it.\n\nafter the draft was released monday, democrats had argued that would leave them arguing their case into the middle of the night and into the next morning, pushing the debate to the dead of night, a democratic aide working on the trial said.\n\ndemocrats also objected to the wording of the section pertaining to votes to call new witnesses before the senate. the rule includes a new hurdle before votes on witnesses and documents can occur: a majority of senators would have to agree to the concept of allowing witnesses and documents before they could vote on the individual pieces of evidence.\n\nloading...\n\ndemocrats were irked by other parts of the resolution, too.\n\nsenate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., argues that the resolution could also prevent the senate and the american people from learning the full scope of claims against the president. for example, it doesn't admit the house record into evidence at the trial, he said. mcconnell also changed that in the final version — house evidence will now be allowed unless there is an objection.\n\nmcconnell's draft resolution had only allowed that senators may offer the evidence, meaning all of the findings from the house process could be subject to majority vote, according to senior democratic aides.\n\nin order for trump to be removed from office, 20 republicans must join all 47 democrats; there is little to no indication that will happen.
what latinos want from immigration reform\n\npresident obama recently announced that he would be turning his attention to immigration reform. but what's a realistic expectation, and what are immigrant communities really hoping for? host michel martin talks with fernando espuelas of univision, and eduardo de souza, a soccer coach at longwood university.\n\nmichel martin, host:\n\nthis is tell me more from npr news. i'm michel martin. we are going to spend some time today talking about some of the biggest issues for what is now the biggest minority group in the country, latinos. in a moment, we'll talk about marketing to latinos from one of this country's veteran marketing executives. we'll ask what works and what misses the mark. her answers might surprise you.\n\nbut first, we want to talk about politics and specifically, immigration reform, which is often viewed as a top priority of latino voters. it's also been on the mind of president obama, who said late last week that he was ready to make it a priority.\n\n(soundbite of speech)\n\npresident barack obama: we should finish the job of fixing our broken immigration system. there's already a broad coalition across america that's behind this effort of comprehensive immigration reform, from business leaders to faith leaders to law enforcement.\n\nmartin: and just today, house speaker john boehner said that he is, quote-unquote, hopeful about bringing up immigration reform in the house this year. we wanted to talk more about this, if there really is the political and popular well to address this country's immigration laws. so we've called upon somebody who's been following the issue closely. fernando espuelas is the managing editor and host of the fernando espuelas show, which is broadcast on univision america. welcome back. thanks so much for joining us once again.\n\nfernando espuelas: thank you, michel.\n\nmartin: and for additional perspective, we also called eduardo de souza. he's the associate head soccer coach at longwood university in virginia. he's been living in the u.s. since 1999 on a series of visas, and we thought it would be helpful for him to tell us more about his experiences in trying to navigate the system as it is now. eduardo, thank you so much for joining us once again.\n\nde souza: thanks for having me.\n\nmartin: fernando, i'm going to start with you because you've been reporting on this. this isn't the first time the president has said that he wants to bring immigration reform to the table, and now the speaker has said the same thing, or he said that he's hopeful. could it be that the stars are aligned that this will now happen?\n\nespuelas: well, i think ultimately there is national consensus. gallup published a poll about a month ago or so which showed over 70 percent of americans want immigration reform with a path toward citizenship. but at the same time, there is a group within the republican party - maybe the tea party would be the right name for it - that is adamantly against it and has pledged to oppose it. so since we've learned with the shutdown that perhaps speaker boehner is not totally in charge of his caucus, he might want to bring it up, but that may not mean that they will bring it up.\n\nmartin: well, to your point, we had a conversation earlier this week with rep. reid ribble. he's a republican from wisconsin. he considers himself a conservative, but he's also a member of the no labels group, which is trying to work toward bipartisan solutions to big political issues. and we asked him about whether immigration reform is going to get through the house anytime soon, if it's even going to be taken up. and this is what he had to say.\n\nrep. reid ribble: i think the rest of this fall, the remainder of the fall is going to be centered around issues of the budget and how the conference committee is doing. maybe there'll be some other lighter legislative initiatives that take place, but i'm a little bit skeptical. and then, if immigration reform is not done by the end of this year, it is highly unlikely that it would be done next year because it's an election year.\n\nmartin: basically, reinforcing your point. but fernando...\n\nespuelas: yeah.\n\nmartin: ...a lot of people might be puzzled by why it is that something that seems to be in the political interest of both parties and is in the - you've got, you know, high-profile business leaders, high-profile faith leaders all say this is something that the country needs to address, why it is that this might not happen. can you shed some light on that?\n\nespuelas: well, i have my theories. i think that there is a group of people in the congress that represent a minority of americans, based on the polling, that adamantly are against any kind of immigration reform, perhaps are somewhat threatened - emotionally threatened by the demographic changes in the country. and they see blocking immigration reform as a way of stopping history at a certain level. i know that sounds like too easy an answer, but at the same time, i actually have attended some of these tea party rallies and heard some of these congresspeople speak. and they really do speak in rather harsh terms about immigrants and about what's happened in this country without recognizing that this is a process. this is a system that has broken down, and we have to fix the system, not for the immigrants, but really for the country.\n\nmartin: so eduardo, let's turn to you because so often the focus is on people who are in the country without documentation. you have documentation. i mean, you've been on the program before, and you've talked about the fact you've been here. you went to school here. you went to graduate school here, and you still have difficulty figuring out how to normalize your situation. could you talk a little bit more about that?\n\nde souza: yes, it's mixing feelings, you know, frustration, stress, anxiety from my family, myself because i think the government - the democrats and republicans - they still do not have anything set up, planned, for people that, you know, came to the united states in the legal path. so we talk a lot about illegal immigrants, and we have the rights to talk about them, and they have their own stories. but i don't see much, you know, people address this issue because, you know, think about it. i came by invitation to the united states. i play sports here. i was a scholarship athlete here. then, you know, passing 12 years, i'm still jumping from visa to visa to visa.\n\ntoday, i hold a h-1b visa, which is a work visa, that will expire in 2015. my wife is from brazil as well. she filed the same path as i. she has her own h-1b visa. we have a daughter now here in the united states. she is an american citizen. and we still don't have anything that's going to, you know, back us up. we put a lot of effort to be here, you know. we expend a lot of money. we're investing everything. we're investing in time for life here, getting degrees and trying to do the right thing. so we feel very injustice.\n\nmartin: well, why do you say that there is no path for you, though? you have an h-1b visa. just to recap. you came here, as you said, by invitation. you were recruited to play soccer. you went to undergraduate and graduate school here. so you had a series of student visas. now you have an h-1b visa, recognizing your particular expertise. why is that not a path to citizenship for you?\n\nde souza: because after you stay here for so long, you know, and if you're still in a work visa, working visa has limitations. so mine will expire in 2015. if i don't get a green card and do that, i need to leave the country or i'm going to become illegal immigrant.\n\nso something that i don't want to be in that path, you know, since i'm putting a lot of effort for all those years. i don't know why i don't have a path. so i don't know why the government doesn't clarify for people they have doing the right thing here, paying tax, doing everything correct like a regular american citizen. but we still don't have - we don't have any idea how can we get it, how can we become a citizen, how we can get a green card. you know, of course, there is certain situations that you're going to go through and apply for other fees and everything else...\n\nmartin: ok...\n\nespuelas: ...but it's still not clear.\n\nmartin: let me let fernando get in on this.\n\nespuelas: well, i think eduardo is a wonderful example of why the system is completely broken down. we have a reality in this country, which is that we need more immigrants in order for the economy to continue to grow. if magically today, you stopped all immigration into this country - documented, undocumented, whatever - our population would decline in the same way that the japanese population is declining, the german population is declining. our economy would come down. this is a fact. it's a demographic fact. what we don't have is a cogent system that we can actually apply in order to meet our needs as a country. and this is really a dynamic which has no party, has no ideology. it's just a need for the country.\n\nmartin: well, there is a dispute about that, fernando, which i'm sure you know is the case. i mean, there is a matter of dispute about that, i mean, about the effect on wage rates and so forth. the other thing - but just setting that aside for now, just setting that sort of argument aside for now and just focusing on the political argument, it is said that one of the reasons that there is not more progress on this is that this is really not the top priority of latino voters. people say that other issues come first.\n\nespuelas: yeah.\n\nmartin: could you just address that?\n\nespuelas: yeah. i mean, i think this is the fallacy of polling, which is that if you ask any human being what is the most important thing that they're thinking about, obviously they're going to think about their first needs - jobs, housing, health. and so that's what comes across in polling. but very quickly thereafter, you're going to hit those issues which are emotional markers. and for, i think, latinos in general, but immigrants in particular - or the other way around - basically, immigration is a proxy for how we are being seen in this society.\n\ni'm an american citizen. i would not benefit from immigration reform, but i'm passionately in favor of it, not just because of the impact to the economy and the country in general, but because i do think that it's a respect issue. why is eduardo being treated - even though he's done everything correctly - why are we not taking advantage of the human capital that he represents to this country, and do it in a rational way so that he can be completely calm and relaxed and investing in the country, investing his energy? why not?\n\nmartin: eduardo, can i ask - briefly as you can - when you think about the situation that you are in, the limbo that you are in, which is better than other peoples' in the sense that you do have, you know, you do have an h1-b visa. you do have a job. you're respected in your field. who do you blame for this situation? do you have a sense of - when you think about it, who do you think is at fault? or do you even think of it that way?\n\nde souza: no, i don't think in blaming somebody. i just think it like fernando was expressing it. we have to address this issue because - i give one example. i'm an educator, you know. i coach soccer here, and i educate young americans and people from other countries here, too. you know, every time i speak with them, i tell words like dream, work hard and you're going to succeed. if you do the right thing, you're going to get a reward in the end.\n\nand, you know, i feel very - sometimes, you know, i am telling the right thing because a lot of people - it's not just myself - a lot of people are in my situation, that you follow the american dream. you do the correct things, and in the end, maybe it doesn't work for you, and why, you know. so i don't think blame should be the word i should use. but i think - i think at least, you know, the president is trying to address the immigration reform. that's a positive thing.\n\nmartin: let me just briefly ask fernando about that 'cause we only have about a minute left. fernando, many people, including congressman luis gutierrez, who's been a guest on your program, as well - a congressman from chicago, who is puerto rican, by the way, is not an immigrant - says that the president has not done as much as he could do on this point, even though he's talked a good game, but has not delivered, and your thoughts about that.\n\nespuelas: i disagree with that only because i'm a pragmatist, and, at the end of the day, congress has to pass laws in order for the president to sign it. and he can give as many speeches as he wants. at the end of the day, if the house of representatives does not take up the senate immigration bill, modify it, do whatever they want with it, but take it up and have a vote, there is no bill to sign. and no amount of speechifying on the part of the president will really change that dynamic. so, at the end of the day, boehner has to open up the floor of the house to an open vote. there will be an almost unanimous democratic support for it and probably about 30 percent of republicans will support it, as well. it will pass. the president will sign it. we'll be done with this issue. eduardo will have a path toward citizenship, and our country will be better for it.\n\nmartin: fernando espuelas is managing editor and host of the fernando espuelas show, which is broadcast on univision america. he joined us from our studios in washington, d.c. eduardo de souza is an assistant soccer coach at longwood university. we caught up with him at his offices there. thank you both so much for joining us, gentlemen.\n\nespuelas: thanks, michel.\n\nde souza: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2013 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

one writer's attempt to give twitter users a break from politics and news\n\nquinn cummings started a new kind of storytelling — via monster twitter threads. she speaks with npr's mary louise kelly about her desire to give followers a respite from politics and daily news.\n\nmary louise kelly, host:\n\nwe journalists spend a lot of time on twitter - a lot. along the way, we come across a lot of snark, occasional poignancy and, once in a blue moon, utter hilarity, as in a thread of tweets by writer and one-time child actress quinn cummings.\n\nquinn cummings: gather round, gentle readers. it is time i tell the story of the worst decision i have ever made in an office.\n\nkelly: across 25 tweets, cummings spins the story of a difficult boss with a wounded ego and a solution actor brian dennehy hatched which required a publicity shot of said boss.\n\ncummings: the door opened. i swear to you, even the phones stopped ringing for a second. susan inhaled. who the [expletive], she screamed, gave brian a picture of my mother?\n\nkelly: that is right. she managed to give him a picture of her boss's mom. well, her boss was not happy, as you heard, but on twitter, people loved the story.\n\ncummings: it's been retweeted - i just checked - a little under 18,000 times. somebody tweeted that they had seen death of a salesman on broadway and that this story was almost as dramatic. that tweet was from lin manuel-miranda. it is possible to joy faint, i now know.\n\nkelly: so quinn cummings decided to write more small stories like that one, a departure from her usual work and from the usual thing you come across on social media.\n\ncummings: i spend a lot of time writing jokes about politics. it's been good for my career. i've ended up doing some ghostwriting. i've written political jokes for other people. this is fantastic. but what i can also do is remind people that life is not just politics. i've started to think of my stories as a chance to be a human again. you can hear about my complaining about the local grocery store, which is a fellini film, or getting the dog to the vet. i try to make them very ordinary. it's a respite.\n\nkelly: you might be the first person i've ever interviewed to describe twitter as a respite from that political craziness we are living through.\n\ncummings: you know, when everyone else is zigging, you zag. so for the most part, they're funny. but i do write about the fact that my mother was an emotionally manipulative narcissist. you might be staggered at the amount of people who write to me privately and say, i can't tell that story because mine is still alive or i can't write the story because mine died, but my family will yell at me for speaking ill of the dead. but thank you for writing this because you make me feel better.\n\nkelly: and does it feel as though you're trivializing really important stuff in any way by breaking them down into a series of tweets?\n\ncummings: that's a really good question. my answer is, if you feel that it trivializes it, feel free to unfollow me.\n\nkelly: i wasn't suggesting that at all.\n\ncummings: no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. i'm sorry.\n\nkelly: i'm just thinking about twitter gets so much criticism for being a place where people just fire off whatever random thought pops into their head. it's a hard place to work through something like your mom dying.\n\ncummings: that came out more abrupt than i meant for it to. what i'm saying is it is a relatively new art form, medium, whatever it is you want to call it. and people are figuring out what they like there. if what i do makes people uncomfortable, i totally understand. i'm not going to change.\n\nkelly: do you write the whole tweet thread out in advance and then break it up into tweets?\n\ncummings: yes. i'm very careful about how i construct it. there are certain sentences i want to be by themselves because they're a joke line. if i structure it in a certain way, i'm pacing how you read it.\n\nkelly: yeah.\n\ncummings: it's important to me that i do this right because i have people now supporting this, underwriting it on patreon.\n\nkelly: explain what patreon is.\n\ncummings: patreon is the equivalent of a tip jar. you can reach out to your supporters and say, would you be interested in giving me a dollar a month? and then one dollar is taken off your credit card every month.\n\nkelly: it's fascinating hearing you describe the effort to figure out a business model here. you're a professional writer. you deserve to get paid for what you write. none of us have figured out how to do that on twitter.\n\ncummings: i got a kid in a liberal arts college. and even as a vegetarian, those lentils add up. if i'm not white-knuckling every month, it's a lot easier to write better jokes.\n\nkelly: do you eventually, if you're trying to make a living here, have to figure out a way to tell these small stories on a bigger stage?\n\ncummings: here's the thing. if i write an essay now and i say, here, i've written it over on medium, just click over and read it - the odds are low that they will click. if i can figure out in this time of great change how to be adaptive and a little creative, i can wait and see where my opportunities are.\n\nkelly: writer quinn cummings talking to us about the small stories she shares on her twitter feed. thanks so much.\n\ncummings: thank you so much for having me.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
what the u.s. can do to improve the coronavirus vaccine rollout\n\nthe rollout of the coronavirus vaccines has been slow and haphazard. but there are a number of steps the u.s. government could take to get more american vaccinated and slow the pandemic.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nfor the first time, this week, the u.s. recorded more than 4,000 deaths from covid in a single day. and every day, at least a quarter-million americans test positive for the virus. while vaccines offer hope, the rollout has been haphazard and slow. the biden transition team has announced plans to accelerate the vaccination campaign when they take over later this month. npr's selena simmons-duffin has details and joins us. selena, thanks for being with us.\n\nselena simmons-duffin, byline: hi. good morning.\n\nsimon: what did the biden people announce?\n\nsimmons-duffin: ok, so you know how both the pfizer and moderna vaccines require two shots? well, operation warp speed, which is the federal effort managing vaccine distribution, has been holding back millions of second doses and not sending them out to the field. yesterday, president-elect biden's incoming press secretary, jen psaki, said they plan to change course.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\njen psaki: the president-elect supports distributing most but not all of the currently reserved doses and will take action to make that change when he takes office.\n\nsimmons-duffin: she said this will allow more people to get those first doses and that biden would use the defense production act if needed to ensure manufacturers can keep up making second doses on time.\n\nsimon: selena, how's this different from the one dose idea that was getting talked about this week? and the fda warned against it, didn't they?\n\nsimmons-duffin: right. so this is not the same thing. they're - biden's team is not suggesting that you can just forget about the second dose, and dr. anthony fauci of the national institutes of health emphasized that point to npr yesterday. he is, of course, a member of president trump's covid-19 task force, and he's been advising the incoming biden administration.\n\nanthony fauci: they're not talking about withholding and not giving the second dose. they are completely committed to giving the second dose on time, but they feel that the importance of getting as many people as possible is worth the risk. hopefully the companies will get the doses back there in time.\n\nsimon: and, selena, what's been the reaction to this idea?\n\nsimmons-duffin: well, public health officials and experts that npr talked to yesterday, by and large, said that this is a good move. it is a bit of a gamble. one official i talked to called it aggressive. and here's claire hannan, who runs the association for immunization managers. and those are the people in charge of each state's vaccination plans.\n\nclaire hannan: i think it's probably a good thing to get more doses flowing.\n\nsimmons-duffin: she says with so many people dying every day, this may be better than keeping vaccine in a freezer somewhere. of course, there are problems that more doses won't solve, like finding willing people to get shots because of vaccine hesitancy and just general disorganization and chaos that we've heard about in different places.\n\nsimon: what are some of the other ideas that you've heard that might help the vaccine campaign be more successful and go faster?\n\nsimmons-duffin: well, money is the no. 1 thing that health officials say they need right now. and the good news is that it's coming. three billion dollars from cdc is finally on its way after congress' year-end relief bill. many officials say they plan to use some of that money for big-scale communications campaigns to try to combat hesitancy and misinformation.\n\nand other suggestions include using bigger venues. we saw new jersey and texas and other states announce these mega sites opening up where a thousand or more people can get vaccinated every day.\n\nand there's also excitement about some new vaccine candidates on the horizon that aren't as complicated to handle, including a one-dose vaccine from johnson & johnson. officials are hoping they'll ask fda for emergency use authorization really soon.\n\nsimon: and we're only a few weeks into this whole campaign, selena. what might be next?\n\nsimmons-duffin: oh, boy, yes. in some ways, this is the easy part. right now, front-line health workers and long-term care residents are the groups cdc advises should get the vaccine. we've heard reports that that's not always what's happening, but that is the federal guidance. but in a few weeks, it'll be the turn of essential workers and people over 75. and those are much bigger, more diverse groups. so public health officials really have their work cut out for them.\n\nsimon: npr's selena simmons-duffin, thanks so much.\n\nsimmons-duffin: thank you.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
u.k. steps up coronavirus prevention, but its hospitals have already been strained\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption frank augstein/ap frank augstein/ap\n\nupdated at 3:22 p.m. et\n\nthe united kingdom's government is urging the public to work from home and avoid pubs, restaurants and theaters to slow the spread of the coronavirus as the death toll hit 67, with 1,950 confirmed cases. but, unlike some other european countries, including ireland, the u.k. will keep schools open for now.\n\nin a news conference monday, prime minister boris johnson told people to avoid unnecessary social contact and travel and to not visit nursing homes. he also suggested that by the weekend, he will call for those older 70 and those with the most serious health conditions to stay at home for 12 weeks.\n\nit now looks as though we are approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve, and without drastic action, cases could double every five or six days, johnson said.\n\nit now looks as though we are approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve, and without drastic action, cases could double every five or six days.\n\njohnson said he was not shutting schools, in part because it would require parents, including national health service staff, to stay home. on tuesday, the foreign office advised against nonessential international travel.\n\nthe government's strategy is to try to avoid a spike in cases that could easily inundate the nhs.\n\nthe coronavirus pandemic comes at a vulnerable time for the country's nhs. a decade of crippling funding cuts has left tens of thousands of vacancies and has led to record emergency room wait times. doctors worry about whether the system can hold up.\n\ni see, when i do shifts on the front line, the real impacts of this shortfall in resources, says rosena allin-khan, an emergency room doctor in south london as well as a member of parliament in the main opposition labour party. we don't have enough nurses; we have people waiting far too long for operations.\n\nallin-khan says she thinks the country's health care system could be heading for a reckoning.\n\ni believe this outbreak is really going to expose the gaping chasms, not even just cracks, but the gaping chasms in the nhs, she says.\n\npatients are also concerned about the system's capacity. monika lakomy-diep, an accountant in london, struggled last week to get a doctor to treat her daughter's allergies.\n\nthe nhs is already stretched, she says, standing outside st. thomas' hospital across the river thames from big ben. getting a simple gp appointment is a miracle.\n\nthe nhs is an institution in this country. the government created it in 1948, following the end of world war ii, as part of a series of reforms to give people cradle-to-grave support. funded by taxpayers, it provides everything from annual physicals to cancer surgery at no cost to users.\n\nfor most of its existence, the health system received annual funding increases of about 4% above the inflation rate. but after the global financial crisis, the u.k. government reduced those increases to about 1.5% annually over the past decade, says siva anandaciva, a chief analyst at the king's fund, a health care think tank.\n\nthe u.k.'s conservative prime minister said last week that he hopes to push the peak of covid-19 cases into the late spring to avoid swamping the system.\n\nif we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our nhs will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, johnson said. more beds are available, and we'll have more time for medical research.\n\nron daniels, an nhs critical care doctor, says that if the government's strategy works, the nhs will be able to cope. but if it doesn't, daniels says, the u.k. could come to resemble parts of italy, where more than 2,100 people have died.\n\nif we're unable to change public behavior and we see a rapid spread, daniels says, then the nhs is very quickly going to find itself overwhelmed, as has happened in lombardy, a northwestern italian region that has been devastated by covid-19.\n\nin britain's house of commons last week, ed davey, an acting leader of another opposition party, the liberal democrats, confronted johnson over the lack of health care funding.\n\ndoes the prime minister not agree that the three conservative governments since 2015 should have fixed the roof when the sun was shining? said davey.\n\njohnson responded that his administration has been addressing the problem: there are 8,700 more nurses this year than last year, and we are recruiting another 50,000 more, johnson answered.\n\nlast week, the u.k.'s new treasury chief, rishi sunak, vowed in his budget speech to provide the nhs with whatever resources it needs to fight the coronavirus, including a portion of a $6 billion covid-19 emergency fund.\n\nit's tough for many britons to watch the nhs struggle because they love it so much. anandaciva, of the king's fund, says the service regularly tops public opinion polls on what makes people proud to be british.\n\nsomething that is comprehensive, universal and free at the point of use, as a social construct, anandaciva says, i think speaks to something in the british identity about a sense of fairness, our sense of everyone being in it together.

defying parents, a teen decides to get vaccinated\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption eric risberg/ap eric risberg/ap\n\nethan lindenberger is getting vaccinated for well, just about everything.\n\nhe's 18 years old, but had never received vaccines for diseases like hepatitis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, or the chickenpox.\n\nlindenberger's mother, jill wheeler, is anti-vaccine. he said she has been influenced by online misinformation, such as a debunked study that claimed certain vaccines were linked with autism, or a theory that vaccines cause brain damage. incorrect ideas like these have spread like wildfire, so much so that the cdc has explicitly tried to combat them, posting pages like vaccines do not cause autism.\n\nlindenberger's eldest sister is vaccinated, and his eldest brother is partially immunized, but once his mother found out that she had the right to opt-out of vaccinations, she chose not to vaccinate her younger five children.\n\ngod knows how i'm still alive, lindenberger wrote on reddit last november.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of ethan lindenberger courtesy of ethan lindenberger\n\nin his reddit post, lindenberger goes on to ask for help figuring out how to get vaccinated. he got more than 1,000 responses. his post joins similar ones from other unvaccinated teenagers trying to get their shots, despite their parents' beliefs.\n\nat a time of widespread measles outbreaks in the pacific northwest, causing washington state gov. jay inslee to declare a state of emergency, more minors are raising questions about whether they can provide their own consent to get vaccines.\n\naccording to the cdc, for month of january this year, measles have been confirmed in 10 states, with the agency monitoring other outbreaks in new york state and new york city.\n\ngrowing up, lindenberger said he listened to what his mom told him about how vaccines were bad and carried negative side effects. he thought it was normal to not receive vaccines.\n\nbut then in school, lindenberger got pulled out of class and asked by educators to get vaccinated. he talked with friends and realized all of them had been vaccinated, but that he didn't even know what a flu shot felt like. he saw more and more anti-vaccination debates popping up on social media. slowly, he started to question what his mother had told him.\n\nso, he did some research of his own.\n\nwhen i started looking into it myself, it became very apparent that there was a lot more evidence in defense of vaccinations, in their favor, lindenberger told npr's scott simon on weekend edition.\n\nafter researching, lindenberger tried to confront his mother, approaching her with an article from the cdc about how vaccines don't cause autism.\n\nher response was simply 'that's what they want you to think,'  he said. i was just blown away that you know, the largest health organization in the entire world would be written off with a kind of conspiracy theory-like statement like that.\n\ndespite repeated efforts to debate vaccination with his mother and show her the impact of the anti-vaccination movement on public health, lindenberger has been unable to change her mind. but his own mind was made up: he was going to get vaccinated.\n\nlindenberger recently received his first round of shots — for diseases such as hpv, hepatitis a, hepatitis b, and influenza. it has caused some stress in his norwalk, ohio home, where he lives with both of his parents.\n\nmy mom had always known i disagreed with her and figured that was going to pass, but it didn't, he said. she looked at it as me getting vaccines for a gesture of rebellion and not for my own sake and for the sake of people around me.\n\nin an interview with the science magazine undark, lindenberger's mother said that his decision to get vaccinations felt like an insult and called it a slap in the face.\n\nsince he's now legally an adult, lindenberger's mother cannot stop him from getting the vaccinations. for minors who want to get their shots, it can be trickier, since there are no federal laws regulating the issue. instead, a minor's ability to get vaccinated varies depending on state laws. in many cases, 18 is the requirement to get medical procedures without a parent's consent.\n\nthough she can't control his decision, lindenberger said his mother still tries to convince him not to continue with vaccinations.\n\nwhile he doesn't question his mother's love, lindenberger said he questions her judgment. he has more shots scheduled for later this month.\n\nnpr's denise guerra contributed to this report and produced this story for broadcast.
since 1997, steve hamilton has been writing his award-winning alex mcknight series, about an ex-cop who rents out vacation cabins in michigan's upper peninsula, but repeatedly finds himself pulled out of the tranquility of nature into the human wreckage of crime. hamilton's latest book inaugurates a new series.\n\ncalled the second life of nick mason, the novel is so good, it legitimately stands shoulder-to-padded-paranoid-shoulder with the classics of the crime-noir genre.\n\nthe opening scene is archetypal: an ex-con named nick mason walks out of a maximum-security prison into a waiting limousine. nick doesn't know why or how he's been released decades early from his 25-years-to-life sentence for his role in a caper that resulted in a cop's death, but he knows that a crime kingpin named darius cole — who's still inside the prison — is responsible.\n\nsure enough, the limo takes nick to cole's luxury townhouse on the north side of chicago. the limo driver drops nick off, leaving him with the ominous advice: this isn't freedom. this is mobility. don't get those two things confused.\n\nsoon, nick's cell phone begins ringing with grisly long-distance assignments from cole. nick is a criminal, but not a bad man. while feverishly scheming how to escape his servitude to cole, nick also must keep dodging a chicago detective determined to put him back in prison.\n\nthere are so many terrific elements in this novel — nick's haunted character, a plot that never darts in the direction you expect it to and a truly ingenious climax — that i could be here till labor day singing its praises. instead, i'll change directions and mention another seasoned hard-boiled writer who introduced a superb new series several months ago.
student petition supports teacher who resigned over racy photos taken from phone\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption google maps google maps\n\nafter one of her students grabbed her phone and took a photo of her racy selfie, teacher leigh anne arthur resigned. the school district says she should have known better. but her students in union, s.c., say arthur was forced to resign — and they want her back.\n\nleigh anne arthur is the victim of a blatant attack of her privacy, says a petition started by her students that has now been signed by more than 3,000 people. personal photographs were illegally obtained by a student and were sent to other students in the school.\n\nuntil recently, arthur worked at the career and technology center at union high school, teaching mechatronics — a field that includes elements of mechanical and electric engineering with computer programming. the students' petition praises her dedication to them and to the program.\n\nthe phone incident stems from last month. arthur says that while she was monitoring the hallway during a class change, a 16-year-old male student took her phone from her desk and navigated to her photos, according to local tv wyff news. the student then snapped his own image of a photo that showed arthur partially nude and shared it via texts and on social media. arthur tells wyff she had taken the photo for her husband, on valentine's day.\n\nthe union county school district's interim superintendent, david eubanks, says the phone wasn't locked with a passcode, and in a statement released wednesday, he also questioned whether arthur was where she should have been.\n\nas a result, a student accessed inappropriate material on her phone, eubanks said, sent it to others, and as a result may also be severely punished by law enforcement as well as the school district.\n\neubanks also said that he has seen evidence that arthur's students routinely used the teacher's cellphone with her full permission.\n\narthur was given a choice of either going through a dismissal process or resigning, the state newspaper reports.\n\nthe students' petition says the decision to let arthur go is unacceptable, and must be corrected. but in an interview with wyff, arthur says she's not sure she'd like to return to work at the school.\n\nthere is no clothing big enough to make you feel protected, she said.\n\nshe also said she doesn't feel the student who shared the image should face harsh punishment.\n\nhe's 16, she said. he's going to make stupid decisions. we all made stupid decisions at 16.\n\npolice in union are now investigating the case. according to the union times, investigators used a search warrant to obtain the male student's cellphone and have now given it to state law enforcement officials for a forensic examination.\n\neubanks issued another statement on friday, doubling down on his assertion that arthur was at fault for leaving her phone unlocked on her desk. the statement read in part:\n\nit is truly unfortunate that a teacher charged with proper supervision and care of students failed to fulfill that responsibility in her classroom. evidence indicates that leigh anne arthur was not in her assigned position at the time of the incident. evidence also indicates that she allowed students to use her personal cell phone on a regular and routine basis. evidence also indicates that the phone was routinely left on her desk for student use and was never locked. ms. arthur has used the media to transmit false information obviously intended for the purpose of deflecting the incident totally to students. the evidence available, points to the extent of her false statements.\n\neubanks' statement also noted that the student who obtained arthur's racy photo has been charged by local police with the crime of transmitting pornographic material using electronic media and now will now also face possible expulsion from the school district.\n\nlastly, eubanks said that he is not aware of charges that may be filed against ms. arthur.

face-off over 'fracking': water battle brews on hill\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption istockphoto.com istockphoto.com\n\nenvironmentalists and the natural gas industry are getting ready for a battle in congress over something known as hydraulic fracturing.\n\nfracking, as the industry calls it, involves injecting a million gallons or more of water and chemicals deep underground to pry out gas that's locked away in tight spaces.\n\nenvironmentalists want the federal government to regulate the practice because, in some cases, fracking may be harming nearby water wells. the industry says regulation should be left up to the states.\n\nhydraulic fracturing allows drillers to dramatically increase production. the chemicals pumped underground with the water help drillers bore through the hard rock. the pressure used is tremendous — about 300 times a typical garden hose. that creates small cracks in the rock that allow gas to escape.\n\nsteve harris believes that pressure also ruined his well. he lives on 14 acres south of dallas. shortly after a driller fracked a nearby well, he and his neighbors noticed a change in water pressure.\n\nwhen you'd flush the toilet — in the back where the bowl is — water would shoot out the top of the bowl, says harris.\n\nwhen he took a shower, there was a foul odor, and the water left rashes on his grandson's skin. his horses stopped drinking from their trough, and there was an oily film on top of the water.\n\nsimilar stories are popping up around the country. in ohio, a couple's house blew up when gas from their water well filled their basement. a woman in colorado blames her health problems on the chemicals used for fracking.\n\nfor the most part, people nearby don't even know what chemicals are being injected into the ground — companies don't have to report that.\n\ntheo colborn, who founded the endocrine disruption exchange, based in paonia, colo., has spent years trying to figure out what chemicals the industry is using, with some success. she says removing the exemption fracking has been given from the safe drinking water act would bring some much-needed light to the industry.\n\nbelieve me, we have a lot of good people within our federal agencies that would love to be working on this issue and addressing it. and they can't — it's hands-off right now, says colborn.\n\ngenerally, the environmental protection agency regulates anything that could affect underground drinking water supplies. but in 2005, the industry successfully lobbied for the exemption for fracking from the safe drinking water act. that leaves regulation up to the states, which don't have the kind of resources the epa does.\n\nwe have no evidence that hydraulic fracturing is causing problems, says lee fuller, vice president of government relations for the independent petroleum association of america. without evidence of problems, he says there's no reason to pile on more regulation.\n\ni think people need to have more faith in the regulatory agencies that are watching it very closely and their ability to respond to issues if they arise, says fuller.\n\nbut environmental groups are lobbying congress to get that exemption overturned as hydraulic fracturing becomes increasingly common. halliburton, which pioneered hydraulic fracturing, says about 35,000 wells are fracked each year.\n\ngwen lachelt of the oil and gas accountability project says that politically, now is the time for those on her side of this issue to move.\n\nwe have a different presidential administration. we have new regions of the country that are now experiencing oil and gas development, says lachelt. new york city is a case in point. ... companies are wanting to drill natural gas wells in new york city's drinking watershed.\n\nseveral city council members have expressed concern over that idea, and there's been talk of finding a way to ban drilling in that region.\n\nbut the natural gas industry argues that more regulation will push up prices. to be sure, hydraulic fracturing is, in part, responsible for the low natural gas prices consumers are paying now.\n\ncolorado school of mines professor geoffrey thyne understands that. still, he wants the industry to start encouraging more scientific research on fracking.\n\nlet's prove to everybody what we're saying — that's there's absolutely no danger — but let's do it in a rigorous way we can defend, says thyne.\n\nthyne says the industry also could agree to stop using harmful chemicals in the process. already, several of the largest drillers have agreed to stop using diesel, which can poison groundwater with benzene.
democrats decry 'dangerous' foreign interference argument made by trump lawyers\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ap ap\n\nupdated at 11:40 p.m. et\n\nthe senate on wednesday night concluded the first of two days full of questions in the impeachment trial of president trump. the proceeding offered clues about the thinking of senators, but the session consisted mostly of trial lawyers on both sides magnifying arguments they have already delivered.\n\nthere were, however, controversial moments in which trump's counsel took positions democrats decried as radical or even unlawful.\n\ntrump lawyer patrick philbin and rep. adam schiff, one of the democrats prosecuting trump, sparred over a topic that reverberated after wednesday's session ended.\n\nphilbin defended accepting credible information from foreign sources about a political rival, arguing that mere information is not something that would violate the campaign finance laws.\n\nif it's credible information, he said, it's relevant information for the voters to know about for people to be able to decide on who is the best candidate for an office.\n\nhis defense echoes comments trump has previously made about accepting compromising information from foreign governments about political opponents.\n\nschiff became animated in responding, saying the suggestion that seeking foreign interference in an american election is a president's policy should have another name.\n\ni'm sorry, that's what i call corruption. and they can dress it up in fine legalese, but corruption is still corruption, schiff said.\n\nfederal campaign finance laws do prohibit foreign contributions, or taking a thing of value from a foreign source in u.s. elections.\n\nsen. debbie stabenow, d-mich., said senate democrats were in shock when philbin defended what she called a type of foreign interference.\n\nthis is setting precedent that is unheard of in our country. and it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, she said.\n\nsen. mark warner, d-va., said he was flabbergasted by philbin's inappropriate remarks. the president's counsel tonight, in a sense gave a green light for that kind of behavior to continue, he said. i hope and pray that cooler heads will prevail but i think there was a dramatic step backwards in terms of protecting the integrity of our election.\n\n\n\nwarner, a lead democrat on the senate intelligence committee, said philbin's advocacy contradicts the work of the intelligence community.\n\nmr. trump's own director of the cia, director of nsa, director of national intelligence, director of fbi, who've all said their top priority going into 2020 is to make sure foreign interference does not continue and is not allowed, warner said.\n\nschiff, sounding aghast, agreed.\n\nit's now okay to criminally conspire with another country to get help in a presidential election? schiff said.\n\nanother striking exchange occurred when trump lawyer alan dershowitz said if a president orchestrates a quid pro quo, or an exchange of favors, and it is done for more reasons than being corrupt, then the action should not trigger an impeachment.\n\nif a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment, dershowitz said.\n\n\n\ndershowitz said if a president does not act out of purely a corrupt motive, but rather has a mixed motive, meaning a president is acting of the country's interest and in hopes of improving reelection prospects, then the behavior cannot warrant articles of impeachment.\n\nhow many presidents have made foreign policy decisions after checking with their political advisers and pollsters? he asked.\n\nsen. richard blumenthal, d-conn., said the position brought dershowitz into the land of legal absurdity, he tweeted. that anything a public official does for re-election is ok. that cannot be true.\n\nthe formal proceedings on capitol hill, in which senators from both parties submitted written questions to house managers prosecuting the case as well as trump's defense lawyers, commenced as news emerged from the white house that the national security council told john bolton, its former chief, in a letter that the manuscript for his upcoming book appears to contain significant amounts of classified information that needs to be excised before the book can be published.\n\nthat is being contested by bolton's lawyer, charles cooper, who on wednesday released an email he sent last week to the national security council in which he asserted that nothing in bolton's book could reasonably be considered classified.\n\ncooper said the national security council never responded to the email.\n\nthat manuscript, which reportedly contains dozens of pages on trump's dealing with ukraine, has loomed over this week's senate impeachment trial sessions. that is because the book purportedly says trump told bolton that military assistance to ukraine would be released only after ukraine opened investigations into trump's democratic rivals — the allegation at the heart of trump's impeachment and the proceedings in the senate.\n\nthe first question wednesday came from susan collins, mitt romney and lisa murkowski, three republican senators who have signaled they may support a vote to hear from witnesses. they asked the president's defense lawyers how the senate should weigh impeachment if trump had more than one motive for his conduct. the question — like all others — were submitted to u.s. chief justice john roberts, who is presiding over the trial, who read them aloud.\n\nattorney patrick philbin responded that once you're in mixed-motive land, once it is established that there is a legitimate public interest that could justify looking into something, just asking a question about something, the managers' case fails.\n\nthe first question from the democratic side was whether the senate could render a verdict without hearing from key witnesses, such as bolton and acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jacquelyn martin/ap jacquelyn martin/ap\n\nlead house manager adam schiff, d-calif., responded, the short answer to that question is, there is no way to have a fair trial without witnesses.\n\nsenate minority leader chuck schumer told reporters later on wednesday that he was uncertain about the prospect of getting 51 senators to vote to call witnesses: all democrats and those who caucus with them would need at least four republican senators to join them in order to get witnesses.\n\nsen. ted cruz, r-texas, asked whether it mattered legally if trump sought a quid pro quo from ukraine's leader. trump's attorney alan dershowitz responded with a broad view of executive powers, arguing that if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\n\nbut later, schiff said: all quid pro quos are not the same. some are legitimate and some are corrupt, and you don't need to be a mind reader to figure out which is which. for one thing, you can ask john bolton.\n\nthere was a definite shift in activity in the chamber wednesday. senate pages ran question cards and notes back and forth — in addition to their usual duties of running water and mail to senators' desks. senators were also much more engaged in the question-and-answer portion. dozens had question cards on their desks, took notes or prepared questions. many watched the speaker at the lectern.\n\nthe session, which was scheduled to last eight hours on wednesday, will continue for a further eight on thursday. this stage in the proceedings comes a day after the president's legal team rested in its defense of trump. democratic house managers made their case last week on why the president should be removed from office. trump was impeached last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress.\n\namong those watching the session wednesday was joseph bondy, the attorney for lev parnas, a former associate of trump's lawyer rudy giuliani. bondy was in the senate gallery as a guest of schumer. parnas, who has been indicted in new york for alleged campaign finance violations, wasn't in the gallery because he has to wear a gps monitoring device as part of his pretrial release. bondy declined to say where parnas would watch the proceedings from.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption patrick semansky/ap patrick semansky/ap\n\nthe two days of senate questions set the stage for a friday vote on whether to allow witnesses.\n\ni hope we can get witnesses and documents, schumer told reporters during a break in the questioning. it's an uphill fight. is it more likely than not? probably no. but is it a decent good chance? yes.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell also expressed concerns about gop senators tuesday. although senate republicans including romney of utah, lamar alexander of tennessee, murkowski of alaska and collins of maine have indicated they may be open to hearing from witnesses, their final decision is still unknown.\n\naccording to democrats, multiple potential witnesses have firsthand accounts of what they say is a quid pro quo scheme with ukraine that forms the basis of the two impeachment charges that trump is facing. but republicans maintain that witnesses can inject uncertainty into the proceedings and prolong the trial.\n\nsen. pat toomey, r-pa., told npr's claudia grisales that he remains very, very skeptical that there is any witness that is going to shed any light that is going to cause me to change my view on what the final outcome of what this trial ought to be. republicans overwhelmingly support trump's acquittal.\n\namong the sought-after witnesses is bolton, the former national security adviser who captured washington's attention this week following the release of revelations in his forthcoming book. those purported book details, first reported by the new york times, placed pressure on senators to vote to allow witnesses into the trial.\n\nloading...\n\nbut the nsc in a jan. 23 letter to cooper, bolton's lawyer, said: under federal law and the nondisclosure agreements your client signed as a condition for gaining access to classified information, the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information.\n\nthe letter, signed by the nsc's record management official, ellen knight, said the council would work with bolton to help identify what material in the manuscript could be used.\n\ntrump's defense team has argued that the manuscript would be inadmissible in the trial.\n\nlawyers for trump have accused democrats of trying to invalidate the result of the 2016 election. they say trump has not committed any crime and therefore cannot be removed from office, even though many legal scholars say a law need not be broken to secure an impeachment conviction that would remove a president from office.\n\nalthough two previous presidents, bill clinton and andrew johnson, have also been impeached, no u.s. president has ever been removed from office.\n\ndemocrats impeached trump last month for abuse of power and obstruction of congress for what the prosecution team says was a campaign to pressure ukraine into opening investigations into trump's political rivals by holding up $391 million in congressionally approved security assistance in order to apply leverage on ukrainian authorities. house democrats say the white house's refusal to cooperate with the impeachment investigation is proof of a cover-up and amounts to obstruction.
don't call me 'darling': american bar association bans sexist language\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption education images/uig via getty images education images/uig via getty images\n\nthe american bar association has passed a resolution prohibiting lawyers from making sexist remarks, following the lead of many u.s. states.\n\nnow, it is deemed professional misconduct to engage in conduct that the lawyer knows or reasonably should know is harassment or discrimination, including sexual harassment and derogatory or demeaning verbal or physical comment, the resolution states.\n\nit was passed this week at the aba's annual meeting in san francisco. some 69 people requested to speak in favor of the rule change, according to the american bar association journal, and there were no speakers opposing the bill. during a voice vote, it was not without opposition, but it passed clearly.\n\nopponents of the bill had argued that it harms free speech and religious freedom, and was driven by 'pc politics' rather than professional ability, according to the journal.\n\nas the new york times reports, nearly two dozen state bars and the district of columbia bar have similar rules. however, without a flat prohibition, advocates of the rule said, using demeaning and misogynistic terms and actions to undermine opposing counsel and others too often does not have consequences.\n\nthe states have not waited for the a.b.a. to act. they have been laboratories of change, law professor myles v. lynk tells the times. it is time for the a.b.a. to catch up.\n\nand while the focus of the discussion was on harassment against women, it also prohibits conduct that the attorney should reasonably know constitutes harassment or discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, national origin, ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status or socioeconomic status in conduct related to the practice of law.\n\nthe journal says the first speaker in favor of the resolution was mark johnson roberts, who was passed over by a law firm hiring committee as a new lawyer 28 years ago because he is gay. he told this story:\n\n[a] young, female colleague ... was groped by an older male opposing counsel at a holiday party. after she fled the scene, the man followed her and asked 'in the crudest possible terms' about what sexual activity she might be planning with her husband that night. the woman went to her bar association to file a complaint, only to discover that the man's behavior violated no ethics rule — unless he had been convicted of a crime. despite concerns that she'd never work in her field again if she prosecuted, roberts said, she filed a police report.  'now the opposing counsel has a criminal conviction,' said roberts. 'so be careful what you wish for when you say [victims] should pursue criminal remedies first.' \n\nthe new resolution extends beyond the courtroom; it also includes interacting with witnesses, coworkers, court personnel, lawyers and others while engaged in the practice of law; operating or managing a law firm or a law practice; and participating in bar association, business or social activities in connection with the practice of law.

i wonder if he meant which hunt as in w-h-i-c-h, which hunt?\n\nsagal: yeah, i know.\n\nbodett: the emoluments clause...\n\nsalie: there are so many.\n\nbodett: ...are we going after the russian collision? which is it?\n\nsagal: all right, we should try to recap what happened this week. it started with the news that trump had blurted out some top secret classified information to, of course, russians in the oval office. his aides said anonymously in his defense - and this is true, this was their defense - that he is so ignorant and oblivious he did not know he was doing it.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: and there's nothing you can do about it because he's like a puppy. if you don't punish him for messing on the floor right away, he's forgotten he's done it. there's no point in bringing it up to him. he doesn't know he did it. that's why general h.r. mcmaster will now be attending all national security briefings with a spray bottle.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsalie: can you explain what...\n\nsagal: no.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: whatever you're asking, i got nothing, but go for it.\n\nsalie: everyone's talking about memos, right?\n\nsagal: the comey memos.\n\nsalie: the comey - did he handwrite this and...\n\nsagal: apparently james comey, who was a very particular and careful man from all accounts...\n\nsalie: he's a virgo, yeah.\n\njames: super hot.\n\nsagal: is he, in fact, super hot to your eye?\n\njames: yeah, 6' 8? yeah, i'll take that.\n\nsagal: you find that...\n\njames: fbi.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsalie: wait, he's 6-foot-8?\n\nsagal: he is.\n\njames: yeah. that's why trump don't like him, is why (unintelligible)...\n\nbodett: he's taller than he is.\n\nsagal: really? just about the memos. apparently what comey did was after every encounter he had with trump, because he realized they were unusual, he wrote down a detailed memo, a detailed account of what had just happened so he'd have a record...\n\nsalie: like in his journal?\n\nsagal: sort of. in fact, the memos read a lot like letters to penthouse because it'd always start with, you're never going to believe what happened to me...\n\nsalie: you're never going to believe this...\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: all right, summer, your next quote comes from a nato official.\n\nkurtis: we're bracing for impact.\n\nsagal: that official was talking about the preparations they were making for whose first foreign trip?\n\nhanford: donald trump?\n\nsagal: yes, him again.\n\n(laughter, soundbite of bell, applause)\n\nsagal: who knew? president trump's first foreign trip starts this weekend. it's a doozy with five different countries on the agenda. sources say he's visiting so many countries because he's not sure which one will offer him asylum.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: it was so tough to get the president to pay attention to the briefing books that were prepared for him about this trip that the aides inserted his own name in every paragraph so that they would hold his interest.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: that's not a joke.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsalie: no, they were like little bread crumbs.\n\nsagal: that's true. it's from the new york times.\n\njames: donald goes to china.\n\nsagal: right.\n\n(laughter)\n\njames: donald...\n\nsagal: it's basically like that. the trip starts in saudi arabia, then it goes on to israel and the vatican. so trump can violate the moral strictures of all three great world religions right in their faces.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: and then when he's in israel he's going to yad vashem. that is the very solemn state memorial to the victims of the holocaust. but again - this is true - he has insisted that he only spend 15 minutes there. he will not spend any longer than that. and, of course, 10 minutes of that has to be in the gift shop.\n\n(laughter)\n\njames: this is also...\n\nsagal: he wants to complete his collection of atrocity spoons. he's got almost all of them.\n\nunidentified crowd: oh.\n\nsalie: oh, my (laughter).\n\n(laughter)\n\njames: he also finds out that he can't hide any money in the west bank.\n\nsagal: it's true.\n\n(laughter)\n\njames: he thought.\n\nsagal: i know.\n\nbodett: yeah, i wanted to see that west bank. it's one i haven't really tapped yet, you know?\n\nsagal: summer, for a change of pace, well, here's your last quote.\n\nkurtis: i love the smell of diabetes in the morning.\n\nsagal: that was a poster on reddit reacting to news that lucky charms, our favorite cereal, is offering a limited run of its own cereal featuring only what?\n\nhanford: only marshmallows?\n\nsagal: yes, only marshmallows.\n\n(soundbite of bell, applause)\n\nsagal: and you didn't think there was any good news in this week. finally, general mills is making all our dreams as a child come true by making a box of lucky charms that is finally all marshmallows.\n\njames: hell yeah.\n\nsagal: hell yeah. you're excited.\n\njames: i'm excited.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: no more picking them out of the oats and milk.\n\njames: no.\n\nbodett: if you wet down a box of entirely marshmallow, how big would that become? i mean, it's like those...\n\njames: what?\n\nsagal: if you wet it down, if you soak...\n\nbodett: it's like those magic monkey things, you know?\n\nsalie: oh, yeah.\n\nbodett: i mean, don't they, like, get...\n\nsalie: they expand.\n\nbodett: don't they get huge when you...\n\njames: what lucky charms are you eating?\n\n(laughter)\n\nbodett: well, it's been a few years.\n\njames: those are toys.\n\nbodett: no wonder i never liked that cereal.\n\njames: you're eating the prizes that come in the box.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: bill, how did summer do on our quiz?\n\nkurtis: well, she wrote a book while she's been playing.\n\n(laughter, applause)\n\nkurtis: and she got them all right.\n\nsagal: congratulations, summer.\n\nkurtis: what a winner.\n\n(applause)\n\nsagal: dear jane would be proud.\n\nhanford: thanks so much.\n\n(soundbite of bow wow wow song, i want candy)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
transcript: npr's full interview with secretary of state mike pompeo\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrew harrer/bloomberg via getty images andrew harrer/bloomberg via getty images\n\nin an interview on friday with all things considered co-host mary louise kelly, secretary of state mike pompeo took questions about u.s. policy in iran and about the former u.s. ambassador to ukraine, marie yovanovitch.\n\nmary louise kelly: secretary of state, good to see you.\n\nsecretary of state mike pompeo: good to be with you. thanks for having me on the show.\n\nlisten: mary louise kelly interviews secretary of state mike pompeo listen · 11:09 11:09\n\nlet's start with iran. what is the plan? and on diplomacy, specifically, is there any serious initiative to reopen diplomacy with iran?\n\nso we've been engaged in deep diplomatic efforts since the first day of the trump administration. we've built out a coalition that is working together — gulf states, israel, many european countries — to deliver on the three central outcomes that we're looking for.\n\nbut in terms of u.s. engagement with iran, is there any talks underway, any plan for talks?\n\nyou know, we never talk about private conversations that are taking place, but the diplomatic effort on this front has been vigorous, robust and enormously successful. we built out a significant coalition that has put pressure on the iranian regime to do what we've asked: to cease its processing of uranium, reprocessing of plutonium, to stop its missile program and the development of its missile program. president trump made clear they're not going to have a nuclear program that is capable of delivering these weapons around the world. and then finally, working to convince them that their model, this proxy model that they've used to conduct terror campaigns, assassinations in europe, assassination attempt right here in washington, d.c., is not tolerable.\n\nyou use the word pressure. this is the maximum pressure campaign that president trump put into place a year and a half ago when he pulled out of the nuclear deal. but in that year and a half, iran has behaved more provocatively, not less. so is maximum pressure working?\n\nabsolutely working. to put it in context, this is 40 years. when you say worse, they held american hostages in our embassy in tehran. they had our sailors kneeling. the previous administration gave them billions and billions of dollars to underwrite the very actions that they're taking today. when we came into office, it took a lot of work to fundamentally reshape the diplomatic, military and economic landscape. so it didn't happen instantaneously, but we made an enormous amount of progress in delivering —\n\nbut in the last year, they have targeted tankers in the gulf. they have shot down a u.s. drone, and they have attacked saudi oil facilities. is that the desired outcome?\n\nno, of course not. of course, we don't want them to do those things. and we've raised the cost for doing this. the response in the previous administration when they undertook those actions was to reward them — to reward them, to give them billions of billions of dollars to allow countries to trade with them, to allow them to do all the things that you're seeing today, the ramifications, the tail, the end result of what the previous administration is the activity that we're seeing today. the money that underwrote hezbollah, that underwrites hamas, that underwrites shia militias in iraq is a direct result of the resources that were provided to them for the eight years prior to us coming into office. we are turning this around. we have reduced resources. we've seen it. they have fewer dollars available. this is beginning to place real choices in front of the iranian regime. and you can see it, too. you can see in the protests inside of iran. you can see the iranian people not happy with their own government when they have to raise the fuel cost. all the things that are undermining this regime's ability to inflict risk on the american people are coming to fruition as a direct result of president trump's strategy.\n\npresident trump's strategy has included pulling out of the nuclear deal. since the president came to office, iran has moved closer to a nuclear weapons capability. they are closer today than they were when he took office. they are spinning more centrifuges. they are stockpiling more enriched uranium. if the plan is to keep iran from getting a nuclear weapon, how do you do that when they're not abiding by the limits of the old deal and there's no new deal in sight?\n\nyou're picking the wrong moment to start your analysis. this is the fundamental flaw of the jcpoa [joint comprehensive plan of action] itself.\n\ni'm picking the moment [crosstalk] when the president pulled out of the nuclear deal, and since then, they are closer to having a nuclear weapon.\n\nthis is a regime that has been working to develop its nuclear program for years and years and years. and the nuclear deal guaranteed them a pathway to having a nuclear program.\n\nit was a certainty. it might have been delayed for a month or a year or five or 10 years, but it guaranteed them that pathway. this administration has pulled the band-aid off. it's been realistic. we accept the facts on the ground as they are. this is a regime that lied to get into that nuclear deal. you can see that now. and what's going on at the iaea [international atomic energy agency] in turquzabad where we now know that they lied about the scope of their program. these are important, mary louise. these are important items. you can't talk about the iranian nuclear program without acknowledging the facts of what this regime has been up to. they stored documents. they kept technology in place. they dispersed it as a result of the jcpoa. they didn't have it in a central research agency, but they continued to develop their program and this administration is determined to prevent them from getting that weapon. not now, not a year from now and not 10 years from now.\n\nbut again, you say you're determined to prevent them. how do you stop them? i was in tehran two weeks ago. i sat down with your counterpart there, javad zarif, and he told me, quote, all limits on our centrifuge program are now suspended.\n\nyeah. he's blustering. look, the truth of the matter is this is a regime that's never --\n\ndo you have evidence that he's blustering?\n\nthis is a regime that has never been in the position that it's in today. one has to confront so many elements that challenge the central thesis of the theocracy and the revolutionary nature of this regime. and you can see it in protests, not just in tehran. and you should know when you traveled there, i'm guessing you weren't permitted to travel freely. i'm guessing that you didn't get a chance to go out into these places where the life of the iranian people, these are people who are suffering. qassem soleimani, who we removed from the battlefield, killed hundreds of iranians, and the iranian people know that. and it's been our strategy that has delivered this message of freedom for the iranian people.\n\nbut my question again, how do you stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon?\n\nwe'll stop them.\n\nhow? sanctions?\n\nwe'll stop them.\n\nthe president made very clear. the opening sentence in his remarks said that we will never permit iran to have a nuclear weapon. the coalition that we've built out, the economic, military and diplomatic deterrence that we have put in place will deliver that outcome. it's important [crosstalk] because this will protect the american people.\n\nis there any new deal being developed? a new nuclear deal, something that would rein in iran, something that they would agree to.\n\nthe iranian leadership will have to make the decision about what its behavior is going to be.\n\nchange of subject. ukraine. do you owe ambassador marie yovanovitch an apology?\n\nyou know, i agreed to come on your show today to talk about iran. that's what i intend to do. i know what our ukraine policy has been now for the three years of this administration. i'm proud of the work we've done. this administration delivered the capability for the ukrainians to defend themselves. president obama showed up with mres (meals ready to eat.) we showed up with javelin missiles. the previous administration did nothing to take down corruption in ukraine. we're working hard on that. we're going to continue to do it.\n\ni confirmed with your staff [crosstalk] last night that i would talk about iran and ukraine.\n\ni just don't have anything else to say about that this morning.\n\ni just want to give you another opportunity to answer this, because as you know, people who work for you in your department, people who have resigned from this department under your leadership, saying you should stand up for the diplomats who work here. [crosstalk]\n\ni don't know who these unnamed sources are you're referring to. i can tell you this, when i talked to my team here --\n\nthese are not unnamed sources.

making democrats' primaries more open could be harder than you think\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption patrick t. fallon/getty images patrick t. fallon/getty images\n\nas the democrats' primary process begins to wind down, the big question on a lot of people's mind is, what does bernie sanders want?\n\nthe vermont senator now has a lot of clout within the democratic party, and is in the position to demand some changes.\n\none thing sanders has voiced concerns about is how democrats vote for president: he's made it clear he doesn't like closed primaries, where only democrats can vote.\n\nneither do sanders supporters. when sanders mentioned during a primary night rally this week that kentucky is a closed primary, something i am not all that enthusiastic about, where independents are not allowed to vote, the california crowd roared to life with boos.\n\nso, perhaps sanders will make a push the party to embrace open primaries at the democratic national convention this summer.\n\nthere are electoral stakes here. all year, sanders has done better in contests where independents, or even registered republicans, were allowed to participate.\n\n(of course, sanders has also done well in caucuses, which are very closed and very limited, compared to statewide primaries.)\n\nthere's a big philosophical split to consider, too. university of denver political scientist seth masket said a lot depends on how you view the main function of a primary.\n\nis a primary just an election that your tax dollars are paying for, and that helps determine who our leaders are? he said. and if so, you tend to think, 'sure, all of us should be allowed to participate in that.' \n\nmasket said the other way to view a primary is as a political party making its most important decision: whom to choose for its nominee.\n\nif that's what it is, well then, really shouldn't people who are members of that party be the ones who make that decision? he said.\n\nthere are four basic camps that existing primaries fit into. open and closed are self-explanatory, and there are several different variations of hybrid primaries. some states allow independents to vote in either the democratic or republican primary, but block party members from crossing over.\n\nor, sometimes it may mean that an unaffiliated voter goes to a polling place, decides to vote in a party primary, and that choice of ballot then registers them with that party, said dan diorio, of the national conference of state legislatures.\n\nthe most open format out there is the type that california has: a top-two primary.\n\nevery registered voter has the same ballot in the primary. it has all the candidates in all the primaries on every ballot, said kim alexander, who heads the california voter foundation.\n\nvoters can vote for any candidate they want in every race, and the top two finishers advance to november.\n\nwhile a democrat and republican ended up facing each other in every statewide election in 2014, alexander said the top-two system has shaken up many local races.\n\npolitics new york's closed primary presents a challenge to sanders' campaign new york's closed primary presents a challenge to sanders' campaign listen · 3:23 3:23\n\nwe have seen a number of contests where, in the general election, you have a democrat vs. democrat, or occasionally a republican vs. republican. and that can make those contests more competitive, she said.\n\nof course, if you don't happen to be a member of the party with two candidates on the fall ballot, top-two may leave you feeling more excluded than a closed primary.\n\nthere is a big catch in california — the state's upcoming presidential primary is still partially closed. that could cause confusion for independent sanders supporters, who will have to specifically ask for a separate democratic ballot.\n\nsanders may ask for big changes to the primary system at the democratic national convention this summer. seth masket is skeptical that the party would push for national changes, but suggested what that might look like.\n\nthey could put a lot of pressure on state parties to comply with that, he said. they could say, look, if you still want your full share of delegates in the next election, you better sign onto this.\n\nbut elections are run by states, and most state legislatures don't seem to be too interested in changing their primaries.\n\nabout 50 bills are introduced across the country each year to change the process, according to the national conference of state legislatures, and most don't go anywhere — only one in ten bills affecting primary voting typically end up becoming law.\n\na push to give colorado an open presidential primary, for instance, died in the state senate earlier this month.\n\nin fact, just one state legislature has changed how its primaries work in recent years, and sanders fans wouldn't much care for it: idaho went from an open system to a closed one.
mateo askaripour on his darkly comic debut novel\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nblack buck is the new darkly comic novel by mateo askaripour that gets its title from an old racial slur. the story opens with darren, a young black man, working at a starbucks in midtown manhattan. one of his regular customers, a white startup guy, comes in with his usual order, and darren tells him he doesn't really know what he wants. here's the author, mateo askaripour, reading.\n\nmateo askaripour: (reading) he says, believe it or not, when you come here and order something, you're not ordering a drink. you're ordering a solution, a solution to fatigue, irritability and anything else that a lack of coffee means to you. so if you'll indulge me, i'm confident that the nitro cold brew with sweet cream is what you actually want. it has 10 grams less sugar than your regular, 40 fewer calories and 140 milligrams more caffeine. but at the end of the day, those are just numbers. so if you buy the nitro cold brew and don't like it, you can come back, and i'll give you your regular free of charge. what do you think? silence. i just stared back into his eyes until he said, did you just try to reverse close me?\n\nsimon: their encounter will lead to darren going to work for his customer in a hot startup. darren, the only black salesperson in the company, recreates himself as buck, a ruthless deal-closer, and becomes a man he doesn't recognize. mateo askaripour was himself in startup sales, and we asked what that encounter between darren and rhett sets off.\n\naskaripour: well, i think subconsciously darren saw in rhett an opportunity that he didn't know he need or wanted. and rhett also saw the same, an opportunity for him to activate the potential of someone who he likely saw part of himself in but also that could help his company get ahead.\n\nsimon: i've read a number of interviews with you. as we noted, you've been a director of sales development. you seem to put a different percentage on how much of this novel is autobiographical each and every time you give a different interview.\n\naskaripour: (laughter).\n\nsimon: i'm wondering how you feel today.\n\naskaripour: where i am now is that the book is completely factual when it comes to my emotions. i have felt every single thing that these characters feel. it's the only way that i was able to imbue them with feeling that resonates with myself and hopefully with those who read it. but if i have to put a number, i don't know, 25.8% (laughter).\n\nsimon: that makes sense to me somehow. why does darren become buck, create his character over again?\n\naskaripour: out of necessity. you know, many of us reinvent ourselves without knowing it until we look back and say, wow, i'm different than the person i was yesterday. but it's out of necessity. darren is thrown into an unfamiliar and hostile environment where he is the resident other. he is not just the only person of color in the entire company, but he's the only black person. and if he didn't change whether he knew it or not, he would have been crushed. and it doesn't mean that he had to change because he could have stayed true to who he was before he began working there, gotten fired or quit and gone somewhere else that championed his differences. but that's just not how it played out. and this story is not just one for fiction, but one that plays out in reality over and over and over again for so many of us.\n\nsimon: i mean, some of this is played for laughs, but it's hard not to feel a sting for darren when all the white type a salespeople tell him how much he looks like almost any famous black person in the world that they've ever seen.\n\naskaripour: yeah. well, you begin to see the humor transmogrifying into horror - right? - from page to page where the example that you just cited, scott, it's funny in the beginning, but then by the end, you begin to question, does this actually happen? and if it does, how does it feel for the person on the receiving end? i also didn't want to write a book with 400 pages of tragedy and trauma. better people have already done that and will do that. so i use humor as a in.\n\nsimon: i've got to tell you about a reaction i had. i found the message at the heart of this novel to be very american, that the power is in the pitch. you know, darren says at one point earlier in the book, martin luther king, malcolm x, james baldwin, frederick douglass, rosa parks, harriet tubman, they were all great salespeople.\n\naskaripour: yeah.\n\nsimon: and i think that's true. but wasn't the power of their message at the essence of their success? it wasn't just their salesmanship.\n\naskaripour: yeah, i agree, but i think it starts somewhere else. it starts in the heart. you have to actually believe your message in order to put it into a pitch that resonates with other people, because many of us have a great [expletive] meter, scott, right? so if someone doesn't actually believe what they're selling, especially when it comes to the vision of a different world, no one's going to buy it.\n\nsimon: well, i'll just tell you. i mean, it's not unlike the great gatsby in its own way.\n\naskaripour: is rhett like gatsby? or is buck?\n\nsimon: i'm going to be inspired by your ability to put percentages on things by saying...\n\naskaripour: (laughter).\n\nsimon: no, no, no, give me a chance here now, ok?\n\naskaripour: yeah, yeah.\n\nsimon: it's 34.6% rhett and 63.7% buck.\n\naskaripour: i'll take it.\n\nsimon: ok (laughter).\n\naskaripour: i'm convinced, yeah.\n\nsimon: without getting too much into the suspense that you build, does buck risk losing his moral compass?\n\naskaripour: he most definitely does.\n\nsimon: and is that the price of success?\n\naskaripour: i guess it depends on who has to pay it and what success means to them.\n\nsimon: yeah. mateo askaripour - his debut novel, black buck - thank you so much for being with us.\n\naskaripour: appreciate it.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
astronaut's photos from space change how we see earth\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption scott kelly/nasa scott kelly/nasa\n\nyesterday, nasa announced that astronaut scott kelly will retire from the space agency as of april 1st. kelly holds the u.s. record for the most time spent in space.\n\nfor nearly a full year, he zoomed along at 17,500 miles per hour — orbiting 230 miles above earth — on the international space station. and for those million or so of us who follow him on twitter, cmdr. kelly's year in space gave us a mind-expanding view of planet earth.\n\nkelly posted spectacular photos — awesome, in the true sense of the word. he called them, earth-art.\n\nthrough his zoom lens, he snapped the majestic snowy cap of mount fuji from straight overhead. it looks like a barnacle.\n\nthe cracking blue ice of the himalayas turns into a stunning lapis mosaic.\n\none day, africa appears as a mass of crinkly brown veins; another, it's become vivid streaks of orange and gold.\n\ncrimson and violet squiggles around australia could be an abstract painting.\n\nit seemed that kelly never got tired of what he could see out the window, and what he could make us see, in an entirely new way.\n\nwhen the capsule bearing kelly and cosmonauts mikhail kornienko and sergey volkov parachuted to a landing in kazakhstan earlier this month, that fantastic journey came to a close.\n\nback home in houston, scott kelly will be poked and prodded, weighed and measured, all in the name of science.\n\nand his terrestrial tweets now bring their own delights. he posted video of his first plunge into a pool!\n\na few days later - there was scott kelly with his arms stretched overhead, and a big smile - looking up at a dark sky:\n\nthat's #rain on #earth. i missed weather, he wrote.\n\nkelly has rejoiced in the simple pleasure of being able to sit down at a table for dinner! he's even excited about finally getting to go to the dentist for a teeth cleaning. i guess that's what a year in space will do to you.\n\ni realize i've been missing scott kelly's technicolor snapshots from space. it was impossible to look at those images and not be awed by the sheer natural beauty of this blue marble.
why china supports new sanctions against north korea\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jung yeon-je/afp/getty images jung yeon-je/afp/getty images\n\ninternational pressure on north korea has ratcheted up in recent days, as the u.s. imposed new unilateral sanctions and china began taking steps to implement a strict, new united nations security council resolution.\n\nbut while the u.s. has few economic ties with north korea to cut, china has plenty of screws to tighten. and so whether international sanctions work or fail may depend to a large degree on how strictly china implements them.\n\nbeijing has begun instructing chinese banks, ports and shipping and trading companies doing business with north korea to implement the u.n. resolution to the letter.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption don emmert /afp/getty images don emmert /afp/getty images\n\nadam szubin, the treasury department's acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, tells npr that china is taking this very seriously.\n\ni know from my meetings here in beijing that my counterparts have very much taken the resolution to heart, he says.\n\nszubin, who visited beijing this week, says the new sanctions will hit hard enough to change pyongyang's decision-making calculus.\n\nthe new u.n. resolution is not just adding a few new companies to a sanctions list or a few new north korean officials, szubin says. instead, it targets every major aspect of north korea's access to international shipping, international banking [and] international trade to develop revenues for its missile and illicit nuclear programs.\n\nalthough china appears committed, the sanctions put it in a tough spot.\n\nfirst, says people's university international relations expert cheng xiaohe, some chinese companies are going to take a hit to their bottom line. china-north korea trade was worth $6.86 billion in 2014.\n\nat the same time as we protect our national security interests, we must be prepared to sacrifice some of our own economic interests in order to accurately target north korea with sanctions, he says.\n\ncheng says the u.s. has its work cut out for it, collecting intelligence on the hundreds of chinese firms doing business with north korea, and on north korean firms adept at concealing their business dealings behind fronts and shells.\n\nand if chinese firms are found to be violating the u.n. resolution, cheng points out, they could themselves face sanctions.\n\nthis could create new frictions between the u.s. and china, he warns. i hope that the u.s. will think carefully before it uses this big stick to crack down on chinese firms.\n\ncheng notes that china continues to supply north korea with crude oil as humanitarian assistance. the sanctions allow this, even if north korea may be able to refine some of the oil for military uses.\n\nchina says neither a humanitarian crisis nor regime collapse are acceptable outcomes for north korea. but zhang liangui, a veteran north korea watcher at china's central party school in beijing, says that at the end of the day, china cannot save north korea from its fate.\n\nif north korea is going to collapse, he says, no external force can prop it up. frankly speaking, whether it collapses or continues to develop will mainly depend on its own domestic and foreign policies.\n\nnorth korea's most recent nuclear test has put beijing on the back foot, undermining its diplomatic ties with seoul and raising the possibility that the u.s. could install missile defense systems in south korea.\n\ncheng xiaohe says beijing doesn't like this — but there's not much it can do.\n\nchina has neither the ability nor the political will to give south korea the security guarantees it seeks, he says. but the u.s. does.\n\nthe setbacks have led some chinese observers to wonder, has china's north korea policy failed? — as the official people's daily newspaper recently asked in an online headline.\n\nzhang liangui says the possibility of failure is not one that chinese diplomats dare admit. then again, zhang says, for the past two decades, no country has succeeded in keeping the korean peninsula nuclear-free. north korea's current suspected stockpile is estimated to include 10 to 16 nuclear weapons.\n\nthe way this situation has developed is a collective failure for all of us, he laments, a failure for the entire international community, including the united nations.

like, yeah, i saw peyton manning shoot a guy once.\n\n(laughter)\n\ntillman: yeah. so you make that up with the people from, like - the people who don't really cover football...\n\nsagal: yeah.\n\ntillman: ...you know, a couple europeaners (ph)...\n\nsagal: sure, sure, sure.\n\ntillman: ...some people from asia. and they're just there because of the super bowl. so i give them real dumb answers.\n\n(laughter)\n\ntillman: it was crazy.\n\nsagal: can you say...\n\nbim adewunmi: can i...\n\nsagal: can you remember a really good one?\n\ntillman: i got, like, a bunch of sex questions. so i just, like, made up a bunch of stuff. like, i don't know.\n\nsagal: wait a minute. you got sex questions? like what? i hate to ask, but what kind of sex questions did you get?\n\ntillman: this lady was - i don't know what exactly i said to the lady. i just made stuff up. i just - i lied. i was like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. i did that. yeah. i did this, whatever...\n\n(laughter)\n\ntillman: ...so she could get out of my way.\n\nsagal: that's great. i love it. so among other extraordinary achievements, you played against tom brady. and you've intercepted, i think, twice in one game.\n\ntillman: oh, yeah, buddy.\n\nsagal: yeah.\n\n(laughter, applause)\n\nsagal: tom brady has such, like, a legend about him - greatest football quarterback who's ever lived. i mean, do you guys find that, like, intimidating or, like, inspiring? like, i'm going to go out and pick that guy off.\n\ntillman: i'm going to take option no. 2. i'm going to go out and pick that guy off. i think he is one of the greatest, if not, the greatest to play the game. but yeah. i don't think anyone's intimidated by him. i mean, there was a second-year player that went out damn near beat him. so...\n\nsagal: right.\n\ntillman: yeah. i don't think players are intimidated by him. i think he knows he has a target on his back. so guys are like, yo, if he's the greatest, well, i want to go against the greatest to see how good i am.\n\nsagal: we heard that you played a game when your wife was extremely pregnant, and she might have gone into labor at any moment.\n\ntillman: yeah. so this was 2012. my wife was pregnant. i did an interview with laurence holmes. laurence holmes asked me the question, hey, what are you going to do if your wife goes into labor before the game? well, i said, well, hell, i'm missing the game. i'm going to go see my daughter be born.\n\nsagal: right.\n\ntillman: a lot of players get ridiculed about how they're not family men, and they're just athletes. but i felt like i was attacked because i made the smart choice, the family choice, the more important choice to go be with my family and watch the birth of my daughter...\n\nsagal: right.\n\ntillman: ...because i know women - it's hard. people think, aw, you just - you push and a baby comes out your vajayjay (ph). it ain't like that, though.\n\n(laughter)\n\ntillman: there are a lot of complications that can go wrong with it. you know, i wanted to make sure i was there for my baby.\n\nsagal: all of a sudden, i'm really interested in what you told those reporters about sex.\n\n(laughter)\n\nadam burke: also is there a cool nickname for that move?\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: what i read was that your wife...\n\ntillman: (unintelligible) the doctor don't catch it.\n\n(laughter)\n\nburke: yeah because you intercepted it.\n\nsagal: exactly. there's the doctor ready to catch...\n\ntillman: yeah. my wife's pretty good at it. she got...\n\nsagal: ...your baby. and all of a sudden, you cut it in, intercept.\n\n(laughter)\n\ntillman: my wife's pretty good at it. so after - literally, after the game, my wife and i - we go home. she changes and everything, gets her bag. and we go straight to the hospital at, like, midnight, 12:30. and i had my daughter, literally, the next day. i had my daughter that night...\n\nsagal: well, that's awesome, man.\n\ntillman: ...right after the game.\n\nsagal: how she's doing these days?\n\ntillman: yeah. come on, audience. that's when y'all supposed to go, aw.\n\namy dickinson: yeah. we love it. aw.\n\n(laughter, applause)\n\nsagal: he knows what he's doing. well, charles tillman, it is an absolute joy to talk to you. but we have asked you here to play a game this time we're calling...\n\nbill kurtis: now, that's what i call an offensive line.\n\nunidentified audience: ooh.\n\ntillman: ooh, ok.\n\nsagal: you know a lot about defense. you were very good at that. but what do you know about offensive lines? that is things people said or did that offended people. we're going to ask you about three offensive lines. get two questions right, you'll win a prize for one of our listeners. bill, who is charles tillman playing for?\n\nkurtis: diane schultz of austin, texas.\n\nsagal: all right - you ready to do this?\n\ntillman: all right - big austin - is she on the phone or...\n\nsagal: no, she's not on the phone. she's...\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: she's presumably - she is presumably listening at home, though, so, you know.\n\ntillman: i sound real stupid right now talking.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: all right. here's your first question, charles. during the early days of spaceflight, tv stations would often broadcast the astronauts live. and nasa was worried that one of their astronauts, in particular, would swear when the whole world was watching him. in order to prevent that, nasa did what? a, they told him that for safety's sake he had to wear a gag so he wouldn't, quote, inhale space...\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: ...b, through a careful psyops campaign, they convinced him that the most offensive swear he could possibly say was gadzooks; or c, they hypnotized him so he would hum any time he wanted to swear.\n\ntillman: i'm going to go with option charlie. i'm going to go with option c.\n\nsagal: option c - you're right. that's what they did.\n\n(soundbite of bell)\n\ndickinson: wow.\n\nsagal: nasa says - they admit they did this. they've never said what astronaut they did it to. but it is absolutely true that astronaut pete conrad, while he was on the moon in one of the apollo missions, weirdly hummed all the time so...\n\ndickinson: oh, i remember that.\n\nsagal: ...we have our suspicions.\n\ndickinson: yeah.\n\nsagal: all right, charles, second question - bbc radio goes to great lengths to keep its listeners safe from offensive content. they even put a decade-long ban on what song because they thought it was offensive?

jussie smollett 'took advantage of the pain and anger of racism,' police say\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption kamil krzaczynski/ap kamil krzaczynski/ap\n\nupdated at 10:45 a.m. et friday\n\nweeks after jussie smollett reported being assaulted in a potential hate crime, the empire actor has been released on bail after police questioned him for allegedly orchestrating the attack. chicago police superintendent eddie johnson said smollett faked the incident, paying two brothers about $3,500 to join a publicity stunt staged by smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary.\n\njussie smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career, johnson said at a news conference thursday after smollett's arrest.\n\ni'm left hanging my head and asking why, he continued. why would anyone, especially an african-american man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? how could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? how can an individual who's been embraced by the city of chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?\n\nthe cook county state's attorney's office has approved disorderly conduct charges against smollett for allegedly filing a false police report. if convicted of the felony, he could face up to three years in prison.\n\ntoggle caption chicago police department\n\nlater thursday, smollett appeared in court for a hearing during which his bond was set at $100,000. he has not publicly responded since his arrest, but his lawyer, jack prior, vowed thursday to push back against the allegations.\n\nthese are outrageous allegations, but my client vehemently denies all this, the attorney said. he is not a threat to society, and is not a flight risk. he came back yesterday from out of state, knowing charges were imminent. he surrendered this morning at 5 a.m. and wants nothing more than to clear his name.\n\nless than a day later, the executive producers behind empire announced that they plan to write smollett's character off the program for at least the end of its current season.\n\nthe events of the past few weeks have been incredibly emotional for all of us. jussie has been an important member of our empire family for the past five years and we care about him deeply. while these allegations are very disturbing, we are placing our trust in the legal system as the process plays out, said lee daniels, danny strong and their fellow producers, many of whom initially expressed their support for smollett in the days after the reported attack.\n\nwe are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show, they added, and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.\n\nthe arrest thursday represents something of a surreal twist to a story that first surfaced late last month, when chicago police revealed that smollett had reported being assaulted in a possible hate crime. the actor and musician, who is black and gay, said two individuals had accosted him with racist and homophobic slurs, beaten him and placed a rope around his neck before fleeing.\n\nhe also said that he had received a threatening letter using racist and homophobic language a week earlier — though police now say that, too, was falsified in an attempt to gain attention. when that didn't work, johnson explained, smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag chicago's reputation through the mud.\n\ndetective cmdr. edward wodnicki laid out an exhaustive timeline of how police arrived at this conclusion, saying they relied on security footage and tips from the community to identify the two brothers smollett allegedly enlisted. they had flown to nigeria shortly after the incident, but authorities were at chicago o'hare international airport waiting to detain them when they returned to the country on feb. 13.\n\nnational what the jussie smollett case means for the black lgbtq community what the jussie smollett case means for the black lgbtq community listen · 4:41 4:41\n\njohnson said it wasn't until the very end of their interrogation that the brothers decided to confess. it wasn't until the 47th hour of their 48-hour hold time — that we could legally hold them in custody — that it took a change, johnson said, adding that it was at that point that the brothers implicated smollett.\n\nthe brothers agreed to cooperate in the investigation, risa lanier, a prosecutor with the cook county state's attorney's office, explained during the bond hearing later. as more evidence — such as text messages, phone records, social media records, bank records, surveillance video and the receipt from the purchase of the rope — was obtained by investigators, this investigation shifted from a hate crime to disorderly conduct.\n\njohnson put it more bluntly.\n\nwhen we discovered the actual motive, quite frankly, it pissed everybody off — you know, because we have to invest valuable resources.\n\nand he expressed frustration not only at smollett's conduct but also at the amount of media attention it has received.\n\njohnson said he is also concerned about what smollett's alleged actions mean for future victims of hate crimes. my concern, he said, is that hate crimes will now publicly be met with a level of skepticism that previously didn't happen.\n\naccording to statistics recently published by the fbi, there was a 17 percent jump in hate crimes from 2016 to 2017. in a separate study, the human rights campaign reported that last year, 67 percent of 12,000 black lgbtq youth they surveyed had been verbally insulted because of their identity; 30 percent of those surveyed said they had been physically threatened.\n\nour laws exist to reflect and defend [our shared] values, and hate crimes will never be tolerated, chicago mayor rahm emanuel said in a statement released thursday. a single individual who put their perceived self-interest ahead of these shared principles will never trump chicago's collective spirit.
entering final primary stretch, clinton and sanders fight for a california win\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption john locher/ap john locher/ap\n\ncalifornia wasn't supposed to be close. in early polling, hillary clinton had a commanding lead, but that lead has all but vanished. a new survey from the public policy institute of california has clinton in a virtual tie with bernie sanders among democratic primary likely voters — 46 percent support clinton while 44 percent support sanders.\n\nthe golden state, which holds its presidential primary june 7, is a big, liberal, delegate-rich prize in what has been a long and increasingly bitter primary fight.\n\nand both candidates are fighting to win california. clinton wrapped up a four-day swing friday, while sanders is in the midst of a weeklong barnstorming of the state.\n\nsanders pointed out recent polls with some glee at a rally in santa monica earlier this week. she's looking very nervous lately, he said. and i don't want to get her more nervous, so if you promise not to tell her, we're going to win here in california.\n\nclinton, meanwhile, has been more focused on the general election than on the primary.\n\nsend a message, she said in san francisco. send a message to a demagogic, rhetorically divisive and dangerous candidate that when you think about the future you don't see donald trump's face up there.\n\nthe reality is, with all the superdelegates who have announced their support for clinton and her very large lead in pledged delegates, clinton will almost certainly clinch the nomination before the polls even close in california. so why is she competing so hard in the state?\n\nit's all about psychology, says jack pitney, a professor of government at claremont mckenna college.\n\nshe wants to end the primary campaign on a high note, and losing california would end it on a low note, he said. she wins the nomination, but loses the psychological warfare to bernie sanders.\n\nas clinton has traveled the state, the reception hasn't been entirely friendly.\n\nin salinas, a mix of what looked to be trump and sanders supporters gathered outside a clinton event. they chanted and waved signs about her speech transcripts, email server and relatively hawkish foreign policy views.\n\nclinton supporter john silva was puzzled by the protesters.\n\nyou're either with hillary or you're with trump, he said.\n\nsilva was wearing a black t-shirt with big white letters reading dump trump and admits he is more motivated against trump than he is for clinton. silva initially supported bernie sanders, but now he plans to vote for clinton in the primary.\n\nyou know, i wish it would end so that all the concentration would be against trump and the democratic party can unite against trump, silva said. that would be a big plus for the party, and i think for america.\n\nclinton needs more voters like silva if she's going to unite the party. she has started making that pitch in california.\n\nwe, sen. sanders and i, our supporters together, have so much more in common together than we do with donald trump, she said in san jose.\n\neven a california loss for clinton wouldn't really change the race, because she and sanders would very likely split the state's delegates, says mo elleithee, executive director of the georgetown institute of politics and public service. he worked on the clinton campaign in 2008.\n\ni think they would like to send a stronger message, he said, but at the end of the day the nomination process is about math much more than it is about momentum. math beats momentum every time.\n\nthat's probably not what sanders and his supporters will be saying heading into the july democratic convention if he is able to pull off a win in california. a golden state victory would be a big part of sanders argument to superdelegates that they should flip and support him.
objecting to electoral votes in congress recalls bitter moments in history\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tasos katopodis/getty images tasos katopodis/getty images\n\nmany in washington, d.c., are worried about civil unrest on wednesday, as the proud boys, a group labeled as extremists by the fbi, and other activists gather to protest just as congress begins to add its imprimatur to last month's electoral college vote.\n\nthat congressional vote will be the final formality leading to the inauguration of president-elect joe biden two weeks later.\n\nwhatever may happen in the streets wednesday, it will not prevent congress from performing its role under the constitution. but it will likely heighten public awareness of that role and how it is performed.\n\nand it may also heighten awareness of the role assigned to the vice president, who declares but does not determine the winner.\n\nthe formal processes of verifying and certifying the election results have gone forward on schedule since november, when biden defeated president trump. states certified their results, and the electoral college affirmed biden's win on dec. 14.\n\nbut the final days of trump's presidency have been fraught because he continues to deny the outcome and refuses to concede. without evidence, he has insisted the vote had to have been rigged, manipulated or misreported. just on saturday, in a lengthy call, he urged georgia's top election official to overturn the results in that state.\n\nmore than 60 lawsuits filed by trump and his allies challenging the results in swing states have been unsuccessful.\n\nover the weekend, judges snuffed out a particularly quixotic bid by republican rep. louie gohmert of texas and a group of trump supporters from arizona. in their lawsuit, they alleged that vice president pence has the power to accept or reject the electoral college results from individual states.\n\nnews of gohmert's suit, or its dismissal, may have been the first time many americans realized that the vice president has any role at all at the end of the presidential election process. but the constitution did create such a role, and it has been an uncomfortable one on numerous occasions.\n\na problem from the beginning\n\nthe writers of the constitution decided to have the reported and sealed ballots from the electors (who meet and vote in their respective states) delivered to the seat of government and entrusted to the president of the senate — who's also the vice president of the united states. the ballots remain sealed until the vice president opens them on the designated day and hands them to tellers to read out and tally.\n\ntoggle caption national archives/getty images\n\nsince as far back as 1796, when john adams was vice president, the job of declaring the winner of the presidential election has been at least potentially problematic. because when adams was opening the envelopes that year, the winner was himself. there had been some controversy over the paperwork from vermont, but adams' main rival, thomas jefferson, said he did not wish to make a fuss over the form of the vote when the substance was clear.\n\nso adams became president and jefferson, as the runner-up, became vice president. (that was how it worked initially, until the 12th amendment gave us something closer to the ticket system we have today.)\n\nfour years later, the roles were reversed. jefferson was vice president and was tasked with reading out the electors' ballots. this time there was a question about georgia's vote, the reporting of which was technically flawed. jefferson counted georgia, and that meant adams was no longer president.\n\nwas the soon-to-be-president jefferson out of line? there was no reason to think that georgia had not voted for jefferson, and the records show it in fact had done so. there was no competing slate of electors to consider. so excluding the report of georgia's electors because of a technical error would have simply disenfranchised the voters of that state. in the moment, jefferson had to make a judgment call, and he did so.\n\ndeeper waters\n\nthe 12th amendment tried to sort things out in 1804, but the electoral college system soon got into trouble again, first in the disputed election of 1824 (when no one had a majority in the electoral college) and again in the years before and after the civil war.\n\nafter the election of 1876, disputes arose in several southern states with two sets of electors claiming legitimacy. republicans of that day said the president of the senate (the vice president) could decide which slate was proper, but democrats protested.\n\nweeks of stalemate and negotiation went by before a special commission struck a deal. the republican rutherford b. hayes would be president and the democrat samuel tilden would concede, but in exchange, the republicans agreed to withdraw the federal troops that had supervised reconstruction in the readmitted southern states since the end of the civil war. thereafter, the economic and political gains that had been made by emancipated african americans in the south were largely lost — including access to the ballot.\n\ndissatisfaction with that election and its aftermath fueled debate over the presidential election process. finally, nearly a dozen years later, congress enacted the electoral count act of 1887. that law has long been criticized as containing contradictions and ambiguities — some of which still afflict the process in our time.\n\nnixon counts for kennedy\n\namong these is the continuing role of the vice president in opening the envelopes from the states that contain the reports of the electoral college voting. the vice president is to hand these to tellers from the house and senate in the presence of both chambers.\n\nif no one objects, this is a simple matter of reading, counting and announcing. it has typically been done in well under half an hour.\n\nnot everyone in congress even feels compelled to attend. and even the vice president has been away: in 1969, vice president hubert humphrey decided to attend the funeral of the first united nations secretary-general instead. that meant the senate president pro tempore, at the time georgia democrat richard russell, had the job of announcing that humphrey, who had been his party's nominee for president, had lost the election to republican richard nixon.\n\neight years earlier, nixon himself had been the vice president and had presided over the counting of the electoral votes by which he lost his white house bid to democrat john f. kennedy. in the course of that count, nixon was even called upon to choose which slate of electors to honor from the new state of hawaii. the first tabulation of votes in the islands had favored nixon, but a recount put kennedy ahead. so two slates were submitted, both with the governor's signature.\n\nhawaii had just three electoral votes at the time and those votes were not going to alter the outcome, so nixon could smile generously and allow them to be counted for the president-elect.\n\ngore gavels an end to challenges\n\ntoggle caption kenneth lambert/ap\n\none vivid example of a discomfited vice president was provided by al gore, who held that office on jan. 6, 2001, and had to read out his own electoral college defeat (271-266). if the vote of any one of george w. bush's 30 states had been reversed, gore would have been the winner.\n\nthe race had been decided by the supreme court in december 2000, when the justices put an end to five weeks of contested counting in florida (where the margin was just 537 votes). gore had won the popular vote nationwide by about half a million.\n\non that january day in 2001, a procession of democratic house members, including a dozen members of the congressional black caucus, protested during the joint session. they spoke of alleged voter suppression in communities of color and said the votes that were cast had been miscounted. they begged for at least one senator to join them so as to force a debate and a vote on the florida electors.\n\nbut gore, who had conceded weeks earlier and urged democrats in the senate not to prolong the process, gaveled the house members down again and again.\n\nat one point he pleaded for an end to it. when democratic rep. jesse jackson jr. became especially impassioned, gore stretched out his hands in a gesture of helplessness and said: i appreciate the gentleman from illinois, but hey ...\n\nwhen all was said and done, gore closed the session by saying: may god bless our new president and new vice president, and may god bless the united states of america.\n\nfour years later, the january 2005 joint session of congress heard the electoral college result from bush's reelection over democratic sen. john kerry of massachusetts (who did not attend). a house member of ohio, stephanie tubbs jones, rose to object to the count from her state. it mattered, because without ohio's electoral votes, bush would not have had the 270 needed to win.\n\njones said there had been irregularities and defects in her state, including a lack of voting sites in communities of color. she was supported by sen. barbara boxer, a democrat from california. the house and senate separated, debated for two hours and voted to accept the ohio count as reported. boxer's was the only vote to the contrary in the senate.\n\ntoggle caption mark wilson/getty images\n\nin 2017, several members objected to the acceptance of the electoral vote for trump. mr. president, i object because people are horrified, said rep. barbara lee, d-calif. the presiding officer was the vice president of that era, joe biden. he asked if the objection was being joined by a senator and was answered in the negative. in that case, biden said, it cannot be entertained. republicans in the chamber applauded.\n\nnot the gore approach\n\nin the present instance, trump has gone on goading supporters in congress to seek to overturn the election. and he has urged activists to come to washington on jan. 6 for a wild protest.\n\naccording to trump and key allies, their aim is not merely to express outrage but to alter the process going on inside the capitol beginning at 1 p.m. on wednesday. and their chances of doing that are, in effect, zero.\n\nthat may not matter to the throngs in the streets that day. but it will matter at the end of the day, at the beginning of the next and on inauguration day on jan. 20.\n\nthat is because there is no further determination left to make in this election. the role of congress is to accept and clarify what 50 states and the district of columbia have already determined.\n\nso what will transpire wednesday should not be regarded as suspenseful with regard to the continuation of the government. that is a done deal. what is still at stake, however, is the attitude of trump supporters toward the legitimacy of that done deal. as a consequence, there is also an opportunity for individuals in the republican party to show their fealty to trump and thereby endear themselves to his most loyal voters.\n\nrep. mo brooks, an alabama republican and outspoken trump loyalist, has said he will object to the results from swing states that went from trump in 2016 to biden in 2020. dozens of other republicans say they will do so as well. this will likely begin when the third state in the alphabetical roll call is reached. that will be arizona, where biden won by one of his slimmest margins.\n\nthe house objectors will need at least one senator to sign their written protests before they can force a debate and vote by the house and senate.\n\nbut one senator, first-termer josh hawley of missouri, has said he will object to the results being reported by at least one state. eleven other senate republicans — seven incumbents and four newly elected in november — said saturday they will cast protest votes as well unless congress sets up an emergency commission to review voting procedures before inauguration day.\n\nin doing so, they may cite the 1877 commission that chose hayes over tilden. but in that case, there were disputed slates of electors, and no one had a clear electoral college majority. in the current instance, neither of those problems exists.\n\npence has since indicated he's supportive of the electoral objections, but that does not change the limited nature of his role.\n\nwhat will happen\n\nwhat will happen instead is that the democrats, who control the house, will vote to accept the electoral college results as reported. in the senate, at least half a dozen republicans have said they will do the same, and they will be joined by all the senate democrats and both of its independents. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., acknowledged the electoral college outcome the day after it was made official and congratulated biden as the president-elect.\n\nmcconnell's judgment was endorsed by republican sen. john thune of south dakota. trump responded with a tweet promising a primary challenge to thune's next reelection bid.\n\nthat tweet offers at least a partial explanation for why so many republicans are willing to challenge the outcome of an election on the basis of nothing but their own candidate's insistence that he could not have lost.
life inside an emergency room during the coronavirus crisis\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\ndr. stephen anderson runs the emergency department at multicare auburn medical center just outside of seattle. he's treated some of the first patients to get sick from coronavirus in the united states. he's also now coordinating covid-19 responses throughout the country. we asked dr. anderson to document his experience for our outbreak diaries project. he says in 35 years of practicing medicine, he's never seen this much anxiety.\n\nstephen anderson: march 18 - driving home from work at night - it's been a long day. and i am emotionally exhausted - going home to an empty house because my wife is in a different part of the state. i kind of feel like a pariah with my family and friends who really want to wish me well but want to stay as far away from me as they can because - let's face it - i'm interacting with everybody they're worried about.\n\nfriday morning, the 20 - since my shift yesterday, i came back in to find the emergency department full. everyone in the icu at the moment is on a ventilator. not only did everything change as far as the severity in my hospital went today, somebody forgot to inform everyone today, please don't go to the emergency department to get a routine test for covid or because you've had two days of a cough and maybe a low-grade fever. those people need to self-isolate at home, take care of themselves and call their doctors if they're concerned. but when you come to the emergency department - number one, if you don't have covid, you're probably going to get exposed to it at a hospital now. number two, if you do have covid, you're going to expose other people who are very ill to it.\n\nmarch 21 on saturday evening - as i walked in the department, they screamed that there was a patient arriving from a cardiac arrest and that they needed me right away. i walked into the room, as the entire team that mobilizes for post-cardiac arrests do all the time. they were very efficient about organizing. and i looked around and realized only half the people had on covid protective gear because that's not what they were thinking. it's a great team. we just screamed, no. everybody in this room, we don't know what this cardiac arrest was caused by. i want everybody in covid gear. and when we did their resuscitation chest x-ray, sure enough, they had the classic signs of ground-glass appearance in multiple spots on their chest x-ray, which is literally classic for covid. and as i went out to talk to the family - found out that he had felt well enough to come home from the nursing home four days earlier. i have no hopes for this prognosis.\n\nmarch 26 - we admitted someone to the intensive care unit today who wasn't going to survive. but we had an intensive care unit bed - and getting them up there just offers the family together for the necessary things that go into grieving. but in the united states today, because this is a pandemic, hospitals are limiting one visitor at a time per day. and so the covid patients in the united states, which are dying at a rapider rate right now than anywhere else in the world, are dying alone. and i can tell you that, as a physician, some of the most rewarding moments i've had in my career are not necessarily the great save that i brought people back from the edge of death but when i helped people, when it was inevitable, to make that final journey with their families and loved ones around them. and the fact that that kind of grieving can't go on at the moment is even more tragic for patients, for families, for the nurses, for the doctors and those that care for them. unfortunately, it's not over. we're still going up. and so i'm still going back to work tomorrow.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that was dr. stephen anderson, er doctor at multicare auburn medical center in auburn, washington.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
transcript and video: president obama's interview with npr's nina totenberg\n\nnpr/ youtube\n\npresident obama spoke with npr legal affairs correspondent nina totenberg on thursday about why he selected merrick garland for the supreme court, why he thinks the judge deserves a hearing from the senate and the impact obama sees for the u.s. judiciary if that doesn't happen. nina writes about the conversation here; a full transcript is below.\n\nnina totenberg: mr. president, judge garland was runner-up twice before. so why now and not twice before?\n\npresident obama: well, i think merrick garland is one of the best judges, not just in the country, but of his generation. and it is a testimony to how good he is that, you know, he has cropped up as a potential supreme court justice for a very long time.\n\ni have always been a huge admirer of his. i've always felt that the way he approaches cases — the intellect, the care to follow precedent, the consensus building — were qualities that would make him an outstanding supreme court justice.\n\nthis moment in our history — a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol — i think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges.\n\nand so although i've always believed that he would make an outstanding supreme court justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that the supreme court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring — or at least increasing — the american people's confidence in our justice system.\n\ndid you talk to him about being a piñata, as sen. cornyn put it?\n\nwe had a very candid conversation. he's chief judge of the d.c. circuit, so i assume that he either reads the washington post or listens to npr, and i think had a pretty good sense of the posture that majority leader mcconnell took immediately after justice scalia's passing — the notion that the republican senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how.\n\ni'm sure that he is aware that, these days, massive advertising campaigns are mounted in opposition to candidates — not just for supreme court, but for appellate court judges.\n\nbut he's not — he's not a pol.\n\nno, he isn't. and so we discussed that, and i wanted to make sure that not only he felt comfortable with it, but his family felt comfortable with it. you know, for those of us who are more often in, you know, the scrum of politics, we're — we call folks like judge garland civilians. and so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they're mindful of.\n\nbut, you know, i think the way he described it — and i'll let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself — the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. he has loved being a judge for a very long time. he occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. he's got a great job.\n\nand he is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he's built in the legal community, that he is prepared i think to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that i might make. because he thinks it's important.\n\nand i think he is convinced that he can do a really good job, partly because he has relationships with the judges that are already on the court, and he's shown himself to be a consensus builder. and he believes, rightly, that we're at a time where the more consensus we can forge, the better off we're going to be.\n\nby the way, when did you offer him the job?\n\nover the weekend.\n\nwell, he's a very good actor because i had dinner with him sunday night [at a small charity event], and he looked like — he kept just was saying he wasn't going to get it. [laughter]\n\nwell, you know, i — i — that just shows his wisdom once again, because when it comes to things like getting — being nominated for the supreme court, it's probably always wise to not count your chickens before they're hatched.\n\nbut you just told me they were hatched. [laughter]\n\nwell, i'm not sure about that.\n\nin the heat of ...\n\ni might have called him right after dinner.\n\nin the heat of a presidential campaign, how do you keep this nomination front and center, alive and prominent in the face of republicans saying that they won't give your nominee a hearing? they clearly don't want to look rude, so they'll meet with him and tell him that they don't want to meet with him. [laughter]\n\nbut — but how do you keep it up there? when the supreme court, frankly — i've written more pieces in my life saying, this year it may be an issue, and then it never really is.\n\nthis year it may be an issue. in fact i think it is, in part because of the circus that has been the presidential campaign season so far.\n\ni think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in the presidential race. i think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in washington. i think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything.\n\nand when you then have — add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the senate saying, i won't meet with a nominee; i won't provide a nominee a hearing; i will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. that matters to people.\n\nand so, you're right, nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following supreme court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. but people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken — and it troubles them. and this becomes i think a symbol of a process that, if republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and presidents — whether they're democrats or republicans — are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the senate.\n\nat that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics. and that damages people's faith in the judiciary — because everybody understands that there's some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.\n\nand so i — we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two — it's not just democrats, but a sizable number of republicans who vote against me, have said this is — this can't be the way we run our government. and what's particularly ironic is the degree to which a number of people who say they're not going to nominate somebody, claim to be people who want fidelity to the constitution, respect for our founders' intentions.\n\nthere's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the supreme court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. george washington nominated a couple of supreme court justices in his last year. and obviously george washington had better poll numbers, i'm sure, than i did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, i think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.\n\nso we've reported that republican — leading republican senators sent a message sort of back-channel: ok, if you appoint merrick garland, we — we still will oppose him now, but we would confirm him in the lame-duck session after the election if there's a democratic president. did that play any role in your decision?\n\ni have not had conversations like that.\n\nno, i didn't say you had.\n\nwhat i have seen are the public statements of leading republicans like orrin hatch broadly complimenting judge garland as a brilliant, fair jurist, who should be confirmed to the supreme court.\n\nand ...\n\nso did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that republicans really do like him?\n\nwell, there's no doubt that what played a role, as i said earlier, was that, number one, i think he's the best person for the job. number two, i think he's a consensus builder. and the court would benefit from that at the moment.\n\njustice scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. but if you think about when the supreme court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. and judge garland, if you look at his work on the d.c. circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. and i think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by republicans.\n\nit certainly told me that this is somebody who is widely respected. and i said at the outset i would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base. i said i would play it straight — that my goal was to actually confirm a justice who i thought could do an outstanding job. and merrick garland fits that bill.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ariel zambelich/npr ariel zambelich/npr\n\nyour base, some of them quietly said, you know, everybody on that list, except merrick garland, was a minority or a woman; some of them were both. you picked the oldest person by far, the only white guy, and he's sort of a centrist liberal. he's not, you know, he's not going to — this is, this is our shot to really change the debate at the supreme court.\n\nwhat do you say to that — those folks?\n\nwell, first of all what i would say is take a look at the appointments i've made since i've been president of the united states. i've appointed as many african-americans to the circuit court as any president ever; more african-american women on the federal courts than any other president; more hispanics, more asian-americans, more lgbt judges than any president in history.\n\nwe actually now have a majority of women and/or minorities on the circuit courts, something that's never happened before. so my record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched.\n\nwhen it comes to the supreme court, i've appointed two women, one hispanic. and in each case, the good news is that i appointed the person who i absolutely thought was the best person for the job. in this case, merrick garland is the best person for the job.\n\nand i have confidence that — without knowing how he's going to decide any particular case — he's going to be somebody who understands the law, understands precedent, understands the constitution; and possesses the values that recognize the unique role of the court in preserving our rights, preserving our liberties; and making sure that the powerful get a fair hearing, but that the powerless also are heard and have access to justice.\n\nwhat do you ask these folks in your interviews? i mean, you can't say, so, what do you think of roe v. wade? that would be improper, right?\n\ni do not do that.\n\nso, i'm judge totenberg. i'm here for my interview. what are you going to ask me? what kinds of things do you ask?\n\nwell, sometimes i just ask about family and background and what made you want to be a judge. you learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is.\n\nand when you hear judge garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the oklahoma city bombing — you get a sense of who that person is. and i spent a lot of time on that.\n\nwith respect to judicial philosophy, i have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so i don't need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases — because i can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and i have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases.\n\none thing i, i do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the constitution might be ambiguous. what do they do to — to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem today? you know, so you'll get some sense of their judicial philosophy.\n\nbut most of the time, by the time they get to me, you know, they've probably gone through a confirmation process before. and they have a pretty good sense of what they can talk about and what they shouldn't talk about.\n\nlet me conclude by asking you sort of a devil's advocate question.\n\nsure.\n\nyou've said that neither party comes to this process clean.\n\nit's absolutely true.\n\nand you voted to not end debate on the alito nomination. and if i understood you correctly at your press conference, what i thought i heard you say was, you know, i knew that it was a meaningless vote. you got a pass from the leadership. you can do this.\n\nbut can you blame the republicans who look at this nomination and say, there's going to be a shift in the court if we approve this nominee, and we don't like that shift in the court. so can you really blame them for trying to prevent a significant shift in the court, hoping that they'll win the presidential nomination [sic]. and if the shoe were on the other foot, wouldn't the democrats do the same? they called — they're all already calling it the biden rule.\n\nwell, a couple of things. first of all, this speech that they continually quote from joe biden when he was on the judiciary committee — if you actually read the speech, number one, he was speaking hypothetically. [cellphone rings]\n\noh, jesus. oops.\n\nshould we start that one over? [laughter]\n\nyeah, let's do that.\n\nwow, nina. you're supposed to turn off your phone.\n\ni'm not — i'm supposed to be a pro.\n\ncome on.\n\ncome on. [laughter]\n\nthe, uh ...\n\nit's the office. [laughter]\n\ni'm assuming you can just splice the question and i'll just answer it, so nina doesn't have to answer — ask it again.\n\nyeah.\n\nwell, first of all, if you look at what joe biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a supreme court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.\n\nwell, you know what? that's exactly what i've done. and so there's no contradiction between what i'm doing and what joe biden suggested a president in my circumstances should do.\n\nnumber two, with respect to my actions when i was a junior senator, you will recall that i never said that a nominee should not get a hearing. i never said that a nominee should not get a vote. and what i also said at the time was that i was concerned about some of judge alito's views that i considered more troubling. but in the case of merrick garland, we haven't seen a substantive argument against his jurisprudence.\n\nthis is just raw politics. we don't want somebody who's been nominated by a democrat — a claim that i would have never made at the time.\n\nnow what is true, nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. justice scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court. and so i understand the politics that republican senators are dealing with, and the price they would pay if in fact they confirmed a nominee.\n\nhere's the problem we have, though: if in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, we've got another excuse for not confirming a democratic president's nominee?\n\nand at that point the process has broken down. democrats have not been blameless in this process. you cannot point to me a circumstance in which democrats have left a seat open when a republican president was in office simply because they didn't like the possibility that it would change the makeup of the court.\n\njustice kennedy was confirmed by ronald reagan, and i'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. but ultimately, he was confirmed. and he was confirmed in the last year of president reagan's office. so we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the supreme court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the supreme court, but the integrity of the senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.\n\nand my simple pitch to them is, be fair — not to ignore politics. i'm not demanding that republicans vote for merrick garland, but do not stop the process in its tracks — because if you do, then the ever-escalating, ever-worsening problems behind not just judicial nominees, but nominations generally, are going to continue to make our government more and more dysfunctional. and at some point, it's got to stop.\n\na good place for it to stop is when we're talking about a supreme court seat, and we have an impeccably qualified candidate who the republicans themselves have acknowledged is deserving of being on the court.\n\nare you taking this on the road?\n\nwell, you know, i'm going to make the case — i'm going to make the case for a fair process. give judge garland a hearing; give him a vote. and look at the qualities of the man. that's what the american people expect. and, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that i've heard from mitch mcconnell and some other republicans is this notion that the american people should decide — we should let the american people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.\n\nwell in fact, the american people did decide, back in 2012 when they elected me president of the united states with sufficient electoral votes. and they also decided that the republicans would be in the majority. they didn't say, we're going to decide that you're in charge for three years, and then in the last year you all take a break. they said, no, you're the president for four years, and mr. mcconnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the senate.\n\nso the american people already have decided. they've already weighed in. they will have another opportunity to weigh in, so that if there is another vacancy that comes up, the next president will fill that vacancy.\n\nthe bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. the real argument is the one that you made, nina, which is that they don't want a democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a democrat to fill the seat.\n\nbut one of the things that's broken down in our politics is a recognition that you don't always get your way 100 percent of the time. and sometimes in the integrity of the institution and the process and governance, and the interests of the american people actually matter more than your short-term politics. they actually matter more than doing what is politically expedient. and there have been a number of times where, as president of the united states, i've had to do things that i knew were bad politics but i understood were important to the country or important to the institution of the presidency.\n\nand i would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on earth.\n\nmr. president, thank you so much for your time. we appreciate it.\n\ni enjoyed it, nina. thank you.
'you have dark skin and you are beautiful': the long fight against skin bleaching\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nancy rosenbaum for npr nancy rosenbaum for npr\n\namira adawe has just arrived at a somali-american community radio station in minneapolis where she hosts a weekly call-in show called beauty-wellness talk. after peeling off her winter jacket, adawe slides a pair of headphones over her crown of dark, short curls. hello? as-salaam-alaikum, she says into the foam mouth of her studio microphone. an anonymous stream of listeners starts calling in to confide about a subject that is deeply personal and also taboo — skin bleaching.\n\nadawe is a minnesota-based public health researcher and educator who works as a manager in gov. mark dayton's children's cabinet. in 2011, while a graduate student and health educator with st. paul-ramsey county public health, adawe proposed a study to investigate how somali women use skin bleaching creams in their daily lives. growing up in mogadishu and minneapolis, adawe knew that skin lightening was widespread in her community.\n\na lot of it ties to colonization, adawe says. certain skin colors were more accepted in the society. but through the years, it became so embedded in the culture to where it's become normal. if you're light-skinned, you're more accepted, she says.\n\nshe had trouble finding women who were willing to be interviewed. adawe says there's a stigma around admitting to skin bleaching. women don't want other women talking about them. they want to pretend that this is their natural color, she says.\n\nadawe suspected that the fast-acting creams contained toxic chemicals, and she was right to be suspicious. out of 27 different creams tested by minnesota researchers as part of adawe's study, 11 contained mercury levels ranging from 4.08 up to 33,000 parts per million (ppm). (the u.s. food and drug administration only allows mercury in amounts of less than one part per million in most cosmetics.)\n\nthe fda classifies skin whitening creams as both a cosmetic and a drug. according to fda spokesperson peter cassell, the use of mercury in skin-bleaching preparations and other cosmetics, with few exceptions has been prohibited in the u.s. since 1973.\n\nthe fda has been aware of mercury as a potential allergen, skin irritant and neurotoxin for decades, cassell says.\n\nthe seven somali women adawe interviewed for her study reported mixing several different creams into one concoction and storing it in the refrigerator. some slathered the cream mixture over their bodies multiple times a day, even while pregnant or breastfeeding. these findings alarmed adawe. the possibility that children or developing babies could potentially ingest mercury through breast milk or contaminated food or water was especially concerning.\n\nskin bleaching products can also contain steroids, which thin the skin, as well as hydroquinone, a suspected carcinogen that is banned in some countries.\n\nthat is a really huge public health issue. that mercury vapor alone can expose everybody in the home, even people who visit. that was really shocking to me, adawe says.\n\ndespite fda regulations, toxic skin lightening creams are accessible in the united states. the products get smuggled past borders through personal luggage and can be found in ethnic markets and also online.\n\na global market\n\nglobally, skin bleaching is a multibillion-dollar business. according to a 2017 market research study by global industry analysts, the market for skin lightening products is anticipated to exceed $31 billion by 2024, with the asia-pacific region representing the fastest-growing market.\n\nadawe was surprised to learn that skin bleaching is such a global phenomenon. i was so focused in the somali community and other african communities that i didn't know this was happening in other places, she says.\n\nseventy-seven percent of women in nigeria use skin lighteners, more than anywhere else in the world, the world health organization reported in 2011. in 2004, nearly 40 percent of women surveyed in china, malaysia, the philippines and south korea reported using use skin lighteners, and in india, 61 percent of the dermatological market is comprised of skin lightening products, according to the same who report.\n\nas adawe continued to sound an alarm about skin bleaching, she realized that warning people about the health risks of toxic chemicals wasn't necessarily enough to change behaviors. so long as the belief that lighter skin is inherently preferable persisted, women would likely keep bleaching, she thought. so she decided to tackle the issue from another direction.\n\nradio outreach\n\nadawe launched her radio show, beauty-wellness talk, in november 2017. it's a platform where the somali community can talk openly about skin lightening without fear of being outed or stigmatized. from the beginning, adawe made it clear that listeners could call in anonymously.\n\non a recent wintry saturday afternoon, adawe's in-studio radio guest is hibat sharif, an educator and outreach worker with st. paul-ramsey county public health. they're discussing how parents can build healthy self-esteem in their children, especially girls.\n\nwe're african, we're somali, we have dark skin, says sharif in a mix of somali and english. our skin is melanated. it provides us with a lot of benefits. why are we telling our girls: you'd look so much better if you were lighter? it's important not to put those toxic stereotypes in your child's head.\n\nsharif cautions listeners about words that reinforce harmful stereotypes, such as cadey, a somali expression of endearment.\n\nquestioning word choices\n\nthat word is really heavy, explains salma ali, 19, a somali-american college student who grew up in the twin cities area. her friend, yusra abdi, also 19, agrees.\n\nit means whitey. like white girl, abdi says. you will never hear anybody say madoowey, which is 'darky.' if anything, that would be an insult in the somali language.\n\ncolorism is personal for both abdi and ali, who describe themselves as dark-skinned. growing up, if somebody in my family was mad at me, they'd call me koor madow, which means, 'hey darker-skinned,'  explains ali. and it was an insult, she adds.\n\nfamily members pressured ali and abdi to use lightening creams. when abdi was in middle school, her mother gave her a lightening gel to help with acne scars. after about a month, she noticed her complexion had lightened and her acne marks had worsened. she decided to stop.\n\nwhen women use these products, it comes from a very deeply ingrained place of insecurity, ali says. it's because of what society pushes on us to believe. across all cultures, darker-skinned people have self-esteem issues.\n\nboth ali and abdi say that they've seen somali women obfuscate their use of skin lightening products by describing the practice as cleaning their skin or helping it to glow.\n\ni've had my aunts come up to me telling me, 'salma you're not ugly, it's just that your skin is just a little dirty. you need to clean it up. i got some products from china. i'mma hook you up.' i'm like, 'how is my skin dirty? i'm taking care of myself.' but because of the fact that i have darker skin, i'm seen as ugly. and that's just part of the way we've all been socialized.\n\nchanging attitudes\n\nadawe wants to disrupt that socialization, but changing ingrained behaviors and perceptions takes time. she sees medical providers as key partners in actualizing systemic change. over the past six and a half years, adawe says she and her colleagues have trained more than 100 clinic systems, with a focus on pediatric care.\n\nshe advises doctors and nurses not to ask patients about skin bleaching directly, but instead to probe slowly and with sensitivity about the different lotions women use. nurses who conduct home visits with pregnant women can play an especially important role since they build a relationship with mothers over time and can see if skin lightening products are being kept in the home.\n\non a thursday afternoon in mid-february, sharif, the outreach worker, stands in front of a class of somali, hmong, nepalese and karen adult students and their translators. the students are all new arrivals to the united states. the class hums with a staccato melody of different languages.\n\nthe no. 1 thing you can do is to stop using these products, sharif tells the students in english and somali. the biggest takeaway from this presentation is that every shade is beautiful, she says.\n\na somali man in the class says it's been ingrained in him to gravitate toward lighter-skinned women.\n\nsharif laughs and says, the change needs to start with you. it really does.\n\nshe asks him if he has dark-skinned daughters, and the man says he does.\n\nwhat does that say to your daughter? sharif says when reflecting on the exchange after class. do you want a guy to treat your daughter that way where he tells her she's not beautiful because she's dark?\n\nyou have dark skin and you are beautiful\n\nsalma ali says she had low self-esteem when she was younger. it's something she thinks a lot of darker-skinned young women experience. things shifted in high school when she started reading books by black women writers and found inspiration in seeing black women actors play strong leading roles on television.\n\nsocial media helped ali and abdi to find affirming messages about black beauty as well. both of them are fans of black women beauty vloggers like jackie aina and alyssa forever whose youtube channels attract millions of views. they credit rihanna for leading the way with releasing a makeup line with many different shades for darker-skinned women.\n\nit can really change the way you think about yourself and the way you see the world, says ali about social media. i really do have hope for this next generation of darker-skinned women who want to be represented. who want to be uplifted and celebrated for our skin. you have dark skin and you are beautiful. i really want that to be a cultural norm, she says.\n\nadawe says that after working on this issue for nearly seven years, she's starting to see hints of change. more people are talking, disagreeing and questioning colorism out in the open. all of that didn't exist before, she says. all of that helps.\n\nadawe is now writing a curriculum for teachers. her next step is to take the conversation into the schools.\n\nthis is going to need systemic change, says ali, who is studying sociology with a focus in health care and a minor in public health and neuroscience at the university of minnesota. i feel like it's something that's so within us that it's going to take a while. it's going to take some work.
former republican arizona sen. jeff flake believes gop will shed trumpism\n\nmichel martin, host:\n\nit's 11 days before the end of this president's scheduled term in office - a time when the national focus should be on what comes next under a new president. but after donald trump incited a mob to storm the united states capitol this week, threatening the peaceful transition of power, congressional democrats are preparing the groundwork for a second impeachment of president trump, an extraordinary step that follows an extraordinary week in u.s. history.\n\non the republican side, some of the president's former aides and allies have stepped aside in the wake of the violence he instigated. but many continue to support him, especially republican officeholders who continue to object to the november election results even after they were forced into safe rooms to escape the mob.\n\nso we'll start there. where does all this leave the republican party moving forward as the country considers the repercussions of what happened this week? for that, we're joined now by former republican senator jeff flake of arizona.\n\nsenator flake, thank you so much for speaking with us once again.\n\njeff flake: thanks for having me on.\n\nmartin: first, i just find myself asking - as a person who served in those halls, who sat at those desks, what went through your mind as you saw what was happening?\n\nflake: well, it was awful - just awful. you know, those halls, those chambers are really sacred to anybody who's served there. and to see them desecrated like this and to see people killed - it was just - i can't imagine being there. it took me back to, you know, the baseball shooting where i was on the field. or 10 years ago, gabby giffords was shot - and just kind of reliving some of these things. but i can't imagine what it would have been like to see your own citizens, some of your own constituents, doing this.\n\nmartin: so the question now becomes, what should happen now? as we discussed, the - some of the democratic leaders are saying that the president should step aside, that if he refuses to step aside, that the 25th amendment should be invoked, where vice president pence would take office, at least for the next few days. and failing that, a second impeachment should occur. so the question is, what should happen now, in your opinion?\n\nflake: well, obviously, we all hope that he would step aside. i hoped that he hadn't run in the first place, obviously, and he should step aside, given what he's done.\n\nmartin: seems unlikely. seems unlikely.\n\nflake: no, he won't. the 25th amendment isn't going to be invoked. and so impeachment, i guess, is the question. i would rather not see that happen. it's not going - there will be no conviction in the senate. the senate isn't returning until the 19th. it would take unanimous consent to return before then. it's not going to happen. and so i fear that the president would treat a second impeachment as a badge of honor, much like he did the first one. and i just don't think that that is a fitting punishment. i think to just see him go away (laughter) is the best we can do.\n\nmartin: so let's talk more broadly about the party because the fact of the matter is that president trump could not have done what he has done without the support of others. you declined to run for reelection in 2018, in part because you - what you've described as your party's embrace of a demagogue, meaning president trump. what has happened to the republican party, in your view? what has caused this?\n\nflake: that's what's so painful. you know, i think we all knew - or anybody who paid attention to who the president is - and he was always going to do what he was going to do. but to have so many of my colleagues, now former colleagues, amplify his message, for example, on the election - that it was somehow fraudulent and rigged - that's what's been painful, and to see that parroted, you know, on social media via the trump base.\n\nand, you know, they're not going away anytime soon. but i think that it will be significantly diminished, that element who, you know, were big backers of the president. if this event - if there is ever a silver lining - it's tough to see with such a horrible event - but i think that it will cause the republican party to move away from trumpism more quickly. it has to happen at some point. there's no there there with trumpism.\n\nmartin: so why do you say that? i guess i have - there's two - there are two parts to that question. first of all, why did this happen to begin with? and what convinces you that this has weakened its hold on the party?\n\ni mean, the party is led by people who are either still loyal to president trump, like the newly reelected chairwoman of the republican national committee, ronna mcdaniel, or senator mitch mcconnell, also newly reelected, who has put very little distance between himself and the president, and that only extremely recently? so the question is, how did this happen? and why do you think it will change?\n\nflake: you know, it runs its course after a while. and it has. if you look across the country, overall, republicans did ok down-ballot. but i think that there was a rejection of trump and trumpism. he lost by 7 million votes across the country and lost in swing states. so there has been a change. and i think that it'll be quickened by the events of the past week.\n\nmartin: as a person who's been a republican for - what? - your entire adult life, what would be your message to your fellow republicans, particularly people who are serving in more local positions, and they're watching all this, and they're thinking, what do i do? what would you say to them?\n\nflake: well, yeah, and it's even deeper than that. college, you know, republicans is always looking to enter the party as poor kids. you know, what choices do they have? i remain a republican and will because i believe that the parties that have - or the principles that have animated the party for generations - limited government, economic freedom, individual responsibility, strong american leadership - if we return to these principles, we can be a relevant, rational majority party in many states and win national elections.\n\nbut if we continue down this nativist road, this kind of personality cult kind of experience, we're not going to get there.\n\nmartin: before we let you go, senator, on wednesday, after the storming of the capitol, you wrote on twitter, today was an awful day, but tomorrow will be better. and on january 20, we will inaugurate a new president. our best days are ahead. what makes you so sure?\n\nflake: when i entered the senate on the first evening there, we were taken to the national archives and were able to view in the - what's called the legislative vaults some of the artifacts of history and, you know, the revolutionary war, the civil war, women's suffrage, the civil rights period. and i thought at that time, man, this really brings it home - the difficult things that we have been through. and they have been monumental, and we got through them, and we've become a better country.\n\nwe'll get through this. this is a particularly dark time. but we always say in this country, our best days are ahead. we mean it. it's always been true.\n\nmartin: do you think you'll go to the inauguration?\n\nflake: i will.\n\nmartin: ok.\n\nflake: i'll be there.\n\nmartin: that was former u.s. senator jeff flake of arizona sharing his thoughts about recent events and the future of the republican party.\n\nsenator, thank you so much for speaking with us today.\n\nflake: thanks for having me on.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
pelosi is narrowly reelected speaker\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption erin scott/pool/afp via getty images erin scott/pool/afp via getty images\n\nupdated at 5:51 p.m. et\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., was narrowly reelected leader of the chamber on sunday, continuing her control of the democratic majority at a time of questions about the path ahead for congress and who may take the gavel after her.\n\npelosi garnered 216 votes sunday, seven more than the 209 for house republican leader kevin mccarthy of california.\n\nfive house democrats did not vote for pelosi. three voted present, while maine rep. jared golden cast a ballot for illinois sen. tammy duckworth and pennsylvania rep. conor lamb voted for new york rep. hakeem jeffries.\n\nin remarks, pelosi told her fellow members that they begin the new congress during a time of extraordinary difficulty. after the last congress passed a relief package in its waning days, she stressed that lawmakers' most urgent priority will continue to be defeating the coronavirus.\n\npelosi also noted the diversity of the 117th congress.\n\nit gives me great pride, she said, to serve as speaker of the most diverse house in american history, with a record-shattering 122 women, 100 years after women won the right to vote.\n\na more divided house\n\ndemocrats have a tighter majority after the november election, which meant there was little room for dissent for pelosi to be reelected.\n\npelosi, a california democrat, is 80 and has served in congress for 33 years. she hinted last year that this might be her final term as the leader of the house. she has no clear heir apparent, and her closest deputies, rep. steny hoyer of maryland and rep. jim clyburn of south carolina, are 81 and 80, respectively.\n\npelosi has sought to knit together a caucus divided between relatively moderate suburban members and much more liberal urban ones. although democrats have preserved their majority, the speaker and her lieutenants presided over a net loss of seats in the 2020 election.\n\ndemocrats have groused among themselves about the causes of the losses in 2020. one complaint has been that the party's failure to repudiate issues said to be perceived by voters as extreme, such as defund the police, hurt it with the moderate voters it sought amid the broader presidential election.\n\nthe most liberal members, including new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, reject the idea that democrats' messaging tacked too far left.\n\nmanaging the tension between the two sides will be a big challenge as pelosi continues her stewardship of the majority.\n\nthe game has changed\n\nmuch of the speaker's workload will shift, however, from resisting a republican administration to helping advance the goals of her fellow democrat, president-elect joe biden. pelosi likely will work every opportunity available to help pass biden's agenda, including more coronavirus relief legislation.\n\nbut the immediate focus in washington and national politics has shifted to the senate, control of which is up for grabs depending on the outcome of tuesday's runoff elections in georgia. if republicans preserve their majority in the upper chamber, they'll likely prevent biden and pelosi from achieving many of their aims.\n\nalthough it is seen as a less likely outcome, if democrats win the georgia races and give the party a slim majority in the senate, the whole ballgame will change, and pelosi will march into her new term as speaker with far greater power.
'you better own this': how rami malek came to embody freddie mercury\n\nno one can sing like freddie mercury, malek told fresh air in november 2018. the actor has been nominated for an academy award for playing queen's lead singer in the biopic bohemian rhapsody.\n\ndave davies, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm dave davies in for terry gross. the academy awards ceremony is sunday. today we continue our series of interviews with oscar nominees. we begin with actor rami malek, who's up for best actor in the film bohemian rhapsody, playing freddie mercury of the band queen. the film's also nominated for best picture, best sound editing and sound mixing. the title of the film comes from the title of one of their most famous songs.\n\n(soundbite of song, bohemian rhapsody)\n\nqueen: (singing) mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger. now he's dead. mama, life had just begun. but now i've gone and thrown it all away. mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry. if i'm not back again this time tomorrow, carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.\n\ndavies: queen's biggest hits were in the '70s and early '80s, among them bohemian rhapsody, we will rock you, we are the champions and another one bites the dust. but those records have endured beyond their time on the charts. we will rock you and we are the champions became popular chants at stadium sports events. freddie mercury was a very theatrical performer with a big personality. he died of complications related to aids in 1991.\n\nrami malek's performance as freddie mercury is a big contrast to his starring role in the tv series mr. robot as a withdrawn hacker with social anxiety disorder. terry spoke with rami malek in november. let's start with a scene from bohemian rhapsody. it's 1975, and freddie mercury and the members of queen are in the office of a record executive, played by mike myers, talking about the record they're about to release. freddie mercury speaks first.\n\n(soundbite of film, bohemian rhapsody)\n\nrami malek: (as freddie mercury) we'll call the album a night at the opera.\n\nmike myers: (as ray foster) are you aware that no one actually likes opera?\n\ntom hollander: (as jim beach) i like opera.\n\nmyers: (as ray foster) do you?\n\naidan gillen: (as john reid) i do.\n\nmalek: (as freddie mercury) don't misunderstand, darling. it's a rock 'n' roll record with the scale of opera, the pathos of greek tragedy, the wit of shakespeare, the unbridled joy of musical theatre. it's a musical experience rather than just another record - something for everyone, something that will make people feel belongs to them. we'll mix genres. we'll cross boundaries. we'll speak in bloody tongues if we want to.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nterry gross, byline: rami malek, welcome to fresh air. it's so much fun to watch you as freddie mercury. was singing part of your audition?\n\nmalek: it ended up being part of that audition. i warned them i was not a singer. i told them i don't play the piano. what i do when i'm out on the dance floor could be considered something having to do with rhythm but probably...\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\nmalek: ...not.\n\ngross: yeah. all the music credits in the movie are attributed to queen. so you sang as you were filming, but the music that we're hearing is actually freddie mercury and queen.\n\nmalek: it's actually an amalgamation. the large majority of it is freddie mercury. and in order to sync it up properly, they used bits of my voice in the beginning. it will lead in with my voice and then pick up for the majority using freddie mercury's voice - tops and tails, as you call it. it's very difficult to get my voice up to those high notes. at some point, my voice breaks. and it breaks pretty quickly when i'm trying to ascend what freddie mercury can do.\n\ngross: there's actually a scene where you're at the piano singing a sketch of bohemian rhapsody, and your voice breaks. is any of that you?\n\nmalek: yeah. there are parts that are me. i think the parts that break, yes, that would be considered (laughter) rami malek.\n\ngross: (laughter) should we just hear that bit? (laughter).\n\nmalek: sure.\n\ngross: ok. let us know if you can tell which part is you, ok?\n\nmalek: you got it.\n\n(soundbite of film, bohemian rhapsody)\n\nmalek: (as freddie mercury, singing) goodbye, everybody. i've got to go, got to leave you all behind and face the truth. mama, ooh, i don't want to die. i sometimes wish i'd never been born at all.\n\ngross: ok. so the final note...\n\nmalek: yeah.\n\ngross: his or yours - voice breaks - what are we hearing?\n\nmalek: gosh. the majority of that is, obviously, freddie mercury. but somehow, they've found a way to put me in there. and i can't - i really can't tell you. it feels so seamless to me. and that's, i think, one of the greatest aspects of this film is even i watch it and i cannot tell.\n\ngross: bohemian rhapsody is bookended by a - basically, like, a reproduction of the famous queen performance at live aid. that was this huge benefit concert in 1985 for the benefit of people suffering from the famine in ethiopia. and your performance - there were multiple stages for this. the queen - i said your performance. the queen performance was in wembley stadium in london to an audience of 72,000 people. so you, as freddie mercury, had to reproduce that performance, which is considered one of the great performances in rock history.\n\nso i'm sure you must have studied it move by move, including learning freddie mercury's microphone technique because he'd, basically, be handed the mic on the stand but not on the bass. so it was just, like, the pole with the mic on it. and then he'd use that as a prop, you know, strutting around on stage and using it as a - you know, strumming it like it was a guitar, putting it across his groin as if it were a large phallus, you know, all the rock tricks.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: so talk to us about, like, studying, freddie mercury during the live aid concert and also, like, how he used the microphone.\n\nmalek: well, i walked around london for about two months with this half mic. and i think now...\n\ngross: wait. now i'm going to stop you. when you say half mic, does that mean, like, the pole with the mic on it? like the...\n\nmalek: correct, yeah.\n\ngross: you walked around with the mic on it.\n\nmalek: yeah, i walked around with the mic attached to it. i just never wanted to lose focus of what i was doing. and that was a very constant reminder. sometimes, i would tuck the microphone into my backpack. but otherwise, you just look like you're walking around with a piece of metal. and that's quite scary these days.\n\ngross: yes, it looks like a weapon.\n\nmalek: exactly. so i kept the mic on it just to remind people, hey, i'm not out to hurt anyone. it was the first thing we shot - live aid - day one. we came out, and it was - it's that massive crane shot that goes through the audience and comes right up around the piano and opens to freddie mercury - myself, playing him - singing bohemian rhapsody.\n\nand talk about a baptism by fire. i never worked that hard in my life on one particular piece of filming. i spent hours with a movement teacher named polly bennett. i always wanted to keep it very spontaneous but, at the same time, honor this fantastic performance that he and queen gave.\n\ndavies: terry gross speaking with rami malek, who stars as freddie mercury in the film bohemian rhapsody. he's up for an oscar for best actor. more after a break - this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of queen's killer queen)\n\ndavies: this is fresh air. let's get back to terry's interview with rami malek, who's nominated for an academy award for his role as freddie mercury in the film bohemian rhapsody.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: another thing we should mention is your teeth. he had - what? - four extra teeth in his upper mouth. and he had, you know, very buck teeth as a result. and so you had fake teeth that you used, made for you by a famous hollywood prosthetic teeth designer.\n\nwhat was it like for you to wear them? like, how did it change your feeling of your mouth and your ability to talk and sing? - because, like, not only did you have to sing for the performance, even though they weren't necessarily going to use your voice, you still had to sing. so you're doing something you're not used to doing - singing. and you're doing it with teeth that aren't even yours.\n\nmalek: yes. the teeth were difficult to get used to. initially, i put them in my mouth a year prior to shooting and immediately felt insecure. i felt like i was on my back foot in a way. i didn't feel like myself, which did help me quite a bit. but it was a feeling of insecurity that i had to cover them up as well. and i'd been watching so much footage of him. you see him covering up his teeth so often that i thought, how am i ever going to do that?\n\nwell, as soon as those teeth went in, it was second nature. i found myself covering them up so often my lips would dry up, so i found myself licking my lips as he did. but another thing happened. i started to compensate physically by holding my posture better, elongating my body, sitting up very straight. and that's something you also see him do. and i don't know if that was something that affected him or he was born with the elegance that he has. but it did give me a way into understanding a little bit more about him.\n\nhis name is originally farrokh bulsara, and he wasn't even called that as a kid. a very strong set of buck teeth - and most of the kids in school called him buckie (ph). so you see this young man who travels from zanzibar and goes to a boarding school called st. peter's in india. he travels there on a ship. he feels very, i think, removed and isolated. and when he comes back to zanzibar, his country is in the midst of a revolution. they have to immigrate to london. and he's a young man at that point, feels like a fish out of water in the 1970s, trying to identify himself sexually as well. i mean, so much stands in the way of this man becoming who he is.\n\nthere is something burning inside of him - this dream that he wants to see realized, this music that is so vibrant and yearning to exist outside of him. and everything stands in his way. but when he gets out on a stage, he holds everyone's attention and says, hey. i may have been an outcast and a misfit. and i may feel like i don't belong. but here on this stage, we belong together. i had to demystify him somehow. i thought to myself, here's a young man, immigrated to a country, defied all obstacles to do what he loved. and that was one thing that i could understand. not to compare myself to him in any way, shape or form, but i am a first-generation american. my family came from egypt and sought a better life for their children in the u.s. and, you know, obviously, like so many people, they would have loved for us to be doctors and lawyers. my sister is a doctor, so she fulfilled that aspect. but it was very difficult to convince anyone that i wanted to do this and that i could do this.\n\ngross: did you feel like you were going to be letting them down if you failed? that they came here - and often with immigrants, the idea is it's for their children. so if you failed as an actor, would you have been letting them down? did you feel guilty for even trying for an acting career?\n\nmalek: it's a good question. yeah. i did feel a bit guilty. and the only way to compensate for that was just to give it my all. i was in my apartment that we were living in - four of us in a two-bedroom apartment. and i had a stack of manila envelopes. and every morning, i would get up and put my head shot and resume in the manila envelopes. and i remember my father one day standing next to my mom saying, you have a very tenacious son. and i don't think that he knows that i heard him, but i heard that. and it gave me that extra boost i needed to just keep going. and i would take those manila envelopes - i was delivering pizza - i would put them - glue them or tape them to every pizza box i would send out. i would keep them behind the register of the fast-food restaurant i would be working at. and if anyone even producorial came in, they were getting a head shot and resume in their to-go bag.\n\ngross: did you deliver pizzas to, like, famous producers or directors?\n\nmalek: i did get an audition out of it once, and i thought...\n\ngross: seriously? really?\n\nmalek: i did. yeah, i did. it was for a commercial and still kept in touch with that person who gave me the audition.\n\ngross: did you get the commercial?\n\nmalek: i did not.\n\ngross: what was it for?\n\nmalek: it was for m&m's.\n\ngross: wow.\n\nmalek: i will tell you this. one day, i did get a call. i got a call from mara casey, who was a casting director for the gilmore girls. and she asked to speak with rami malek's agent, and i said, speaking. and she said, well, can i talk to - about rami malek coming in for a role on the gilmore girls? and i said, yeah. and she said, and who am i speaking with? i said, this is he. and she said, you don't have an agent, do you? and i go, no, but we can work on that. and she started laughing. and she said, well, are you sag? are you part of the screen actors guild? and i said, as of yet, no. but that's something else we can work on, as well. and she kept laughing. and she's like, listen; you're cute. call me when you get representation. and i said, listen; we're doing all right. we're having a good time. i see that the scene has only three lines. how about giving a guy a break? and if you're laughing now, chances are i might have you laughing in the room. and she took a few seconds, and she said, you know what, kid? come on in.\n\ni couldn't believe it. i could not believe it. i went in on that day. and later on that night, i had a callback for that show. and in between that, one of these manila envelopes that i had been stuffing, sending to every agent in los angeles, happened to call me in between the audition and the callback. and the confluence of the things that happened on that day still defy me to have any explanation for them. but it was a very profoundly successful day.\n\ngross: so you got the gilmore girls part, right?\n\nmalek: i got the part the next day.\n\ngross: let's talk a little bit about mr. robot. now, in this, you're somebody who has serious mental health issues, serious social problems. it's very hard for you to be with people. you're very withdrawn. you literally withdraw into your hoodie most of the time. and you're a hacker by night, but you're, like, a tech worker during the day. in the opening episode of season 1, you walk into a coffee shop - ron's coffee shop - and you start talking to the owner of the shop. let's listen to that scene.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, mr. robot)\n\nmalek: (as elliot alderson) you're ron. your real name's rohit mehta. you changed it to ron when you bought your first ron's coffee shop six years ago. now you got 17 of them with eight more coming next quarter.\n\nsamrat chakrabarti: (as ron) may i help you with something?\n\nmalek: (as elliot alderson) i like coming here 'cause your wi-fi was fast. i mean, you're one of the few spots that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed. it's good - so good it scratched that part of my mind, the part that doesn't allow good to exist without condition. so i started intercepting all the traffic on your network. that's when i noticed something strange. it's when i decided to hack you.\n\nchakrabarti: (as ron) hack...\n\nmalek: (as elliot alderson) i know you run a website called plato's boys.\n\nchakrabarti: (as ron) pardon me?\n\nmalek: (as elliot alderson) you're using tor networking to keep the servers anonymous. you made it really hard for anyone to see it. but i saw it. the onion routing protocol - it's not as anonymous as you think it is. whoever's in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic, which makes me the one in control.\n\nchakrabarti: (as ron) i must ask you to kindly leave.\n\nmalek: (as elliot alderson) i own everything - all your emails, all your files, all your pics.\n\nchakrabarti: (as ron) get out of here right now or i'll call the...\n\nmalek: (as elliot alderson) police? you want them to find out about the 100 terabytes of child pornography you serve to your 400,000 users? personally, man, i was hoping it was just going to be some bdsm stuff. you realize how much simpler that would've been?\n\nchakrabarti: (as ron) i didn't hurt anyone - never did. that's my personal life.\n\nmalek: (as elliot alderson) i understand what it's like to be different. i'm very different, too.\n\ngross: that might sound like an expression of sympathy (laughter). but right after that, rami malek's character is offered money by the coffee shop owner to cover this up. and elliot, rami malek's character, the hacker, says that he doesn't care about money. and it turns out he's tipped off the police. and as he gets up to leave the coffee shop, the police get out of their cars. and they start walking in to bust the coffee shop owner. it's a great scene, and it kind of hooks you right at that - right at episode 1. how did you get the part of mr. robot? you weren't very well-known at the time. i mean, mr. robot is really what made you well-known.\n\nmalek: correct. i got the part, actually, auditioning with that very scene. sam esmail, who is the creator of mr. robot, had seen me do a miniseries that was from steven spielberg and tom hanks called the pacific. and at some point, i came in with another hundred actors or so, did my best and kept coming in and coming in until finally, i did a network test. and i got the role. i never thought that i would be the lead character in any show. and this proved me wrong.\n\ngross: rami malek, it's really been so great to talk with you. thank you so much. thank you for your performances.\n\nmalek: it's been an absolute pleasure. i don't usually share this much of myself, but i figured, what better place to do it than on npr with you, terry?

'madaya mom' tells the story of a mother of 5 living in a syrian town under siege\n\nscott simon speaks with abc news producer rym momtaz and comic book artist dalibor talajic about marvel's madaya mom. it's the story of a woman in a syrian town held by rebels since july 2015.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nmadaya's a small syrian town located between damascus and the border with lebanon that has been held by rebels and under siege since july of 2015. in january of this year, rym momtaz, a producer for abc news, was able to get in touch with a mother of five children in madaya. abc news has joined with marvel comics to try to tell the story of a woman who was in a place that reporters can't reach in a truly vivid and graphic way. they have produced a nonfiction graphic book, a true life digital comic called madaya mom. rym momtaz joins us now and also dalibor talajic, the marvel comics artist who has drawn madaya mom. let me thank both of you for being with us.\n\ndalibor talajic: thank you for having us.\n\nrym momtaz: thank you for having us.\n\nsimon: rym momtaz, let me begin with you. how did you and how do you communicate with the woman you call madaya mom?\n\nmomtaz: we communicate through secure messaging apps over the phones, over the internet really. so the way we went about finding her was to go through a wide network of sources that we've cultivated over the years of covering the war in syria. we had to work for a few weeks, i have to say, to identify the right person and then to get in touch with her and to gain her trust in order for her to feel comfortable enough to engage in this conversation with us because she felt and her family felt that it might put her in danger.\n\nsimon: which is why you keep her identity, her actual name, a secret.\n\nmomtaz: yes, exactly. we can't reveal her identity because she worries that revealing her identity might put a target on her back.\n\nsimon: dalibor, what are some of the stories you've illustrated that stay with you that you think are most important for us to know?\n\ntalajic: the most striking parts is for me the most intimate ones as she - for instance, she decides to even though they are - they're all starving, she decides to stop eating herself because this little amounts of supplies and food that she has, she distributes it to her children and of course husband. and she herself just stopped eating. and it's not like a dramatic decision. it's, like, a logical thing to do. these are the moments that stick with me most.\n\nsimon: yeah. on the one hand, it's a very - and i use this word deliberately - it's a very heroic action. on the other hand, it's also what a mother does, isn't it?\n\ntalajic: well, yes. even though this is a story about a particular mother, she's an every mother anywhere. i don't believe that any other mother should - would do differently.\n\nsimon: help us understand what madaya mom has had to do to survive and keep her family going.\n\nmomtaz: the first thing she's really had to do is to keep calm and go on because she really is the rock of the family. she has this extremely strong character. she's very spirited, and she has refused to allow the circumstances that they are in - i.e. besieged by their own government supported by militant groups - she's refused to let that affect her children too much. so she tries to keep their daily life as normal as possible. she really is sort of the center of that family. she's also extremely courageous and understands that her eloquence and her ability to communicate with the outside world is an opportunity. it's what she can do to explain to the world what is happening to them, and she hopes to bring about change.\n\nsimon: dalibor, you grew up during what we now euphemistically call the wars in the former yugoslavia. does the story of madaya bring back certain memories for you?\n\ntalajic: yes, it does. what i could relate to is this civilian point of view during the war because somebody else is fighting, and regardless of your actions, bombs are falling around, snipers are shooting around, and you just survive. it's just very boring, very pointless, very hopeless aspect of war. one of the fragments in the madaya mom story that rang so many bells with me was her disappointment in the u.n. because they couldn't come to agreement what to do with the siege and everything. and she was - she was really enraged. like, why doesn't anyone care? and that made me remember, like, during the war, as the war started, as it was about to break out, we were all thinking like, no, this is not going to happen. i mean, it's 20th century. and as the time goes by, people start dying, cities start being destroyed, and you realize that, you know, it really doesn't matter. nobody cares.\n\nsimon: rym, how are madaya mom and her family getting by?\n\nmomtaz: you know, they found a kind of new normal, i guess. it doesn't mean that they don't constantly every day ask when is this going to stop, when is the siege going to end, when are we going to be free again? they spend their days waiting, and there doesn't seem to be much hope on the horizon. she asks constantly, you know, what do you think is going to happen? do you have any news about this? and i have to tell her, well, you know, we - we're hearing what you're hearing, that there are talks and people are trying to solve the situation.\n\nsimon: rym momtaz is a producer for abc news. dalibor talajic is an artist from marvel comics. together they have created madaya mom. thank you very much for being with us.\n\ntalajic: thank you for having us.\n\nmomtaz: thank you for having us.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
poll: trump approval down, slips with base\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption brendan smialowski/afp/getty images brendan smialowski/afp/getty images\n\nwhile the longest government shutdown in u.s. history continues, president trump's approval rating is down, and there are cracks showing with his base.\n\na new npr/pbs newshour/marist poll finds trump's approval rating down and his disapproval rating up from a month ago. he currently stands at 39 percent approve, 53 percent disapprove — a 7-point net change from december when his rating was 42 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove.\n\nand the movement has come from within key portions of his base. he is:\n\ndown significantly among suburban men, a net-positive approval rating of 51-to-39 percent to a net-negative of 42 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove. that's a net change of down 18 percentage points.\n\nto a net-negative of 42 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove. that's a net change of down 18 percentage points. down a net of 13 points among white evangelicals, from 73-to-17 percent approve to 66-to-23 percent approve.\n\ndown a net of 10 points among republicans, from 90-to-7 percent approve to 83-to-10 percent.\n\nfrom 90-to-7 percent approve to 83-to-10 percent. down marginally among white men without a college degree, from 56-to-34 percent approve to 50-to-35 percent approve, a net change downward of 7 points.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above? click here.\n\nfor the first time, we saw a fairly consistent pattern of having his base showing evidence of a cracking, said lee miringoff, director of the marist institute for public opinion, which conducted the poll. don't know if that's temporary — tied to the government shutdown — or a broader problem the president is having.\n\nthe percentage of people now saying they strongly disapprove of the job the president is doing is up to 45 percent, the highest for trump since december 2017.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above? click here.\n\n2020 headwinds\n\nthe president also faces some significant headwinds for re-election in 2020. just 30 percent of registered voters said they will definitely vote for trump in 2020, while 57 percent said they will definitely vote against him.\n\njust 76 percent of trump supporters, 69 percent of republicans and 58 percent of white evangelicals say they will definitely vote for him. many, if not most, of them will likely vote for the president, but their softness in supporting him for re-election is a sign of vulnerability.\n\nfor context, in 2010, when asked about then-president barack obama, just 36 percent said they would definitely vote for him, while 48 percent said they would not. obama went on to win with 51 percent of the vote.\n\nbut for trump to have more than half the country already saying it definitely won't vote for him indicates he is facing a difficult re-election.\n\nthe president has had his base and not much else, miringoff said, and when you look ahead to the election ... he enters with a significant disadvantage. his re-election prospects would definitely be in jeopardy at this point.\n\ntrump has a lot of work to do to be able to reassemble the coalition that voted for him narrowly to win in the electoral college in 2016. he lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes and won just 46 percent of the vote. he won by about 70,000 votes combined between pennsylvania, wisconsin and michigan, all states that have trended away from the president during his first two years in office.\n\nthe democratic field\n\nas for who trump would face, former vice president joe biden stands apart from the democratic field, in terms of how democratic voters feel about him compared to others.\n\nbiden is the best-known potential democratic candidate, and is very well-liked — 76 percent of democrats and democratic-leaning independents have a favorable impression of him. just 12 percent have a negative view.\n\nif he gets in, he automatically becomes the front-runner with numbers like this, miringoff said. he becomes the candidate who you have to get into the mix with and be competitive with him.\n\nbarbara carvalho, director of the poll, added, it is unusual to see a candidate, who's been part of the washington scene for so long, have such a low unfavorable rating.\n\ndon't see the graphic above? click here.\n\nbernie sanders, the principal challenger to 2016 nominee hillary clinton, is well-known, but between 1 in 3 and 1 in 4 democrats have a negative opinion of him. there are a lot of questions about whether sanders will be able to keep his base of activist supporters together, four years later, now that democrats have so many more options.\n\nmassachusetts sen. elizabeth warren has an almost equally high favorability rating as sanders, but is not viewed as negatively. others are potentially well-positioned, too. new jersey sen. cory booker, texas rep. beto o'rourke and california sen. kamala harris are in a next tier and have a capability of taking off if they make a good impression as voters get to know them.\n\nthe poll isn't good news for all potential democratic contenders, however. the democratic primary electorate does not appear ready for a billionaire. as former new york mayor michael bloomberg weighs a run, democrats are evenly split on their views of him, while about half of them haven't yet formed an opinion.\n\na primary challenge to trump?\n\nthere has been talk of a primary challenge to president trump, but no candidate emerges with particular backing.\n\nformer ohio gov. john kasich and mitt romney are viewed more unfavorably than favorably with republicans and republican-leaning independents — 24 percent view kasich favorably, 28 percent view him unfavorably; 29 percent view romney positively, while 48 percent view romney negatively.\n\nromney has been an outspoken critic of trump, and the gop base does not appear to appreciate that.\n\nthere is no strong support for a primary challenge to trump, miringoff said. kasich is not well-known, and romney is not particularly popular.\n\nin the mood for compromise\n\nas this shutdown continues, 59 percent said they mostly blame president trump or congressional republicans for it.\n\nand more than 6 in 10 are in the mood for compromise — 63 percent said they want their elected officials to compromise with people they disagree with rather than stick to their positions, including a majority of republicans. just 31 percent overall said they want their elected officials to stick to their positions no matter what.\n\nstrong republicans (50 percent), african-americans (51 percent), trump supporters (53 percent), latinos (55 percent) and gen xers (56 percent) are among the least likely to say they want their elected officials to compromise.\n\npeople are looking for compromise right now, miringoff said.\n\nbut neither side is seen as doing a very good job of it right now — 57 percent think the trump administration is doing too little to work with democrats in congress; 55 percent think that democrats are doing too little to work with the administration.\n\nneither party is making a very good impression, either. only about a third of americans have a positive view of congressional democrats (34 percent), while a majority (53 percent) disapprove of the job they are doing.\n\nan even lower number (29 percent) have a positive view of congressional republicans and more view them negative (58 percent).\n\nthe survey of 1,023 adults was conducted from jan. 10 to jan. 13 by the marist poll for npr and the pbs newshour. results for all americans have a margin of error of +/- 3.8 percentage points. there were 324 republicans or republican-leaning independents surveyed. where they are referenced, there is a margin of error of +/- 6.8 percentage points. there were 417 democrats and democratic-leaning independents surveyed. where they are referenced, there is a margin of error of +/- 6 percentage points.
epa scientists' work may face 'case by case' review by trump team, official says\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption rachel la corte/ap rachel la corte/ap\n\nscientists at the environmental protection agency who want to publish or present their scientific findings likely will need to have their work reviewed on a case by case basis before it can be disseminated, according to a spokesman for the agency's transition team.\n\nin an interview tuesday evening with npr, doug ericksen, the head of communications for the trump administration's epa transition team, said that during the transition period, he expects scientists will undergo an unspecified internal vetting process before sharing their work outside the agency.\n\nwe'll take a look at what's happening so that the voice coming from the epa is one that's going to reflect the new administration, ericksen told npr.\n\nericksen did not say whether such a review process would become a permanent feature of trump's epa. we're on day 2 here. ... you've got to give us a few days to get our feet underneath us.\n\nany review would directly contradict the agency's current scientific integrity policy, which was published in 2012. it prohibits all epa employees, including scientists, managers and other agency leadership from suppressing, altering, or otherwise impeding the timely release of scientific findings or conclusions.\n\nit also would likely have a chilling effect on the agency's ability to conduct research on the environmental issues it is charged with regulating.\n\nericksen's comments come just days after trump's team ordered agencies to limit their external communications to the public. employees at the epa, the department of agriculture and the interior department, among others, have been instructed not to post on social media accounts. at the epa, the staff was told not to speak to the news media.\n\nericksen said it's not abnormal for administrations to limit outward communication during their transition while they work toward getting different branches on point. trump's nominee for epa administrator, oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt, is still awaiting confirmation.\n\nit's also not abnormal for administrations to restrict access to government scientists. in 2013, a statement by the society of environmental journalists called the epa under former-president obama one of the most closed, opaque agencies to the press.\n\nit's certainly the case that every administration tries to control information, but i think that what we're seeing here is much more sweeping than has ever been done before, said andrew light, the distinguished senior fellow in the global climate program at the nonpartisan world resources institute. and in particular, it's noteworthy that it seems to be aimed at a cluster of science-driven agencies that primarily work on the environment and climate change.\n\nwhile previous administrations have restricted government scientists' communications to the public, controlling their scientific conclusions is far more rare.\n\nperhaps the most notable case came in 2003, when the administration of president george w. bush tried to alter the climate change section of a major epa report on the environment. according to the union of concerned scientists, which tracks such issues, changes included the deletion of a 1,000 year temperature record and insertion of a study funded by the american petroleum institute.\n\nmany federal agencies employ scientists to help conduct research. those findings are crucial in ensuring that regulations and government policy are based on the best information available. data collected by federal scientists is also used by state and local governments as well as private industry.\n\nthe epa's policy, like those of other technical agencies within the government, is designed to encourage its scientists to participate in the scientific process. to that end, the agency's official policy is to encourage publication and presentation of research findings in peer-reviewed, professional, or scholarly journals and at professional meetings.\n\nscience scientists race to preserve climate change data before trump takes office scientists race to preserve climate change data before trump takes office listen · 4:25 4:25\n\nthere's a growing concern in the scientific community and among environmental organizations that the new administration might take aim at climate change research in particular. trump has previously called climate change a hoax created by china to hurt the u.s. economy, though he later said he had an open mind on the issue. in the weeks before his inauguration, groups of scientists rushed to copy and preserve federal public climate data out of fear that it would be purged.\n\nericksen said that under trump, the epa will focus on its core mission, which is to protect the environment and protect human health.\n\nwhen asked if climate change fit into that, he repeated that they'll focus on the core mission.\n\npressed further about whether specific research on issues such as climate change could be withheld, ericksen told npr that it's premature to comment on a hypothetical before we've even had the time to look at what's currently happening in the [agency].
first woman to officially enter boston marathon will run it again 50 years later\n\nin 1967, kathrine switzer ran the boston marathon, even though it was a men's-only event. she tells npr's lulu garcia-navarro about that race, and training to run it again in 2017, at age 70.\n\nlourdes garcia-navarro, host:\n\nthe boston marathon is tomorrow, one of the marquee events for distance runners around the world. as with many sports, it used to be a men's-only event until 50 years ago, when kathrine switzer became the first woman to wear a boston bib number and race. now she's prepping to run it again at the age of 70. kathrine switzer joins me now from boston. welcome.\n\nkathrine switzer: thank you very much. it's wonderful to be with you.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so it's hard to imagine these days that women would be banned from running in a marathon. take us back to 1967. what was the thinking behind that?\n\nswitzer: in 1967, when i pinned on that bib number, i really wasn't trying to prove anything because a woman had actually run the boston marathon the year before by just jumping out of the bushes and running. there was nothing about gender in the rulebook in those days because everybody assumed a woman really couldn't run and didn't want to run, and why even bother with it in the rulebook or on the entry form?\n\nand in sports, the longest distance in the olympic games, in fact, was just 800 meters. it was feared that anything longer was going to injure women, that they wouldn't be able to have children or they somehow turned into men. that was what was the theory.\n\ngarcia-navarro: really, that they were going to turn into men or that their uterus would be damaged?\n\nswitzer: absolutely. you know, it was amazing. you'll never be - ever have children, they said. you're going to get big legs. you're going to grow hair on your chest. it was hilarious, the myths. and, of course, when people hear myths, they believe them because to try otherwise might mean damaging yourself. so people were afraid and they just went about their lives that way and restricted themselves.\n\ngarcia-navarro: but you didn't. you actually entered that 1967 marathon. tell us a little bit about how you did that and what - and the story behind that.\n\nswitzer: well, i entered the race simply because my coach had been a 15-time boston marathon runner. and he didn't believe a woman could do it, but he loved running with me and telling me stories about the boston marathon. so he energized me. and, you know, when i told him that i really wanted to try and he said he didn't believe a woman could do it, i was bound and determined to prove him wrong.\n\nso we did the - all the right things. we followed all the rules. we signed up using the correct entry form and had our travel permits and our aau cards. we were parts of the federation. the only thing that challenged it was how i signed my name. i sign my name k.v. switzer, with my initials. and when the entry form went in, they thought it was from a man.\n\ngarcia-navarro: the race organizers realized there was a woman on the course, of course. how did they find out, and what happened when they did?\n\nswitzer: at about a mile and a half into the race, the press truck went by us, and they saw that i was a woman in the race wearing numbers and they began taking pictures. and alongside of the photographer's truck came the officials' press truck. and the race director was on the truck and the guys were teasing him. and he got so angry that there was a girl in the race that he stopped the bus and jumped off it and ran after me and attacked me in the race and tried to pull off my bib numbers, screaming at me, get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers.\n\nand i was just blindsided by this. i was terrified. i was scared. and my boyfriend came along with a full streak and gave the official a cross-body block and sent him out of the race instead. you know, we laugh about it now because it's so funny when a girl is saved by her burly boyfriend. but, you know, i said to my coach immediately after the incident - and i said, i have to finish this race now because if i drop out of this race, nobody's going to believe that women are serious.\n\ngarcia-navarro: we should tell our listeners you won the new york city marathon in the '70s. you came in second in boston once. you've been running ever since. and now, again, you are going to run the boston marathon at 70 years old. what's - what are your hopes for the race day?\n\nswitzer: you know, what's going to happen on monday, patriots' day here in boston, is to come back 50 years and celebrate the fact, first of all, that i can run, that i'm capable of doing it, amazingly enough, and i'm very, very grateful for that. and i'm also very grateful for the opportunity to thank a city and the streets that changed my life and help to empower millions of women all around the world and change the face of the sport.\n\ngarcia-navarro: kathrine switzer, good luck out there tomorrow and what an honor to speak with you.\n\nswitzer: thank you so much. good luck everybody and stay fearless.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

'we felt totally defeated': palestinian writer recalls memories of 6-day war\n\nnpr's robert siegel interviews raja shehadeh, a palestinian lawyer and writer best known for his book strangers in the house, about his memories of the six-day war and its lasting impact on the middle east.\n\nrobert siegel, host:\n\nwe've been marking the 50th anniversary of the six-day war this week. it's the war that changed the middle east geographically and politically. yesterday we heard from israeli writer a.b. yehoshua about what it was like for an israeli for him during the war.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\na b yehoshua: the threat was a real one. the fact that the whole egyptian army and the syrian army were nearby the center of israel, the fact that the - such heavy army with tanks, with all the machines were so near to our houses, threatening us to destroy us.\n\nsiegel: well, today, the palestinian writer and activist raja shehadeh is going to share his memories of the six-day war and his sense of its legacy and consequences. he joins us from ramallah on the west bank. welcome to the program.\n\nraja shehadeh: thank you.\n\nsiegel: you were just 16 years old in 1967. tell us about where you were and what you remember of the six-day war.\n\nshehadeh: i was in ramallah. and the war, it turned out to be a very big event because it meant that the west bank where i was living was occupied and has been occupied for 50 years. but at the time, it wasn't such an amazing war for me because it took place very quickly. there was no fighting as far as i was concerned in ramallah. the israeli army more or less marched into the town and received no resistance whatsoever. and so in a matter of a few days, we found ourselves occupied by the israeli army.\n\nsiegel: as opposed to being - up until that time you were occupied by the jordanian army. that's who retreated in the war at that point.\n\nshehadeh: yeah, we were under jordanian rule for 19 years until that time.\n\nsiegel: how did the war in 1967 change the life of a teenager in ramallah, as you were, or his family and your neighbors?\n\nshehadeh: well, you know, for me at 16, it was the most crucial time when i needed to be free and explore life and go into the world. and instead, the war meant perpetual curfew. so we were under at first a 24-hour curfew, and then it was reduced a little bit. and then, of course, there was also utter confusion because we felt totally defeated. and the feeling of being defeated is a very hard one, especially when you don't understand why and how to move out of it. and so this was the time when i began writing my journals, my diary, which was my way of trying to figure out what was happening and to understand the confusion around me.\n\nsiegel: fifty years after the six-day war, do you have any optimism at all about a possible settlement, any hopes that something might develop in the coming years?\n\nshehadeh: absolutely, because without a settlement of the conflict there will be no possibility of peace in palestine, israel or in the region. and i believe that eventually it would be seen that a resolution would be beneficial to both sides. it cannot continue. no colonial situation has lasted. no discriminatory situation so glaring has lasted. nor would this one last as well.\n\nsiegel: and to israelis who say the palestinian leadership is just too weak, perhaps because of israeli policies, but for whatever reasons - and too divided and the leadership can never reach a tough agreement with israel, what do you say?\n\nshehadeh: i say that the leadership and the people have shown that whenever there is a little bit of hope they change and adopt the hope and are willing to go all the way with it because people want to have hope. when there's no hope, it weakens the leadership because at this point, the leadership is not giving us hope because israel is not willing to come along with the leadership and say, ok, we will go along with you on this basis. there isn't any such response from israel, and therefore this weakens the leadership.\n\nsiegel: raja shehadeh, a palestinian lawyer, writer. thank you very much for talking with us today from ramallah.\n\nshehadeh: thank you, pleasure.\n\n(soundbite of her's song, what once was)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
'a bit of a montessori 2.0': khan academy opens a lab school\n\nin 2015, khan academy, which pioneered free, online video tutorials and lectures that have reached millions of students around the world, sought new ways of reaching new people.\n\nit had already partnered with everyone from nasa to the museum of modern art, and this past year khan joined forces with the sat's overlord, the college board. the goal, in the parlance of our times, is to disrupt the billion-dollar test prep industry.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption stephen lam/reuters/landov stephen lam/reuters/landov\n\nas we've reported, students anywhere now can get free sat test prep both online and in person at some boys & girls clubs of america. the move may help level the playing field by improving test prep for less-affluent students to get them ready for the newly revamped sat, which remains a pillar of college admissions despite the growth in 2015 in test optional schools.\n\nit's part of what khan academy calls its core duty to help provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.\n\nbut where does the new $23,000 a year ($25,000 for grades 6-12) brick-and-mortar khan lab school in silicon valley fit into that mission?\n\ni interviewed khan academy founder and ceo salman khan on here & now, the live midday news show from npr and wbur, about the value of coding, ed tech and why education videos aren't enough.\n\nwhat inspired you to start coding when you were a student?\n\ni was probably early high school or late middle school, and i had one of those ti-85 calculators. i just started reading the manual, and i realized i could make video games on it. and so that was my first hook. and that was back in the day when you didn't have the internet to look up things and to get help. but that immediately got me hooked, where you said, hey, you can create anything you want using a computer.\n\nhacking the calculator.\n\nthat's where i started. i eventually convinced a local professor to let me use some of his computers. but that was kind of my first glimpse about how exciting it could be.\n\nwhy should kids, who may be struggling to learn the basics of addition and subtraction, learn the basics of coding?\n\ni think in the next few decades, at least having a strong familiarity with software and what programming can accomplish is pretty powerful.\n\nit seems like we have a long way to go, sal, before coding becomes a foundational educational tool?\n\nthe hard thing about programming is, it hasn't been there traditionally. so, you know, we're trying to find space for it in the traditional school system. a lot of educators haven't been exposed to it when they were young. so that's the challenge. but there's also an opportunity in that there isn't anything to replace. it's green field, it's a new area, and there's all sorts of incredible tools for people to learn. and when i talk about people, i'm not just talking about students — i'm talking about people of all ages. i encourage parents, teachers, people of all walks of life to start dabbling a little bit.\n\nwhat benefits do you see for adults who might be deep into their lives to hit restart and start learning the basics of coding?\n\nin almost any profession that you're in now, software is starting to play a larger and larger role. and the folks who at least have a familiarity with how a program works, how does software work, what is it capable of, what is it not capable of, they're going to be in a really great position to, especially if they wanted to start something, be entrepreneurial. you know, a lot of people have these phobias because they were in school, you know, they remember seeing the chalkboard and not knowing what was going on, mainly because they were pushed ahead while they had these gaps. but now you have all of these resources where you can go at your own time or pace, and what we hear over and over again is that they find it fun!\n\nyou've launched the khan lab school — a brick-and-mortar school in mountain view, calif., in silicon valley. to some, that's like amazon opening a bunch of brick-and-mortar stores. why did you think it's necessary?\n\na lot of people when they think about virtual anything, they do make that comparison of say an amazon.com versus a barnes & noble. we at khan academy, we never viewed it that way. we view the virtual as something that can empower the physical — that if students can get lectures at their own time and pace, they can get exercises, they can have a programming platform, that doesn't mean that the classroom gets replaced; it means the classroom gets liberated. it doesn't have to be about a lecture anymore; students don't have to learn at the same time and pace. classroom time could be much more about socratic dialogue, building projects, whatever else. so we wanted to prove it out. we've been working with a lot of great schools who have been doing aspects of this, but we started a lab underneath our offices, literally, where we have mixed age, it's full-year, full-day. the students do mastery-based, personalized learning for kind of the first half of the day. we have a lot of focus on kind of meta-cognitive skills like entrepreneurship and creativity. the second half of the day — and they're here until 6 o'clock — they're building stuff, they're making things.\n\nall ages mixed together. that's a core ideal of montessori. is it a kind of montessori-esque program?\n\nyeah, you could almost imagine this is a bit of a montessori 2.0. i mean, the whole principle of montessori is students learn by exploration, play, they learn at their own time and pace, they have mixed age. and mixed age allows older students to mentor and younger students to get that mentorship, and what we're doing is exactly that. but montessori has historically struggled as you go into the more advanced subjects, as you get to your algebra and your physics and your chemistry, and that's where tools like khan academy come into play. because now students can still learn at their own time and pace, and they can still explore, and they can pull the information they need to solve real-world problems. so we are inspired by montessori, and i would like to think that maria montessori would be pretty excited if she saw what was going on.\n\naren't you at risk of creating a two-tier system with your free lectures and your pricey private school?\n\nyou know, khan academy is on track, and hopefully it does reach hundreds of millions, billions of students and empowers them where if they have a low-cost cellphone, they can start to self-educate themselves. but we think the opportunity now is not just online. we want to catalyze change more broadly. you know, what does a physical classroom look like? break out of this kind of prussian-factory model of education. and what we said was we needed to create a lab school, but we don't just want to create another one-off, progressive private school. so everything that we're doing in this lab school we're sharing — we're sharing with local public, private schools. all the curricula, we're going to open-source it and figure out what works, what doesn't. and when you figure out things that do work, share it with the rest of the planet.\n\nyou'll openly share best practices learned out of this lab school?\n\nyeah, that's the exact reason. the reason we did it as an independent school is so we could really push all of the boundaries. fully mixed age would be very hard in any other context. every six weeks, we kind of look at what worked, what didn't work, and we kind of reset it and reboot it and we try new things. so it really is in the spirit of innovation of khan academy. if we really want to understand what's possible in a physical classroom, we need a lab.\n\nyou've spent a lot of time perfecting your online lectures. but there's been criticism, including of methods and the format itself — khan academy's sage on the stage lecture format. some see that as outdated, whether done online or in person. has your own understanding of what makes a good educator changed since you launched khan academy?\n\nwell, i think there's some reality to that notion that these lectures are lectures. and if you look at a khan academy video, they're these kind of traditional chalk-talk explanations. what's different is how someone consumes, or the attitude. you know, if you go to a traditional lecture hall, it's pushed onto you. while a khan academy-like video, you only watch it if you need to watch it. you're like, hey, wait. i don't quite get that. let me go get a 10-minute explanation, and now i want to learn the next thing. so when you have lectures on demand, it really just kind of takes them off the table. they're there and they are useful sometimes, and then it allows you to work at your own time and pace, and you only watch the videos if you want an on-demand explanation.\n\nthe man who's pioneered the online lecture is admitting there are deep limitations to them.\n\ni think they're valuable, but i'd never say they somehow constitute a complete education. if i'm confused about something, hey, to get a 5-, 10-minute explanation of it, i think that's valuable.\n\nthe research shows that students learn best when they work through challenges together, stumble around, try to find answers and come up with solutions themselves with help from a good teacher. that's hard on a one-way lecture online.\n\neverything we advocate — and this was some of the ideas of the lab school — is that students should work on problems. [that] could be traditional problems or more open-ended inquiry-type projects, and while they're working through those they say, hey, wait, i need to figure out how fast this thing is gonna fall. i need help here. so, yes, i agree with that — the best way to do it is look at it from a problem-solving point of view, try to struggle with the problem, and then pull the knowledge as you need it. it could be an on-demand lecture, it could be looking at a reference book, asking your friend, asking a teacher, finding an article on the internet. whatever it is, it's going to stick much more than when it's pushed on to you.
is america's 2-party system fracturing?\n\nneither donald trump nor bernie sanders is a conventional party leader. npr's lulu garcia-navarro talks to political scientist diego von vacano about the breakdown of the two-party system.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nthe 2020 race is shaping up to be unlike any other in recent american history. consider the fact that the current front-runner on the democratic side, bernie sanders, hasn't actually been a member of the democratic party for most of his career. the head of the republican party, donald trump, isn't a traditional republican either. he has reshaped the gop in his image, inverting longstanding conservative canons on issues like debt, international relations and democratic norms. is the two-party system as we know it breaking down? and if so, why?\n\nwe're now joined by diego von vacano, a professor at texas a&m university. welcome.\n\ndiego von vacano: thank you very much. it's my pleasure to be on your program.\n\ngarcia-navarro: you study populism, where more trust is put in a person like president trump than in political institutions. and you contend that populism breaks down the traditional order. can you explain how this could be affecting the two-party system in the united states right now?\n\nvon vacano: so in the u.s., definitely there's been a change in the last few years. we've seen that the gop has been taken over by president trump using mechanisms like fear, retaliation, personalism. and these are populist methods.\n\ngarcia-navarro: explain personalism. when you're saying personalism, what does that mean?\n\nvon vacano: personalism is where an individual leader uses their connections and their - sometimes even their friends and their families in order to become more popular, to gain support. in president trump's case, it's been quite evident in the last few years - right? - that this use of the family, his connections, even the use of twitter itself - so that his followers will see him almost as their - he's talking to them directly, skipping the institutional apparatus.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and can you just talk me through some of the parallels you see in president trump's rise to some of the other places you have studied?\n\nvon vacano: peron is probably the best example in argentina in the '50s. his ability was to be kind of a - theatrical and performative. so his appearance, the way that he behaves, his image - president trump has definitely used that model. and then in the case of a more of the left-wing populism in latin america, we have somebody like evo morales who, again, is - has a particular persona, narrative. and he - again, the use of repetitive stories about the elite versus the masses is something that's also quite similar in the way that bernie sanders is rising.\n\ngarcia-navarro: one of the things that has been so striking is how quickly voters shed the ideology of their party once a populist comes to power. does that show that all this political edifice, all the political sort of intellectual underpinnings of liberals and conservatives are simply a house of cards, which populists can exploit to their advantage?\n\nvon vacano: in general, i would say that is the case. i do think there is a crisis in the u.s. party system. i do think that the edifice constructive by long - for a very long time in the gop by intellectuals who are conservative is falling down, breaking down because of the use of certain tropes by president trump. so for instance, the idea of race, gender and the us-versus-them dialectic and then the idea of the strongman are at least four elements - are really quite visible in the case of trump.\n\nfor the democratic party, i think sanders and bloomberg see that younger voters, especially - and also, in the case of bernie sanders, immigrants, latinos - they have maybe felt excluded from some of the traditional approaches by the democratic party. so definitely, i think they are taking the trump model seriously.\n\ngarcia-navarro: as someone who studies populism, i suppose i'm going to end by asking you, do you think that the two-party system can survive what's happening right now?\n\nvon vacano: so in politics, it's very difficult to predict. but i anticipate sanders will continue to be successful, and that will change the mainstream. and i think in the case of the gop that trump has definitely already almost co-opted the party. so he has won that fight. so definitely, the democrats have to respond in kind in some sense. and i think there'll be a lot of self-reflection within the ranks.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's diego von vacano, associate political science professor at texas a&m. thank you so much.\n\nvon vacano: thank you very much.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

is it me? and then he gets on his zip line and goes down and they, like, hug. and, you know...\n\ndickinson: exactly.\n\ngrosz: ...they won't do anything sexual. they just need to endorse.\n\nrocca: i think...\n\nsagal: i endorse you. i endorse you, you crazy fool. why is it raining all of a sudden?\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: ok, josh, here is your next quote.\n\nkurtis: i think we may have been visited already.\n\nsagal: now, that was another presidential candidate trying to shore up support from the ufo community. who was it?\n\nmartin: on my goodness, was it bernie sanders?\n\nsagal: no, believe it or not...\n\n(laughter)\n\nkurtis: good guess.\n\nsagal: this is - this is, like, the one strange idea he doesn't have.\n\n(laughter)\n\nrocca: he's in the ufo.\n\n(laughter)\n\nmartin: it's got to be hillary then.\n\nsagal: yes indeed. it was hillary clinton.\n\n(soundbite)\n\nsagal: yes, that's who it is.\n\n(applause)\n\nsagal: after months of failing to ignite any sort of passion among anybody, hillary clinton is finally generating excitement - and this is true - by standing up for ufo enthusiasts.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: apparently, the former secretary of state is a believer in ufos - or as she now calls them - and this is true - uaps - unexplained aerial phenomenon. and she has promised that if elected president, she will finally release the x-files. we'll know what happened at roswell and area 51 and in the lab where she was created.\n\n(laughter)\n\ndickinson: wait, but is there a constituency that she will not...\n\ngrosz: pander to.\n\ndickinson: ...go after? it's like when she was first running for senator in new york, it was, like, mets, yankees, they're all awesome.\n\ngrosz: yeah.\n\ndickinson: you know, she just...\n\ngrosz: this is a bold stand for her. like, if she can't even pick - like, just pick one of the teams - like, because you can say let's run the numbers and see who likes the yankees more than the mets. like, you could run the numbers and, like, 95 percent of america would be, like, no, we're not cool with ufos. she's actually picking something that nobody likes, which is very rare for her.\n\nsagal: it is. and this is in fact a genuine...\n\ngrosz: she's super committed.\n\nsagal: ...interest of hers...\n\ndickinson: really?\n\ngrosz: ...that goes back decades...\n\ndickinson: wow.\n\ngrosz: yeah, it's like one of her first actual, like, genuiney (ph) things and people are like ha ha, that's weird.\n\ndickinson: wow.\n\n(laughter)\n\ndickinson: wow.\n\nrocca: wait, does mars - does mars have a primary or a caucus?\n\n(laughter)\n\nrocca: because if it's a caucus - she loses all the caucuses.\n\ngrosz: no, mars is red. she's going to lose it no matter what...\n\nsagal: yeah.\n\ngrosz: ...anyway...\n\n(laughter, applause)\n\ngrosz: ...in the general.\n\nsagal: all right, here is your last quote.\n\nkurtis: ready to reach for an ice cold can of america?\n\nsagal: that was fox news host megyn kelly talking about what beer that just changed its name to america?\n\nmartin: oh, my goodness. i don't know. i drank my fair share of beer in college.\n\nsagal: it's the king of beers.\n\nrocca: do you have a clydesdale in your marching band?\n\n(laughter)\n\nmartin: that's good - not bud lime - budweiser.\n\nsagal: budweiser, yes.\n\n(soundbite of bell)\n\nsagal: that's the answer.\n\n(applause)\n\nsagal: budweiser is going to be renamed america for most of the rest of the year. it makes sense because when you think of terrible tasting beer water, you think america.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: now, anheuser-busch, the brewer, has a problem. budweiser used to be the best-selling beer in america by a huge margin. but then about 15 years ago, americans discovered actual beer.\n\n(laughter)\n\nrocca: i prefer america light as...\n\nsagal: yeah.\n\nrocca: i just wanted to point that out.\n\nsagal: or as it's often called, canada.\n\ngrosz: yeah.\n\n(laughter, applause)\n\nsagal: now, these days budweiser is only bought by people trying to be hip and those who've been told it's a great way to keep slugs out of their garden.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: so as a marketing gimmick, why not change its name to america? that was the number two solution they came up with to help with sales after they rejected number one - make it taste good.\n\n(laughter)\n\nrocca: i'm worried because i mean, like, a lot of people when i finish a bud, i like to smash it against my forehead - crush it against my forehead. so is that going to be, like, flag burning now? it's going to be...\n\n(laughter)\n\nrocca: ...unpatriotic?\n\n(applause)\n\nrocca: i could be arrested for the way i drink my america.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: bill, how did josh do on our quiz?\n\nkurtis: josh, john philip sousa couldn't have done any better. we're going to call you a winner.\n\nmartin: oh, thank you so much.\n\nsagal: thank you.\n\n(soundbite of song, drunk americans)\n\ntoby keith: (singing) in these neon lights, we're all stars, we're all stripes. and we're all drunk americans.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
the latest on virginia's political scandals\n\none week into the scandal engulfing virginia's capitol, all three embattled state leaders are still holding onto their jobs. how long can they withstand their respective scandals?\n\nmichel martin, host:\n\nit's hard to imagine that it was just over a week ago that a racist yearbook photograph rocked virginia's capital. a lot has happened since then. to recap, governor ralph northam admitted to wearing blackface in a photo in his med school yearbook. then he denied it. then he admitted he did wear blackface on one separate occasion. now he tells the washington post he wants to devote the remainder of his term to racial reconciliation.\n\nattorney general mark herring also announced that he had donned blackface on one occasion. meanwhile, two sexual assault allegations have surfaced against the lieutenant governor, justin fairfax. none of them has resigned, despite pressure from heavyweights in their state and the national party. from richmond, npr's colin dwyer looks at whether these three men can really hope to hang onto office.\n\ncolin dwyer, byline: it's been just a few weeks since governor northam spoke at richmond's historically black virginia union university. so when student government president jamon phenix saw the photo in northam's yearbook, it felt like a personal betrayal.\n\njamon phenix: i felt heartache.\n\ndwyer: and phenix also felt that it was time for a change in the governor's mansion.\n\nphenix: this is something that we don't need. this is something that we don't look forward to. and it's not intrinsic to who we are as a younger generation looking to the future.\n\ndwyer: but that future may well still include virginia's embattled leaders, all three of whom have defied calls to step down. alison dagnes is a professor at shippensburg university in pennsylvania. she's been studying and writing about political scandals for a long time, and she says something has changed lately in the way that leaders handle them. they've got the benefit of deep political polarization, the growth of partisan media and now the model of president trump, who has often survived his scandals simply by riding out the news cycle.\n\nalison dagnes: that has served an unfortunate lesson now for politicians who are in office. and this is regardless of party because northam, of course, is a democrat.\n\ndwyer: so are the next two men in line for his job if he does resign. but fairfax, the lieutenant governor, may not last long enough to see that happen. a state lawmaker says he plans to begin impeachment proceedings against the black politician, who has denied the rape allegations. it would be more difficult to dislodge his colleagues, who have admitted to wearing blackface and who have vowed to complete their terms. but dagnes says they may be missing the point.\n\ndagnes: when politicians are given the cue that if they just keep their mouth closed and they disappear for a little while, it'll all go away, they're wrong. they may keep their job, but at what cost?\n\ndwyer: gregory howard, an interim dean at virginia union university, says northam and herring should not get to dictate the terms of their own rehabilitation.\n\ngregory howard: every now and again, we slip up, we fall, and we have a responsibility to dust ourselves off and seek for full healing and reconciliation - but reconciliation that is based upon the one who has been offended - not the offender.\n\ndwyer: because, according to howard, there is a lot more at stake here than political office.\n\nhoward: this is not a partisan issue. this is not a political issue. this is a matter of humanity and morality.\n\ndwyer: and, he adds, right now, the national spotlight is on virginia to see how it responds.\n\ncolin dwyer, npr news, richmond, va.\n\n(soundbite of la riviera song, sans lendemain)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
would college students retain more if professors dialed back the pace?\n\nenlarge this image adam crowley/getty images/blend images rm adam crowley/getty images/blend images rm\n\nwhen we read books, why do we forget so much of what we read, in only weeks or even days after we read it?\n\ncoming across an article on this topic by julie beck in the atlantic over the weekend, i found insight and even some consolation. i'm not the only one who forgets the plots of novels i've truly loved.\n\nbeck explains that as we read a book, it feels like a fluent experience when we're absorbed in the text. the material that we're taking in, though, is being held only in working memory. it takes concentrated effort to set that material in long-term memory. beck writes:\n\nif you want to remember the things you watch and read, space them out. i used to get irritated in school when an english-class syllabus would have us read only three chapters a week, but there was a good reason for that...if you read a book all in one stretch — on an airplane, say — you're just holding the story in your working memory that whole time.\n\n(note that beck refers to watching as well as to reading: it turns out, she says, that if we binge-watch a tv program, we forget its contents more quickly than if we watch at conventional one-week intervals.)\n\nin a case of literary serendipity, right after i read beck's piece, i stumbled onto an essay called the simplest course i ever taught in the chronicle of higher education by paula marantz cohen, dean of the pennoni honors college and professor of english at drexel university.\n\ncohen describes her embrace of slow teaching, an approach that designs a college course to look closely — and by extension, slowly — at one major idea or text over the course of ten weeks.\n\nthough the focus of cohen's essay is a one-credit course she developed that took the slow teaching approach to a new level — she read aloud jane austen's pride and prejudice to her students, and they discussed the plot and characters together — she explains that the honors program she heads offers a whole set of slow-taught courses. one of them focused on charles darwin's on the origin of species, an indication that science as well as the humanities is involved.\n\na deliberate change on professors' part from trying to cram in as much material as possible over the course of a term, cohen suggests, brings benefits to the students. i am convinced that key concepts and texts will adhere better to memory and understanding if their presentation is slowed down, she says in her essay.\n\nwhat a striking match between cohen's pedagogy, designed as an antidote to a headlong rush through the semester, and beck's article on why we forget what we read.\n\nthat teaching style matches, too, with a perspective developed (and a book written) by canadian professors maggie berg and barbara k. seeber, whose work urging professors to resist a corporate-style focus on rush-rush productivity i profiled here in 2016.\n\nas i wrote then about the slow professor philosophy:\n\nmost important of all, college teachers should insist, unapologetically, that reflective inquiry is the heart and soul of the university. and reflective inquiry can't be done in a distracted rush, without uninterrupted time to focus.\n\nby email, i asked cohen how she would respond to a skeptic who might claim that slow teaching coddles students rather than challenges them fully. she told me:\n\nthe goal is to inspire students to want to learn. if we hold to labels like coddling, we miss the point. my students work incredibly hard to qualify for med school and law school, and for engineering, finance, and other professional careers. drexel is a cooperative education school, which means that students spend some of their time working at actual jobs in their fields. at times, they hold down part-time jobs while also taking a full roster of courses. these students are intensely hard-working, even driven — very far from a coddled stereotype. the humanities, unfortunately, tends to get short shrift in this context. it is important to find ways to lure students into reading for intellectual stimulation and pleasure rather than just for facts and careerist ends. so i don't see this as coddling but as intellectual seduction without which we are likely to see the books and ideas we love fall by the wayside.\n\ngiven what i wrote here last year about celebrating intellectual engagement on college campuses, it's no surprise that i'm convinced by cohen's points. i'm not a skeptic about the slow-teaching approach.\n\nstill, i do wonder, is it likely to be successful across all disciplines? when i taught college, my science-based biological anthropology courses did require me to jam in a lot of material. in a course on human evolution, for instance, doing a thorough job meant teaching a range of topics in genetics, primate behavior, fossil humans, and the evolution of cognition and behavior.\n\ndid cohen have any thoughts on whether slow teaching would be as effective in the science as in the humanities? she replied, in part:\n\ngood question. we are currently trying to do a one-credit slow teaching course on 'rate of change,' the underlying concept of calculus. we'll have to see how this turns out. i sense that it will need to be tweaked to work well, but that it has potential.\n\nof course, no one is suggesting that slow teaching become the single method used by professors in college classrooms. it shouldn't. but added into the mix, how could it be anything but a boon to pleasure in learning — and pleasure in remembering more of what is read?\n\nbarbara j. king is an anthropology professor emerita at the college of william and mary. she often writes about the cognition, emotion and welfare of animals and about biological anthropology, human evolution and gender issues. barbara's new book is personalities on the plate: the lives and minds of animals we eat. you can keep up with what she is thinking on twitter: @bjkingape
second u.s.-north korea summit likely focus on nuclear weapons center\n\nthis month's summit between president trump and north korean leader kim jong un is likely to focus on north korea's main nuclear weapons center at yongbyon.\n\nari shapiro, host:\n\nwhen president trump and north korean leader kim jong un discuss denuclearization in hanoi, they are likely to focus on one north korean nuclear facility in particular. npr's geoff brumfiel introduces us to it.\n\ngeoff brumfiel, byline: it's called the yongbyon nuclear research center.\n\njeffrey lewis: this is really the oldest, best-known nuclear facility in all of north korea.\n\nbrumfiel: jeffrey lewis is a scholar at the middlebury institute of international studies at monterey.\n\nlewis: you know, it's basically a small city. there's quite a lot of housing for scientists and workers. there are many facilities.\n\nbrumfiel: including a nuclear reactor that can produce plutonium, a giant facility designed to extract and purify that plutonium and a separate, modern facility filled with centrifuges for enriching uranium. plutonium and uranium are both used in nuclear bombs.\n\nsig (ph) hecker is a former nuclear weapons scientist, now at stanford university. he's one of the few westerners who's visited yongbyon, and he says it's pretty spartan.\n\nsiegfried hecker: yeah, most important part - it was cold. this was january in yongbyon. and particularly, what was striking - it was colder inside the buildings than outside the buildings.\n\nbrumfiel: on other trips, hecker saw scientists growing their own vegetables and using primitive safety equipment while working in potentially dangerous areas. but he is convinced that yongbyon is effective at producing material for nuclear weapons.\n\nhecker: these facilities may be old, but they're functional. and the people were professional and very competent.\n\nbrumfiel: if the north does give up yongbyon, as it suggested it might in statements...\n\nhecker: they would significantly curtail their abilities to continue the nuclear weapons program. of course, it doesn't mean that they're giving up their bombs because i'm quite certain the bombs are not in yongbyon.\n\nbrumfiel: hecker estimates north korea's current nuclear arsenal at several dozen weapons that are stored somewhere else. north korea is also believed to have covert facilities where it can make uranium for nuclear weapons.\n\non top of all that, it's not clear what giving up yongbyon would mean. last year, north korea closed its underground nuclear test site by dynamiting the entrances in front of foreign journalists...\n\n(soundbite of explosions)\n\nbrumfiel: ...but foreign inspectors were never allowed to examine the site first. jung pak, with the brookings institution, says that north korea is paranoid about foreigners.\n\njung pak: north korea does not want people running around their country looking at their nuclear facilities or their missile facilities.\n\nbrumfiel: but yongbyon is a big, technically complex site. it can't just be blown up. pak believes that any deal should include inspections.\n\npak: it would be a big change and a good signpost of north korean sincerity on denuclearization if they did allow inspectors into their facilities.\n\nbrumfiel: those inspectors would probably be let in in exchange for some kind of sanctions relief and, perhaps, a peace declaration between north korea and the u.s., which have remained formally at war since an armistice in 1953. for now, jeffrey lewis says the satellite photos indicate the reactor is running, making more plutonium for nuclear bombs.\n\nlewis: you know, it's really business as usual at yongbyon at the moment. people all show up for work, and material comes in. and it looks pretty much like it's looked for the last, you know, 10 or 15 years.\n\nbrumfiel: it remains to be seen whether a second summit can change that. geoff brumfiel, npr news, washington.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

why nepal has one of the world's fastest-growing christian populations\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption sworup nhasiju sworup nhasiju\n\nfamous for its high peaks and wind-whipped prayer flags, hindu-majority nepal used to be a nation unreached by christianity.\n\nnow the country has one of the fastest-growing christian populations in the world, according to the world christian database, which tracks global trends in christianity.\n\nbishwa mani pokharel, news chief at nepal's nagarik newspaper, pulls out copies of the census to show the statistical gallop of christianity across nepal. it listed no christians in 1951 and just 458 in 1961. by 2001, there were nearly 102,000. a decade later that number had more than tripled to more than 375,000. pokharel and others think the increase is really much higher but inaccurately reported.\n\nbefore, when the christians had a party, they slaughtered a chicken. now, they slaughter a goat, says pokharel, who has been reporting on the conversions. that extra meat, he explains, is necessary to feed all of the new people who've joined the guest list.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption salim ali salim ali\n\nmuch of this growth can be attributed to nepal's internal changes. before 1950, nepal was closed to foreigners. mountain climbing changed that. and starting with the maoist civil war of the 1990s and culminating with the end of the monarchy in 2008, the country has transitioned from a hindu kingdom to a communist-led secular republic with greater freedom of religion. encouraging someone to convert to another religion was always illegal, but as nepal eased away from its official hindu status, the rules lightened up.\n\nchurches now mushroom throughout the kathmandu valley and across the terraced hills. proselytizing remains illegal, but with political instability and weak law enforcement, that doesn't stop it from happening.\n\nmeanwhile, the earthquake last year may have strengthened the christian surge. where the government — long mired in political instability — has failed to help poor villagers, aid groups have trickled in to fill gaps, some of them carrying a message of salvation.\n\nclimbing for christ (c4c), an evangelical group based in rochester, n.y., is one.\n\npledging to bring the gospel where others cannot or will not go, the group began its mission: nepal in 2008. in 2011, it dedicated the first church in the village of dapcha, 25 miles east of kathmandu. today, dapcha — with a population of just 1,000 families — is home to three churches.\n\nthey found some sick people and broken families and talked to them and prayed for them, and miraculously these people were convinced and began to follow christ, said tej rokka, pastor of the c4c partner ministry, savior alone redeems asians. they distributed some food for the people, and clothes. because of that, people began to listen to them.\n\nafter the earthquake, c4c sent relief materials such as tents and money for food and first-aid items to congregants in dapcha and other affected areas. gary fallesen, c4c's founder and president, and a team were also in nepal in october helping rebuild the earthquake-damaged house that belongs to the family of sumitra pariyar, a young woman who believes she was healed from paralysis and seizures by her acceptance of christ.\n\nlauren leve, a professor in the religious studies department at the university of north carolina at chapel hill, is researching women who have converted to christianity in nepal. she found that as in the case of pariyar, many of these conversions were related to illness.\n\nothers point to the hindu caste system as an impetus. though outlawed in 2001, caste discrimination is still widely practiced, particularly in rural nepal, where people on the lower rungs suffer systematic abuse passed on between generations. many converts come from these lower castes, and missionaries point to christianity as a way to escape. it's the only way out, says fallesen. socially there's nothing they can do to change that and then we come along and we share about jesus and the love he has for them. the system still exists, fallesen says, but no longer has power over them.\n\nnepali leaders aren't happy about the christianity boom. before the release of the country's first constitution this september, debates swelled over whether to scrap secularism and go back to an official hindu designation. while christians and other religious minorities feared a clampdown on religious freedom, the hindu right insisted secularism would allow christianity to take over. the british ambassador in nepal ran afoul of this sentiment in 2014 after telling parliament the right to change religions should be included in the constitution. pro-hindu groups accused him of supporting proselytizing and called for his resignation. when lawmakers did ensure secularism in the constitution, police needed water cannons and tear gas to dispel angry hindu protesters.\n\nleve thinks laws against proselytizing aren't the best way for the nepali government to keep conversions down. what it needs to do is ramp up the public health and social support infrastructure so that its citizens are getting what they need from the state, she says. when public hospitals start to provide effective health services, when there's a social safety net in place post-earthquake or any other time, you will see fewer people expressing any interest in christianity.\n\nfor fallesen, this need for material goods can be a foot in the door to a conversation about jesus. he said his team starts by building relationships with villagers to find out what their problems are. usually the solution to those needs is to share about jesus, he says.\n\nrokka, the nepali pastor who is also c4c's country representative, shows off the audio bibles the team uses to minister to the illiterate in nepal. people think the local language recordings of the new testament are cellphones or mp3 players, he explained. he said that even when they find out what the gadget is, they're still excited to get a new device.\n\nfew avenues exist here for the rural poor to better their situation. for more than a decade, many parents have sent their children to orphanages in kathmandu, where they hope they'll get better resources and education than what's available in their villages. the problem of false orphanages has grown so out of control that the u.s. and other countries banned international adoptions from nepal in 2010. there were simply too many orphans with parents.\n\nc4c supports an orphanage, too. not all the kids are orphans in the western sense, fallesen explained, but they come from families that don't have the ability to properly care for them. how do these families feel about their kids getting baptized? some are happy, some are not. some now want to take them out from the home, said rokka, whose ministry runs the orphanage. but the parents don't typically act on their concerns, he added. they have no way to help them. anyway [the children] are getting help here, so [the parents] think, ok, let it be.\n\nrokka came to the faith as a child after his mother died. he says some people convinced his father to send him and his brother to an orphanage run by an indian missionary. rokka estimates that 90 percent of the children he grew up with have since started their own ministries.\n\nsitting outside their dapcha house, an elderly couple expresses disdain for the churches popping up around them. we don't go there, the woman says, waving her hand dismissively and mimicking someone in christian prayer. she then pretends to handle buddhist prayer beads. we say 'om mani padme om,' she says, using the buddhist mantra to declare her faith.\n\nto christian relief workers like fallesen, the importance of bringing nepalis to christianity outweighs the concerns expressed by nonbelievers. if i have a choice between possibly offending you or saying ok, whatever you believe is fine, but i believe in my heart if you don't believe in jesus, you're going to go to hell, well, then i'm going to take the risk of offending you, he says.\n\nso c4c has its sights on more remote areas of nepal. land was just purchased for its newest church in the hard-to-reach far west district of humla, where fallesen says the nepali population of seven christian men has grown to 150 men and women. the church will be strategically placed at the point where hindu and buddhist pilgrims begin the trek to mount kailash, a holy site for both religions.
democrats' health care ambitions meet the reality of divided government\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption carolyn kaster/ap carolyn kaster/ap\n\nin her first speech as speaker of the house, nancy pelosi made it clear that she knows that health care is key to why voters sent democrats to congress.\n\nin the past two years the american people have spoken, pelosi told members of congress and their families who were gathered thursday in the house chamber for the opening day of the session.\n\ntens of thousands of public events were held, hundreds of thousands of people turned out, millions of calls were made, countless families, even sick little children — our little lobbyists, our little lobbyists — bravely came forward to tell their stories and they made a big difference, said pelosi, a california democrat.\n\nwhat is the democrats' mandate?\n\nto lower health care costs and prescription drug prices and protect people with pre-existing medical conditions, she said to applause.\n\nin their campaigns last year, democrats promised to protect the affordable care act, and the access to coverage that it guarantees for many people. many democrats went further, running on the promise of medicare-for-all.\n\nbut now that democrats control the house, their ambitions are meeting up with reality.\n\nwith the senate in republican hands and president trump having promised to repeal the aca, democrats' ability to make sweeping health policy changes is limited.\n\ninstead, they'll likely rely on hearings and turn to the courts to try to influence health policy and shore up the aca.\n\npelosi started on day 1.\n\njust hours after her speech, house democrats voted to intervene in a lawsuit in an effort to protect the affordable care act. the house will join several state attorneys general in appealing the ruling of a federal district judge in texas that the law is unconstitutional.\n\nand rep. frank pallone, d-n.j., head of the energy and commerce committee, announced a hearing on the impact of the ruling. he said he intends to hold lots of hearings to review the trump administration's actions around the aca — actions he calls sabotage.\n\nat a time when the trump administration is doing all the sabotage of the aca, i think the focus really has to be on trying to prevent the sabotage and making sure the aca is strengthened, he said in an interview in his capitol hill office.\n\nthat sabotage includes trump's decision to stop reimbursing insurance companies for discounts they're required by law to give to their lowest-income clients, pallone said.\n\nhe also cited a department of health and human services rule change that allows insurance policies that don't carry the full benefits required by the aca to be renewed for up to three years. in the past, those plans were intended to serve as a bridge for someone between jobs and were limited to just a few months\n\npallone said these and other changes may violate the law.\n\ni think if you do some good oversight and find out what the sabotage consists of, then you can say, 'well this isn't allowed under the law,'  pallone said. and then you either take it to court or try to get legislation passed.\n\noversight is a powerful tool, said chiquita brooks-lasure, a former hhs official who is now a managing director at manatt health strategies, a consulting firm.\n\ni don't think we should underestimate how important that is, when decisions that are being made are questioned and officials have to defend them, she said.\n\nfor the past two years, the focus in washington has been on repealing or dismantling the affordable care act. that's about to change, she said.\n\nthat energy can now shift to examining what the administration is doing and putting forth other ideas and other proposals, some of which might generate bipartisan agreement, she said.\n\npallone is hopeful that republicans may support some measure to shore up the aca. in the last congress, sen. lamar alexander, r-tenn., proposed bills that would restore those payments to insurers, and he backed a plan to create a reinsurance program that could help reduce premiums.\n\npallone acknowledged democrats' plans are much less ambitious than the medicare-for-all proposals that many of his colleagues touted during their campaigns.\n\ni just think it's unlikely that we could ever pass it, he said. so i don't want to prioritize that.

policy that was, at best, indifferent to what was happening to baylor women, jim dunnam, a lawyer representing 15 women in an ongoing case against the university, told npr.\n\nwhen starr took over the presidency at baylor university in 2010, he appeared to have quickly grasped the importance of athletics at the division i school. as president, he oversaw the opening of the university's $250 million football stadium. before some games, he even ran onto the football field and cheered alongside students.\n\nhowever, shortly after starr's arrival on campus, baylor athletics became marred by sexual assault allegations and convictions.\n\naccording to a 2016 report from the wall street journal, the sexual assault scandal that plagued baylor during starr's tenure included at least 17 women who had reported sexual or domestic assault involving 19 football players since 2011. the reports included four instances of alleged gang rapes, according to the journal.\n\nconvictions soon followed. in 2014, former baylor football player tevin elliott was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison on two counts of sexually assaulting a former baylor student in 2012.\n\nwhen another football player was convicted of sexual assault the following year, starr called for an internal inquiry into how the university handled the case. the internal inquiry led starr to recommend that the university hire outside counsel to look into the school's response.\n\na fundamental failure\n\nthe results of the inquiry were damning. according to a summary of the findings of the law firm pepper hamilton released by the university in 2016, the investigators discovered a fundamental failure by baylor to implement title ix, the federal law that polices sexual violence on campus, as well as the violence against women reauthorization act.\n\nthe report expanded on several ways the university fell short, finding:\n\nbaylor failed to take appropriate action to respond to reports of sexual assault and dating violence reportedly committed by football players. the choices made by football staff and athletics leadership, in some instances, posed a risk to campus safety and the integrity of the university. in certain instances, including reports of a sexual assault by multiple football players, athletics and football personnel affirmatively chose not to report sexual violence and dating violence to an appropriate administrator outside of athletics.\n\nthe summary of the report didn't identify any of baylor's top administrators by name, but stated that senior leadership had failed to support and engage with the school's title ix functions, and that institutional failures at every level of baylor's administration had impacted response to individual cases of alleged assault.\n\nstarr declined npr's request to comment on this story, writing in an email that, for now, he's remaining silently on the media sidelines.\n\nbut in a 2018 interview with npr, starr said this about the baylor scandal: unfortunately — and this is going to sound like an apologia, but it is the absolute truth — never was it brought to my attention that there were these issues. and i focused on student safety from day one.\n\nsoon after the report was released, the school's athletics director resigned after being sanctioned and put on probation, and the head football coach was fired, along with other members of the athletics program. starr was stripped of the presidency, and subsequently resigned from his faculty position.\n\nthe same year, a case was filed against baylor alleging violations of title ix and a deliberately indifferent response to student-on-student sexual assault. according to an early complaint filed in the case, reports of sexual assault to high-level, policy-setting employees at baylor failed to result in change at the university.\n\nstarr was at the helm the entire period of time, said dunnam, one of the plaintiff lawyers in the case, which remains ongoing.\n\nwhen asked how much he thinks starr knew of the school's sexual assault problem, dunnam pointed to a lesser-known 2014 report by the consulting firm margolis healy & associates that was also commissioned by the university and obtained by the waco tribune-herald in 2018.\n\nthe report outlined how administrators, including athletic department staff, had received little to no training regarding title ix, and had failed to adequately communicate with and support students. one person the firm interviewed said, we have to stop being stupid. the margolis healy report was delivered to baylor almost two years before starr was ousted in 2016. starr has claimed it as evidence of the university's commitment to addressing student safety.\n\nstill, the specifics of how starr handled the scandal remain unknown. the 2016 pepper hamilton report was never released in full.\n\nbut that could change. last march, a federal judge in texas ordered the law firm to turn over records connected to its 2016 inquiry into baylor requested by the plaintiffs.\n\naccording to the firm's initial summary, it reviewed emails, cellphone data and documents from current and former baylor employees, as well as interviews with more than 65 people, including witnesses in the president's office as part of its investigation. for now, says dunnam, the case is still in discovery.\n\nafter baylor, starr joined the lanier law firm in 2018, and became a frequent commentator and defender of the president on fox news. those appearances have helped return starr to the center of yet another presidential impeachment.
vatican sex crimes investigator on summit\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\narchbishop charles scicluna of malta is the vatican's top sex crimes investigator. he joins us now from rome.\n\nwelcome to the program.\n\ncharles scicluna: thank you. thank you, lulu.\n\ngarcia-navarro: the pope ended the summit calling for all-out battle against abuse by priests. what does that mean?\n\nscicluna: it means that the guidelines we have, the laws we have need to be implemented across the board. but it also means a change of heart. he talked about conversion because this is a fight against one of the greatest evils. and this is, obviously, theological language. but it is a very important language for us. the pope, actually, put the abuse of kids and cover-up of that abuse on the same level of gravity. and we need to get it right.\n\ngarcia-navarro: what are the next steps though? for example, former cardinal theodore mccarrick was defrocked earlier this month. in fact, you were instrumental in that decision. victims want zero tolerance and that all priests who are found guilty have the same thing happen. will it?\n\nscicluna: well, first of all, that is the law for the united states of america and canada. victims also need to be reminded that we need to be reminded of the very important words by saint john paul ii, who said that people should know that there is no place in the priesthood for anybody who would harm the young, who would harm our kids. and this has to be the way forward.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so you think that the pope now will embrace that for every single diocese in the world.\n\nscicluna: i think that the quote from saint john paul ii has been policy since 2002. now we need to audit ourselves in order to make sure that that is the case.\n\ngarcia-navarro: are you saying that this needs to happen everywhere now? when a priest has been convicted of a sex crime, he should be defrocked everywhere.\n\nscicluna: i wouldn't say defrocked. he should not be in ministry. and that is something that people need to know. he will not be in parishes. he will not be around with kids.\n\ngarcia-navarro: you have been working on clerical sex abuse cases for decades. you are the top investigator now. under benedict, now pope emeritus, you were the church's top sex crimes prosecutor, before that, the vatican's promoter of justice. and yet this problem persists. why has it persisted? and is there something that you think should've been done earlier?\n\nscicluna: well, sin will always be with us. and crime will always happen. i don't think that we can guarantee that no unfortunate incident of sex abuse will ever happen again. but we will do whatever it takes to prevent it from happening. this is something that we owe our church, we owe our faith community. yet...\n\ngarcia-navarro: are there any regrets on your part, though, archbishop? - because the church is in crisis.\n\nscicluna: well, i think crisis is also an opportunity. and i think that this is a moment where we need to listen to the victims, to the communities there asking that we get it right. this will not go away easily. this will create a lot of hurt. but the united states has moved - i'm talking about the catholic church in the united states - has moved forward since 2002. the united states catholic church is an example of good practice.\n\ngarcia-navarro: archbishop, why should anyone trust that the church will do anything different? we're talking tens of thousands of victims - conservatively - a culture of secrecy that hid crimes, that protected abusers, that silenced victims. these new revelations continue. why should they trust the church?\n\nscicluna: that is a legitimate question. we need to own our credibility on a day by day basis. and there is no easy way to be credible but doing the right thing.\n\ngarcia-navarro: archbishop charles scicluna of malta, thank you so much.\n\nscicluna: thank you. thank you, lulu.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
examining the lure of isis in 'another world'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of tristram kenton/national theatre courtesy of tristram kenton/national theatre\n\nin a darkened london theater, the first thing the audience hears is the rhythmic chanting of an a capella islamic state anthem.\n\nanother world: losing our children to islamic state, currently at the national theatre, is a play about young people seduced by the group. the main characters are three mothers whose children left their homes in europe to join isis.\n\nin one scene, a belgian mother named yasmine recounts how she found out her 20-year-old son had left for syria. he'd told her he was going on a beach vacation to morocco with a friend.\n\nhe phoned his brother, telling him he had entered the land of sham, and that he didn't want to come back here — that he didn't belong here anymore in this country, yasmine says. i heard this word, 'syria, syria' — and i felt the world fall on top of me. i didn't see it coming. i haven't done my job as a mother properly.\n\nthis is verbatim theater — a mix of journalism and art. the whole script is taken directly from interviews with real people, including three mothers whom director nicolas kent interviewed last year at a community center in brussels' largely muslim neighborhood of molenbeek.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of tristram kenton/national theatre courtesy of tristram kenton/national theatre\n\nwe don't change anyone's words. we obviously have to cut them down because we have 50 hours of interviews, but the play lasts only two hours, kent tells npr backstage. so this is an edited version, but it sticks with what people have said and the spirit of what they've said.\n\nover six months, starting last summer, kent also interviewed british anti-terrorism officials, a former guantanamo bay detainee and gen. john allen, who at the time was president obama's adviser on isis. all their words form parts of the play.\n\nthe actor who plays yasmine, nathalie armin, listened to tapes of interviews with the real yasmine in french — even though she doesn't speak the language.\n\ni was very — is seduced the right word? [i was] taken by her pauses. the rhythms of her speaking are what struck me while i was listening, armin says. i suppose that's inevitable if you don't understand what somebody is saying — you listen to it almost musically.\n\nin the fall, just as kent and the play's co-creator, gillian slovo, were finishing the script and rehearsals were already underway, bombs went off in paris — and four months later, in brussels.\n\nso the story has surrounded us in every way, kent recalls. we started being at a distance to the story, and we landed absolutely in the center of the story.\n\nbefore staging the play, kent, slovo and some of the actors returned to brussels to share the final script with the women whose words form its basis. they discovered something terrible.\n\nwe went to molenbeek to visit the characters that we play — the mothers, armin says. but the mother i play wasn't there. we discovered from the other mothers that the reason for this was that she found out her son had been in the paris attacks.\n\nyasmine's son was one of the suicide bombers who blew himself up outside a paris soccer stadium on nov. 13, part of coordinated attacks that killed 130 people, for which isis claimed responsibility.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of tristram kenton/national theatre courtesy of tristram kenton/national theatre\n\nkent decided to change the script at the last minute to include what happened. so at the end of the play, armin pulls back her headscarf and breaks character. she explains what happened when they went to molenbeek that day, and what they learned.\n\nwhen that part of the play is performed, you can hear the audience gasp — as we did when we heard it, kent says.\n\nanother world: losing our children to islamic state closes this weekend at london's national theatre. but later this month, it will be staged again — at a high school in a poor, largely muslim area of the british capital.

'power poses' co-author: 'i do not believe the effects are real'\n\nted talks youtube\n\nperhaps, you're among the more than 36 million people that have watched social psychologist and harvard professor amy cuddy's ted talk about power poses — poses she says would make people feel more powerful and more willing to take risks. for example, poses like leaning back in your chair or standing with your hands on your hips.\n\ncuddy, a body language expert, has built much of her career on power poses. in addition to a myriad of speaking engagements, she's been widely featured in the media including the wall street journal, new york times and cnn discussing the benefits of and science behind power posing.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption stacey a. kamp/stacey a. kamp stacey a. kamp/stacey a. kamp\n\nthe idea of power poses came from a 2010 psychological science study co-authored by cuddy and two then-columbia university professors, andy yap and dana carney.\n\nbut last sunday, carney dismissed everything that cuddy has been teaching about power poses. now an associate professor at university of california, berkeley, carney posted on her faculty website that she has no faith in the embodied effects of power poses.\n\nas evidence has come in over these past 2+ years, my views have updated to reflect the evidence. as such, i do not believe that 'power pose' effects are real, her post said.\n\nif you go back and you see the technology section of any newspaper, i'm going to guess that a small share of the things that are in the future ever become the present. the journals in science are a bit like that.\n\ncarney based her revised analysis on failed replications of the data and her hindsight view that she and fellow researchers engaged in some aspects of data dredging.\n\nit's almost unprecedented in the psychological-research field for one to make such an admission and as boldly carney.\n\nnpr reached out to cuddy for a response to carney's claims and a representative from her publisher. nicole dewey of little, brown and company, issued a reply via email. cuddy expressed surprise at carney's post and noted that since her first published evidence, the power posing effect has been replicated in several other published studies from different labs.\n\nshe said, i have confidence in the effects of expansive postures on people's feelings of power — and that feeling powerful is a critical psychological variable. you can read carney's full response at the end of this article.\n\nnpr's simon scott spoke with uri simonsohn, a behavioral scientist at the wharton school of business, about the power poses research, the implications of caddy's actions in the scientific research community and about whether we should take similar studies seriously.\n\ntoggle caption courtesy tommy leonardi/courtesy tommy leonardi\n\ninterview highlights contain some web only content\n\non what the initial study suggested and where it went wrong\n\nlike much of science, early findings are tentative and should be followed up. that's at one level and at the other level, psychology has been changing a lot in the last five, six years. people have been doing more rigorous, more large sample studies, more careful descriptions. and this study was conducted before all the change was happening and so the standards were lower; at least as seen from the current perspective.\n\non if the researchers reached these conclusions to give a ted talk\n\ni don't think so. i can't imagine they were thinking about a ted talk at the time. and so, i think it's important to distinguish between the regional, narrow, a little dry paper that came out in 2010, that dana's talking about and then the ted talk, which is inspired by that study but also talks a lot by amy cuddy's personal experiences. i think of that talk of more a motivational speaker, more than a scientific presentation.\n\non if cuddy's motivational talk was grounded with scientific research\n\ni think so. so maybe the scientific foundation was exaggerated or over perceived. but i think it's useful to keep those two separate, so dana carney and amy cuddy have thought of this from different perspectives; one much more basic science, the other much more in terms of giving advice.\n\non if an alarm bell went off when he first heard about power poses\n\nnot particularly. i wasn't aware of it until maybe 2003/2004. the alarm's bell for me came up recently, maybe a year or so ago when a team of researchers in switzerland failed to replicate it. and then the original authors summarized the entire body of work that had looked at this and me and some co-authors, we have a tool – have a physical tool – that will also tell you if a body of work has what you call, evidential value.\n\nif you should trust it, if there's reason to believe as whole, it's telling you what you think it's telling you. and when we apply that technique to the entire body of work on power posing, we found that no, that there's no reason to believe that and you should be quite skeptical of the existing evidence. that doesn't mean that effect couldn't be documented in the future, it just means the existing evidence for it doesn't have the value that you wish it.\n\nif in hindsight, the research was flawed by inadequate design from the get-go\n\nif you think about the time, the only thing i'd say is, it had a small sample. but studies back then – and it's funny because it's only six years ago, but a lot has changed – it was very common to have a very small sample. and dana also talks about choices they made when they were reporting that in hindsight seem like that's not the ideal way of doing things.\n\nimagine you're doing a journalistic story and you want to prove a point. so you ask one person a question and you don't quite like the answer, so you say, i'm going to ask five people, best out of five. so if after five people you don't get it, you say best out of 10. and once you have 10 people, if the answer looks good, then you stop.\n\nand so that kind of thing used to be quite common in psychology. it actually is – to the surprise of some – it's also common out of branches of science and biology. it's not uncommon for people to run, say five miles and if things don't look that promising, they collect another five miles. and so, those kinds of things that seem innocent end up messing up the statistical analysis.\n\non if we should we take a clue from this when we read other studies\n\ni think, by the time we're communicating with the media, it should be very well established – to the general public, i mean. so i think textbooks would be better than the most recent study. and if we're covering the most recent study, we should realize, these are ideas, these are prototypes.\n\nso we should think about when companies said; the way we're talking now about self-driving cars, it's promising, we think it's going to happen, but we're not reporting that the streets are filled with them right now. and a lot of time when we have this prototype of ideas and we have the first of two studies, the media and people like to think of them as, this is done. ... and we're really just starting with them.\n\njust think about it, if you go back and you see the technology section of any newspaper, i'm going to guess that a small share of the things that are in the future ever become the present. the journals in science are a bit like that. they are very well informed guesses about what's going to happen next. but they're not solid knowledge that we should take for granted.\n\non if it's difficult for a scientist to say i was wrong\n\ni think it is incredibly difficult and that's why i think very highly of dana for having done this. because, basically, what she did wrong, quote-unquote, is what people thought was normal back when she did it. what she's doing now, is not normal. it is very unusual for somebody to look back at their own work and come forward publicly with nothing to gain and say, you know what, i don't think that this is really there and i'm just going to share my skepticism. ... that is very, very rare.
trump officials approve tennessee's controversial request to revamp medicaid funding\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tasos katopodis/getty images tasos katopodis/getty images\n\nwith less than a dozen days left in power, the trump administration on friday approved a radically different medicaid financing system in tennessee. with this move, the federal government is for the first time granting a state broader authority in the operation of its health insurance program for the poor without interference from washington, allowing tennessee to make decisions on such issues as whether to add new benefits or eligibility categories or spend medicaid dollars outside of health care, if it thinks that would help enrollees.\n\ninstead of the open-ended federal contribution to the funding of medicaid in all other states — which increases with higher enrollment and associated health costs — tennessee will instead get a capped amount of money, via an annual block grant.\n\nthe annual funding cap will increase if enrollment grows. what's different is that, unlike with other states, medicaid funding to tennessee won't automatically keep up with rising expenses.\n\nthe approval is a 10-year experiment, according to friday's announcement by seema verma, administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services. the approach has been pushed for decades by conservatives who say states too often chafe under strict federal guidelines about enrollment and coverage. they think they can find ways to provide care more efficiently, she says.\n\nbut michele johnson, executive director of the tennessee justice center sees the move as a step backward for the state's medicaid program.\n\nno other state has sought a block grant, and for good reason, johnson says. it gives state officials a blank check and creates financial incentives to cut health care to vulnerable families.\n\ntennessee is one of 12 states that have not approved expanding medicaid under the affordable care act – a decision that's left tens of thousands of working adults in tennessee without health insurance.\n\nwhether this change in the way tennessee's medicaid program is funded will stick is an open question. the incoming biden administration is likely to oppose the move, but to unravel it, officials would need to set up a review that includes a public hearing.\n\nimplementing such a fundamental change via an executive branch action rather than getting congress to amend medicaid law is also likely to be met with court challenges.\n\nin any event, the changes to the state's program will take months to implement because the shift in policy requires final approval by the legislature, and officials in tennessee must also negotiate quality of care targets with the administration.\n\ntenncare, the state's medicaid program, says the new system would give it unprecedented flexibility to decide who is covered and what services it will pay for.\n\nunder the agreement, tenncare will have a specified annual spending cap, to be based on historical spending, inflation and predicted future enrollment changes. if the state can operate the program at a lower cost than the cap and maintain or improve quality, the state then shares in the savings.\n\ntrump administration officials say the approach adds incentive for the state to save money, unlike the current system, in which increased state spending is matched with more federal dollars. if medicaid enrollment grows, the state can secure additional federal funding. if enrollment drops, it will get less money.\n\nthis groundbreaking waiver puts guardrails in place to ensure appropriate oversight and protections for beneficiaries, while also creating incentives for states to manage costs — while holding them accountable for improving access, quality and health outcomes, verma said. it's no exaggeration to say that this carefully crafted demonstration could be a national model moving forward.\n\nthe agreement is somewhat different from traditional block grants championed by conservatives, the cms notes, since it allows tennessee to get more federal funding as enrollment grows. and while the state is given flexibility to increase benefits, it can't on its own cut benefits.\n\nhowever, opponents — including most advocates for low-income americans — say the approach will threaten care for the 1.4 million people in tenncare — a group that includes children, pregnant women and the disabled. federal funding covers two-thirds of the cost of the program.\n\ndemocrats have fought back against block grant medicaid proposals since the reagan administration and most recently in 2018 as part of republicans' failed effort to repeal and replace major parts of the affordable care act. even some key republicans opposed the idea because it would cut billions in funding to states, and that would make it harder to help the poor.\n\nthe approval of tennessee's request comes as medicaid enrollment is at its highest-ever level.\n\nmore than 76 million americans are covered by the state-federal health program — a million more than when the trump administration took charge in 2017. enrollment has jumped by more than 5 million in the past year as the economy slumped with the pandemic.\n\nmedicaid, part of president lyndon b. johnson's great society initiative of the 1960s, is an entitlement program in which the government pays each state a certain percentage of the cost of care for anyone eligible for the health coverage. as a result, the more money states spend on medicaid, the more they get from washington.\n\nthe newly approved demonstration project in tennessee calls for cms to work with the state to set spending targets that will increase at a fixed amount each year.\n\nthe plan also includes a safety valve to increase federal funding in the case of unexpected increases in enrollment.\n\nthe safety valve will maintain tennessee's commitment to enroll all eligible tennesseans with no reduction in today's benefits for beneficiaries, according to a cms written statement.\n\ntennessee has committed to maintaining coverage for eligible beneficiaries and existing services while staying under the spending targets.\n\nin exchange for taking on this financing approach, the state will receive a range of operating flexibilities from the federal government, as well as up to 55% of the savings generated on an annual basis when spending falls below the aggregate spending cap and the state meets certain quality targets, yet to be determined.\n\nthe state can spend that money on various health programs for residents, plus areas that medicaid funding typically doesn't cover, such as improving transportation and education and employment for enrollees.\n\nten years is an unusually long time for a federally granted waiver of its rules, but the trump administration has approved other long-term experiments in recent years to give states more flexibility.\n\nthe block grant is just another example of putting politics ahead of health care during this pandemic, says johnson of the tennessee justice center. now is absolutely not the time to waste our energy and resources limiting who can access health care.\n\nstate officials in tennessee applauded the approval.\n\nit's a legacy accomplishment, says gov. bill lee, a republican. this new flexibility means we can work toward improving maternal health coverage and clearing the waiting list for developmentally disabled.\n\nthis means we will be able to make additional investments in tenncare without reduction in services and provider cuts.\n\nkaiser health news is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the kaiser family foundation, and is

time for sports.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nsimon: bama - and since this is npr, i'll explain that's short for alabama - beat notre dame - a university, not a cathedral - in the rose bowl. ohio state upset - i'll say they're upset - clemson in the sugar bowl. and more women shatter more glass ceilings this week in sports.\n\ntom goldman joins us. tom, thanks so much for being with us.\n\ntom goldman, byline: well, you're welcome. and happy new year, scott.\n\nsimon: and happy new year to you, too, my friend. alabama - 31-14 last night. ohio state stunned clemson, which had been no. 2 - not anymore - 49-28. justin fields, the ohio state quarterback, had six touchdowns, i believe. and i want the bears to sign him right now. what a game.\n\ngoldman: (laughter) wow. you know, for those who didn't see, scott, he took a nasty hit to the ribs in the first half - a hit so nasty, the defensive player who speared him with his helmet was kicked out of the game. fields kept playing and visibly wincing. and he ended up throwing four touchdown passes after the hit, giving him, as you said, a total of six, leading ohio state to a win that avenged a loss to clemson in last year's college football playoff. so, yeah, i think that qualifies as valiant on a football field.\n\nsimon: what does a national championship really mean this year, though?\n\ngoldman: well, that's a very good question. and i think what you're saying is it doesn't mean as much because of the way college football lurched through the season - you know, many games canceled, many players, coaches tested positive for the coronavirus. nearly 20 bowl games were called off because of the pandemic. and ohio state, in fact, only managed to play and win six games before last night. and some, including clemson head coach dabo swinney, said that should've disqualified ohio state from playing in the college football playoff. then you had the big ten conference change some rules to make it so ohio state could qualify for the playoff. and the buckeyes got some players back early after they'd tested positive for the coronavirus so they could play in yesterday's game.\n\nafter all that, you still have two college football powers playing in the title game, and with fields and the buckeyes earning a lot of new fans after last night, the college football season will probably end up meaning a lot to a lot of people, especially in alabama and ohio.\n\nsimon: let me ask you about a couple things that happened this week shattering glass ceilings and follow a theme this year. becky hammon became the first woman to serve as head coach in an nba game when gregg popovich got the toss for rejecting - for arguing a call from the spurs. so she, for about a half, coached the spurs. and then the red sox are hiring bianca smith as a minor league baseball coach, the first african american woman in that position. 2020's been quite a year.\n\ngoldman: it has been. you know, it's interesting, too, about hammon. you know, she acknowledged the moment after the game, but mostly, she seemed like any coach who was annoyed after a loss.\n\nsimon: (laughter).\n\ngoldman: and, you know, that's how...\n\nsimon: yeah.\n\ngoldman: ...you hope the moment can be significant, too, if it normalizes having a woman in that position so other females with basketball experience and knowledge can get there, too. they're out there, scott, and have been out there. hammon just got the first chance. and, you know, you mentioned bianca smith.\n\ni mean, we've all - you know, we're relieved to see 2020 behind us, but it was important, as you say, for women and milestones. alyssa nakken of the san francisco giants became the first on-field coach in major league baseball. kim ng...\n\nsimon: yup.\n\ngoldman: ...you know, remember, hired as the team's general manager, the miami marlins' first woman, first asian american to have that job. and then sarah fuller of vanderbilt - first woman to play in a top-tier college football conference. so it was a banner year for women in milestones. we'll see if 2021 can continue that trend.\n\nsimon: npr sports correspondent tom goldman, thanks so much for being with us.\n\ngoldman: you're welcome.\n\n(soundbite of preservation hall jazz band's kreyol)\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
u.s. manufacturers brace for trump's next trade targets\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jabin botsford/the washington post/getty images jabin botsford/the washington post/getty images\n\nwhen donald trump takes to twitter, some companies shudder.\n\nthis week, ford motor co. said it would scrap a $1.6 billion plant in mexico in favor of expanding an existing one in michigan. that happened on the same day the president-elect tweeted criticism of general motors for manufacturing its chevy cruze vehicles in mexico.\n\ngm says only a small number of the cars produced in mexico are sold in the u.s., but that's a detail that may not register with the public.\n\neconomist barry bosworth of the brookings institution says of companies that produce consumer goods: they can't afford bad publicity.\n\nbosworth notes that so far trump's targets are companies that are expanding or planning to build operations in mexico. he has not singled out u.s. companies that built plants there long ago.\n\nu.s. firms' investment plans in mexico mexico is a global business center, with industries ranging from aerospace to autos operating factories and research facilities there. the following is a sample of u.s. firms' recent investment plans announced for mexico. cisco systems plans to spend up to $4 billion to expand production.\n\nwal-mart says it will invest $1.3 billion in logistics, including building and expanding distribution centers.\n\nspectrum aeronautical is investing $300 million to build an aircraft assembly plant.\n\nkansas city southern plans to invest about $154 million in mexico rail operations.\n\nautomotive wheel manufacturer prime wheel plans a $60 million expansion to boost production.\n\nhoneywell plans to invest about $15 million to upgrade its plant in mexicali.\n\nmetlife plans an $11 million global distribution and support center. sources: mexico business blog, published reports\n\nhe focuses in on these individual cases, says bosworth, but there doesn't seem to be a rule.\n\nin november, under pressure from trump, heating and cooling firm carrier corp., a subsidiary of united technologies, said it would keep hundreds of jobs in indiana instead of moving them to a plant in mexico.\n\nwho might be next?\n\nbosworth says the trump twitter spotlight is shining the most on big companies with well-known household brands.\n\nautomakers are especially at risk because of the sector's high volume of cross-border trade, and because it is so vulnerable to consumer opinion.\n\nbosworth says going after a maker of obscure chemicals or a small firm that makes car components doesn't produce great headlines, nor does it move public sentiment. trump's focus is on finished products.\n\nif they're not assembled, they can't be identified in the terms of a specific model of a general motors car, bosworth says. it doesn't have the same public appeal.\n\ntrump has talked tough on china trade as well, but bosworth notes he has not gone after individual companies — apple, for example, and its huge iphone assembly operations there. china's economy is almost as big as the u.s.'s, and it has the power to inflict lots of pain on u.s. companies, like boeing — so interfering there could backfire for american workers.\n\nbosworth says picking on mexico is like fighting the weak kid on the playground: it's less likely to elicit a retaliatory response. u.s. companies are the biggest foreign investors in mexico, and u.s.-mexico trade is worth about half a trillion dollars annually.\n\nit's a much weaker economy, bosworth notes, much fewer options available to them.\n\neconomist derek scissors at the american enterprise institute says retailers, banks and other service providers aren't likely to be targeted. and, he says, he hopes the singling out of individual companies will stop once trump takes office.\n\nwhen you're president, you shouldn't be bothering one company. you should be changing policies such as corporate taxes, to change the whole landscape, scissors argues. getting down into the details can't be done by twitter.\n\nhe acknowledges that tweeting about trade does accomplish a few things. first, it appeals to trump's base.\n\nprobably the reason that he won the election is the effort to re-shore manufacturing, he says, not to accept it as inevitable that manufacturing will head overseas.\n\nthe tweets also telegraph a message, he says, not just to the specific companies trump has targeted, but also to firms in other industries which might be thinking about expanding elsewhere besides mexico.\n\nit's not going to stop at very high-profile manufacturers that consumers know about, scissors says. it will continue. he's just sending the signal now to everyone, 'this is your chance to make an adjustment.' 
logan act lingers for others in russia probe, as all eyes look up the trump ladder\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption brendan smialowski/afp/getty images brendan smialowski/afp/getty images\n\nupdated dec. 1 at 5:01 p.m. et\n\nmichael flynn, president trump's former national security adviser, pleaded guilty friday to providing false statements to the fbi. those are less serious charges than he could have faced, because he is cooperating with special prosecutor robert mueller's investigators.\n\nflynn likely has something to trade, as npr's carrie johnson noted on all things considered friday. flynn was not acting alone, according to charging documents against him. in fact, there were multiple members of the presidential transition team who spoke with flynn about his communications with the russian ambassador.\n\nthat included a very senior member, who directed flynn to contact officials from foreign governments, including russia ... several news organizations have identified that individual as jared kushner, president trump's son-in-law.\n\nthe logan act often comes up in relation to the russia investigation. back in february, we noted that flynn himself could have violated it. but now that mueller is looking up the food chain, we dug out and refreshed our post explaining what it is, why it matters — and why it is seldom used.\n\nwhat is the logan act?\n\nthe logan act states, in part (emphasis ours):\n\nany citizen of the united states, wherever he may be, who, without authority of the united states, directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes or controversies with the united states, or to defeat the measures of the united states, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n\nlet's break that down. this is saying that no private person can try to conduct foreign policy without the permission of the u.s. government.\n\nspecifically, that person isn't allowed to talk with a foreign government or its representative and try to influence foreign policy — directly or indirectly.\n\nwhen was it put in place and why?\n\nit's named for dr. george logan, a democratic-republican party lawmaker from pennsylvania, who traveled to france in 1798 and negotiated the lifting of an embargo and the release of american sailors held captive in french prisons.\n\nhe did so without the permission of president john adams, though he was a friend of then-vice president thomas jefferson's.\n\nit was after the french revolution, and the united states didn't help france because of a treaty with england. the french were upset and began robbing passing american ships and jailing its sailors.\n\nofficial adams administration envoys tried unsuccessfully to settle the unrest with france — and the country appeared tumbling toward war with france. that's when logan, a quaker, embarked on his effort.\n\nhe succeeded, but when he got back to the u.s., adams, washington and others were furious. congress then acted to bar actions like logan's from taking place again.\n\nhas anyone ever been convicted of violating it?\n\nno.\n\nthis is important, because as often as this law is mentioned, no one has ever gone to jail for it, meaning the likelihood of its being used is pretty slim.\n\nwhy hasn't anyone been convicted?\n\noften, the people who get mentioned are people who are in government and seem to defy the sitting president. for example, remember when then-house speaker john boehner invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to address congress?\n\nobama and netanyahu had an icy relationship because of israeli settlement expansion. (ironic considering what the charging documents say flynn did in trying to get russia to vote a certain way on a united nations resolution dealing with that very issue.)\n\nso some people raised the logan act and whether boehner was in violation. most said no. here's why, per the washington post:\n\nthat's partly because the law is vague about which branch of government can give permission for someone to conduct foreign affairs, noted eugene volokh with the volokh conspiracy blog at the post in 2015. it could be the executive branch, it could be congress. it could even be the president telling just one member of congress to go do something without telling the others. it seems like [there] are so many loopholes and uncertainties, it's hard for prosecutors to peg down how someone violated this law — and even harder for courts to make that determination. but the law is pretty clear that you need to have permission from the government to do something, and it doesn't look like flynn had permission to talk to russians about sanctions while the obama administration was still in power.\n\nso has there ever been an attempt to prosecute someone for it?\n\nyes, once someone was indicted.\n\nthat was way back in 1803, four years after the law was enacted.\n\nan anonymous column ran in a kentucky newspaper arguing for a western america allied with france. the u.s. attorney for kentucky was an adams ally and persuaded a grand jury to indict francis flournoy, a farmer, who actually wrote the column.\n\nbut it never went to trial.\n\nlater that year, the louisiana purchase, which expanded the united states farther west, made it moot.\n\nhow else has the logan act been used?\n\nmostly as a political weapon.\n\nvarious courts have mentioned the logan act, according to the congressional research service, but it has mostly been used to try to shame political opponents.\n\nfor example, in the 1980s, there was house speaker jim wright's relationship with the sandinista government in nicaragua — and jesse jackson negotiating in syria and cuba for prisoner releases.\n\nthat is the law of the land, a frustrated president ronald reagan said in an interview in 1984 of the logan act and jackson's efforts.\n\nhe added, we are not going to take legal action, but i do feel that while in this instance he was successful, there were things that make you pause and think.\n\nok, that was the 1980s. has it been mentioned more recently?\n\nyes, lots.\n\nduring the george w. bush administration, house speaker nancy pelosi took a trip to syria and talked about improving u.s.-syria relations with that government, irritating the white house.\n\nformer president jimmy carter also traveled to syria in 2008 to meet with hamas about mideast peace.\n\nas recently as 2015, the act was mentioned again when 47 republican u.s. senators wrote a letter to iran downplaying the nuclear deal. sen. tom cotton, who has been rumored to be in line as trump's next cia director, penned the letter — and was accused of violating the act.\n\nthe potential of a logan act violation was raised again when democratic rep. tulsi gabbard of hawaii met with syrian leader bashar assad in january of this year, before trump was sworn in.\n\ni wanted to see if there was, in some small way, a way that i could express the love and the aloha and the care that the american people have for the people of syria, she told cnn.\n\nthe obama administration's official position was regime change in syria. president trump has said the u.s. should work with russia to bring peace in syria. russia's policy is to leave assad in place.\n\ncould the very senior member be susceptible?\n\nwe noted in february that if flynn, in any way, reassured the russian ambassador in his phone conversations or texts that the incoming trump administration would loosen or drop the sanctions obama put in place, that could potentially be a violation.\n\nthat could be the same for whoever directed flynn (or whoever directed the person who directed flynn) if there was reassurance on sanctions.\n\nthe charging documents note that:\n\nflynn and the ptt official discussed the u.s. sanctions, including the potential impact of those sanctions on the incoming administration's foreign policy goals. the ptt official and flynn also discussed that the members of the presidential transition team at mar-a-lago did not want russia to escalate the situation.\n\nthe charging documents do not make clear what flynn urged exactly when it came to sanctions — if there was reassurance, for example. but there is a transcript of that call collected by the intelligence community, and presumably mueller's team has reviewed it.\n\nthe white house said in february it was confident flynn didn't say anything that violated the law.\n\nthere was nothing wrong or inappropriate about those discussions, then-white house press secretary sean spicer contended after flynn was fired in february.\n\nthe white house has not commented since flynn's guilty plea.
trump's census plan in peril as bureau expects february release of count results\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrew harrer/bloomberg via getty images andrew harrer/bloomberg via getty images\n\npresident trump's bid to alter a key set of census numbers has hit another snag with the census bureau uncovering even more irregularities with the 2020 head count and the expected release of numbers delayed again.\n\nas of dec. 29, the bureau's projected date for putting out new state population counts was feb. 9 — close to three weeks after the end of trump's term — but newly discovered anomalies may even further delay the release, justice department attorneys john coghlan and diane kelleher told u.s. district judge lucy koh during a court conference on monday.\n\nif these delays remain in place, trump would not get control of the numbers the president wants to alter as part of an ongoing effort to exclude unauthorized immigrants from a count that, according to the constitution, must include the whole number of persons in each state.\n\nthe numbers are used to determine each state's share of votes in the house of representatives and the electoral college for the next decade. last week, the commerce secretary, who oversees the bureau, missed the year-end legal deadline for reporting the population counts to the president, who is required to deliver the counts along with each state's new number of house seats to congress for certification.\n\nspeaking during a virtual conference for a national urban league-led lawsuit over the administration's last-minute changes to the census schedule, coghlan emphasized that the exact release date remains a moving target as the bureau keeps working on resolving the irregularities in the census records.\n\ncoghlan did not provide any details about the newly found anomalies, and the census bureau's public information office did not immediately respond to npr's inquiries.\n\nstill, monday's revelation further tightens the window for trump to try to make an unprecedented change in who is counted in a process that helps set the balance of power in congress and the electoral college long after trump's term ends.\n\nthe bureau usually takes about five months after the end of counting to review the results of each once-a-decade census to make sure no resident is counted more than once or in the wrong place. but after ending counting early in october, the trump administration forced the bureau to cut short the time for running quality checks to try to get the first set of results out before inauguration day.\n\nin november, the bureau's director, steven dillingham, announced that the agency had discovered processing anomalies that have occurred in past censuses. records collected about college students, many of whom were displaced from dormitories around census day because of the pandemic, have been particularly troublesome for the bureau in recent months.
how the storming of the capitol was — and wasn't — about police\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption olivier douliery/getty images olivier douliery/getty images\n\npeople around the world watched in shock on wednesday as thousands of trump supporters stormed the capitol building, descending on the halls of congress and postponing the vote that would make joe biden's election official. and while there was much to take in — windows shattered, trump flags waving, a man with his boots up on nancy pelosi's desk — many were particularly struck by what they saw from police at the scene. the police force seemed quickly overwhelmed and unable to secure the capitol. in some cases, officers were even criticized for appearing sympathetic to the will of the crowd.\n\nover and over in the news and on social media, people imagined how different — and likely more deadly — the police response would have been if those people lined up outside the barriers had been black or brown. and that alternate scenario is raising complicated questions about what role the police can, and should, play in response to protests, riots and mobs.\n\nbut alex vitale, author of the end of policing, says it's a mistake to boil wednesday's events down to questions of police force and tactics. rather, vitale, who is a professor of sociology and coordinator of the policing and social justice project at brooklyn college, says that, in addition to examining the role of the police in these incidents, we need to open up a broader conversation about race, politics and justice. (we'll be talking more about this, and other aspects of wednesday's events, on the next episode of the code switch podcast.)\n\nour conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nas you were watching the footage of what was going on at the capitol building on wednesday, what were you noticing? what stood out to you?\n\nwell, the thing that was most striking was the intense militancy of the crowd. the willingness of the demonstrators to engage in physical combat with the police — to fight with them over barricades, to fight with them with their own pepper spray and weapons. to see thousands of americans engaged in violent attacks on police is extremely rare in american history. and that was deeply concerning to me.\n\nwhat do you think made the people on wednesday feel empowered to confront the police in this violent way, as opposed to other situations?\n\ni think it's absolutely appropriate to talk about the racial disparities that are so crucial and so obvious. mostly peaceful demonstrations, not just this summer, but over the last six years, calling for fundamental rethinking of our use of police and the status of african-americans in our society have been met with very high levels of police violence, massive restrictions, criminal investigations, the labeling their movements as black identity extremists by federal law enforcement. the posture of police towards their demonstrations is entirely different. cori bush, a member of congress newly elected from st. louis, said if there had been black and brown people pushing through police lines, running up the capitol steps, people would have been shot down and at the very least, tear gassed and beaten. and i think that's absolutely correct.\n\nand i think that the kind of angry white man, white supremacy at the center of the movement we saw yesterday is emboldened by their racial status. they feel like they have the right to engage in this kind of behavior. clearly these white nationalists, extremists feel that they have the right to do this. and without having to worry about any consequences.\n\none of the scenes that i saw yesterday seemed like a strange inversion of what we've seen at some of the other protests from the past year. an african-american police officer was basically chased up the stairs of the capitol by a group of white people. and you could see in this video that he seemed perhaps afraid, but certainly questioning what to do in that moment, how much to react. he had a gun, which he seemed to reach for and didn't touch. did you see that scene, and what did you make of it?\n\nyes, i did see that. so we've seen a handful of videos that have shown either the d.c. metropolitan police or the capitol police sort of giving way to the demonstrators. and this has been used to talk about their alleged affinity with the demonstrators or their complicity in this kind of right wing politics. and while i'm sure there are officers who were very sympathetic to the protests and we know there are officers who buy into a lot of these conspiracy theories, i think if we look a little bit more carefully at these videos, what we see is officers who were overwhelmed by an extremely violent and persistent crowd and are making a discretionary judgment about the use of force in a situation where they have lost control.\n\nand i think if that african-american officer had started shooting people, then i think the national crisis we're experiencing right now would be worse. and we know that in one case, an officer did shoot someone to death, and i've seen those videos as well. this was someone trying to climb through a window into a more secure part of the capitol. and a lone officer made the decision to kill someone rather than to allow them into this more secure part of the capitol. and that, too, in my view, is a failure of policing.\n\ni've been hearing a lot is people saying, as you described, that the police were kind of letting this happen. that some police seemed sympathetic to what was happening. people described seeing some officers taking selfies with protesters. do you think that's what was happening on a larger scale?\n\nno, i don't. if you look really at a broad array of these videos, you see police really fighting to keep these demonstrators out of the capitol. several officers were injured, some seriously.\n\nnow, there was a failure of planning. there was a failure of deployment. there are ways that this could have been prevented. the fact that we got ourselves into this mess in the first place is the real problem. so, while there are clearly sympathies within law enforcement to the demonstrations, to the trump administration, to the kinds of conspiracy theories that they are in league with, i don't think that that is the way to understand what happened.\n\none of the things that i heard was people talking about the fact that the police weren't prepared for this moment. and people were contrasting that to, you know, the very geared up, militant looking police officers that were stationed around the capitol during some of the black lives matter protests over the summer. and whether that difference in preparation says a lot about who we expect to be violent and who we think of as a real threat in this country.\n\npolice, before a demonstration, engage in threat assessments. they gather intelligence, they sit around in a room, sometimes in consultation with political leaders. and they make a threat assessment. one of the things we know from extensive research is that these threat assessments are colored by police world views, which means that threats from the left and threats from racial minorities are always exaggerated, and threats from the right and from white nationalist groups are always diminished.\n\nso that, you know, left the capitol police and the d.c. metro police unprepared to manage the level of extremist violence that they were confronted with, and that then puts individual officers or groups of officers in this kind of untenable situation.\n\nanother theme that i saw coming out of all this was these different narratives about what to make of the way that police force was used. i saw some people saying, look at this reaction, this is proof that the police are ineffective! different people were saying, look at this, we need police to be stronger and more prepared and have more weapons at their disposal. and then i saw other people saying that this is how police should respond to any situation, with the sort of calm and restraint that kept things escalating even more. what did you take from wednesday's events? and what do you think other people should be considering?\n\ni think that it is a huge mistake, at the end of the day, to analyze this event in relationship to questions of policing. because even if we had the perfect police deployment, and the capitol was protected, [yesterday's violence] would have required high levels of force by police that would have just played into these existing polarizing narratives. it would have done nothing to resolve the underlying political problems, and might just have inflamed additional resentments. which then just means police have more work to do.\n\nso, yes, the policing did not work. it both failed to protect the capitol and used what i think is probably unnecessarily deadly force against people. it was a double failure. and then to the take away from that the message that, well, we just need to do more of that seems misguided. what we need is a real national reckoning about political responsibility for this mess we're in. and i think we're starting to move in that direction.\n\njust to put a finer point on it, where do you think the failures that led to yesterday stem from, and where do they need to be addressed?\n\ni think the real accountability for this rests with the trump administration and his core supporters. [the election marked] a repudiation of this politics in the national political arena. but we have to continue that process, that those members of congress who have supported this politics need to be voted out of office. and i think ultimately that is the most important form of accountability here, is the kind of popular rejection of this kind of white nationalist extremist politics. trying to use the criminal justice system to fix those political problems is not the right way to go and is unlikely to be successful.\n\nit's not a simple solution and it doesn't happen very quickly, right? it's going to be two more years almost until we have another round of congressional elections. and so we have to sustain this analysis. we have to sustain this anger and indignation about what's happening. and we have to turn that into real political power. and to see members of congress last night talking about using the sedition act against protesters as somehow the logical solution to this problem is a way of absolving their own responsibility for this mess.\n\nthe history of this is to turn what are essentially political problems over to the police to manage, whether it's mass homelessness or deep political divisions in our society or longstanding racial inequalities. the police are not capable of doing that. and to the extent that they attempt to do so, they often make those problems worse.\n\ni'm guessing there are a lot of people who might agree with what you're saying. but people who were also, in the moment, watching what was going on yesterday and having the sort of visceral reaction of: i want to see something happen. i want to see some consequences for people who feel like they have the right to just come in and storm the government and not fear any consequences.\n\nwell, look, americans are deeply committed to their retributive impulses. the united states has become a gigantic revenge factory. so obviously, people are falling back on these impulses — imagining justice as a question of punishment. imagining that accountability is going to be measured in years of incarceration.\n\nbut that is not the only possible way to imagine these things, right? there is going to be accountability for this, which is that these movements are going to become politically isolated. the politicians who support them are going to become politically isolated. we're already seeing that happen. i think that this is going to be a turning point in the kind of extremist trump ideology, and i think that the voters of georgia helped cement this, because this problem didn't just emerge yesterday on capitol hill. this was in charlottesville. this was in the streets of portland, oregon. this is an ongoing problem. and i think a majority of americans have spoken clearly against this approach. and i think that trend is going to continue.\n\nmany black people, and more broadly, other people of color, are not really under the illusion that the police are going to keep them safe. but a lot of white people are. and a lot of white people, i think, see chaos or violence or what they perceive to be dangerous situations and think, i want a police force. i want something standing in the way of me and violence. the solutions that you're talking about and the kind of radical change that we're talking about are obviously going to take time. in the meantime, how much is that fear of violence a barrier?\n\none of the major bulwarks of policing is not right wing extremists, it's centrist liberalism. it's the belief that what's most important is the production of order. and the willingness to to turn that problem over to police and the criminal legal system. and the kind of willful ignorance about what the consequences of that turning over are for the people who are subjected to it. so part of what's happening is a racial reckoning. that the folks who've been subjected to that system of order are unwilling to put up with it anymore.\n\nand so this continues to be the problem: whites who have benefited from this system of order continue to support order over justice. and what i think is being demanded in this moment is some courage. some willingness to stare a little bit of disorder in the face. as a necessary part of producing a more just and ultimately more stable society, because, look, our state, our society, is a mess. the standards of living are declining for all but the richest. people are miserable. and to say that we need to hold on to that system at the expense of racial justice because it's less scary is a profound kind of cowardice.
ireland resoundingly votes to legalize abortion\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jeff j. mitchell/getty images jeff j. mitchell/getty images\n\nupdated 2:19 p.m. et\n\nthe people of ireland voted overwhelmingly to repeal its restrictive abortion ban by changing the country's constitution.\n\nthe results were announced saturday evening, local time: out of the more than 2 million people who participated in friday's referendum to overturn the eighth amendment, which bans nearly all abortion in the socially conservative country, 66.4 percent voted for repeal and 33.6 percent voted against it.\n\nit was a difference of 706,349 votes, according to rté news.\n\npeople of all ages gathered outside the dublin castle to await the final news, holding posters, swaying their arms and singing an altered version of what's up by american rock band 4 non blondes: and i said, 'hey yeah yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah,' i said, 'hey. repeal the eighth.' \n\nthe top areas that supported the constitutional change were in dún laoghaire, a suburb of dublin (77 percent), and much of the capital city itself, reported rté news.\n\nexit polls indicated a resounding victory for people who favored the referendum. an irish times/ipsos mrbi poll late friday suggested a stunning victory of 68 percent to 32 percent. support came not only from major cities but also from rural areas.\n\nyounger voters showed more support for overturning the amendment than older voters did, according to rté exit poll projections. among people aged 18 to 24, 87.6 percent supported the repeal, compared with 63.7 percent of people aged 50 to 64. voters over the age of 65 were the only ones to come out against the repeal according to projections, with 58.7 percent voting no.\n\nthe poll also projected that about 66 percent of men and 72 percent of women supported the change.\n\nthe irish taoiseach, or prime minister, leo varadkar, reveled in saturday's landmark decision. he said, a quiet revolution has taken place, a great act of democracy.\n\nmary lou mcdonald — irish political party sinn fein's first new leader in 34 years — tweeted, i'm very pleased with the definitive result, the debate on the 8th was done on an all-island basis. we now need a single legal framework that allows for women to have access to the care that they need.\n\ndr. peter boylan, chairman of the institute of obstetricians and gynaecologists, was at the castle with fellow campaigners. in the weeks leading up to the historic vote, he incited controversy by saying that most members of the institute supported overturning the amendment.\n\ncora sherlock, who campaigned on a love both pro-life platform, tweeted, today is a sad day for ireland and for people who believe in genuine human rights. the struggle to defend the most vulnerable has not ended today, it's just changed. thank you to all the incredible people who worked so hard to protect women and save babies. we fight on.\n\na week prior to the vote, polls showed that the yes side was ahead but that its lead had narrowed from earlier surveys.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption peter morrison/ap peter morrison/ap\n\nabortion was illegal in ireland long before the eighth amendment was voted into the constitution through a public referendum in 1983. but catholic groups sought to solidify the provisions after roe v. wade made abortion in the united states legal in the 1970s.\n\nthe catholic church remained quiet during the country's heated debate this spring, and the clear embrace of abortion rights undermines its legacy. it is the final nail in the coffin for them. they're no longer the pillar of society, and their hopes of re-establishing themselves are gone, gail mcelroy, a professor of politics at trinity college dublin, told the new york times.\n\nireland has loosened other social constraints since the 1990s by legalizing easier access to contraception, divorce, homosexuality and same-sex marriage.\n\nsaturday's outcome paves the way for new legislation that will let women, who have had to travel abroad for abortions or take illegal drugs to induce them, the ability to seek out safe procedures in their home country.\n\nlawmakers say they hope to have a new law in place by the end of the year.
james comey: trump should be impeached but not federally prosecuted\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption chip somodevilla/getty images chip somodevilla/getty images\n\nformer fbi director james comey's new memoir has the misfortune of rendering a verdict on the trump presidency before what could be its most defining day.\n\ncomey's book was already finished before the violent mob incited by the president stormed the capitol last week, leading to five deaths.\n\ni was sickened, as i hope all americans were, watching an attack on the center of our democracy, comey says of the violence. and i was also angry as someone who spent a lot of a career in law enforcement; i was angry that it was being allowed to happen and that the capitol was not being adequately defended. it just mystified me and angered me.\n\nthe federal prosecutor in washington left open the possibility of charging trump over crimes related to the riot. washington, d.c.'s attorney general said the same. some democrats have also called for prosecuting trump over other potential crimes.\n\ncomey tells npr he thinks trump should be impeached but opposes a drawn-out federal criminal trial. i think it's still the best thing for the country not to have donald trump on our television screens every day for the next three or four years, he says.\n\ncomey's 2018 book, a higher loyalty: truth, lies and leadership, describes trump as unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. his latest offering, saving justice: truth, transparency and trust, continues to lay out his case against the trump administration while assessing former attorney general william barr and the mueller report. trump's firing of comey in 2017 helped set in motion what became robert mueller's investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\ncomey talked with npr's ailsa chang about the attack on the capitol, the response of law enforcement, his actions involving hillary clinton's email in 2016 and trying to convince people to believe the truth.\n\ninterview highlights\n\nthere were warnings that something on that scale was going to happen at the u.s. capitol. how concerned are you that law enforcement, potentially, even including the fbi, just were not ready for what happened?\n\nthat was the source of my anger as i watched it, because we were faulted as a government after 9/11 by the 9/11 commission for a failure of imagination, not imagining how the terrorists might attack us. this required no imagination at all. this was just a failure.\n\nbecause they were announcing they were coming. they were literally walking slowly down pennsylvania avenue. i don't know how the capitol was not fortified in an adequate way. and i think it'll be really important for all of us to find that out with a commission-type examination.\n\nyou do make the case at the end of your book that the justice department should not spend its time trying to prosecute donald trump after he leaves office for the sake of rebuilding national unity and moving on. do you still believe that, given last week's events, that donald trump should not be prosecuted?\n\nthat was a very close call when i wrote about it and finished the book back in the fall. it's even closer now, but i think it's still the best thing for the country not to have donald trump on our television screens every day for the next three or four years as part of united states v. trump in the district of columbia.\n\njoe biden and kamala harris are going to try to heal a country both spiritually and literally, because so many of our fellow citizens are sick and dying. and i just think donald trump's craving for attention is something we don't want to accommodate now. we don't want him center of our lives. i'd rather him in his bathrobe yelling at cars on the lawn at mar-a-lago with the camera lights off. i think that's the best thing for the country now. but look, i'm not sure that i'm right.\n\ndo you think he should at least be investigated for his role in what happened at the u.s. capitol?\n\ni think the congress has important interests to vindicate. i think he ought to be impeached. and ideally, he would be convicted by the senate and barred from further office. i also think that the local prosecutors in new york should continue their work to hold him accountable for his life of being a garden-variety criminal before he became president. i'm just talking about not giving him the platform of a daily drama outside the federal courthouse in washington, while joe biden is trying to change this country in a good way.\n\nyou mentioned the impeachment process, but impeachment is a political process, right? and you write in your book that for people to trust in the legal system, everyone needs to be held accountable under the law. so how does the country move on when you don't hold the president of the united states accountable under the law and you rely on a political process, assuming that states don't end up prosecuting?\n\nthat's what makes it such a close question. but i think slightly differently about the impeachment process. it's a deeply legal process embedded in our constitution, and it's about the american people, through their representatives, holding accountable the chief executive. and so i don't think of that if there were no federal prosecution as not holding him accountable. i think it's actually the most important form of accountability right now.\n\nthroughout the book, you talk about this reservoir of trust that's necessary for the justice department to function. in what way do you believe former attorney general bill barr eroded this trust you speak of when the mueller report was released?\n\nby lying to the american people about it in both written and in a brief press conference, misleading the american people so severely that later a federal judge wouldn't trust the department of justice's redactions or elimination of some texts from that in deciding what to make public. but that misleading the american people allowed the trump administration and their enablers to proclaim full vindication, complete vindication, this thing is over. when anyone who took the time to read the report knew that that was false.\n\nyou argue that mueller left himself wide open to having his findings distorted by bill barr and others. you say that was mueller's fault. can you just briefly explain that point?\n\ni think the world of bob mueller and i have worked with him and considered him a friend for a long time, but i think the way he handled the conclusion of his investigation allowed it to be distorted, lied about by the president and the attorney general. and the reason i say that is: bob did the old-school thing. he prepared a very long report in single-spaced, 12 times new roman with, i think, thousands of footnotes and sent that over as his report. well, that's not how americans consume information. i don't know that they ever did, but they certainly don't today. and that allowed the attorney general to go to the keyboard and write pithy letters and offer snapshots in a statement at a press conference to the american people, which drove the entire narrative.\n\nyou announced in a letter to congress just days before the 2016 presidential election that you were restarting the hillary clinton email investigation because of a new batch of emails that was discovered. do you think that you also left room for people to distort what you were, in fact, saying in that letter?\n\nyeah, i think that's fair. i mean, it's a different kind of situation, but it's the same basic challenge. how do you provide information that fosters the trust and the knowledge of the people that you're working for, the american people? the challenge there in late october was there was nothing we could say beyond that sparse letter that wouldn't magnify the harm that was flowing from our doing the notice in the first place. if i had included in there that we found hundreds of thousands of hillary clinton's emails on anthony weiner's laptop, i think i would have increased the harm. and so we wrestled with it. but there was no way to do less harm by speaking more at that point.\n\ni want to turn you now to the ultimate question that you pose in your book, and that is, how do you restore faith in the justice department given all that's happened the last four years? how optimistic are you that restoring that trust is possible?\n\ni'm very optimistic. it will take time. the easiest part's going to be restoring the morale and the operations of the department of justice because the culture is solid. the hard part is going to be reaching those americans, the tens of millions, literally, who are trapped in a fog of lies about the virus, about our institutions, including about the fbi and the justice department. it'll take time to win that back, to coax those people back to reality. but it'll happen. the work will prove itself.\n\nand the pick of judge [merrick] garland, who i don't know, seems to be the perfect person, as ed levi was when he became attorney general after watergate, to restore not just the internal operations of the department, but the way in which the american people see it as something nonpartisan, something above the tribal scrum in our country.\n\nyou continually argue in this book that truth is paramount, but how do you make the truth matter when it appears a lot of america does not agree on what the truth is?\n\nit's very hard. it requires constant attention. and you don't bring people out of a fog of lies by shouting at them that their facts are wrong.\n\nand so the way you do it is you show them what good looks like. and i'm optimistic that our new president is going to show what empathetic, competent leadership when we need it most looks like, and then people gradually awaken.\n\ni'm actually hoping that this horrific attack on the capitol is an inflection point in that sense, that if the numbers are to be believed, people are awakening more quickly even than i expected to what's really going on here. but it will take time. it'll be earned by the work and by transparency and communication with the american people.\n\nsam gringlas and courtney dorning produced and edited the audio interview. james doubek produced for the web.
here's why environmentalists are cheering the latest burger at sonic drive-in\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption the mushroom council the mushroom council\n\nit's a long way, metaphorically speaking, from the campus of the culinary institute of america in hyde park, n.y., to the sonic drive-in burger joints that line america's highways and small towns, particularly in the south.\n\ncome monday, though, two new items on sonic's menu will make that leap. they're blended beef-mushroom burgers, a food that the institute has boosted through its menus of change initiative. according to the institute, this is the kind of menu change that's a powerful, and previously underappreciated, way to drive improvements in our health and our planet.\n\nthe idea is that mixing chopped mushrooms into our burgers boosts the umami taste, adds more moisture and reduces the amount of beef required for a burger. and reducing the need for beef has a big impact on the environment. according to the world resources institute, if 30 percent of the beef in every burger in america were replaced by mushrooms, it would reduce greenhouse emissions by the same amount as taking 2.3 million vehicles off of our roads.\n\nsonic, though, isn't stressing the saving-the-planet angle. in a press release, the company's vice president of product innovation and development, scott uehlein, said that its new blended cheeseburgers, which contain 25 percent mushrooms, will deliver the juicy savory deliciousness you expect from a burger in a way that makes you feel like you're getting away with something.\n\nthe company promises that people eating the burger will get all this flavor but none of the guilt but does not reveal whether the guilt reduction will come from cutting calories or greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nrichard waite, from the world resources institute, is thrilled. i think it's great! he says. wri has been pushing the blended beef-mushroom burger as a candidate to become one of america's most-served menu items, which wri calls power meals. according to waite, the list of the top 20 meals served by food service companies currently contains only one plant-based item, a veggie wrap. the rest are meat-centric, including four versions of the classic hamburger.\n\nmany niche burger makers and school cafeterias have joined the blended burger bandwagon. in the dining rooms of stanford university, waite says, it's the only kind of burger you'll find. but sonic's 3,500 drive-in restaurants represent a huge boost to the concept.
cities laredo and nuevo laredo maintain close relationship despite border separation\n\nlaredo, texas, and nuevo laredo, mexico, celebrate their annual abrazo bridge ceremony on saturday. it has special resonance in an era of heightened anti-immigrant and border security rhetoric.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nanother border event now. today the sister cities of laredo, texas, and nuevo laredo, mexico, celebrate their annual abrazo children ceremony. the event brings together children from each side of the border who cross the bridge that links the two towns. it has special resonance now in an era of heightened anti-immigrant and border security rhetoric. lorena rios reports.\n\nlorena rios, byline: the annual event is called the abrazo children ceremony. it's been going on for nearly half a century. each year, both cities nominate a child to represent them. the children dress up in their local finery and walk to the middle of the bridge to embrace their counterparts from the other side.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nrios: thirty-four years ago, erika garcia hein was the abraza child representing the u.s. but she talks about it like it was just yesterday.\n\nerika garcia hein: oh, i remember everything. yes. i was 9. just to see the amount of people on both sides sharing a hug, the music is playing, you're marching to the bridge - it's just, wow, you can't help but get emotional.\n\nrios: since then, her son, niece and two nephews have also been abrazo children celebrating the blurred lines between laredo and nuevo laredo.\n\nhein: you know, the kids - they don't realize the political, you know, background that's happening. to them, they're just befriending somebody from another country without a border. that - to them, there's no border.\n\nunidentified person: ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to now present the 2019 abrazo children.\n\n(applause)\n\nrios: at a reception for this year's abrazo children, the children from each country danced and practiced their hugs. maria candelaria uribe remembered earlier celebrations.\n\nmaria candelaria uribe: we used to have the governor here all the time from texas. we had, like, four or five governors from mexico. and they would party, and they would get to know each other so that if they needed something, they could just pick up the telephone and call each other and talk to each other.\n\nrios: now things are changing.\n\nuribe: we wanted them to see how we work so well together. it's very important. they're way up there. they don't know what's going on down here. but they don't come as often as they used to.\n\nrios: the political talk from washington seems to bear little resemblance to the actual daily interactions between these two cities. pete saenz is laredo's mayor.\n\npete saenz: this rhetoric galvanized us. it brought us even closer together. and we interact, and we're so interdependent. that's life in the border.\n\nrios: laredo is 95 percent hispanic. and its land ports are some of the busiest in the country, hosting over $200 billion in trade each year.\n\nlucy hastings: i'm a laredoan - full-force laredoan.\n\nrios: lucy hastings is the mother of this year's abrazo child from laredo.\n\nhastings: we live in the border, so we have a little bit of both worlds. so we take a lot of pride in both countries.\n\nrios: laura edith garza de perez is the mother of the abrazo child representing mexico. she feels the same way.\n\nlaura edith garza de perez: (speaking spanish).\n\nrios: we're really just one, she said. this friendship and sisterhood doesn't change. it's us who decide as citizens how to live our own history.\n\n(applause)\n\nrios: for npr news, i'm lorena rios in laredo.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
election officials warned 'someone's going to get shot,' but that didn't stop trump\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption michael m. santiago/getty images michael m. santiago/getty images\n\nover the four years of donald trump's presidency, people in charge of elections in both major parties have warned that his continued peddling of falsehoods about elections could one day lead to violence.\n\nnow, as a mob took over the u.s. capitol on wednesday, those predictions have come true.\n\nevery elected leader who helped spread lies about american elections paved the way to today, said colorado secretary of state jena griswold.\n\nwhile many americans looked at their televisions in shock wednesday, those in charge of elections seem to have seen it as the natural evolution of a growing problem: a large portion of the country now falsely believes that the electoral process is rigged and that therefore there may be no other alternative than taking to the streets.\n\nit's a theme that predated trump within the republican party and one that will probably plague american democracy long after joe biden is sworn in as president on jan. 20.\n\na month ago, a top election official in georgia, gabriel sterling, begged his fellow republicans to stop spreading conspiracy theories about voting, as it was leading to death threats against officials overseeing that state's recount.\n\nsomeone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed, sterling said at the time.\n\nbut trump, as well as many other republicans in congress, didn't heed those warnings. in a phone call with georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger over the weekend, trump listed a number of debunked conspiracy theories, many of which spawned from extremist corners of the internet.\n\non wednesday, house republicans mentioned some of those same conspiracy theories in objecting during the electoral college vote-counting process. and less than two hours later, windows were shattered, at least one person was fatally shot and the entire capitol building was overrun.\n\nit all could have been avoided, experts say, if those in power told the truth about the legitimacy of the vote.\n\nwhat did they think would happen? tweeted chris krebs, a republican who led the federal government's election security efforts before being fired by trump in november. they own this.\n\nkrebs oversaw an effort by the department of homeland security to fact-check some of the most pervasive lies about the election over the past two months.\n\nyet the president & his campaign/lawyers/supporters fanned the flames for their own selfish reasons, he said.\n\ntrump has given no indication that wednesday's events will change how he talks about the election. he tweeted a video on wednesday evening in which he called the extremists at the capitol special and continued to falsely claim that he is the winner.\n\nthe question now is whether congressional republicans will do the same.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell said earlier wednesday that if elections in the u.s. were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, then our democracy would enter a death spiral.\n\ni hope [republicans] can look themselves in the mirror and say, 'was this really worth it?'  said josh douglas, an election law professor at the university of kentucky. they should have known better. they should have known that they were spouting anti-democracy rhetoric and really undermining one of the core tenets of our democracy.
health savings account change in 2018 could trip up some consumers\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption fanatic studio/collection mix: subjects rf/getty images fanatic studio/collection mix: subjects rf/getty images\n\nmembers of congress have said they want to loosen rules for health savings accounts. did they do it in the latest spending bill? do people who were uncovered for one month in 2017 owe a tax penalty? and how can immigrants who move to the u.s. to retire get insurance? these are the questions i'm tackling for readers this week:\n\ni heard that health savings account rules would be loosened under the new spending bill passed by congress last month. did that happen?\n\nno. in fact, the standards have become slightly tighter this year.\n\nin recent years, members of congress from both parties have supported expanding eligibility for health savings accounts and also expanding the list of ways that money can be spent. to date, though, those proposals, as well as other changes regarding the accounts, haven't become law.\n\nhealth savings accounts, which are linked to high-deductible health plans, continue to multiply. in 2017, there were 22 million accounts totaling more than $45 billion in assets, an increase of 11 percent in the number of accounts over the previous year, according to devenir, a firm that offers advice on hsa investments.\n\nmoney deposited in hsas is tax-deductible, grows tax-free and can be used without owing tax to pay for medical expenses. advocates promote the plans as a way to help consumers play a larger role in controlling their health spending, and say that the tax advantages help people afford care.\n\nthe internal revenue service announced last month that the maximum amount individuals with family coverage could contribute to their health savings accounts would actually be reduced slightly from their previously announced limit for 2018. the maximum contribution for people with individual coverage in 2018 remains $3,450.\n\nthe family coverage contribution reduction of $50 — from $6,900 to $6,850 – isn't much of a change. it happened because the federal government altered the way it calculates inflation adjustments to the contribution limits.\n\nbut ignoring the new limit could create headaches for people who have already made the maximum hsa contribution for the year based on the $6,900 figure, says roy ramthun, president of hsa consulting services. if you don't ask the bank that handles your hsa to return the $50 plus any earnings that have accrued before the next tax season, your taxable income will be off by that amount, plus you'll be on the hook for a 6 percent penalty for exceeding the maximum contribution allowed.\n\nthat's not going to amount to a lot of money, but there's more than financial pain to consider, ramthun says. do you really want to give the irs a reason to come find you?\n\ni didn't have health insurance for one month last year, in january 2017. do i owe a penalty for not having health insurance when i file my taxes this spring?\n\nif you were uninsured for only one month in 2017, you won't owe a penalty. people can be uninsured for up to three consecutive months during the year without triggering a tax penalty for not having coverage, says tara straw, a senior policy analyst at the center on budget and policy priorities.\n\nthis year, for the first time, the internal revenue service won't accept electronically filed tax returns unless filers report whether they had health insurance all year, were exempt from the requirement or will pay a penalty for not having had coverage. any tax refund, too, may be delayed if it is tied to a paper return that doesn't have this information, according to the irs.\n\nin your case, you'll file federal form 8965 with your tax return to report a short-term insurance coverage gap and claim an exemption from the coverage requirement. your employer — or your insurer, if you purchased coverage on your own — will send a form to the irs stating that you were covered for the other 11 months, straw says.\n\nthose penalties — $695 or 2.5 percent of your household income, whichever is greater — are also in force for 2018 coverage. but starting next year, you won't owe a penalty no matter how long you may be uninsured. the tax reform law eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance in 2019.\n\nwhat health insurance options are available for my parents, who are seniors who worked in india and are now retired in the united states with green cards?\n\ndepending on their situation, people like your parents who are legally entitled to reside permanently in the united states have a number of options.\n\nfrom your description, it's unclear whether they live on their own or with you. if you claim them as dependents on your taxes, you might consider adding them to your own health insurance plan, says shelby gonzales, a senior policy analyst at the center on budget and policy priorities.\n\nassuming your parents haven't worked for at least 10 years in the united states, they're probably not eligible for premium-free hospitalization coverage under medicare, the federal health insurance program for people age 65 and older, gonzales says. if they've lived in the states for at least five years and their income and other resources meet state eligibility guidelines, however, they could qualify for medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people.\n\nif they don't qualify for either government health program, they could consider buying a health insurance plan on the state marketplace or through a broker.\n\nif they buy a marketplace plan, they could be eligible for premium subsidies if their income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level

commuter pushes d.c. metro to get on board with #metoo\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tyrone turner/wamu tyrone turner/wamu\n\nmargaret wroblewski's daily commute on the metro often comes with an unwanted consequence, and it's not necessarily unexpected delays or crowded trains. it's sexual harassment.\n\nlike many students, the 22-year-old relies on the metro rail system to get around the washington, d.c., region every day. she's studying photojournalism at george washington university and commutes from her home in maryland.\n\nwroblewski posted her latest encounter with sexual harassment on snapchat last fall. as her friends weighed in, she quickly realized she wasn't alone.\n\nthat really just fueled my fire that something really needed to be done about this issue, because i think it needs to be brought to light, wroblewski says.\n\ninspired to act by the #metoo movement taking place nationwide, wroblewski decided to grab her camera and get to work. she began a series on instagram called i was on the metro when, publishing photographs of women who have been sexually harassed or assaulted on the transit system. wroblewski has interviewed about 14 women who have faced anything from catcalling to public masturbation.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tyrone turner/wamu tyrone turner/wamu\n\nshe is also crowdsourcing for more story contributions from women and men who have faced harassment on public transportation. wroblewski ultimately wants to approach the washington metropolitan area transit authority about using her photos for anti-harassment campaigns within metrorail stations and buses, replacing the agency's current ads.\n\nall the women that i've talked to really want to say something and want their voices heard, wroblewski says. i don't think there's been an outlet for them to do that.\n\nlaw justice ruth bader ginsburg reflects on the #metoo movement: 'it's about time' justice ruth bader ginsburg reflects on the #metoo movement: 'it's about time' listen · 2:52 2:52\n\npublic spaces, like the metro, are rife with incidents. two years ago, metro commissioned a study that showed roughly 20 percent of respondents faced some type of sexual harassment on regional public transportation. national statistics show a similar pattern.\n\nit took a lot of lobbying from activists to persuade wmata to even begin tracking harassment on its buses and trains. holly kearl with the advocacy group stop street harassment remembers approaching metro leadership alongside other groups in 2012.\n\nthe initial response we got was, 'one person's harassment is another person's flirting. it's not a problem on our system,' kearl says.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption carmel delshad/wamu carmel delshad/wamu\n\nkearl says that within a month of that meeting, the d.c. metro was on board with what advocates were asking for. now, metro has partnered with stop street harassment and other groups to put up anti-harassment ads throughout its system, and a web page to report harassment. the agency is also running a revamped psa — with kearl as its voice.\n\nmetro's 2016 study showed people aware of the campaigns were twice as likely to report harassment, and metro is urging those who experience or witness harassment to report it, too.\n\nthen we start to build a database, start to track that, says metro general manager paul wiedefeld. in case it does evolve, or we see a pattern start to evolve, we can get on top of it.\n\ncritics of metro's approach aren't sure reporting will amount to any action, especially in cases where the harassment may not be against the law — like verbal comments.\n\nand while there's more work to be done, holly kearl says she believes metro is doing what it can to tackle the issue.\n\nsexual harassment is a rampant problem in all arenas in our life, kearl says. it would be unrealistic to expect one transit agency to solve it. we have to address the culture and change it.\n\nand while that kind of change may not happen overnight, kearl says this moment is the most promising she has seen in a long time.
9-year-old helps shape obama administration's approach to science\n\nthe obama administration gathered feedback from students about what they want to see in stem programs. this came after 9-year-old jacob leggette encouraged president obama to ask students about their opinions at a white house science fair.\n\nari shapiro, host:\n\na 9 year old is helping to shape the white house's approach to science. let me explain. third-grader jacob leggette met president obama last month at the white house science fair. he asked the president a pretty pointed question. here's the tape from whitehouse.gov.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\njacob leggette: do you have a child science adviser?\n\nbarack obama: i don't. do think you might be interested in that position?\n\njacob: you should. a child science adviser can give you...\n\nobama: feedback.\n\njacob: feedback on how kids like science.\n\nshapiro: and now it's happening. the administration announced today that it wants ideas from children about what it can do to help shape the future of science.\n\njacob leggette joins us from his home in baltimore. hi, there.\n\njacob: hi.\n\nshapiro: so how did you hear about this?\n\njacob: my mother told me.\n\nshapiro: and what did you think when she told you?\n\njacob: i thought it was a new start.\n\nshapiro: (laughter) i wonder if you have any other ideas for the president.\n\njacob: a bunch.\n\nshapiro: well, give it to us.\n\njacob: one thing is to change the world to make it a better place, like, no cigarettes, no drugs, making artificial organs, making homeless people have a homeless shelter to help them survive longer.\n\nshapiro: do you know what kind of science you want to do when you're grown up?\n\njacob: i want to do computer science and make artificial organs and program robots.\n\nshapiro: that is a very advanced goal for a 9 year old. i think when i was 9, i probably wanted to be either a firefighter or a veterinarian.\n\njacob: wow.\n\nshapiro: do you remember the first thing that made you interested in science?\n\njacob: watching my father.\n\nshapiro: what was your father doing?\n\njacob: he was working on a computer.\n\nshapiro: what was the first thing you did?\n\njacob: the first thing i did was crash my grandmother's computer.\n\nshapiro: how did you crash your grandmother's computer?\n\njacob: i deleted some other apps, and then i actually restored them all.\n\nshapiro: so that was your first science project, huh?\n\njacob: yes.\n\nshapiro: well, your mom stephanie is there with you, right? could i talk to her for a minute?\n\njacob: yes.\n\nstephanie leggette: hello.\n\nshapiro: you must be very proud.\n\ns. leggette: extremely.\n\nshapiro: what was the first sign little jacob gave you that he was going to be shaking things up on the national stage by the age of 9?\n\ns. leggette: you know what? i would've never imagined that in a million years. i always told him that he was going to change the world, and i tell him and his sister both that.\n\nshapiro: well, what kind of indications did he give you when he was a little kid?\n\ns. leggette: well, when he crashed my mother's computer, he was 2.\n\n(laughter)\n\ns. leggette: and i had no clue what he had done. and i set him in my lap, and i said you have to fix this. and he sat there, and he fixed it.\n\nshapiro: wow. and you homeschool him, so you can take some credit for this.\n\ns. leggette: a little bit, little bit. my husband, he's - you know, he spearheads everything that he does, especially the technology aspect of it.\n\nshapiro: do you mind handing the phone back to him?\n\ns. leggette: sure.\n\nshapiro: hello again.\n\njacob: hello again.\n\nshapiro: before we say goodbye, if there are kids listening out there who might be thinking about going into math or science or technology, what kind of advice do you have for them?\n\njacob: keep going, stay on task, and you'll make it.\n\nshapiro: jacob leggette, what a pleasure to talk to you. thank you.\n\njacob: you're welcome. have a good day.\n\nshapiro: you too. that was 9-year-old jacob leggette and his mother stephanie.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
teaching and learning at the boundaries of 2 cultures\n\nenlarge this image getty images getty images\n\nmarcelo gleiser is a theoretical physicist and writer — and a professor of natural philosophy, physics and astronomy at dartmouth college. he is the director of the institute for cross-disciplinary engagement at dartmouth, co-founder of 13.7 and an active promoter of science to the general public. his latest book is the simple beauty of the unexpected: a natural philosopher's quest for trout and the meaning of everything. you can keep up with marcelo on facebook and twitter: @mgleiser\n\nmonday was the first day of dartmouth's spring term. so, as i often do at this time, i started teaching my course for non-science majors called understanding the universe: from atoms to the big bang.\n\nthis is what students like to call a physics for poets class — a class that explores the history of how humanity has confronted some of the deepest questions we can ask about the material world and our place in it, without the math. it is a class that tries to capture the true spirit of the liberal-arts education, mixing the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences as different and complementary ways of knowing the world and why we matter. in fancier words, as an intellectual history of physics and astronomy, the class requires that scientific thinking be contextualized culturally, so that students can situate the ways in which some of the most revolutionary ideas in the past 2,000 years emerged when they did.\n\nthat said, it's interesting to see how students that have a background in the sciences — and those who don't — look at the course. this is something that speaks to our educational system at large.\n\nscientists, by training, have little exposure to the humanities. given that a major in the sciences requires a lot of technical work, we spend precious little time dealing with what happened culturally and historically around the science we are trying to understand. we don't learn much about galileo and his bouts with the roman inquisition, or about newton's religious motivation for his work or his research in alchemy, or kepler's pythagorean mysticism, or darwin's struggles with his wife's (and his own) faith, or einstein's work as a pacifist. in the classroom, at least, we learn about their technical ideas, but not about who they were or why they were thinking what they were at the time.\n\nthis, i believe, is the reason why so many scientists (with, of course, brave exceptions), many of them in the public media, condemn the humanities as useless — or seem not to understand why we should bother with them at all. as a consequence, many scientific ideas are presented as having conquered some of the deepest questions we have been asking for millennia, when they haven't. point in case, the origin of the universe, something we can't truly address within the scientific framework as we know it, is often presented as solved and understood. god isn't needed. case closed. boom.\n\nhumanities students, on the other hand, are (with, of course, brave exceptions) typically those who eschew the sciences or, at least, math. their training is also technical, involving lots of reading and critical writing. you can often tell, when you teach this kind of class, who the scientists and the humanists are. all you have to do is write an equation on the blackboard and look at the class. humanists' eyes will quickly glaze over. the scientists will perk up. as you read from aristotle's metaphysics, the opposite will happen. to bridge this gap is the challenge.\n\nthis split, of course, is not new. in 1959, the british physicist and novelist c.p. snow, in his rede lecture at cambridge university, called our attention to the two cultures divide — the growing gap between the sciences and the humanities that, he believed, threatened the health of academia:\n\ni believe the intellectual life of the whole of modern western society is increasingly being split into two polar groups...at one pole we have the literary intellectuals, who incidentally while no one was looking took to referring to themselves as 'intellectuals' as though there were no others...at the other scientists, and as the most representative, the physical scientists. between the two a gulf of mutual incomprehension — sometimes (particularly among the young) hostility and dislike, but most of all lack of understanding.\n\nwe all stand to lose from this gulf between the sciences and the humanities. the sciences run the risk of being decontextualized from their moral and social consequences, pursuing technologies that should be regulated and scrutinized. artificial intelligence research, for example, as many philosophers and, thankfully, scientists have recognized, needs to have safeguards so as to guarantee that, in the advent that we do build machines more intellectually capable than ourselves, they would still be willing to work with us and not against us. the same with crispr/cas9 biotechnologies, that can effectively and specifically change genes within organisms, thus allowing us to engineer life following target goals. on the other hand, the humanities run the risk of becoming disconnected from the pace of scientific discoveries and myopic to how they are effectively transforming the world we live in.\n\nthe classroom is the ideal place for this conversation between the sciences and the humanities to unfold. by exposing students to the two sides of the cultural divide, we stand a chance of building bridges that will actually close the gap. scientists should read from original sources, and humanists should grapple with scientific concepts such as relativity, quantum physics, evolution and natural selection, plate tectonics, climate change, and the expanding universe. scientists should recognize that some research topics — ai, biotechnology, climate change, life extension, the nature and pervasiveness of faith, and many others — need to be investigated together with humanists as a joint effort; inasmuch as they impact society as a whole, they are not just scientific research projects.\n\ni finished the first class asking students what they expect from a teacher. the answers were great: be passionate about the subject matter; be available to students after class; be clear about expectations; have a sense of humor. i reminded them that i was once a student, too, and i swore then that if i ever became a teacher, i'd never repeat the things i hated in my teachers. at least, i try not to. but then i reminded them that the onus is not all mine. that to learn you must engage with the subject matter, that learning is an active state, not a passive one. finally, i reminded them that not even the best teacher in the world can teach someone who doesn't want to learn.\n\nthe best teachers know very well that the secret of good teaching is precisely this, to make someone want to know. after all, as tom stoppard reminded us in his brilliant play arcadia, it is wanting to know that makes us matter — scientists and humanists alike.
'welcome to the new georgia': raphael warnock on his win in senate runoff\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption michael m. santiago/getty images michael m. santiago/getty images\n\ndemocrat raphael warnock made history in one of georgia's two senate runoffs on tuesday when he became the first black person to be elected to the senate from the state and the first black democratic senator from the south.\n\ngeorgia certainly made me proud last night, warnock told npr's noel king wednesday morning. they decided to send a kid who grew up in public housing to the united states senate to represent the concerns of ordinary people.\n\nwarnock, 51, won his race by over 50,000 votes, according to the associated press, which is outside the 0.5 percentage point margin that would enable republican sen. kelly loeffler to request a recount.\n\nwarnock reflected on the state's increasingly diverse electorate as a factor in defeating loeffler.\n\nwelcome to the new georgia, he said. it is more diverse. it's more inclusive. it readily embraces the future. and i'm the product of that.\n\nafter november's general election, georgia became the center of the u.s. political universe and the scene of a bitter battle within the gop over the results of the 2020 presidential election, with president trump falsely claiming that the state was stolen from him. the state's result is likely to be challenged wednesday as congress counts the electoral college vote. that challenge is expected to fail.\n\nlisten, the four most powerful words in a democracy are: 'the people have spoken.' the people of georgia spoke very clearly on nov. 3, when they elected joe biden and kamala harris and gave them our 16 electoral votes, warnock said on npr. we counted those votes three times. it is clear, when you look at the swing states all across our country, joe biden is the president-elect. unfortunately, there are enablers of this nonsense in the united states senate. and that's why the people who i'm running into all across georgia are frustrated with politics.\n\nhe said his campaign sought to cut through the noise of the culture wars and instead focused on the concerns of ordinary people.\n\ni'm a pastor. i lead ebenezer baptist church, where martin luther king jr. served. he said that we're tied in a single garment of destiny, caught up in an inescapable network of mutuality, whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly, warnock said. and so whether we're talking about health care, or we're talking about a livable wage, there's a way in which we have to look out for one another.\n\nwarnock said the coronavirus pandemic has brought those issues into sharper focus, and that he supports passing the $2,000 stimulus payments for qualifying americans.\n\nfolks waited for months without getting any relief at all, and when we saw relief in the spring, too often it centered on large corporate businesses while small businesses were at the back of the line, he told npr's king. some people need immediate relief. and we've got to get this virus under control. we've got to get the vaccine safely and efficiently distributed, so that we can safely reopen our economy, get our businesses roaring again, get our children back into school, but in a way that's sustainable.\n\nasked whether the senate should push for more progressive climate legislation like the green new deal, warnock stressed the need for commonsense reform.\n\nthere's no question that climate change is real. there's work we need to do on that front, he said. i think too often, even in the places where there is agreement, at least among ordinary people that we need movement, we get no movement. and that's quite frankly because someone other than the people own our democracy. and so one of the things that i'll be very focused on is the outsized influence of well-connected corporate interests in our politics.
philip roth and his millions of words\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nphilip roth wrote millions of words, 29 novels and scores of short stories and essays. my god, exclaims his signature character alexander portnoy in the 1969 novel portnoy's complaint. (reading) the english language is a form of communication. conversation isn't just crossfire where you shoot and get shot at, where you've got to duck for your life and aim to kill. words aren't only bombs and bullets. no, they're little gifts containing meanings.\n\nthe comic monologues in portnoy's complaint can still make you laugh and gasp about things more polite novels didn't explore so explicitly. but his praise for the power of language might also make you wince today when cruel words can be so meanly flung in public life.\n\nportnoy, zuckerman, neil klugman in goodbye, columbus - philip roth's best-known characters were jews, beginning at a time in the 1950s when the holocaust and american anti-semitism had animated jewish identity. but he didn't want his work to be consigned to any category. i have never conceived of myself for the length of a single sentence as an american-jewish or jewish-american writer, he wrote in the new yorker.\n\n(reading) as a novelist, i think of myself - and have from the beginning - as a free american and, though i am hardly unaware of the general prejudice that persisted here against my kind till not that long ago, as irrefutably american, fashion through my life to the american moment, under the spell of the country's past, partaking of its drama and destiny and writing in the rich native tongue by which i am possessed.\n\nwe interviewed philip roth five years ago when he announced he was done with writing and just wanted to be free to ruminate and nap. but he used to send us emails about what he heard and liked - older authors he thought had been overlooked and new authors he thought we should read. he sounded like a man who had poured everything from his heart onto the page until there was no more to add.\n\nwhat i want is to possess my readers while they are reading my book, philip roth once told the paris review. (reading) then let them return just as they were to a world where everybody else is working to change, persuade, temp and control them. the best readers come to fiction to be free of all that noise - to have set loose in them the consciousness that's otherwise conditioned and hemmed in by all that isn't fiction.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
in china, birthrate falls to lowest level in 70 years\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption visual china group via getty images visual china group via getty images\n\nupdated at 9 a.m. et\n\nnew birthrate figures show that china has so far failed to reverse the effects of its longtime one-child policy — a change that policymakers say is necessary to forestall the long-term economic consequences of an aging and shrinking population.\n\nthe national bureau of statistics of china released the new data on friday, the same day it announced that the country's gdp growth has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 30 years.\n\nlast year, there were 10.48 births per 1,000 people, the lowest birthrate since 1949, the year the people's republic of china was founded. the number was down from 10.94 the year before.\n\nthe one-child policy was put in place in 1979 by chinese leader deng xiaoping, who feared that the country's exploding population would hold back economic development.\n\nhowever, by 2016, china's leadership came to realize that the policy had been too successful and officially relaxed it.\n\nexperts say that improved education and higher incomes in china have led to delayed marriage and childbirth and that once-strict government restrictions on births have made one-child households the norm.\n\nchina should have stopped the policy 28 years ago. now it's too late, yi fuxian, a senior scientist at the university of wisconsin, madison and a longtime critic of the country's family-planning policies, told the guardian last year.\n\nby 2050, a third of china's people will be 60 or older, according to current projections, placing a significant burden on the government to care for the elderly.\n\ntariffs pinch economic growth\n\nmeanwhile, the world's second-largest economy cooled to its slowest pace in nearly three decades, with china posting year-on-year growth of 6.1% last year — a further sign that the protracted trade war with the u.s. has taken a toll.\n\nthe pace of growth in gross domestic product for 2019 was down from 6.6% the previous year and marked the smallest annual increase since 1990.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption stephen b. morton/ap stephen b. morton/ap\n\nbeijing's policymakers had projected growth of between 6% and 6.5% for the year.\n\nchina's gdp, worth an estimated $14.4 trillion, is second in size only to that of the u.s. its economy has been undergoing a painful shift away from heavy industry and commodities. instead, beijing has aimed for a more consumer-based economy.\n\nthe latest gdp figures, while exceptionally strong by the standards of many other countries, are a long way from the heady days of 10% or more growth barely a decade ago.\n\nin 2007, the chinese economy grew by a blistering 14%.\n\nin recent years, china's leaders have struggled to balance competing demands of maintaining high rates of growth while simultaneously minimizing the consequences of years of debt-fueled stimulus spending. last year, authorities took steps to limit wasteful infrastructure investments in an effort to rein in unsustainable levels of local government and corporate debt.\n\nfriday's data come days after a phase 1 trade deal between the u.s. and china, seen as a step toward ending an 18-month-old trade dispute, which has seen damaging tariffs imposed by both sides.\n\nthe new trade deal eases u.s. tariffs on some popular consumer goods manufactured in china, such as cellphones, but leaves in place hundreds of billions of dollars of other tariffs, including on components that u.s. factories use to assemble finished products.\n\nnpr's emily feng in beijing contributed to this report.
congress certifies biden victory; trump pledges 'orderly transition' on jan. 20\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption erin schaff/pool/getty images erin schaff/pool/getty images\n\nupdated at 4 a.m. et\n\ncongress certified president-elect joe biden and vice president-elect kamala harris' victory early on thursday, the end of a long day and night marked by chaos and violence in washington, d.c. extremists emboldened by president trump had sought to thwart the peaceful transfer of power that has been a hallmark of modern american history by staging a violent insurrection inside the u.s. capitol.\n\nto those who wreaked havoc in our capitol today, you did not win, vice president pence said once lawmakers reconvened after many spent hours in lockdown. violence never wins. freedom wins, and this is still the people's house.\n\nbiden and harris finished with 306 electoral votes, while trump and pence had 232. it takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.\n\nin a statement released just after the certification was finalized, trump at long last acknowledged his election loss. he said that even though he disagrees with the outcome, there will be an orderly transition on january 20th.\n\ni have always said we would continue our ... fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. while this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to make america great again!\n\ndozens of republican house lawmakers, along with some republican senators supportive of trump, had planned to object wednesday to the electoral votes of as many as six states that backed biden.\n\nbut late wednesday night, some senate republicans withdrew their objections. each objection requires the backing of a member of both the house and the senate to be considered. sens. steve daines of montana, mike braun of indiana and kelly loeffler of georgia all said that they would stand down.\n\ni cannot now, in good conscience, object to the certification of these electors, loeffler said wednesday, drawing applause from some of her colleagues. loeffler was one of two republicans who lost their races on tuesday, giving democrats control of the u.s. senate.\n\nmissouri republican sen. josh hawley, who took up trump's call that lawmakers object to the results of the election, said wednesday night that the senate should consider his objections, but that they should be debated without violence, without attacks, without bullets.\n\nsenate lawmakers voted late wednesday to reject the challenge to biden's victory in the state of arizona, and the house followed suit, but with many republicans in favor of overturning the state's results. a similar result played out for the state of pennsylvania, with both chambers voting to reject the challenge to biden's victory there.\n\nrepublican house lawmakers also objected to the electoral votes in georgia, michigan, nevada and wisconsin, but no senator would join in those objections.\n\nin that case, the objection cannot be entertained, pence said repeatedly, chairing the proceedings in his role as president of the senate.\n\nso the count continued, state by state, with vermont's three electoral votes putting biden and harris over the 270 mark, until finally wyoming's three electoral votes were tallied for trump and pence.\n\nhow the chaos unfolded\n\nthe process to affirm biden's victory began in the early afternoon. the typically ceremonial affair, an affirmation of the democratic process, was expected to be a bitter, hours-long endeavor because of objections planned by trump's congressional allies, despite the fact that they were certain to be met with bipartisan defeat.\n\nbut as the process began, a mob of pro-trump extremists stormed the capitol on wednesday afternoon, bringing the counting of the electoral votes to a halt.\n\nlawmakers were evacuated from the building as the violent, chaotic scene played out, prompting a citywide curfew. one woman was killed by a capitol police officer in the capitol. wednesday night, d.c. police said three other people died from medical emergencies in the surrounding area.\n\naround 8 p.m. et, hours after the capitol was breached, lawmakers were cleared to return to finish debate and tally the electoral college votes. in separate speeches in their respective chambers, house speaker nancy pelosi and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell vowed to press ahead with the business at hand.\n\nwe will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation. we are back at our posts, mcconnell said, adding, and we're going to do it tonight.\n\ntrump's pressure\n\nthe scene that unfolded at the capitol on wednesday was the culmination of months of efforts by trump and his allies, publicly and privately, to overturn the results of the 2020 election. some of those efforts were based on unproven claims of fraudulent vote counts, while others were founded on baseless conspiracy theories.\n\ntrump had been particularly focused on pence's role, publicly ratcheting up pressure on his vice president in recent days — including as he addressed supporters on wednesday — to back his efforts to reverse the 2020 election results. pence, though, said wednesday that he did not have the power to change the outcome of the election or to unilaterally delay the certification of biden's victory.\n\nand the insurrectionists that disrupted the certification of the electoral college votes did so after trump spoke to them, demanding that they fight to stop the steal of the election — a false claim — and descend on the capitol.\n\nafter this, we're going to walk down — and i'll be there with you — we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down to the capitol, trump said earlier wednesday, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.\n\nas the mob drew down on the capitol, trump remained largely silent and did not make widespread remarks condemning the violence, or attempts to quell it. at one point, he tweeted a short video in which he repeated claims — without evidence — regarding voter fraud and a stolen election, while saying we love you to the mob that had descended on washington and urging them to go home.\n\nlater wednesday, he tweeted that these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.\n\ntwitter later demanded that the tweet and video be removed, and the platform temporarily locked the president's account, threatening to permanently suspend it.\n\ncondemnation of the president\n\nfor his part, biden called on the president to direct his supporters to end what he described as an unprecedented assault on democracy that borders on sedition.\n\ni call on president trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the constitution and demand an end to this siege, biden said in brief remarks. the president-elect also suggested that trump was to blame for the violence, saying that at the best, the words of a president can inspire. at their worst, they can incite.\n\nas the chaos unfolded, some house democrats have called for impeaching the president again during his final two weeks in office.\n\nrep. ilhan omar of minnesota wrote on twitter that she was drawing up articles of impeachment. we can't allow him to remain in office, it's a matter of preserving our republic, she wrote. rhode island rep. david cicilline faulted the president for the violence that consumed the capitol and said, we should impeach and convict him tomorrow.\n\nassistant speaker katherine clark, d-mass. called the president a traitor to our country and our constitution and called for him to be removed from office and prevented from further endangering our country and our people.\n\ntrump also faced critics within his own party for his role in egging on the mob.\n\nwhat happened today was nothing short of a coup attempt. the president of

terry gross, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm terry gross. my guest is the winner of this year's pulitzer prize for fiction, viet thanh nguyen. his novel, the sympathizer, is set during and just after the war in vietnam and is told in the form of a forced confession written by a spy for the north vietnamese who worked undercover as an aid to a south vietnamese general. it appears that part of his crime is sympathizing with the suffering on both sides. that sympathy is in part a function of his own divided self. the character's mother grew up in the north of vietnam.\n\nhis father was a french colonialist in vietnam. my guest tells part of his own story in an essay at the back of the book. viet thanh nguyen's parents grew up in the north of vietnam when the country was divided in the mid-1950s. with the north under communist control, his parents fled to the south. when the south fell to the north in 1975, the family fled to america. viet nguyen was 4 years old at the time. he is now a professor of english and american studies and ethnicity at the university of southern california.\n\nviet thanh nguyen, welcome to fresh air. why did you want to write this novel from the point of view of a spy?\n\nviet thanh nguyen: well, when my agent told me i should write a novel, the first thing that came to me was a spy novel and partly it was because it's a genre that i really enjoy and i wanted to write a novel that was actually entertaining, that people would actually want to read because i knew that i would also be dealing with a lot of very serious political and literary matters. and then the other inspiration for that was that there really were spies in south vietnam that rose to the very highest ranks of the south vietnamese bureaucracy and military.\n\nand there was a very famous spy named pham xuan an who was so important that during his time as a mole he was promoted to a major general by the north vietnamese. and he was friends with people like david halberstam and all the important american journalists. and they had no idea that he was a communist spy who had studied in the united states. so all these factors were in my mind.\n\ngross: the war in vietnam was central to your whole family's story. your parents are from the north of vietnam and fled to the south in the mid-50s when the country was divided. they were teenagers then. why did they choose to leave north vietnam and flee to the south?\n\nnguyen: well, they were part of a great migration of about 800,000 north vietnamese catholics who had been persuaded by their parish priests that the communists were going to massacre them or at the very least persecute them. and that idea had been promulgated by the cia, by col. edward lansdale who became famous for helping the philippines suppress a communist insurgency in the 1950s and then he brought his talents to south vietnam. and he became the inspiration - so it was rumored - for alden pyle in graham greene's the quiet american. so that was the history behind why my parents had decided to flee. and they came from a region in north vietnam that was famous for producing hard-core revolutionaries like ho chi minh, who was born 30 minutes from their home village. and it was a region famous for producing hard-core catholics, and so my parents were among the hard-core catholics.\n\ngross: did - your parents were teenagers when they left north vietnam for the south. did their families come with them?\n\nnguyen: well, my mother's family did go, so all my aunts on that side of the family and my grandparents on that side of the family went. my father's parents and his siblings decided to stay in north vietnam. and the human consequences of this were that my parents left in 1954 to go south. my parents would not return to a unified vietnam until the early 1990s, which meant my father didn't see his own relatives for 40 years. my mom, because her family came to the south and then, you know, she left in 1975 when saigon fell, she wouldn't see her siblings again for 20 years.\n\ngross: so your father's family who stayed behind in the north, were they persecuted like they were told by the priests that they would be?\n\nnguyen: well, they weren't subjected to pogroms or anything like that, but they certainly lived a marginalized life. you know, catholics who stayed in the north were subject to suspicion because the communist regime, which was a really hardline regime, was very paranoid about any kind of subversion and they thought the catholics would be a kind of subversive anti-communist force, and so that meant that their economic opportunities were really circumscribed. and so when i went back to visit in around 2004, all of my uncles were still living in the same compound that my grandfather had built and they, you know, had been sustained for a couple of decades in the 1970s and '80s, early '90s by the money that my parents had sent home as remittances. so i think they definitely did feel that - even if they weren't murdered - that they were definitely discriminated against by the communist regime.\n\ngross: so in 1975, when saigon fell, and your parent's town had already been taken over by the north vietnamese, your family fled. so it was you, your parents and your brother?\n\nnguyen: yeah, i mean, the story was that in march, 1975, my father had gone to saigon on business and my mother was at home in buon ma thuot with myself, my brother and my adopted sister, who was the oldest sibling. so march, 1975, the communist army invades, seizes the town, cuts off all communication. my mother can't communicate with my father, so she takes our lives into her hands and decides to flee the town on foot with my brother, who was 10 years old, and myself, who was 4, and leaves behind my adopted sister, who was about 16, to take care of the family property because she believed - and reasonably so - that we would be back because that's the way the war had happened for the last 10 or 15 years - you know. so you saw battles and people would leave and they'd get to go back.\n\nwell, of course we never got to go back. and my mom walked downhill to nha trang, that port town of about 150 miles south. and the best i can say about that is that at least it was all downhill and that i don't remember any of it even though my brother does and says it was horrible. and the historical accounts that i have read indicate that it was chaos and death and lots of civilians and southern vietnamese soldiers dead along the way. we caught a boat from nha trang to saigon, met up with my father, fortunately enough.\n\nand then a month later, the communists came and took saigon. and according to my brother, you know, we tried various ways to get out of the city - went to the airport, couldn't get out. finally, we made it onto - we found a barge, but we got separated. and so again my father was somewhere else. my mother was with us. and without knowing where my father was, my mother decided to get on that boat. and then later we discovered my father gotten on that boat, too. so my parents have always been risk-takers. and for us, most of the time, it's worked out.\n\ngross: most people form their earliest memories at around, i think, the age of 4 - 3 or 4. so, like, your earliest memories have to do with the war and with trying to escape and with being separated from your father. how do you think that affected your view of the world or your just, like, your basic identity?\n\nnguyen: well, i have vague images of pre-april 1975 saigon, which are not reliable. you know, for example, i thought i remembered that when we were on that boat leaving saigon, that sailors were shooting at smaller fishing boats that were trying to come up to us. and my brother said, no, that never happened. but then i read somewhere else that it did happen. but my most reliable memory really begins after we had come to the united states and we - all vietnamese refugees, in order to come to the united states, were settled in these refugee camps.\n\nand ours was fort indiantown gap, pa. and in order to leave one of these camps, you had to have sponsors take you. no sponsor would take my family of four. so my brother went to one family, my parents went to one family and at 4 years old, i was sent to live with a white family. and that's when my memory begins and - of being separated from my parents. and even though that was only for a few months, it was really traumatic for me.\n\nand it's taken me a long time to understand how deeply traumatic that was, that that experience remains an invisible brand stamped between my shoulder blades. and in many ways, i've been - i spent a lifetime trying to make sense of what that trauma has meant to me.\n\ngross: did the family who was - did the family you were staying with take good care of you?\n\nnguyen: i think i stayed with two families, if i remember right. and i think the first family was in a mobile home. they were young. they had no idea what to do with me. and now being the father of a 3-year-old, i can just imagine what kind of a terror i was at 4 years old separated from my parents in a strange household. so then i was sent to another family with children. and they did take very good care of me. i remember them, you know, with fondness. but i also remember that, you know, they tried to make me comfortable.\n\nand one of the ways that they did that was to give me a pair of chopsticks. and they all had chopsticks. and they said, show us how to use chopsticks. at 4 years old, i had no idea how to use chopsticks. and i felt very badly about that. and that was, i think, my first initiation into the sense of being culturally and racially different than other americans.\n\ngross: what happened to your 16-year-old adopted sister who was left behind?\n\nnguyen: well, you know, she had to take care of the house, take care of the family business. and when the communists were already there, i mean, basically what they did was they seized the property, kicked her out. and then she was forced to join a volunteer youth brigade. and they were called volunteers - obviously they weren't - and sent to, you know, rebuild the country. so eventually, she came back from that. she found a husband, got married, had kids.\n\nwhen i went back to vietnam in 2004, for the second time, i finally was able to meet her. and she'd been a presence in my life because i remember, you know, we had a photograph of her when she was probably 16 - black-and-white photograph. and she was beautiful. and when i was growing up, i was always haunted by that face, her face, and thinking, why is she there and not here? i have no memory of her, but her memory obviously persists in the family.\n\nand that sense of loss and of haunting had always stayed with me. and i also knew that, you know, she had been one of the people that my parents had been sending money to for decades to help keep her alive. and my own family, my parents are very, very strict, very hard-working, very upright. and then i went to vietnam, and i met her. and she was beautiful, and she was wearing fashionable clothes.\n\nand she had makeup on, and her hair was well done. and she laughed and smiled a lot. and i was really happy to find someone in my family who knew how to have fun.\n\ngross: (laughter) that's funny, actually, that the sister who gets left behind at the end of the war, you know, facing who knows what kind of doom, she's the one who knows how to have a good time.\n\nnguyen: yeah, well, i think that's one of the reasons why my parents think she's adopted and my brother and i are not because my brother and i are not good at having fun.\n\ngross: (laughter) so let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more. if you're just joining us, my guest is viet thanh nguyen. and his novel, the sympathizer, won this year's pulitzer prize for fiction. we'll be right back. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. my guest is viet thanh nguyen. his novel, the sympathizer, won this year's pulitzer prize for fiction. it's written in the form of a forced confession by a spy from north vietnam. the novel is about the end of the war from the points of view of vietnamese characters. viet thanh nguyen fled vietnam with his family in 1975 after the fall of saigon. he was 4 when they came to the united states. so after - what? - about three years or so, your family moved from pennsylvania to san jose. and why was there a big vietnamese community there?\n\nnguyen: well, there is a big vietnamese community in san jose because the weather was good, because one of the refugee camps for vietnamese resettlement was in camp pendleton in san diego. so there was a significant population of vietnamese people who were in california. and they migrated to different cities.\n\nand what happened was - through their personal connections, they started to send the signal out that california was a good place to live. the weather was nice. the economy was good. there were excellent welfare benefits. and vietnamese people who had been scattered all over the country by deliberate government policy in order to encourage assimilation - many of them heard that message and came to california and to other places like it, such as texas. and that's how we ended up - that was one of the reasons why we ended up in san jose.\n\nthe personal connection was that when we fled buon ma thuot, the person that we had fled with was a very good friend of my mother's - a single woman who was an excellent businesswoman. she made it to san jose. she opened possibly the first vietnamese grocery store there. and she told my mom, you know, that they definitely needed to come to san jose to just have a better economic opportunity. and that's why we went. and we went there. we worked for this family friend in her grocery store. and within a few months or maybe a year, we - my parents opened their own vietnamese grocery store not far away.\n\ngross: what are some of the things your parents sold in the vietnamese grocery that you couldn't get in a supermarket?\n\nnguyen: well, rice. i remember that we had just - my dad had built these racks and racks that were just stocked full of rice up into the rafters. and i remember going there after school and hiding up in these rafters amid these sacks of rice and all kind of, you know, vietnamese fruits and things like fish sauce - nuoc mam, which is the lifeblood of vietnamese cuisine. and there was always a certain kind of odor in the vietnamese grocery store that i came to recognize, which was the scent of rice and fruit and spices that you cannot find anywhere else - a certain kind of mustiness, which i assume might have been alien to americans but to vietnamese people was the smell of comfort.\n\ngross: your family fled south vietnam to avoid the violence or persecution. you write the violence they sought to escape caught up with them because once they - after they opened up their vietnamese grocery store, they were shot one christmas eve during a holdup of their store. what happened?\n\nnguyen: i don't know. i was very young when that happened. and i was probably less than 10 years old because i remember i was - it was christmas eve. i was watching scooby-doo! christmas. my brother got a phone call - said to me, hey, mom and dad have been shot. and i had no reaction. i just wanted to watch my cartoon. and it's not that i didn't care. i just - i didn't know what to do with that incident. and then i remember my brother yelling at me because i didn't react.\n\nand it was really difficult, you know, to try to understand what was happening to my parents and to my brother and myself there - that there was violence. it was partly violent because my parents were shopkeepers, and this is what happens to immigrant shopkeepers. they get robbed. they get beaten. they get shot all the time.\n\nbut it was also the fact that, i think, a lot of south - a lot of vietnamese refugees to the united states brought violence with them. there was a lot of domestic violence, a lot of domestic abuse. people were traumatized. they were hurt. they were scared. the men faced downward mobility and alienation. and of course, they took it out on their families - their wives and their children. and these children, a lot of them joined gangs. i was in a so-called gang when i was in the second grade. you know, i mean, it wasn't a real gang, but i got to this public high school. there were vietnamese kids there. and immediately, we split up into gangs to fight each other.\n\nand that became a much more serious issue with, you know, teenage vietnamese and younger vietnamese-american boys who formed real gangs with guns and terrorized the vietnamese community with this new phenomenon of - called home invasions. and they knew - they did this because they knew that these families kept money in gold at home and that these people were vulnerable. and my parents always told me watch out for vietnamese people. do not let them into the house because they may rob us.\n\nand ironically, what happened was that one day, someone knocked on our door when i was 16. and he was not vietnamese. he was a white guy. and because he was a white guy, one of my parents - i think it was my father - let him in. and that man had a gun. and that man put that - pointed that gun in all of our faces. you know, it was only because my mother ran out into the street screaming that our lives were saved.\n\ngross: wow. it seems just so tragic that you have this community of vietnamese people who have so much in common. they fled their country for the same reason. they're living together in a community to - in part, to avoid the kind of hostility they may face in the larger american culture. and then they hurt each other.\n\nnguyen: well, it was a revolutionary war. it was a civil war, depending on how you look at it. and what that means is that vietnamese people were already hurting each other in vietnam. they'd had a long tradition...\n\ngross: good point (laughter).\n\nnguyen: ...of doing that even before...\n\ngross: right (laughter).\n\nnguyen: ...(laughter) even before the french came.\n\ngross: right.\n\nnguyen: you know, it's a hierarchal feudal society. the vietnamese were already exploting each other. and then that was exacerbated by colonialism and american occupation - or intervention - however you want to describe it. and so it was ironic and not ironic that when they came to the united states, they would do the exact same thing to each other because in vietnam during the war years, you know, in order to survive in vietnam, you had to exploit each other.\n\nit was a country that was corrupted by american aid, and people brought those habits of corruption and brutal competition with them to the u.s. and they also brought the memories of vietnamese people killing other vietnamese people to the united states. and i'm sure that affected them and their children and created the conditions for violence and brutality towards each other in this - the very same community, as you said, that was created in order to protect each other.\n\nbut that is one of the basic facts of ethnic communities in the united states. they gather together for comfort, but these people who know each other and love each other so well also know where the weak spots are.\n\ngross: so i want to get back to your parents being shot when you were 10. so you were watching scooby-doo! christmas, and you kind of initially paid no attention to it. you just wanted to watch your cartoon. and you don't know the circumstances of this shooting. i understand you were 10 then, but many years have elapsed since then. you've never asked your parents to tell you what happened?\n\nnguyen: yeah. i've asked my parents certain kinds of questions that i thought were the important ones, you know, about their life in general. and then there's certain things that i have - i don't know if i've passed over them deliberately or not. i just - why? why reopen old wounds? i think that's been my parents' attitude towards many issues.\n\nand i think back to this one particular incident. and i'm like - you know, they were shot. and they weren't shot badly. i mean, they were released from the hospital the next day. but do i really want to go there? do i really want to talk about this incident? i mean, it's for me to know something, but it's for them to maybe safeguard and protect.\n\nwhat i do know in general is that their life as shopkeepers was intensely difficult. they literally worked seven days a week every day of the year except christmas, new year's and easter. and they literally worked 12 to 14 hour days. they would work at the store. and then they would come back. they would cook dinner or barely cook dinner. they were - you know, dinner was a really horrible experience. and then i would help them, you know, do the checks and tabulate the accounts. and, you know, by the time i was 10 or 11, i was helping to do the accounting.\n\nand it was a hard life. and i sympathize with this idea that maybe we shouldn't ask our parents to have to relive the difficult things that they've survived.\n\ngross: were you afraid in the store after that?\n\nnguyen: i hated that store. you know, i am thankful to my parents that they were not the kind of - i mean, they made me do certain kinds of things, like do the accounting and all of that. but they rarely actually made me go physically to the store to help them do that kind of work. and i didn't like being there.\n\nand i think they didn't make me do these kinds of things because they wanted me to study. they sacrificed their lives in order for my brother and i to always have food, to always have clothing and to always have an education - and to have religion. those were their priorities. but they didn't want us to become shopkeepers and to do their kind of work. so fortunately, we were protected from that.\n\ngross: my guest is viet thanh nguyen. his novel, the sympathizer, won this year's pulitzer prize for fiction. we'll talk more after we take a short break. and our tv critic, david bianculli, will talk about how jimmy fallon, james corden and jerry seinfeld's viral videos are changing comedy. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross back with viet thanh nguyen. his novel the sympathizer won this year's pulitzer prize for fiction. it's set in vietnam during the war and in la just after. the main character is a spy for north vietnam working undercover as an aide to a general in south vietnam. viet thanh nguyen was born in south vietnam. he was 4 in 1975 when the war ended. the north, which was communist, took over the south. the americans pulled out. and he and his family fled to the u.s.\n\ndo you remember when you started realizing that there was an enormous conflict in the united states about the war in vietnam and that the war had really divided america?\n\nnguyen: well, i knew that we were different as vietnamese people really early. and, you know, soon after i came - we came to san jose, calif., - my parents had to open this grocery. and i walked on that street, and i saw a sign in a window that said another american business driven out by vietnamese people. so that was my first sense that, somehow, we had arrived in a place that looked at us as different. and then not long after that, the vcr arrived on the scene. and i was about 10 years old. we got a vcr.\n\nand one of the first movies that i remember watching was apocalypse now. i was probably about 10. and i think that was the first indication, also, that i had that there was something called this war and that this was how americans saw this war as one that had divided them. and that was my first glimmering that there was something like a civil war happening in the american soul and that we as vietnamese people were caught up in that because i watched that movie as a good, american boy who had already seen some american war movies - john wayne in world war ii.\n\nand i was cheering for the american soldiers until the moment in apocalypse now where they started killing vietnamese people. and that was an impossible moment for me because i didn't know who i was supposed to identify with, the americans who were doing the killing or the vietnamese who were dying and not being able to speak?\n\nand that moment has never left me as the symbolic moment of my understanding that this was our place in an american war, that the vietnam war was an american war from the american perspective and that, eventually, i would have to do something about that.\n\ngross: well, you kind of work that out a little bit in your new novel because the main character, the spy, after the fall of saigon when he comes to the u.s., he ends up being an advisor on a film called the hamlet, that's very much modeled on apocalypse now. it's like your fictional version of apocalypse now. and in the acknowledgments for your book, you mention, like, a whole bunch of, like, books and movies that you, like, read or watched that have to do with apocalypse now. so your spy is, like, an advisor on this movie. what is expected of him?\n\nnguyen: well, he's an advisor on this movie, which is certainly, you know, clearly alluding to apocalypse now. but it's really a compilation of all the movies that i'd scene about the vietnam war because apocalypse now is actually a great movie, even though it traumatized me. and it's a problematic movie. but so many of the movies that were made about the vietnam war were not that great. and the hamlet is going to be one of these films. but his job on this film is to be the authenticity consultant.\n\nand, you know, his basic understanding of this is that hollywood is interested in the authenticity of details when it comes to others. so they have to get the right costume down, for example. but they're not interested in the authenticity of the people that they're dealing with. so all of these vietnamese people who've been brought in to have roles in this american epic about the vietnam war literally have nothing to say.\n\ntheir function is to literally just be stage props for an american drama. and my narrator understands this. and he understands it very intellectually and viscerally that what is happening here is that hollywood is the unofficial ministry of propaganda for the pentagon, that its role is to basically prepare americans to go fight wars by making them focus only on the american understanding of things and to understand others as alien and different and marginal, even to their own histories, right?\n\nand so his belief is that he can somehow try to subvert this ministry of propaganda, this vast war epic that is going to continue to kill vietnamese people in a cinematic fashion, which is simply the prelude to actually killing vietnamese people in real life. so he believes that he can try to make a difference. and, of course, the humor and the tragedy is that he can't.\n\ngross: you know, one of the things you say about the war and hollywood is that, like, this is one war where the losers get to write the story.\n\nnguyen: yeah, and that's one of the tremendous ironies, you know, that the united states lost the war, in fact, in 1975. but for the very same reason that the united states was able to wage a war in which it lost 58,000 american soldiers, which is a human tragedy, but was able to create the conditions by which 3 million vietnamese people died of all sides and 3 million laotians and cambodians died during those years and in the years afterwards.\n\nfor the very same reasons that the industrial power of the united states is able to produce this vast inequity of death, that's the same reason that the united states, in the years afterward, through its incredibly powerful cultural industry, is able to win the war in memory because wherever you go outside of vietnam, you have to deal with american memories of the vietnam war. inside vietnam, you have to confront vietnamese memories. but outside, wherever i've gone and talked about the vietnam war and memory, one of the first questions that i get is what do you think of apocalypse now? so...\n\n(laughter)\n\nnguyen: ...that's what we have to confront - right? - that american soft power is tremendously powerful. and it goes hand-in-hand with american hard power.\n\ngross: of course, so many of the movies made about vietnam are about the divisions in american about whether it was a just war or not and whether american soldiers committed atrocities or not.\n\nnguyen: yeah, and this is one of the things that people have a hard time getting their minds around. i often get questions, people saying, well, if you look at these vietnam war movies, americans come off really badly. and my response to that is, yes, that's true, but they're still the movie stars. and given an option between being a virtuous extra who gets to say nothing and being the demonic antihero who occupies center stage, i think everybody would choose being the demonic antihero. and that's what's happening.\n\nthe basic reality of the vietnam war that americans can't get around is that it was, in many ways, a really bad war. and so hollywood has at least acknowledged that much. but the way that it has contained the meaning of that war is to make americans the stars of this drama and relegate the vietnamese to the margins, even though in reality, the vietnamese paid the heaviest price. and that is one of the ways by which cultural power, soft power, prepares americans to do the same things over again, that now as we confront the same parallels and analogous situations in the middle east, the irony is that, you know, it's mostly people from these other countries that are dying.\n\nbut americans are preoccupied with their own experiences. that's an exact replication of the mindset that got us into vietnam and that has now allowed americans to remember the vietnam war in a certain way that makes it an america war.\n\ngross: do you see your novel the sympathizer in part as an answer to that, as an alternative way of seeing the war, a way of seeing it through vietnamese eyes as opposed to through american eyes?\n\nnguyen: you know, absolutely. it's my revenge on francis ford coppola.\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\nnguyen: it's my revenge on hollywood (laughter). and, you know, my lonely, small effort - not even lovely and small. many vietnamese-american artists and writers are doing very similar things to try to get americans to understand that vietnam is a country and not a war. and they're also trying to get vietnamese people to understand this war in a different way, too, because the vietnamese understanding of it in vietnam is equally problematic from a very different way. but, you know, we write novels. and what that means is my novel, even though it won this prize, is just a book.\n\nand hollywood produces $200 million, $500 million blockbuster epics that will totally destroy my book.\n\ngross: well, at least your book won the pulitzer prize (laughter).\n\nnguyen: at least, yeah.\n\ngross: if you're just joining us, my guest is viet thanh nguyen. and his novel the sympathizer won this year's pulitzer prize for fiction. let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: this is fresh air, and if you're just joining us my guest is viet thanh nguyen. his novel the sympathizer won this year's pulitzer prize for fiction. it's written in the form of a forced confession by a spy for north vietnam. the novel is about the end of the war from the points of view of vietnamese characters. viet thanh nguyen fled vietnam with his family in 1975 after the fall of saigon, when he was 4 years old. they came to the united states.\n\nyour novel is written in the form of a confession - the confession of a north vietnamese spy whose name we don't know. and i'm wondering if you read any confessions before writing this book, or if you read what you describe as the discourse of steady groups, committees and parties - parties as in communist party, not like new year's party.\n\nnguyen: right exactly. well, you know, i certainly knew that the confession or the autobiographical self-criticism was a really important part of chinese and vietnamese communist efforts to reeducate - that's a euphemism - reeducate the people that they had defeated. and i hadn't actually read any of those but i'd heard about them repeatedly. and i had read autobiographical accounts of people who had survived these kinds of reeducation camps or reeducation experiences. so i had a pretty good idea of what these kinds of autobiographies would look like. and to me it seemed like this was a great literary form, to try to adapt and to integrate with the spy story that is a part of the novel because the confession certainly has other roots - christians have been writing confessions since saint augustine, at the very least - and it meshed very well with the idea of a political confession, too. and my narrator struggles with both what it means to be a communist and what it means to be a catholic.\n\nand the other reason why the confession became really important to the novel is that it's confession written from one vietnamese person to another vietnamese person who was the interrogator. and what that meant was that what i could do in the novel was to construct an implied audience of vietnamese people. so it was vietnamese people talking to vietnamese people, which is not how minority literature typically works in this country. typically if you're a minority writer in this country you're expected to write towards the white audience. i mean, the literary industry is 89 percent white. they're the first line of defense in terms of getting published in this country and minority writers understand that. and i really did not want to write this novel with a first audience of white americans. i wanted to write it with a first audience of other vietnamese people. and i knew that this would fundamentally change the way that the novel was written and how it would situate the american readership.\n\ngross: you write that your parents are prosperous, your brother is a doctor who leads a white house advisory committee on asian-americans and pacific islanders, you're a professor, you're a novelist, you're a pulitzer prize winner, but you say our family story is story of loss and death, for we are here only because the u.s. fought a war that killed 3 million of our countrymen, not counting over 2 million others who died in neighboring laos and cambodia. do often think about what your life would've been like if your family had stayed in vietnam?\n\nnguyen: well, of course because i have my sister's story as an example. and i have the stories of many, many vietnamese people who stayed behind or were left behind who are relatives of people who came to the united states or to other countries. and of course for many of them it was a really, really difficult time and a really horrible experience. and i know that when i talk about these kinds of things in this context that what people are hearing in your audience is that my family and myself are examples of the american dream - we've made it, right? and i really resist that idea.\n\ni mean, obviously we're successful and we're successful partially because of the opportunities that america has offered. but, again, it's only possible because of a war that the united states waged in vietnam. and there are so many asian immigrants and refugees who have come from countries like the philippines, korea, laos, cambodia who are here in the united states because of wars that the u.s. waged overseas. and the difficulty for americans and for these refugees and immigrants is to think about both of these kinds of things at the same time - economic opportunity domestically in the united states for some asian immigrants and refugees, not all of them - that are made possible because of foreign wars that the united states have waged abroad.\n\nand the way that i think about it is that i have to insist all the time that i am not an immigrant and that i - the story that i'm telling in my novel is not an immigrant story. i'm a refugee and the story i'm telling is a war story because one of the ways that the united states tries to contain the meaning of these histories is to think that all of these asians are here because they're immigrants, and that their story begins once they get to the united states. but again, my understanding is that many of these asians are here because of the consequences of wars. and many immigrant stories and refugee stories need to be understood as war stories.\n\ngross: so your first name is viet, which is i think a very common name for people from vietnam. it's also the first half of the name of the country that you were born in - vietnam. what does viet mean?\n\nnguyen: viet just means the name of the people. so my parents chose for me a very nationalist and patriotic name. and in combination with my last name - nguyen - i am basically john smith in vietnam. but what's also interesting is that, you know, i've always understood that even as common as that name is - my name is for vietnamese people here in the united states, it's obviously for many americans - for most americans - a very foreign name that they have a hard time getting their tongue around. but i've never changed my name because i think for whatever reason, as ambivalent as i feel about coming from vietnam - especially, you know, when i was an adolescent growing up in the united states - as ambivalent as i felt about it, i also felt that i was vietnamese. and whether or not vietnamese people accept me as vietnamese or see me as authentically vietnamese, i always felt that there was a part of me that had been marked by being born in vietnam, that had marked indelibly by being a refugee, by war and that i would not give up my name for anybody. my parents, for example, i think are more pragmatic. they have adopted american names legally, even though they're very, very, very vietnamese.\n\ngross: really? your parents changed their names?\n\nnguyen: yeah, they have. they changed their names. i mean, in the vietnamese community they go by their vietnamese names. but they're very pragmatic. as business people outside of that community, to do business they go by their american names on their driver's licenses. and i had that option when i - when we became citizens, to change my name. and i thought, maybe i can be troy.\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\nnguyen: though whatever name i tried - see, you laugh. nothing sounded right. nothing sounded right except my own name. so i've always stayed with it despite the minor cost that it might have entailed in terms of not seeming to be quite as american as everybody else. but obviously the ambition is to make americans say my name, to make americans recognize that this is also now an american name. it is also now a french name. it is also now an australian name. my surname, nguyen, is the fourth most popular surname in australia. you know, we've transformed the countries that we've come to and the people who live in these countries will eventually be able to say our names in the same ways that they say coppola.\n\ngross: well, viet, thank you so much for talking with us. and congratulations on winning the pulitzer.\n\nnguyen: thank you so much for having me, terry. it's been a pleasure.\n\ngross: viet thanh nguyen won this year's pulitzer prize for fiction for his novel the sympathizer. after we take a short break, our tv critic david bianculli will talk about how james corden and jerry seinfeld's comedies in cars are examples of how the internet is changing the comedy landscape. this is fresh air.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
mine executives in brazil step down after deadly dam collapse\n\nseveral top executives of a brazilian iron mine company have stepped down temporarily after a government investigation into january's deadly dam collapse. about 300 people were killed.\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\nto brazil now. executives of the mining company vale have quit after a mining disaster that killed some 300 people. here's reporter catherine osborn.\n\ncatherine osborn, byline: when the dam at vale's iron mine in the small city of brumadinho burst in late january, brazilians thought back to a similar recent disaster. vale co-owned a nearby mine where a dam burst in 2015. that killed 19 people, and the mine waste left a trail of environmental ruin. but no one was arrested, and the mine's owners paid less than 10 percent of the federal environmental fines they owed. now state investigators are taking a new enforcement approach. last week, they cited engineering reports from 2017 and 2018 that alerted vale managers the dam was unstable and called for 14 employees to step down. four of them did so temporarily on saturday, including ceo fabio schvartsman (ph). risk management professor gerardo portela from the federal university of rio says this shows a change in how brazilian investigators understand accountability for this kind of disaster.\n\ngerardo portela: (speaking portuguese).\n\nosborn: they started to study the engineering processes better and discovered that there is information about these risks that gets to top managers, he says. schvartsman, the ceo, said in a letter to the board on saturday that he and the other directors acted adequately and correctly. the state prosecutor's report cites warnings about instability at another vale dam since the recent disaster, saying vale delayed in responding.\n\nportela: (speaking portuguese).\n\nosborn: portela says not much changed after the 2015 tragedy, but from now going forward, it does look like some change is possible. brazilians who live near mining dams across the country have remained on high alert in recent weeks as safety certificates are being rechecked and evacuation procedures practiced.\n\nfor npr news, i'm catherine osborn in rio de janeiro.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

immigration, infrastructure and iran: the president's plans for 2018\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nicholas kamm/afp/getty images nicholas kamm/afp/getty images\n\nthe senate returns wednesday, and president trump made his way back to washington on monday after lying fairly low to end the year in palm beach, fla., at his personal resort.\n\nhis first year was a mixed bag of legislative accomplishments (tax overhaul) and failures (health care), the book is still out on his foreign policy posture, and the russia probe continues.\n\nso what should we expect in 2018? there are four areas of domestic policy the president is particularly focused on, according to the white house — immigration, infrastructure, welfare and health care.\n\ni would expect to see those four areas, as well as national security, which never goes away, white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said, per usa today.\n\nmore pressingly, there is a jan. 19 deadline to pass yet another spending bill to keep the lights on in the government.\n\nhere is a look at some of those key priority areas and variables:\n\nnational security\n\nthe president's team would make the case that the u.s. is safer now and that isis is on the run. but there have been lone wolf attacks domestically on this president's watch, including a truck attack in new york that killed eight people and another man's failed attempt to blow himself up in the new york subway.\n\nattacks like these have prompted the president to move to curtail the immigration system further. his critics argue that doing so emboldens recruitment for those trying to pull off or inspire these kinds of attacks. so that will remain an area of political tension.\n\niran\n\nthe president has tweeted support for protests against the current iranian regime, while also opposing (yet not completely ripping up) the iranian nuclear deal.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption anadolu agency/getty images anadolu agency/getty images\n\nat least 21 people have been reported dead in iran, as the regime has moved against the protesters. but it's still unclear what this president wants to do tangibly to effect change. vice president pence has brought up the difference from past administrations' approaches, but remember, back in 2009 when protests also cropped up, it was a very different kind of iranian leadership that then-president barack obama was dealing with. now, there is a more pragmatic leader in president hassan rouhani than there was in mahmoud ahmadinejad. so what would change in iran actually bring?\n\nwhat's more, trump's stance on the uprising is more in line with an interventionist approach, which is contradictory to his more isolationist america first policy. so there is a question about the trump doctrine: when does the united states intervene and when does it not? what is the trigger to say, ok, this is where the united states gets involved?\n\nnorth korea\n\nanyone who thought the north korean leader would be cowed by a more saber-rattling u.s. stance was mistaken. kim jong un took to state airwaves during the new year's holiday weekend to tout that his country had made progress as a nuclear power — and that he has a button to launch attacks on his desk.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jung yeon-je/afp/getty images jung yeon-je/afp/getty images\n\nthe white house says it remains focused on the denuclearization of north korea. but the president also tweeted criticism of china, a key player in achieving that goal. and, ironically, it is china that is stepping forward as more of a world leader as the united states has receded, as some see it, under trump.\n\nchina\n\nthe view from china of trump? yan xuetong, dean of tsinghua university's institute of modern international relations, told the new yorker:\n\namerican leadership has already dramatically declined in the past ten months. in 1991, when bush, sr., launched the war against iraq, it got thirty-four countries to join the war effort. this time, if trump launched a war against anyone, i doubt he would get support from even five countries. for chinese leaders, yan said, 'trump is the biggest strategic opportunity.' [new yorker reporter evan osnos] asked yan how long he thought the opportunity would last. 'as long as trump stays in power,' he replied.\n\nso, for as much as trump might think chinese president xi jinping likes him (he treated me better than anybody's ever been treated in the history of china), xi might have a different reason for feeling that way than trump thinks.\n\nimmigration\n\nas noted, for trump, immigration is tied to national security. so don't expect him to pull back on his push to curtail various programs and make the u.s. immigration system more merit-based.\n\ndemocrats, though, feel as if they have leverage in this election year on the issue, especially because there is generally bipartisan support for a dream act or a path to legalization, if not citizenship, for people in the u.s. illegally who haven't committed crimes. (the dream act would provide a path to citizenship for people brought to the united states as children.)\n\ntrump said in september that he was giving congress six months to address daca, the executive action implemented by obama on deferred action for childhood arrivals. that means congress has until march to do something. daca allowed people brought to the country as children to avoid deportation. obama signed the executive order after congress failed to pass a bipartisan comprehensive immigration overhaul.\n\nwe think we have to have a daca solution, house speaker paul ryan told npr's steve inskeep on nov. 30.\n\nwe'll see shortly what that is or whether it is even true. still, trump's posture doesn't appear to be one through which a deal has been made. in fact, he tweeted friday that any daca deal must include building a wall with mexico and ending both chain migration and the visa lottery system.\n\ninfrastructure\n\ninfrastructure is always dangled as a potentially big area of bipartisanship. both parties say they want it, and yet nothing has gotten done in the past decade.\n\nwhy? the question of how to pay for it.\n\nyet, trump teased that maybe we start with infrastructure in the new year.\n\ninfrastructure is by far the easiest, the president said dec. 22 during the bill signing for the tax overhaul. people want it — republicans and democrats. we're going to have tremendous democrat support on infrastructure as you know. i could've started with infrastructure — i actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road. so we'll be having that done pretty quickly.\n\nhaving it done pretty quickly could be an overstatement. republicans are going to need 60 votes, which now means the support of nine democrats or independents after democrat doug jones was sworn in wednesday.\n\nwelfare, entitlements and health care\n\nryan, r-wis., has indicated that he would like to target welfare and entitlements, but trump and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., are not on board with all that ryan wants to do.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption portland press herald via getty images portland press herald via getty images\n\nthe trump administration is reviewing the programs, and the white house is preparing a january executive order related to welfare, according to politico. npr's mara liasson reports that the president wants to keep his promise not to touch the big, middle-class entitlements — medicare and social security — but he is interested in reforming means-tested programs that target lower-income americans.\n\npolitics republicans talk of changes to welfare next republicans talk of changes to welfare next listen · 4:51 4:51\n\nthe temporary assistance for needy families programs affects about 1.5 million families, and liasson reports:\n\nwhite house aides say they are now looking at a number of additional changes, including tighter work requirements and drug-testing rules for food stamps, medicaid and housing assistance. those changes may not save much money the way changes in the big middle-class entitlements like medicare or social security might. but it will help the president highlight an issue that seems to motivate his base in a year when getting republican voters excited is the no. 1 goal.\n\nthe senate also seems to be less-than-enthused to change any of the big entitlements. mcconnell, who will be clinging to an even narrower 51-49 majority in 2018, told axios that he would not expect to see the senate work on making changes to those programs without democrats.\n\ni think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan, mcconnell told npr. the house may have a different agenda. if our democratic friends in the senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform, i'd be happy to take a look at it.\n\ntranslation: he is not about to walk the plank without holding hands with democrats — and democrats aren't going anywhere near the edge of that ship.\n\nit's the same story when it comes to health care.\n\nwell, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 senate, mcconnell told npr. we'll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 senate. but i think we'll probably move on to other issues.\n\ndoes ryan resign?\n\nso if a tax overhaul has passed — and ryan can't get his next agenda on entitlements, welfare or health care through the senate, it does raise the question — does the speaker think about stepping aside in the next few months or after the election?\n\nremember, this is not a job he wanted. he was seen as the only one who could get the votes to become speaker after john boehner resigned. it has certainly been rumored that ryan is considering resigning — and it makes some sense. at this point, it's just speculation, but worth watching.\n\ni ain't goin' anywhere, ryan told reporters after a dec. 14 politico piece speculating on his resignation.\n\nhis office added, this is pure speculation. spokeswoman ashlee strong said, as the speaker himself said today, he's not going anywhere any time soon.\n\nboehner's representatives denied he was leaving up until right before he did.\n\nmidterms will shape the year\n\nnot much traditionally gets done in midterm years, mcconnell is skittish about diving into the president's thornier priorities and democrats feel they have some leverage now on things like immigration and infrastructure.\n\nso don't expect them to jump at the chance to work with this president, in this election year, without major concessions.
bbc's 'dynasties' captures the complicated social lives of 5 different species\n\nterry gross, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm terry gross. there's a lot of great dramatic television these days. and our subject today is a series where none of the stars are professional actors. in fact, none of them are human.\n\n(soundbite of chimpanzee screeching)\n\ngross: dynasties is a new five-part bbc series focusing on groups of animals from five different species, each with rich and complex social lives. there's an hour each on lions, chimpanzees, tigers, painted wolves and emperor penguins. naturalists and camera crews followed each group for up to two years, long enough so that the episodes reveal the social relationships among the animals, their kinship and affection, as well as their rivalries and power struggles. real plotlines develop and drama unfolds. the series is narrated by david attenborough.\n\nour guest is the executive producer, michael gunton. he has advanced degrees in zoology and animal biology and is creative director of the factual and natural history unit of the bbc, where he spent most of his career. dynasties premiered january 19. it's airing on bbc america, amc, ifc and sundance tv and will soon be available on demand. gunton spoke with fresh air's dave davies.\n\ndave davies, byline: well, michael gunton, welcome to fresh air. you know, there've been lots of terrific tv films and series about animals over the years, many you've participated in with david attenborough. but this one was different. you're putting a ton of cameras and equipment and personnel, committing them to a family for two years. and it is remarkable. you had to pick the right families - in effect, cast the series for...\n\nmichael gunton: yeah. i mean, i've used that expression. and it does sound strange in terms of documentary. but, actually, that is exactly what we had to do because the only way i felt this would work is if you could be sure - as it were, sure as you possibly can be. you can never be sure in nature - that one, the animals were box office animals, that they had real charisma and people would want to watch them; two, that we could get access to them and that they had scientific backing, scientists studying them so that we knew the stories we were telling were true; but most importantly that we needed to be pretty sure that something tumultuous was going to happen in their lives.\n\nit was going to be a real change because, you know, we called this series dinasties (ph) - or dynasties, as you say it - because it is about power struggles within families and about animals trying to either hold onto their rulership or take over. so we wanted to make sure that there was going to be real dramatic action.\n\ndavies: so these are - really involves plotlines, in effect, among individuals. i guess the penguins was a little different. but...\n\ngunton: yeah.\n\ndavies: among four of the five, you have these real struggles that develop among individuals in the species. and i thought we'd listen to one clip. this is from the episode called chimpanzee, where you follow a group of chimpanzees. and there's an alpha male named david. he's been named by the scientists who've been studying them. he's had that role for three years, which is around the time these things typically change. he's kind of a, you know, a very mature alpha...\n\ngunton: yep.\n\ndavies: ...male. and in this little section, we're going to hear david attenborough narrates as the chimps are eating termites from a big mound. let's listen.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, dynasties)\n\ndavid attenborough: these chimps have learned to use grass stems as tools to fish out the insects.\n\n(soundbite of chimpanzee calling)\n\nattenborough: as leader, david gets his pick of the feeding spots. but he is wary, as he must feed alongside old enemies. he has two particularly ambitious rivals. david's toes begin to twitch - a nervous tic he can't conceal. this is jumkin, who has long sought the top spot, and this luther...\n\n(soundbite of chimpanzees screaming)\n\nattenborough: ...a tempestuous younger male...\n\n(soundbite of chimpanzee screaming)\n\nattenborough: ...with an aggressive streak.\n\n(soundbite of chimpanzee calling)\n\nattenborough: the troop is together for the first time in months. and jostling for good feeding spots can easily lead to clashes.\n\n(soundbite of chimpanzees screaming)\n\nattenborough: it's vital that david keeps order and defuses the situation. all eyes are on him.\n\n(soundbite of chimpanzee screeching)\n\nattenborough: his display shows he is in control.\n\ndavies: oh, it's a rumble.\n\ngunton: (laughter).\n\ndavies: that is david attenborough in the series dynasty (ph). our guest is the executive producer, michael gunton. this is a fascinating story. and when you invested in following these groups, did the crews know what the plotlines of the story would be?\n\ngunton: well, that's the key thing. when i was thinking about how this might work and sort of selling the idea to my bosses, who were actually going to have to pay for it, you know, one of the things i was saying to them is that these will end up feeling quite like drama but they cannot be plotted because these are true observational documentaries. we have the confidences that if we know enough about these animals and enough about the situation that we're pretty certain something is - dramatic is going to happen. and we will just follow that action as it happens. there were certainly times when things weren't happening or things were happening we weren't predicting. and we weren't being able to kind of work out what was going to happen.\n\nbut i think that's what has made them so exciting to watch as viewers because they feel they are witnessing something that they really do not know what's going to happen in the same way that we didn't. so for the crews, it's kind of keeping your wits about you all the time, about where's this heading, who's - you know, is that animal going to make its move now for - to challenge or is something else going to happen here? so in shooting it, it's quite an unusual situation because you're kind of having to cover almost everything.\n\nbut also, you have to really concentrate on the detail because sometimes, the clue and the things that the audience want to see may be quite a subtle movement, like a little look or little baring of its teeth. so these were long - these were two years, sometimes longer, filming these creatures. and to keep that kind of concentration and that intensity of following them and trying to film them was, you know, was, again, a unique thing we've not done before.\n\ndavies: in this particular story, david is eventually attacked by some of his rivals, the alpha male - alpha of the chimpanzees and suffers some pretty nasty injuries, which are really graphically seen in the series. he makes a comeback by building alliances almost like a ward politician. you want to describe what happens here.\n\ngunton: two things happen when david is attacked. so the females coming into breeding season is what finally stimulated these - his rivals to come together and make their move. and what's strange is that one of the females is particularly attractive. so, apparently, whenever she gets into - comes into breeding conditions - breeding season - the males get more interested because she's the - they find her the most attractive. anyway, she came into season, so that's why his rivals picked their moment to attack him. and they attacked him so severely. they, effectively, left him for dead. and we actually thought he was dead.\n\nbut rather like something out of the - kind of cross between the revenant and, you know, something from, like, clint eastwood in one of those fistful of dollar (ph) movies. he does recover slowly. and he goes off to feed himself up and to build his strength because he knows that if he doesn't get back to the troop soon, one of the usurpers will take over power. so he builds himself and builds himself. and - you know, these terrible injuries. he walks the 10 kilometers - seven or eight miles - to where they are and then makes this enormous gamble, which is that even though he's weak and unable to and would actually in a - if it came to a fight, would not be able to win.\n\nhe kind of stands up on his back legs and makes himself look as big as possible and just walks towards his - this major rival to intimidate him as much as he can. and the rival has this - you can see it in his face. this moment he thinks, this shouldn't be happening. i thought we'd killed you. he's coming back towards and he looks around, almost for - the rival looks around for support, doesn't get any. and then just at that moment, just bottles it and says, i can't do it, and runs away. and david, effectively, by not actually having to strike a blow, has regained his position in the - as the alpha.\n\ndavies: yeah. and then this thing happens where he's still an aging leader. he's not as strong as some of these young, tough ones. and he employs a strategy to get help.\n\ngunton: yeah. what normally happens is that males - these alpha males will try and get a kind of a group of other males to support him. of course, the politics of this is all - there's duplicity going on all over the place. so, you know, he's trying to get friends and allies. but can he really trust them? but what he, in the end, does, which, i think, is - he always had this one particular friend who supported him. but just the two of them together weren't strong enough.\n\nso what he now does is he tries to court the attentions and the favors of the elders of the troop, who are too old now to really challenge him. once you get to above about 24-ish in chimp - in this particular society, you're too old. and they are past that. so it's worth their while being his friend because if they are his friend, they might get some benefits from being with him. so they might potentially be able to go off and have a little quick, sneaky mating with one of the females, or something like that.\n\nso it's a kind of, you scratch my back, i'll scratch yours. and together, they create this alliance. so when the younger males later try and do a takeover again, they suddenly realize, no, we can't because he's got all these other guys with him, and they're together. they're far too strong.\n\ndavies: michael gunton is executive producer of the bbc series dynasties. we'll continue our conversation after a short break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ndavies: this is fresh air, and we're speaking with michael gunton. he's executive producer of the bbc series dynasties, an intimate look at five animal species. each episode focuses on the group dynamics of a single group or family in the species over an extended period of time. it premiered january 19 and is airing on bbc america, amc, ifc and sundance tv and will be available on demand.\n\nlet's talk about how you shoot this stuff. i mean, a lot of the shots of these animals are really close. what did the crews have to do to get so close and stay so close - 'cause some of these animals really move.\n\ngunton: (laughter) yes. one of the essential elements of the series is that you feel close to the animals. you want to - we want the audience to feel in their world and kind of experiencing the world and the challenges that those animals are facing. and so how you do that photographically is part of the way we get that to work. we're not actually as close as often as it might appear because there are certain things that operate when you're doing this. if you get - you always have to consider any impact you might have on the behavior. and if you get too close, there comes a point where you do start to influence their behavior. you distract them or they become aware of your presence.\n\nso the skill, i think, of the crews out there - and they're all fantastic natural historians, biologists, in their own right - is just constantly gauging that proximity barrier, if you like. now, some of this is done on telephoto lenses. but we tried wherever we can to not do that, but to try and get the camera off the tripod and in a more hand-held - the cameras in a more fluid way and using slightly wider-angle lenses, which does demand that you get closer.\n\nso part of it, as i say, is understanding the reaction of the animals. and they are all habituated, to some degree, in the sense that they're observed by scientists or naturalists. and so they are used to human presence. and, you know, the chimpanzee film that we were talking about is - you know, that was an interesting one. when you turn up there after having been away for a while, david, the chimpanzee, the alpha male, will look at the crew and sort of think - maybe just give them a stare or do something, and sort of say, i remember you. don't forget, i'm the boss. and then turn away and then forget them for the rest of time he's there.\n\nand they - i don't know whether they think we're kind of walking trees, or something like that. but it's a quite interesting relationship that you have with them. you don't want to really have a relationship, but you certainly don't want them to be conscious of your presence.\n\ndavies: one of the remarkable shots in the series is of tiger cubs in a den, which was really secluded. they're (laughter) really adorable and amazing. how do you set up a camera to capture that?\n\ngunton: well, filming those baby tiger cubs is a good example of how you have to be very, very careful about disturbance, and how you have to really plan how you get certain shots in a program like this, particularly when you're trying to follow individual life stories. filming tiger cubs is not something that people have been able to do very often because often, you're just simply not allowed to or unable to actually get close to them.\n\nso what we did was, we were able to use - once we'd located where the den was, we used remote cameras so that the cameraman was able to approach and put a camera on a long, super-extended tripod. and on that tripod was a camera with a number of remote servers on it which allowed him to pan, and tilt, and zoom and change the exposure. and then that was wirelessly connected to a control panel, which he was then able to retreat off to some distance away and then just leave it. because if you would try to do it in a hide, or a blind, as you guys call it, that would be too disturbing.\n\nso by being a long distance away and just letting the camera on its own, you know, he was able to spend four hours filming those cubs, which, i don't think it would be possible any other way. and that's why you get that extraordinary intimacy. and, you know, it's one of the most beautiful sequences in the whole series, those cubs - and also unique. i mean, people never get that close to them and able to film like that.\n\ndavies: and some of these animals really range over large areas. how did you keep track of them?\n\ngunton: well, (laughter), every one of these films had its own logistical challenge in that sense because the chimpanzees there, they don't move very far, but when they do move, they go. and this is a really tough habitat. that forest is 40 degrees centigrade. that's 40 - yeah - 40 degrees centigrade. i don't know what that is in fahrenheit, but it's very (laughter) hot and humid and ghastly. and then we were filming the painted wolves, and they range over enormous areas. so that, you're in vehicles. you're using drones to follow them. at one point, we had about five different crews following those two packs.\n\nwith the emperor penguins, that's not a case of - they don't move anywhere, but you have to be out there in -40 degrees centigrade, which i think is actually the same as -40 degrees fahrenheit, and even colder with windchill. and that's the most brutal place on planet earth. so every single one of these things has a particular kind of logistical challenge that you have to adapt your crews and your filmmaking approach, in fact, to accommodate.\n\ndavies: you know, it was fascinating - at the end of each of the episodes is a few minutes in which we meet the crew, and they talk about what they do. and in the one on painted wolves, these wild dogs that were - there are two packs that you follow, one of the trackers said he could distinguish them by smell?\n\ngunton: yeah, absolutely. in fact, there is a situation where, (laughter), the vehicle drives over a dropping. one of the painted wolves had had a poo there, and they drove over it. and as they drove over it, it squished it. so it released some smell. and he said, stop, we're following a different pack here. that's the other pack.\n\nand they...\n\ndavies: (laughter).\n\ngunton: ...had some radio tracking devices, and they flipped - they couldn't find the wolves. they flipped the frequency on the radio tracking, and then it went ping, ping, ping, ping. and it was the other pack. and he could tell because the diet of that particular pack, they had switched to hunting baboons. and the smell of baboon remains in there, in the dogs' feces, he could smell. it is kind of weirdly uncanny (laughter), what they can do, actually. it's sort of feels, whew, kind of magical.\n\ndavies: yeah. and in that case, there actually were some electronic tracking devices...\n\ngunton: yeah.\n\ndavies: ...attached to some individuals in the pack...\n\ngunton: yeah.\n\ndavies: ...right? yeah.\n\ngunton: yeah. so that - we don't apply - attach these devices. the scientific researchers do this to some individuals so they can follow the packs for various parts of their scientific research. with the painted wolves, i don't think - it would - although we - the trackers were amazing. and actually, for long distance tracking, you sometimes can only do it by that kind of traditional tracking skills. but when you're closer, strangely, they're actually sometimes harder to find because they might be sleeping under a thicket or something like that. and that's when the radio tracking devices sometimes can help you zero in on them and find them.\n\ndavies: what dangers did the crew face?\n\ngunton: we get asked this a lot about the dangers from - and people - i assume they mean from the animals. and the - to us, there's almost no danger from the animals because if there was, we wouldn't be doing our job right - because i think if the animals are aware of you or if you're in a situation where you might be attacked or might put yourself in danger, you have stepped too close, or you have done something that is disturbing the natural course of events. so really, the dangers we face are really driving around, flying around, going in boats or occasionally bumping into people with guns.\n\ndavies: oh, really - people with guns?\n\ngunton: well, on this series, that didn't really happen. but that - you know, on my - in my career, the most scared i've ever been is bumping into roadblocks in some of the more hostile parts of the world and with seeing people who, perhaps, were scared and weren't quite sure what to do and maybe didn't - we didn't have much in common in language. and yeah - that's scary.\n\ndavies: right.\n\ngunton: well, i've never been scared by - well, actually, that's not true. i have been scared by a rhino once. but pretty much, in 35 years, i've never really been scared by an animal.\n\ndavies: you know, there are times when the crew are, you know, photographing, you know, animals, which can - which are serious predators - i mean, tigers and lions - and are sometimes, you know, hungry, almost starving. don't they ever get concerned that the animals look at them and - that's moving.\n\ngunton: (laughter) you obviously have to respect all animals - that they are potentially a risk, a danger to you. funny enough, actually, predatory animals are often less of a risk than things like rhinos and elephants or buffalo. hippos - i mean, those are the ones that do more damage to people than predators, generally, partly because you don't think they're going to do any damage. but we always have to be very, very careful of how close we approach. and we are always very conscious of - you know, we're all natural historians. we're all, you know, biologists. we understand. we spend a lot of time in the field. and i think we have good antenna about when things are beginning to turn out wrong.\n\nand to be honest, if somebody got attacked by a predator - one of our film group - i'd be really cross with them because they will have done something wrong. they will have got themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time because if you put yourself in a situation like that, you're already - the animal's aware of you in a way that it shouldn't be aware of you. so i think we are pretty confident. we've - touch wood - we've never had an incident like that in all the 60 years that the natural history unit has been making films. and i think that's because we just kind of know what we're doing and make sure that that situation doesn't happen.\n\ngross: we're listening to the interview fresh air's dave davies recorded with michael gunton, executive producer of the bbc series dynasties. after a break, we'll talk about gender differences in the animals they followed for this series and how painted wolves care for their sick, injured and elderly. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of steve turre song, in the spur of the moment)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to the interview fresh air's dave davies recorded with michael gunton, the executive producer of the bbc series dynasties. the series provides a close look at five species of animals: lions, chimpanzees, tigers, painted wolves and emperor penguins. the episodes reveal the complex social relationships of these animals, showing kinship and affection and sometimes deadly power struggles. each group of animals was followed for years by camera crews and naturalists.\n\ndavies: they must get attached to the animals they follow. i mean, they, you know, in some cases, follow these individuals for two years. and there are cases, i mean, where the team could choose to intervene. there was one amazing scene where - in the lion episode where - it's - a young male lion named red, i think, wanders in to a bunch of hyenas.\n\ngunton: yeah.\n\ndavies: want to describe what happens there?\n\ngunton: young males in all - virtually all animals, ourselves included, often think they're a bit tougher and a bit braver and a bit cleverer than they really are. and one of the young males in this - in charm's pride - as they do it, this - they're - just before they're beginning to probably leave and go off and live their own lives, he was wandering around and thinking he was a bit of a - you know, bit invincible and ended up caught in a kind of a corral of hyenas and very quickly discovered that he was completely outnumbered.\n\nand the hyenas decided that they were going to take him out, and they just would not leave him. and they - what - of course, if he got one of them in his jaws, he could kill them instantly. but they were very clever. they'd run in. some of them would run in, and he'd snap at them. and the others would then run in and bite him on his rear. and they were, basically, trying to wound him and weaken him so that they could eventually - well, we don't know if they would've killed him. but it looked like that was what they were trying to do. and he was - and this was going on and on and on. and he was trying to fight them off, and then they would fight. and you could see he was getting weak, tired. and it didn't look like it was going to end happily.\n\nthere was a lot of - you know, a huge cacophony of sound, you know, rumpus of all this going, the howling of the hyenas, him roaring, all the rest of it. his half-brother was also out and about and heard this in the distance and looked over and came running over. and when he saw it, he ran in. and as soon as the hyenas saw there was another male lion, they stop it because suddenly, there were two jaws to fight - to bite rather than just one. and the odds were then completely against them. and so that - his half-brother, basically, saved his life.\n\ndavies: right. but i think we as the audience, and, i'm sure, the crew that was filming it, were thinking, oh, my god. we're going to see this...\n\ngunton: yeah.\n\ndavies: ...animal that we've developed this affection for ripped to pieces. wow.\n\ngunton: but the thing about that, you know, if you - people say, you know, talking about intervention, what would you do? i mean, as an observer of a camera crew, one - well, you know, if you walked in there, you'd probably end up being eaten by one or other of them.\n\ndavies: drive a vehicle towards them. no.\n\ngunton: yeah. but then what would they then - would the lion turn on you? would the hyenas turn on you? also, you have to take a kind of a judgment call that you're interfering with what is, you know, the rhythms of life, if you like. he had made a mistake. and that was what was going to happen. and i think if you'd intervened in that way, i think you'd - i think it would be a very difficult thing to justify. it's heartbreaking.\n\nbut i think you take a view. it's this sort of rule that you judge every situation on its own merits. and there was another situation in the series when - there was a difference - where we took a different view. but in that particular case, i think, you just observe what you're seeing. and let nature take its course.\n\ndavies: well, i want to talk about one case where the film crew did intervene to help some animals. and we have a clip from this series. this is about the emperor penguins. and they're on this huge ice sheet, where hundreds - maybe thousands - have come to breed, right? and...\n\ngunton: thousands, yeah.\n\ndavies: and they're - they've given birth to their chicks. and they're holding them in these warm little pouches in kind of - just off the ice at the base of their legs. but a storm has come up. and about 50 or so of these penguins were blown into a gully maybe 50 feet deep. and the sides of the gully are too steep and icy for them to climb out. so they're going to die there. and some of the chicks are starting to die. the film crew observes this. and then a storm comes up. and they have to leave because conditions are just too fierce. and then we pick up the story here - again, david attenborough narrating.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, dynasties)\n\nattenborough: two days later, the weather allows the team to return to the colony. already, the gully has claimed more casualties. the team decide to act.\n\nwill lawson: we've given it a lot of thought. we've decided that we are definitely going to dig a shallow ramp that they will hopefully use.\n\nattenborough: it's fairly rare for the film crew to intervene. but they realize that they may be able to save at least some of these birds simply by digging a few steps in the ice.\n\nunidentified person: oh, man. will, look.\n\nlawson: oh, my goodness. we were literally just about to leave. but the first birds are definitely making their way out, which is brilliant. so hopefully, they'll just make their way back to the colony. and them and their chicks will have a much better chance of survival because there's no chance that they were going to survive down there at all.\n\n(soundbite of penguins chirping)\n\ndavies: and that is from the series dynasties. our guest is michael gunton, the executive producer of the bbc series - pretty dramatic moment. and there are a few other cases. there was a case of a tiger who wanders too close to a village. and, i guess, in cooperation with conservation authorities, they tranquilize it and bring it back. i guess these were tough calls.\n\ngunton: yes. i - in the case of the tiger, we had no involvement in that at all. we just observed that. that was all done by the authorities. and generally, when there is an intervention like that, as there was, actually, in the lion film where the - one of the lions gets poisoned, again, it's the authorities who make that decision to intervene or not. but with the emperor penguins, it was such an unusual situation because all those kind of things i was mentioning or mentioned before about, you know, changing the dynamic between a predator and prey or between two fighting animals or feeding an animal that's starving, all those kind of things we don't do because one, you - how would you? and secondly, you're probably going to make things worse.\n\nbut this was a kind of - almost like a laboratory environment. there were no other animals involved. these animals, these - the penguins were blown into a - were in a prison kind of not of their own making. it was a complete freak of nature. this chasm had opened up. and the only reason why they couldn't get out was because, although the side of the thing was slippery, it was because they have to carry their chicks on their feet, which restricts the movement of their feet. so they just simply couldn't get enough traction on the ice. and so they would - they had a choice - the adults - either abandon their chick when they did have the traction or stay there and, eventually, would perish.\n\nwhat we actually saw before we had to leave the first time was one female did make it out. and she - what she did was she wouldn't give up. she had a little chick on her feet. and she used her beak as a kind of ice pick to give her this extra traction. and she sort of kind of chipped little bits into the ice and then would pull herself up. and she finally managed to get out. i think that gave us the thought that, actually, they can get out if they just had - could get a tiny little bit more traction.\n\nso the rules of working out there - you're not allowed to touch the animals. you're not allowed to get closer than a certain distance to them, which is pretty distant. but if - they've decided if they could just cut some tiny, little nicks, if you like, little chinks into the one side of the ice, they might - the penguins might discover it. and if they could, that could give them a chance to escape.\n\nand what was strange is almost immediately, they cut these little - i mean, steps is too grand, i think. they were little slices, little chinks. the penguins discovered it and out they went. and one after the other, one - they all got out. and i just think we all felt, how on earth would you - you know, imagine the conversation if we said, we could've done that. and we just sat there and watched them all perish. so i think in that case - very unusual situation - we made the right decision.\n\ndavies: michael gunton is executive producer of the bbc series dynasties. we'll take a break here and then talk some more. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of benji merrison and will slater's emperor penguins extended)\n\ndavies: this is fresh air, and we're speaking with michael gunton. he's executive producer of the bbc series dynasties, an intimate look at five animal species. each episode focuses on the group dynamics of a single group or family in the species over an extended period of time. it premiered january 19 and is airing on bbc america, amc, ifc and sundance tv and will be available on demand.\n\nthe behavior here is just fascinating in all these groups. and gender roles are very clearly defined, and it's interesting how they vary among species. you know, in the episode on lions, we see a pride of lions in which a female has this enormous burden of both protecting and feeding her young over long distances and long periods of time. and the reason is that the male lions in the pride have just left. is that typical? is that natural behavior?\n\ngunton: no, that was very unusual. in fact, that was - when we embarked on that film, we didn't expect that at all to be the story. we thought it would be - typically what happens is eventually, other males will come in and challenge the kind of incumbent males for that that position. and we thought there would be what they call a takeover or an attempted takeover, but just - for - i don't think anybody's really ever seen it, certainly they'd never filmed this before. these - the adult males just up and left. i mean, there's a lot of complex interactions with other prides in the area, which probably explains why they did it.\n\nbut what it meant is, as you said, is that suddenly the - this female, charm, whose job it is normally to provide because the females do most of the hunting and most the providing of the food, she not only had to be the provider, but she had to take the role of the males whose job it is fundamentally to be a protector of the pride. she had to do both jobs. and that, of course, put enormous pressure on her.\n\nand that really is the dynamic of the film is how she managed with that and how each of those challenges made each other - harder thing to do and so why she almost lost the pride. but in the end, because she's an incredible lioness, she managed to keep them together and rebuilt the pride and is now - and it became a powerful one again with resident males who then became the protectors.\n\ndavies: wow. so normally, the males hang out and protect while the females go out and hunt and get all the food.\n\ngunton: broadly, yeah.\n\ndavies: the dudes have it - get all the breaks, don't they, in nature?\n\ngunton: well, they're doing - well, i think people would say that in lion society, actually. male lions have a pretty easy time, except, of course, when they have to do the one thing they're there for, which is to protect, and then it can be pretty brutal.\n\ndavies: you know, there are some cases where animals - i think in the lion episode, where one of the young ones is ill and can't travel. and at some point, i mean, the pride will come back to check, but in the end, they can't do much. and the animal has left. and it's interesting that the painted wolves, who travel in packs, seemed just fiercely committed to taking care of each other. even, like, when one of them was - had a lame leg, they just wouldn't let go.\n\ngunton: absolutely. i mean, i suppose one of our hopes was that when you make a film about an animal like a painted wolf, you know, everybody knows and admires lions, but like a painter wolf, there's a kind of a bit of a misunderstood, a bit of a, you know, in some people's eyes a bit of a villain in nature films.\n\nand it's wrong to kind of, i think, to paint animals as good or bad. you know, they're all trying to make their living. and they're all trying to do the best they can. and the truth of it is, actually, that painted wolves are extraordinary animals. and actually, it's often lions are the baddies - if there was one in those situations. and, you know, that story about that - the way they look after their pack, their co-pack members is remarkable.\n\nthey are - they're one of the few animals that will have this kind of social care, if you like, for their fellows. and part of that, i'm sure, is because the pack is more efficient and more effective when numbers are high. they're much better at hunting. so, you know, in biological or evolutionary terms, it's good to keep your numbers up.\n\nbut nevertheless, they do have this, you know, uncanny ability to tend to the old and the weak and the sick and the injured. and i think, for that, they should be, you know, we should be admiring them.\n\ndavies: right. and there was also one amazing sequence which we see one of them eaten by a crocodile, pack takes it hard.\n\ngunton: you know if you talk to the director, nick (ph), who spent so much time with those animals, he felt that there were things that were going on in those animals' minds that you absolutely could connect with as a human being in a way that people would describe as being anthropomorphic. and he would absolutely deny it to the bitter end. he said the complexity and the nuance and the emotion that those animals show was, you know, we did our best to show as much of that as we can in the film, but it's - you never can perhaps - you can never completely reflect the realities of that.\n\nthey - and that's one of the things, i think, that the series is trying to do is that these are individual animals. and they think, and they plan, and they complex lives. and they need to be respected and kind of considered in that way because that's probably a good way of making sure that we perhaps look after them.\n\nand you start to see them as individuals who are struggling in the same way that we struggle. that gives an empathy with them that may be a powerful way of helping us care about them because if you care about them, you want to look after them, protect them.\n\ndavies: a lot of these animals are threatened. and, you know, there are numbers that you cite in the series about how few tigers there are left, for example. and generally, all of these species, they face threats from loss of habitat, which just makes conditions all the tougher.\n\ngunton: yes. i mean, it's competition for habitat, loss of habitat. yes, you're right. they can actually lose the habitat because it's destroyed, but often, it's because there is literally - humanity wants that land as well as the animals do. and in those situations, animals don't often come out on top. and it's quite a - it's a really important part of - it became a really important part of the series, actually. we didn't set out to tell people a conservation story.\n\nbut i guess looking back on it now with hindsight, if you spend this amount of time - is - the amount of time that we did with these creatures - these type of creatures - it was almost inevitable that part of that story would result in them bumping into humanity in a confrontational way and - as it so proved to be. and actually, i think it was - i think it's been a good element to the series to show people that as well as all the pressures these animals face between their rivals within their own families and competitors with other species, they also have this extra challenge, which is that they have - they're bumping into humanity and in conflict with humanity for space, for habitat.\n\ndavies: you know, there are a lot of heartbreaking scenes here. i mean, this will bring tears to viewers' eyes, and i think that's partly because, you know, we have so little contact with the natural world. i mean, my daughter weeps if her - one of her cats gets a mouse. and we see a - you know, real competition for food and space and territory and mates. and you know, particularly in the lions series, i mean, you know that there are droughts, and there are predators and all these things.\n\ngunton: yes, although i think - i mean, animals are evolved to live out there. that's the place where they should be, i think. i don't think they'd complain if they could. it's just - i think one of the things that we - you know, you talk about, people will cry. and i - and people did. in the u.k., we've shown the series, and it - and people did find them - the emotional rollercoaster, as they described them as.\n\nbut i think what was fascinating was that the audiences were enormous in the u.k. it was the highest-rated species factual program in the u.k. last year. and the audiences came to it because of the - i think they accepted that we had not dodged the realities in showing these films. this was a true representation of what these animals have to face. and so when they saw these - you know, there are traumatic moments 'cause in nature there are - there is - these things happen. they could accept it because - see it in the context of the bigger story.\n\nand ultimately, the - every film is uplifting. it has the kind of uplifting and - not that we engineer that. it's just - i think it reflects the fact that these animals have within them this sort of unquenchable fire to survive and - doesn't matter what mother nature and what rivals and competitors throw at them. they will never give up. i think the little extra twist is the impact of humanity just tipping the balance a little bit too far against them. i think that's - and i don't - we don't answer that question, but i think that is something that will be in people's minds.\n\ndavies: michael gunton is the executive producer of the bbc series dynasties. we'll continue our conversation after a short break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ndavies: this is fresh air, and we're speaking with michael gunton. he is the executive producer of the bbc series dynasties, an intimate look at five animal species. each episode focuses on the group dynamics of a single group or family in the species over an extended period of time. it premiered january 19th and is airing on bbc america, amc, ifc and sundance tv and will be available on demand.\n\nyou know, the crew spent, like, two years with a lot of these animals and really got to know them. it must've - there must've been a terrible separation to leave - i mean, missing your kids.\n\ngunton: absolutely. and each of the directors is absolutely adamant that their animal is the best.\n\ndavies: (laughter).\n\ngunton: that - so - 'cause they don't quite get to fisticuffs, but you know, there is this kind of pride. but you're right. and i think it's - it was tough for them to be dispassionate when they saw these things, particularly as the films got later and later - you know, further and further through the production, which is why i think when you - when they do end with a triumph of some description at the end, i think it's particularly poignant and particularly rewarding for them.\n\nyou know, in the emperor penguin film, lindsay, who is the cameraman - he says, right. that's the very last thing he says - is that, you know, i've been here a year. i'm desperate to get home. i should say that his - while he was there, his wife had given birth to their first child, and he hadn't seen his child. the child was four months old when he got home. so he was absolutely desperate to get home and see his family and his new baby. but he said, but a part of me doesn't want to go because i - the place and the animals and the story and the - that world just gets to you in a way that is almost inescapable. so it does have - it does absolutely - you know, experiencing this kind of thing does never leave you.\n\ndavies: and that's from a guy living in antarctica.\n\ngunton: well, yeah. i mean, the story there is great because, you know, when we - when i - when we decided to do that film, you have to find a crew who are prepared to leave their home and live in antarctica for nearly a year. and for about four - no, about eight months of that, they are on their own with seven other scientists. there - basically, there's a station there, an overwintering station, which has some scientists and some people watching the weather and some geophysics and stuff. that's it. that's all that - those are the only people there.\n\nand for two or three months of that time, it's completely pitch black. there's no sun. the only light is from the moon. and it's brutally cold. and you had to find someone to do that. and amazingly, this young guy lindsay said, i've always wanted to go and film emperor penguins. i'd love to do it. and so he said - he signed up to say i'll do it. and then he got married and then discovered about two months before he was about to leave that his wife was pregnant. and he still went.\n\ndavies: wow. you know, among the individuals of the species in this series, one of the more interesting is a 92-year-old homo sapien named david attenborough.\n\ngunton: (laughter) yes.\n\ndavies: we see him out in the bush. he delivers this compelling narration. just tell us about what he brought to this project.\n\ngunton: there was only one person who i - could ever be the person to tell the stories in this series. and that was david because for - oh, so many reasons. one, because, i think, it is a - it was a new - it's a new approach. and i think the audience needed to be introduced to the, you know, what are - what we were trying to do with this story and how it was going to work.\n\nand, of course, if he tells you this is a - if he stands there at the beginning and says, let me tell you a story, most people are going to say, ok, i'll listen to this story, because he is the world's great storyteller. but also, i think the way he delivers the stories allowed us to tread the line between the truth and the drama of the truth without stepping into melodrama or something that felt untrue. there's something about the conviction and the passion and the knowledge that he has, absolutely makes you absolutely follow those stories with, you know, an extraordinary intensity.\n\nand for that - part of the reason that - well, one of the outcomes of that is that i thought we had - we needed him to come out on location with us and introduce the series from location and set out in a - what we call a piece to camera. in other words, addressing the audience directly about what we were trying to do with the series. and, you know, that's a challenge. he's 92 years old. i mean, he's an extraordinary fit and healthy man. but i, nevertheless, had that responsibility. and nobody wants to be the person who killed david attenborough.\n\ndavies: (laughter).\n\ngunton: so we were pretty careful that he - that didn't happen. but we went to zimbabwe for about 10 days to shoot. all - we found - we used that as a generic location to introduce the series and each of the episodes. and then we were able to get a - because that's also the location where we filmed the whole story of the painted wolves, we are actually able to get a specific closing to that - to the painted wolves film with him in the absolute signature david attenborough thing, which is david attenborough standing next to the animals, delivering his great lines and then turning to the animals. and we were able to do that with the painted wolves. and it was an amazing experience to do it because i've worked with him for 30-odd years and done many of those things. and i wasn't sure i - that would happen again. and to be able to do it one more time was amazing.\n\ndavies: well, michael gunton, it's a fascinating series. thanks so much for spending some time with us.\n\ngunton: it's been a pleasure. i hope you all enjoy it.\n\ngross: michael gunton is the executive producer of the bbc series dynasties. it premiered january 19 and is being shown on bbc america, amc, ifc and sundance tv and will soon be available on demand. gunton spoke with fresh air's dave davies, who is also whyy's senior reporter. if you'd like to catch up on fresh air interviews you missed, like our interview about how addictive drugs interact with the brain with judith grisel, a neuroscientist and recovering addict, check out our podcast. you'll find lots of fresh air interviews.\n\n(soundbite of dave douglas and nomad's summit music)\n\ngross: fresh air's executive producer is danny miller. our interviews and reviews are produced and edited by amy salit, phyllis myers, sam briger, lauren krenzel, heidi saman, therese madden, mooj zadie, thea chaloner and seth kelley. i'm terry gross.\n\n(soundbite of dave douglas and nomad's summit music)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
former presidential candidate evan mcmullin on centerist politics\n\nnpr's scott simon talks to evan mcmullin, an independent presidential candidate in the 2016 campaign, about the place for centrist politics in the u.s. political landscape.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nwe continue to follow the situation in north korea. last night, president trump spoke by phone with china's president, xi jinping, who urged both sides to dial back their rhetoric about fire, fury and missile threats. we're going to turn now to evan mcmullin, the former cia officer and republican staffer who ran against president trump last fall, criticizing his temperament and qualifications. he won about 700,000 votes. mr. mcmullin has continued to speak out. he's in philadelphia this weekend for a meeting of the centrist project, which urges qualified independents to run for office at all levels. he's co-founder of the group stand up republic. mr. mcmullin, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nevan mcmullin: great to be with you, scott. thanks for having me.\n\nsimon: it's traditional for americans from all parties to support the president in time of crisis. what do you think of president trump's statements and actions surrounding north korea?\n\nmcmullin: well, i would say that i do support a harder line with north korea. presidents of both parties for decades have tried a more traditional diplomatic approach with the kim regime unsuccessfully. they do present, i believe, a threat to u.s. and global security. but i've questioned whether donald trump's rhetoric has been part of the smartest, wisest strategy. and i also would advocate for a little more caution around some of the red lines and threats that the president is drawing now. i think a much more productive approach is to increase the cost of the status quo for china in north korea so that china can be then more inspired to do more to rein in that regime.\n\nsimon: but you spent years at the cia.\n\nmcmullin: yes.\n\nsimon: what's your realistic assessment. is? there any policy the u.s. can pursue that would prevent north korea from developing nuclear weapons if that's what they want to do and if that's what the regime feel it has to do to stay in power?\n\nmcmullin: you're exactly right. that is the primary motivation for the kim regime in pursuit of nuclear weapons - is to preserve its power. and so the goal then, if - the goal has to be to change the way they think about the best way to do that. right now they think the best way to do that is to develop nuclear weapons. it's understandable that they would think that, by the way. it's a rational conclusion, but we have to change that dynamic. and the only way we can really do that is with a lot more help from china. and so that's got to be the approach. china provides most of north korea's energy and other support - humanitarian, et cetera. and we've got to change the dynamic there so that the regime actually fears, you know, its demise through lack of that support rather than through its lack of nuclear weapons.\n\nsimon: a tough question - but i think it's on the minds - a lot of americans have expressed this over the past few days. do you, mr. mcmullin, trust president trump with u.s. military power, including nuclear weapons?\n\nmcmullin: i can't say that i completely trust him with that awesome power. no. i'm sorry to say that. but i would say that there - he does have good people around him. i know general mattis. i have confidence in him. and there are others around the president like that. and i'm hopeful that they will help prevent any terribly unwise actions.\n\nsimon: let me give you a chance to talk about the centrist project, too. i'm not quite clear, having read your website, if it's a movement or a party.\n\nmcmullin: it's more akin to a movement, although i'm not exactly sure i would call it quite that at this point. it's more a coordinated effort between potential independent candidates and those who would support them to drive change in american politics.\n\nsimon: you might be an independent candidate for something, i gather.\n\nmcmullin: it's possible. i do believe that i'll run again. of course, the next opportunity for that would be in 2018. it is possible. i just haven't made the decision yet.\n\nsimon: evan mcmullin, thanks so much for being with us, sir.\n\nmcmullin: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
coronavirus task force details 'sobering' data behind its extended guidelines\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mandel ngan/afp via getty images mandel ngan/afp via getty images\n\nupdated at 7:40 p.m. et\n\namerica must brace for 100,000 or more people to die in the coming months in the coronavirus pandemic, the white house's response team warned tuesday.\n\nas sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it, said dr. anthony fauci, a top immunologist helping to steer white house policy on the disaster. no one is denying the fact that we are going through a very, very difficult time right now.\n\nthe white house's coronavirus task force detailed the modeling and other data that compelled president trump to extend virus countermeasures deeper into the spring.\n\nfauci and another top physician, dr. deborah birx, renewed their pleas for americans to observe social distancing and other precautions to try to depress the rate of infections and deaths.\n\nthis is not a number we need to accept. we can influence this to a varying degree, fauci said.\n\ntrump, however, suggested that he has been told that 100,000 could be a floor and not the ceiling.\n\nthey're very sobering, yeah, the president said of the estimates. when you see 100,000 people and that's a minimum number ... and they said it's unlikely you'll be able to attain that. think of what would have happened if we didn't do anything.\n\nhard days lie ahead\n\nthe president had earlier described an imaginary scene of full church pews on easter sunday — but then acknowledged sunday that federal guidelines for social distancing and other mitigation measures would need to remain in place through april 30.\n\nit's life and death, frankly, trump said. it's a matter of life and death.\n\npublic health officials warn that infections and deaths may not peak for the next few weeks; it isn't clear when, except that the disaster will get worse.\n\ni want every american to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead, trump said. this is going to be three weeks that we haven't seen before.\n\ntask force members used tuesday's briefing to detail the metrics that informed those warnings and that prompted trump to extend the countermeasure guidelines.\n\nthe blue mountain\n\nbirx showed reporters at the white house on tuesday a chart that showed what she called a blue mountain of deaths hitting a peak of around 2.2 million — a projection of what could have taken place without any countermeasures at all.\n\nsocial distancing and other protocols cause that estimated curve to be shorter in height, which is why they're so essential, birx said. she and fauci said the models they've cited still were subject to change based on the ongoing response.\n\nbut she also warned that the stark reality of the coronavirus justifies the grave warning trump gave and underscores why she said americans must continue to isolate and take the other precautionary measures.\n\nthe united states is still climbing the statistical curve of infections as the virus spreads into and within new regions such as the south and the midwest. a statistical curve of mortality will follow and likely abate over a longer period of time, officials say.\n\namericans must continue to stay home, keep apart, wash their hands and take the other steps that public health officials have urged, birx said.\n\nit's communities that will do this, she said. there's no magic bullet. there's no magic vaccine or therapy. it's just behaviors.\n\nin terms of the types of countermeasures required, the officials said nothing more is likely needed beyond what's already recommended: the closure of restaurants, businesses and other public places; avoiding groups; washing hands; and so forth.\n\nwe hope it's enough, trump said. we hope we're at a level where we can say, 'let's go.' \n\nloading...\n\nthe number of test-confirmed cases nationwide is nearing 200,000, and more than 3,800 americans have died as of tuesday evening, per johns hopkins university.\n\nfauci told reporters that the coming weeks' worth of data might be grim, but he said that the nation must hold fast. data from washington state and elsewhere show that social distancing makes the statistical curves shorter in height and stops transmissions.\n\nwe're going to continue to see things go up, fauci said. we cannot be discouraged by that, because the mitigation is actually working.\n\nthe united states, he added, can't take its foot off the accelerator and put it onto the brakes — i know that's what we can do over the next 30 days.\n\nlife in isolation\n\namericans in many places are under more stringent restrictions than those in the federal guidelines. governors and mayors have ordered people to stay at home and business to close through may and into june in some cases.\n\nothers, including florida gov. ron desantis, haven't yet. trump was asked tuesday whether he'd get involved with those leaders' decisions.\n\nnot unless he felt that was necessary, the president said. unless we see something obviously wrong, we're going to let the governors do it, he said.\n\nfor a time, trump and vice president pence sustained a vision of a phase in which at least some locations could relax their efforts on pandemic mitigation to bring portions of the economy back to life.\n\ntrump and pence said they didn't want the cure to be worse than the disease, and they likened the old projections for coronavirus fatalities to the annual tolls taken in car accidents or by the seasonal flu.\n\nthe new data, however, have cooled that ardor.\n\ntrump alluded on tuesday to what he now says people were saying about simply enduring the pandemic and made clear he rules out that approach.\n\na lot of people have said, 'ride it out' and 'think of it as the flu.' but it's not the flu — it's vicious.\n\nthe pandemic is not only a public health disaster but an economic catastrophe.\n\nalready millions of people have filed for unemployment benefits nationwide. washington is beginning to implement a $2 trillion relief program, and members of congress are discussing the prospect of more such legislation.\n\nprospect for an era of masks\n\none question on tuesday was whether the centers for disease control and prevention might open the door partly toward normalization with a recommendation that most americans wear masks outdoors.\n\ndr. robert redfield, the cdc director, told npr member station wabe in atlanta that roughly 25% of coronavirus sufferers may be asymptomatic and continue to transmit the virus.\n\nthat could compel the cdc to recommend that when people go outside their homes, they should cover their faces in case they're carrying the virus and don't know it, redfield acknowledged.\n\nno such actual recommendation is yet in place, and redfield told wabe that anything the cdc issued would be informed by science and data about the pandemic.\n\ntrump suggested on tuesday that he might support guidelines for using face coverings in public, positing that people might be able to wear scarves.

biden expects to rebound in south carolina, but rivals are circling\n\nthe former vice president has a big lead in polls of the state, but with his fourth-place finish in iowa, other democratic presidential candidates are looking to erode his support among black voters.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nthree weeks from today, south carolina democrats cast ballots to pick a presidential nominee. former vice president joe biden has held a wide lead in the state for months. but after mr. biden slipped to fourth place in iowa, his rivals working furiously to try to narrow his lead among the state's black voters. npr's juana summers reports.\n\njuana summers, byline: women dressed in shades of red are filing into a gymnasium in columbia, s.c.\n\n(soundbite of song, everybody loves the sunshine)\n\nunidentified artist: (singing) everybody loves the sunshine.\n\nsummers: they're here for go red columbia day, which raises awareness about cardiovascular disease. four activists from the group black women for join in. they've endorsed elizabeth warren.\n\nunidentified person: are you ready to party?\n\nunidentified crowd: yeah.\n\nunidentified person: all right.\n\nsummers: events like these, though subtle in nature, are one of the ways that warren's campaign is seeking a foothold in south carolina. black voters make up just under two-thirds of the democratic electorate here. and warren is specifically targeting black women. vilissa thompson is an activist who lives in winnsboro, s.c., and thinks that warren is talking about the right issues.\n\nvilissa thompson: south carolina likes to be a little behind the curve at times. but i really feel that she could be the candidate that could really rile us up to get us where we need to be as a state and throughout the country.\n\nsummers: this is a state where joe biden has maintained a wide lead. and his campaign has said south carolina would be a springboard as the race moves to more diverse states. biden supporters say that results in iowa and new hampshire don't say much about how he'll perform here. this is state senator marlon kimpson.\n\nmarlon kimpson: we welcome a day where we can have a sense of normalcy, stability, experience, competence. these are the things that joe biden has demonstrated. he was not president barack obama's vice president choice by chance. now, should he rest on that? no.\n\nsummers: tom steyer has been among the candidates most aggressively courting black voters in south carolina. at last night's debate, steyer made clear that he believes he has ground to gain here. he pointed out a recent poll that he said shows him with support from nearly a quarter of black voters in the state. brandon upson is steyer's national organizing director and a south carolina native. he thinks biden is vulnerable.\n\nbrandon upson: especially when he said that it was a gut punch for him to lose iowa - that folks here in south carolina lost more confidence in his ability to bring this thing home. and i truly believe that i see it every day.\n\nsummers: they're so focused on the state that steyer will spend the day before new hampshire's primary campaigning in south carolina. pete buttigieg and bernie sanders have their sights set on younger voters here. and all of the campaigns are pointing out the fact that many south carolinians haven't decided who to support. naida rutherford is one of them. bernie sanders is among the candidates that has caught her eye. she had been a kamala harris supporter.\n\nnaida rutherford: bernie has a proven record. i mean, he has done things, and he's willing to speak up for the people who don't have a voice at some of the tables that he's sitting at. so that is very appealing to me.\n\nsummers: but really, she told me she is focused on who can beat president trump.\n\nrutherford: he is in the white house. and so whoever is going to change that, that's who i want to vote for. that's who i want to get behind.\n\nsummers: even tameika isaac devine hasn't decided who to vote for. as the only black woman on columbia's city council, she's met most of the major candidates and even hosted events for some.\n\ntameika isaac devine: i tell my husband - i said, it's kind of like you're the popular girl high school, and everybody's trying to ask you to the dance.\n\nsummers: she'd come close to coming off the sidelines once. new jersey senator cory booker dazzled her. she'd wanted to back him, but he dropped out of the race soon after. with three weeks to go, she's got a short list, one she is still paring down. juana summers, npr news, columbia, s.c.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
justice department rolls out quotas for immigration judges\n\nenlarge this image john moore/getty images john moore/getty images\n\nthe department of justice is setting quotas for immigration judges — part of a broader effort to speed up deportations and reduce a massive backlog of immigration cases.\n\nthe new quotas are laid out in a memo that was sent to immigration judges across the country on friday. to get a satisfactory rating on their performance evaluations, judges will be required to clear at least 700 cases a year and to have fewer than 15 percent of their decisions overturned on appeal.\n\nattorney general jeff sessions and other immigration hard-liners say that backlog allows people who should be deported quickly to stay in the united states for years while they wait for a court date.\n\nimmigration courts handle the civil cases of undocumented immigrants who are seeking to stay in the u.s. the courts are part of the justice department, and sessions has the power to set rules and change precedent. he wants to clear a backlog that is approaching 700,000 cases.\n\nbut the national association of immigration judges, the union that represents immigration judges, warns that quotas could undermine judicial independence and erode due process rights for immigrants. immigration lawyers are also critical of the plan. decisions in immigration court have life-or-death consequences and cannot be managed like an assembly line, said jeremy mckinney, secretary of the american immigration lawyers association.\n\nthese unprecedented numeric quotas are so onerous that many judges will rush through cases to protect their own jobs, he said.\n\npolitics immigration judges warn against trump administration benchmarks immigration judges warn against trump administration benchmarks listen · 2:57 2:57\n\nbut the justice department disputes that. between 2011 and 2016, immigration judges completed an average of 680 cases, according to doj spokesman devin o'malley.\n\nwhat this means is that judges will have to complete about three cases per day, o'malley said. we feel that is in line with what judges are already completing.\n\nthe immigration court system has been under fire, not only from critics who say it's inefficient but also from immigrant-rights advocates.\n\nfor one thing, advocates point out that only one-third of immigrants are represented by lawyers. comedian john oliver recently mocked the system on hbo's last week tonight for forcing young children to represent themselves in court.\n\nthe new performance standards, which were first reported by the wall street journal, are part of a wider push to speed up immigration courts and deportations. for instance, sessions is widely expected to eliminate or cut back on the practice known as administrative closure, which allows judges to put cases on hold while immigrants seek visas or other kinds of relief from deportation. sessions also is taking steps to limit who gets asylum in the u.s. immigration lawyers are warning that those changes could mean immigration judges will be forced to turn away more people fleeing violence or persecution in their home countries.
'flying while muslim': profiling fears after arabic speaker removed from plane\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption haven daley/ap haven daley/ap\n\nearlier this month, khairuldeen makhzoomi, who came to the u.s. as an iraqi refugee and is currently a student at the university of california, berkeley, was removed from a southwest airlines flight because another passenger overheard him speaking on his cellphone in arabic.\n\nfirst they pulled me out of the plane, then they didn't allow me to go back, makhzoomi told member station kpcc. they got my bag until the moment they started searching me in front of everyone and the police officer, he called the fbi.\n\nthe passenger who overheard makhzoomi also spoke arabic. a southwest official says the passenger overheard what she perceived as threatening comments. and the airline official says it was the content of makhzoomi's conversation, not the language used that prompted the response.\n\nthe council on american-islamic relations is providing makhzoomi with legal representation. zahra billoo, executive director of the group's san francisco offices, spoke with npr's kelly mcevers on the issue.\n\nbilloo says she could see a possible reason why makhzoomi would have been reported by another arabic speaker. the word that was being discussed was shahid, she says. shahid means martyr. he says he never said shahid.\n\nbilloo says the fact that the person who reported makhzoomi also spoke arabic doesn't affect the case. it doesn't change how ... absurd and bewildering the entire situation is, how invasive and traumatizing the law enforcement searches were, she says.\n\nwhile billoo says she could see how hearing the word shahid might make someone raise an eyebrow, she says no single word spoken should be a problem.\n\nfor now, i'm asking for an apology. ... they have to admit that there is a problem.\n\nit amazes me that this person speaks arabic enough to call law enforcement and airline staff on khairuldeen, but didn't catch that he was telling his uncle that he was at a luncheon with the u.n. secretary-general and had the opportunity to ask him a question.\n\ndoes this mean arabic speakers are policing each other? billoo says it's hard to tell. she cited several other complaints against airlines and they don't always involve an arabic speaker complaining about another arabic-speaking passenger.\n\nwhat i do worry about is that it's a pattern of airlines acting disproportionately and then law enforcement supporting them in those actions, she says.\n\nmeantime, makhzoomi says he has no plans to sue southwest.\n\nfor now, i'm asking for an apology, he told kpcc. i can sue. i have many lawyers, they've reached out to me, but i have said it many times, a human's dignity, it cannot be bought. this is something important. they have to apologize. they have to admit that there is a problem.\n\nin a statement, southwest said: we will not be apologizing for following our obligation to adhere to established procedures. ... were we given an opportunity to speak with him (many attempts have been made) we would offer regret for his experience.\n\nmakhzoomi says he has also tried to reach out to southwest.\n\nbilloo says there are no plans to pursue a lawsuit against the airline.\n\nwe are exploring the options available in mr. makhzoomi's case and seeing how we can best connect it to what we are worried about as being a pattern — the new reality of flying while muslim, as some muslims refer to it. we are looking at the different options to see what will make the most sense.

what to watch for in sanders and biden's first 1-on-1 debate\n\njoe biden and bernie sanders will debate tonight, one-on-one for the first time. the debate comes as biden racks up a lead in delegates, and there will be no audience due to coronavirus precautions.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\ntonight, democratic presidential hopefuls bernie sanders and joe biden will debate each other one on one. and it's not just the stage that will look pretty empty after having been so crowded for so long. the debate is happening in a tv studio here in washington with no audience due to coronavirus concerns. npr national political correspondent don gonyea joins us now with a preview.\n\nhi.\n\ndon gonyea, byline: hi, glad to be here.\n\ngarcia-navarro: don, neither candidate will have a cheering section tonight, and that's not the only aspect of this campaign that's been affected by the coronavirus, right?\n\ngonyea: yeah. i mean, where do i begin? the rallies are done for now at least. and when will people feel comfortable coming back to a rally? so that's an open question. joe biden held a virtual event on friday. sanders did a virtual fireside chat but so much of a campaign is about human contact. i mean, they're all about bringing people together and creating community and energy. how do you canvas? how do you knock on doors? i mean, the answer is you don't. we have seen both biden and sanders give speeches trying to show how they would handle a crisis. so that kind of thing is going on. one other thing about tonight though, lulu, not only is there no audience but also one of the moderators. jorge ramos has withdrawn from the debate. he's self-quarantining because he may have had secondhand exposure.\n\ngarcia-navarro: just showing how widespread this is. joe biden has been building a lot of momentum, though, as well as a pretty solid delegate lead. is this debate bernie sanders' last stand to stop biden from running away with the nomination?\n\ngonyea: it could be. there won't be many more opportunities like a debate. but biden's lead and his momentum will be extremely tough for sanders to overcome, even with a lot of primaries to go. sanders himself is admitting that his broad movement of especially young voters has not been showing up at the polls quite as he expected. last week, he gave a speech that really made it clear, a, he is not dropping out. but there was also a shift in tone. he's not pushing for biden and the democratic party to address the issues he's been running on and those issues that are so important to young voters. and he says to the future of the party. on wednesday, he even gave biden a heads up of how that would go.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbernie sanders: joe, what are you going to do to end the absurdity of the united states of america being the only major country on earth where health care is not a human right? are you really going to veto a medicare for all bill if it is passed in congress?\n\ngonyea: and sanders also said he will press biden tonight on housing and college affordability, climate change and all of that.\n\ngarcia-navarro: what about joe biden? what is his big challenge tonight?\n\ngonyea: people will certainly be listening to what he and both candidates say about the coronavirus. but when you look at the debates so far, biden has mostly gotten by with kind of disappearing in the crowd. that will not be an option tonight. and he'll need to answer sanders' challenge on young voters and on progressive priorities.\n\nultimately biden may be on the path to the nomination, but he still needs a really strong performance. his performance on the trail has not always been really solid. at times, it's been uneven. he has to start demonstrating that he's steady, that he's in command, that he's ready to be the nominee.\n\ngarcia-navarro: npr's don gonyea thank you so much.\n\ngonyea: it's my pleasure.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
talkin' birds: the great backyard bird count\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of august davidson-onsgard courtesy of august davidson-onsgard\n\nas birds flitted on and off colorful feeders in a flicker of flapping feathers, and chattered in chirps — punctuated by the occasional trill — a band of birdwatchers offered a cacophony of their own.\n\ni heard a red-winged blackbird!\n\nthere's a blue jay!\n\nis that a downy woodpecker?\n\nwith every sighting, tina alleva, a brooklyn resident and volunteer for the brooklyn bird club, added to the count. she was counting birds, along with other club members, in brooklyn's prospect park on saturday as part of this year's great backyard bird count.\n\nthe great backyard bird count is an annual, global citizen-science project that hopes to collect data about wild birds, lots of data.\n\nled by the cornell lab of ornithology and the national audubon society, along with bird studies canada and other international partners, bird count participants are asked to go outside for at least 15 minutes and identify as many birds as they can.\n\ndon't have a backyard? no problem. the great backyard bird count can be done anywhere, whether that's standing on a street outside an apartment, looking out a window at the office, or wandering around a park.\n\nyou might be surprised at what you find.\n\nin the heart of new york city, the obvious birds one might first expect to spot are pigeons, or perhaps more accurately, rock doves. but through their binoculars, the brooklyn bird club managed to spot 43 different species of bird.\n\nalleva's final count included eight american coots, four red-breasted mergansers, one merlin, and 101 canadian geese.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of tina alleva courtesy of tina alleva\n\nher data, pooled with that of participants around the world, will give scientists a better idea of how weather and climate change may influence bird populations or migration patterns.\n\nthis is the type of information that researchers can't collect enough of on their own. ray brown, host of the radio show and podcast talkin' birds, told npr's scott simon that the data collected through the count is extremely useful.\n\nbirds are a great indicator of the health of the ecosystems on our planet, brown said. data from the bird count helps determine how we can help birds survive, where they're going, how they're doing.\n\nthe bird count first launched in 1998, and over time, brown said scientists can get a big picture idea of what's going on with the avian population, especially when combined with data from other popular bird counts, such as the national audubon society's christmas bird count.\n\none example is how over the past 30 or 40 years, many bird species, especially songbirds, have expanded their ranges northward.\n\nincreased bird feeding has something to do with it, but certainly the temperature changes and other changes associated with climate change seem to have a big impact on that, brown said.\n\nrounding the bend in the dirt path that leads to prospect park's bird feeders, cyrus baty, a volunteer at the brooklyn bird club, heard a peculiar sound for february: two sharp clicks ending in a throaty trill.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption amanda morris/npr amanda morris/npr\n\ni haven't heard that in a while, he said as he turned his binoculars skyward.\n\nwhen he spotted a small, sleek, black bird whose wings were capped with orange and yellow feathers, baty smiled.\n\nhe explained that the mating call he had heard from the red-winged blackbird usually wasn't out until spring, when the birds typically mate. on a sunny, yet frigid day in brooklyn, the bird's unique call felt mistimed.\n\nwhile baty is a seasoned expert at spotting different species from far away, alleva said the beauty of the great backyard bird count is that anyone can do it.\n\nit's a good way for people to get out, she said. this is a lot more fun way to introduce people to birdwatching.\n\nthough alleva once reacted by asking, really? when she was asked to participate in a bird watching walk five years ago, she quickly became hooked to the hobby because she said it's meditative, connects watchers with nature, and every time you go out, you'll find something unusual.\n\nto help identify the birds, participants can use an app from the cornell lab called merlin bird id, which takes information such as the bird's size, color, and location to pinpoint the exact species. online, participants can submit their counts and see results from others in real-time.\n\nin 2018, people participated in more than 100 countries and counted more than 6,400 species of birds.\n\nthe 2019 count ends on february 18.\n\nnpr's ned wharton produced this story for broadcast.
trump axes officials who gave damaging testimony in impeachment inquiry\n\nlt. colonel alexander vindman and his brother were fired from national security council staff and ambassador gordon sondland was recalled from europe in moves top democrats called shameful and weak.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nriveting accusations against the man in the white house - a finding of not guilty in the u.s. senate, anger from the white house and then dismissals. is all of that retribution? i'm going to ask john dean, who cooperated with watergate investigators and provided testimony damaging to then-president richard nixon. john dean joins us on the line.\n\nmr. dean, thanks so much for being with us.\n\njohn dean: my pleasure.\n\nsimon: how do you assess the dismissals from the national security council of lt. col. alexander vindman and his twin brother?\n\ndean: since mr. trump is going nowhere in the immediate future, i think this relates to his craving need for loyalty. he is now, with some revenge, going after people he perceives as disloyal. and obviously, vindman and sondland would fit in that category because they testified truthfully before the house and that their testimony was relied on in the senate trial, which he did get through.\n\nsimon: but in a practical world, it would have been awkward for the vindman brothers to continue, too, in some ways, wouldn't it?\n\ndean: well, the vindmans, as i understand it, had already put in for a change of venue, so to speak.\n\nsimon: yeah.\n\ndean: they were requesting to go back from the national security council to the pentagon. this is not unlike what he did with mccabe, who - on his last day at the fbi, he fired him so he couldn't get his 20-year pension or whatever number it was; purely a vindictive act.\n\nthis, to me, is a sign of a weakness in a leader who demands loyalty. i can't imagine, for example, an eisenhower or a truman, say, firing people because they were disloyal. they get their following because they're strong leaders. a weak leader like trump has to demand and command loyalty. he did it with comey when he was, really, being interviewed to stay on the job, and comey said, i can't do that. so comey was removed. this has just been a constant pattern throughout the trump presidency.\n\nsimon: mr. dean, you testified during the impeachment process this year. it's over now. how - did the process work, do you think?\n\ndean: i think the process worked, but it showed what's happened when one party of the senate is in the same party as the president. we're in a time, a highly partisan time, where it is difficult for the process to work. but also, even in their rationalized votes against trump or for trump, i should say, to stay in office, they've said this is something the voters should decide. so what they've done is they've put all this impeachment - all the charges against trump on him to carry into the election. and i think he's going to have to bear that burden, as are a lot of senators who voted that he should get a pass at this time.\n\nsimon: but surely the impeachment provision wasn't put into work only when the president and the congress or the senate are from opposite parties, was it?\n\ndean: well, it was put in at a time when the senate was not to be selected by a popular vote but rather by the state legislatures of the various states, and that was further insulation. but not unlike the electoral college, modern times have made the machinery of the 18th century a little bit creaky.\n\nsimon: half a minute left. mr. dean, do you see both republicans and democrats trying to use this as an election issue?\n\ndean: yes, i do. i don't think - i think the republicans will have to defend against it. some republicans who are challenging incumbents are certainly going to use it against the incumbent. but no question that trump is going to have to carry and explain this throughout the election.\n\nsimon: john dean, thank you so much for being with us, sir.\n\ndean: pleasure, scott.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
california is on its way to having an avocado crop year-round\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ezra david romero/valley public radio ezra david romero/valley public radio\n\nnot my avocados!\n\npresident trump's tough talk on renegotiating the north american free trade agreement with mexico and canada has raised many questions — including how such a move might negatively affect the flow of beloved produce to the u.s.\n\nlike the avocado. americans ate 2 billion pounds of avocados last year, two-thirds of which were imported – mostly from mexico. that's because avocados grow year-round in mexico's climate – but not in california's. but researchers in the golden state — america's biggest producer of the green fruit — are working to change that.\n\ncurrently, most california avocados are grown in the southern part of the state and on a narrow strip along the coast. but if avocados could grow in the central valley, the state's agricultural powerhouse, farmers there could reap the benefits of our avocado addiction, as well as stand out among foreign imports.\n\nfor more than 20 years, researcher mary lu arpaia has been on a mission to find an avocado tree that can withstand the central valley's frosty winters and hot summers. at a test field east of the central valley city of visalia, arpaia thinks she's found three varieties that can do just that.\n\nthere's a void of california fruit on the market in the months of november, december and early january, arpaia says. so if we can find different selections that maybe are unique that fit into that window, then we help the entire california avocado industry.\n\nninety-five percent of all the avocados americans eat are hass, a variety discovered in california in the 1920s. but the climate of the central valley does not allow hass avocados to grow as well as they do in the milder climates of coastal and southern california. even in these locations, hass only grow at certain times of the year — and not enough to compete with the large amount coming in from foreign markets.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ezra david romero/valley public radio ezra david romero/valley public radio\n\nthe goal is to breed varieties that aren't super tall, can be planted close to each other and have a high yield. one type arpaia and her colleague, eric focht, are recommending to growers has all these traits. it's called gem, the great granddaughter of the hass avocado, and is already sold at nurseries. arpaia didn't breed it, but she and focht recommended that the university of california system patent and release the variety.\n\nfocht says that gem avocados are a little more oval or egg-shaped than hass. it has the speckling on the skin. as it ripens, it will turn dark, and a lot of times the speckled lenticels [pores through which gases are exchanged] will get a ... golden color to it.\n\nin taste tests conducted by westfalia fruit estates, a south african company marketing gem worldwide, the avocado variety scored better than hass in terms of eating quality.\n\nthe second type is nicknamed lunchbox for its small size. the third has no name yet, but arpaia and focht think it holds promise.\n\nlunchbox, that one peels nice, but i mean [the third, nameless variety] just falls out of the skin, focht says.\n\narpaia adds that the unnamed variety makes wonderful guacamole, and i found with a non-replicated test in my refrigerator the fruit doesn't brown.\n\narpaia say lunchbox and the nameless variety should be on the market within a year or two. that's good news for california avocado growers who want options.\n\ni want our avocado varieties to be in season for more than one week, arpaia says, adding that she'd like different times of the year to be associated with certain varieties of avocados. i want it where you can say it's july — it's time to pick this variety.\n\nthe avocado industry is also interested in arpaia's research. tim spann, the research program director at the california avocado commission, says new varieties producing at different times of the year could widen the california avocado market.\n\nwe have those premium supermarket chains that want california fruit, says spann. so if we can develop other varieties that will expand our season to a year-round or nearly year-round position, that would be fantastic.\n\nthe industry once funded the uc avocado research but pulled most of its funding a few years ago to focus on pests harming avocado trees. now, spann says the commission is thinking of reversing course.\n\nwithin the last six months there's been a lot of talk about new varieties and how some of those varieties could help us expand our market, spann says.\n\njon stearns is one of the few avocado farmers in the central valley. he grows 25 acres of mainly hass avocados on a hill outside of visalia and says the incline actually helps keep the trees warmer in winter.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ezra david romero/valley public radio ezra david romero/valley public radio\n\nin the summertime we do some cooling techniques with our emitters and some foggers when it gets really hot — you know, over 105 degrees, stearns says.\n\nhe says he'd love to get his hands on avocado varieties that grow well in the central valley. if they could come up with a variety that's similar to the hass that we could plant down at ground level instead of having it on the hills, i'm sure a lot of people would plant them, stearns says.\n\nand it's not just avocado farmers that are interested in the new varieties. arpaia's avocado test plot is based at a uc citrus research center in part because she wants to see if avocados will grow well where citrus grows in california's central valley.\n\nvalley citrus growers are considering alternative crops because of a looming threat to their business. a disease called huanglongbing, which is carried by tiny bugs called psyllids, has already decimated the citrus industry in florida and has made its way to southern california.\n\nbob blakely, of the trade organization california citrus mutual, says he hopes the disease does not make it to the central valley. i hope that we're able to come up with resistant citrus varieties before we have to think about going to another crop. i'm just hopeful that the science is able to move quickly enough.\n\nblakely says if the disease does reach the central valley, citrus farmers will eventually need something else to grow. maybe that could be avocados.\n\na version of this story first

hospitals forced to be more transparent about pricing. will that save you money?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption fs productions/tetra images rf/getty images fs productions/tetra images rf/getty images\n\nhospitals are facing the new year with new requirements to post price information they have long sought to obscure: the actual prices they negotiate with insurers and the discounts they offer their cash-paying customers.\n\nthe move is part of a larger push by the trump administration to use price transparency to curtail prices and create better-informed consumers. yet there is disagreement on whether posting the prices for hospital services and procedures will actually achieve that goal.\n\nas of jan. 1, the facilities must post on their websites prices for every service, drug and supply they provide. next year, under a separate rule, health insurers must take similar steps. a related effort to force drugmakers to list their prices in advertisements was struck down by the courts.\n\nwith the new hospital rule, consumers should be able to see the tremendous variation in prices for the exact same care among hospitals and get an estimate of what they will be charged for care — before they seek it.\n\nthe new data requirements go well beyond the previous rule of requiring hospitals to post their chargemasters — the hospital-generated list prices that bear little relation to what it costs a hospital to provide care. also, few consumers or insurers actually pay those listed prices.\n\ninstead, under the new rule put forward by the trump administration, these are the real prices in health care, says cynthia fisher, founder and chairman of patient rights advocate, a group that promotes price transparency.\n\nhere's what consumers should know:\n\nhow will this work?\n\neach hospital must post publicly online — and in a machine-readable format that is easy to process by computers — several prices for every item and service they provide: gross charges; the actual, and most likely far lower, prices they've negotiated with insurers, including de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated charges; and the cash price they offer patients who are uninsured or not using their insurance.\n\nin addition, each hospital must also post, in a consumer-friendly format, the specific costs for 300 common and shoppable services, such as having a baby, getting a joint replacement, having a hernia repaired or undergoing a diagnostic brain scan.\n\nthose 300 bundles of procedures and services must total all costs involved — from the hardware used to the operating room time, to drugs given and the fees of hospital-employed physicians — so patients won't have to attempt the nearly impossible job of figuring it out themselves.\n\nhospitals can mostly select which services fall into this category, although the federal government has dictated 70 that must be listed — including certain surgeries, diagnostic tests, imaging scans, new patient visits and psychotherapy sessions.\n\nwill prices be exact?\n\nno. at best, these are ballpark figures.\n\nother factors influence consumers' costs, like the type of insurance plan a patient has, the size and remaining amount of the annual deductible on their health plan, and the complexity of their medical problem.\n\nan estimate on a surgery, for example, might prove inexact. if all goes as expected, the price quoted likely will be close. but unexpected complications could arise, adding to the cost.\n\nyou'll get the average price, but you are not average, says gerard anderson, a professor of health policy and management at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health who studies hospital pricing.\n\ntools to help consumers determine in advance the amount of deductible they'll owe are already available from many insurers. and experts expect the additional information being made available this month will prompt entrepreneurs to create their own apps or services to help consumers analyze the price data.\n\nfor now, though, the hospital requirements are a worthy start, say specialists in u.s. health care costs.\n\nit's very good news for consumers, said george nation, a professor of law and business at lehigh university who studies hospital pricing. individuals will be able to get price information, although how much they are going to use it will remain to be seen.\n\nwho else will use this information?\n\nzack cooper, an associate professor of public health and economics at yale, doubts that the data alone will make much of a difference for most consumers.\n\nit's not likely that my neighbor — or me, for that matter — will go on and look at prices and, therefore, dramatically change decisions about where to get care, cooper says.\n\nsome cost information is already made available by insurers to their enrollees, particularly out-of-pocket costs for elective services, but most people don't consult it, he says.\n\nthat could be because many consumers carry types of insurance in which they pay flat-dollar copayments for such things as doctor visits, drugs or hospital stays — payments that have no correlation to the underlying charges.\n\nstill, the information may be of great interest to the uninsured and to the increasing number of americans with high-deductible plans, in which they are responsible for hundreds or even thousands of dollars in costs annually before the insurer begins picking up the bulk of the cost.\n\nfor them, the negotiated rate and cash discount information may prove more useful, nation says.\n\nif i have a $10,000 deductible plan and it's december and i'm not close to meeting that, i may go to a hospital and try to get the cash price, nation says.\n\nemployers, however, may have a keen interest in the new data, says james gelfand, senior vice president at the erisa industry committee, which lobbies on behalf of large employers that offer health insurance to their workers. employers will want to know how much they are paying each hospital compared with others in the area and how well their insurers stack up in negotiating rates, gelfand says.\n\nfor some employers, he says, it could be eye-opening to see how hospitals cross-subsidize by charging exorbitant amounts for some things and minimal amounts for others.\n\nthe rule puts that all into the light, says gelfand. when an employer sees these ridiculous prices, for the first time they will have the ability to say no. that could mean rejecting specific prices or the hospital entirely.\n\ntypically, employers can't or won't limit workers' choices by outright cutting a hospital from an insurance network. more likely, they may use the information to create financial incentives to use the lowest-cost facilities, says anderson at johns hopkins.\n\nif i'm an employer, he says, i'll look at three hospitals in my area and say, 'i'll pay the price for the lowest one. if you want to go to one of the other two, you can pay the difference.' \n\nwill price transparency reduce overall health spending?\n\nrevealing actual negotiated prices, as this rule requires, may push the more expensive hospitals in an area to reduce prices in their future bargaining talks with insurers or employers, potentially lowering health spending in those regions.\n\nit could also go the other way, with lower-cost hospitals demanding a raise, driving up spending.\n\nbottom line: price transparency can help, but the market power of the various players might matter more.\n\nin some places, where there may be one dominant hospital, even employers who know they are getting ripped off may not feel they can cut out a big, brand-name facility from their networks, no matter the price, anderson says.\n\nis the rule change a done deal?\n\nthe hospital industry went to court, arguing that parts of the rule go too far, violating their first amendment rights and also unfairly forcing hospitals to disclose trade secrets. that information, the industry says, can then be used against them in negotiations with insurers and employers.\n\nbut the u.s. district court for the district of columbia disagreed with the hospitals and upheld the rule, prompting an appeal by the industry. on dec. 29, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia affirmed that lower court decision and did not move to block enforcement of the rule.\n\nin a written statement last week, the american hospital association's general counsel cited disappointment with the ruling, and said the organization is reviewing the decision carefully to determine next steps.\n\napart from the litigation, the aha says it plans to talk with the incoming biden administration to try to persuade them there are some elements to this rule and the insurer rule that are tricky, says tom nickels, an executive vice president of the trade group. we want to be of help to consumers, but is it really in people's best interest to provide privately negotiated rates?\n\nfisher thinks so: hospitals are fighting this because they want to keep their negotiated deals with insurers secret, she says. what these rules do is give the american consumer the power of being informed.\n\nkaiser health news is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the kaiser family foundation and is not affiliated with kaiser

virginia gov. ralph northam's yearbook page shows men in blackface and kkk robes\n\nthe medical school yearbook page shows a photo of two men — one in blackface, and one in a ku klux klan robe and hood. it isn't clear, if northam is one of the men in the photo.\n\nari shapiro, host:\n\ndemocrats and republicans are calling for virginia governor ralph northam to resign after a photo from his past surfaced this afternoon. the democratic governor's medical school yearbook page from 1984 shows a photo of two people, one in blackface and one in a kkk robe and hood. northam admits he was in the photo and released this apology soon after the news broke.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nralph northam: i cannot change the decisions i made, nor can i undo the harm my behavior caused then and today. but i accept responsibility for my past actions, and i am ready to do the hard work of regaining your trust.\n\nshapiro: for more, we're joined by npr's sarah mccammon, who is at eastern virginia medical school. hi, sarah.\n\nsarah mccammon, byline: hi, ari.\n\nshapiro: just begin by telling us what else we know about the photo.\n\nmccammon: well, we have confirmed, as many other media outlets have, that this is a real photo from virginia governor ralph northam's medical school yearbook in 1984. the page shows several sort of typical yearbook photos, and then it also shows a picture of someone in blackface and someone else in a kkk costume. this is on northam's page in his yearbook, and he has acknowledged that he appeared in the picture, didn't say which of those people is him. and he's apologized for that.\n\nshapiro: and we heard a bit of that apology. what else can you tell us about his response?\n\nmccammon: well, you know, he has not said he plans to resign. let's be clear about that. in fact he said in that statement later on that - he talked about serving out the remainder of his term and expressed desire to work toward healing after this event and after this came forward. but a lot of other people have called for him to resign, and those calls this evening have been coming in kind of one after another, ari, initially mostly from republicans but also now from a lot of democrats.\n\njust to tick through a few of them here in virginia, the state gop has called for northam's resignation, as has the national republican governors association. but we've seen similar calls from kamala harris, the senate - california senator running for president, from the liberal group moveon.org and from planned parenthood just a moment ago. all have called for him to resign as well as the naacp.\n\nand here in virginia, we saw a statement from the black legislative caucus (ph) at the virginia statehouse, which is dominantly democratic. they have not called for him to resign, but they expressed a sense of betrayal in the statement they put out - so a lot of very sharp, pointed words here for northam. so far, though, he has said he wants to serve out his term.\n\nshapiro: really striking how widely across the ideological spectrum the condemnation is so quickly. and this comes at a time when ralph northam was already struggling over comments he made about abortion earlier in the week. tell us about that.\n\nmccammon: that's right. he was also already facing a lot of heat just in the past couple of days over a proposal in the virginia legislature that he had expressed support for that would have removed a lot of restrictions on abortion including during the third trimester, later in an abortion. he talked about his experience as a physician talking to families in very difficult situations and said that in some of these difficult situations involving a pregnancy where there's a severe fetal deformity or a fetus is unable to survive outside the woman's body, he would support allowing doctors and patients to make those decisions together.\n\nand that drew a huge backlash from the right - accusations of supporting infanticide, which he roundly denied. and here, you know, just in the wake of that big controversy that really got national attention, this photo emerges, and now we're seeing calls, again, from both sides of the aisle for northam to resign because of this.\n\nshapiro: that's npr's sarah mccammon at the campus of eastern virginia medical school. thank you, sarah.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
whole foods will drop prices on monday, amazon says in detailing new grocery strategy\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption patrick t. fallon/bloomberg via getty images patrick t. fallon/bloomberg via getty images\n\namazon is cutting the prices of bananas, butter, organic eggs, and other best-selling staples at whole foods' 470 stores, promising customers lower costs and targeting the grocer's whole paycheck nickname. the online giant also says its amazon prime members will get special prices and perks.\n\nnew prices will take effect on monday — the same day amazon says it will finalize its $13.7 billion acquisition of whole foods. the online marketplace, famous for disrupting the book industry and other retail segments, also laid out its plans for combining its business with an established brick-and-mortar chain.\n\namazon customers would be able to receive packages — and return items bought online — at whole foods locations that include its lockers service, the retailer said, outlining what customers can expect to see.\n\nintegration of the two companies will also mean amazon customers will be able to buy whole foods' private label products through its website and local grocery delivery services. another change would make prime the loyalty rewards program for whole foods customers.\n\namazon sent ripples through the grocery industry when it announced it would buy whole foods back in june. but analysts have also noted that the combined company would only control about 2 percent of the u.s. grocery market. the largest share goes to walmart, with about 14.5 percent, followed by kroger with 7.2 percent, cnbc reported this summer.\n\nwith the new details, amazon is revealing some of its goals for this acquisition — including gathering customer information from whole foods' clientele.\n\nthe list of grocery items that will be cheaper at whole foods markets next week ranges from bananas, apples and organic avocados to ground beef, salmon and tilapia, along with organic rotisserie chicken and other products.\n\ncalling the combined venture the first of a new breed of cyber-physical retailers, professor lee mcknight of syracuse university's school of information studies says amazon's first priority isn't to boost whole foods' sales volumes — it's to boost the amount of data the company has about its customers.\n\nciting a strong overlap of upper-income consumers who use both amazon prime and whole foods, mcknight says, they want to tie those two databases or datasets together, which makes it more valuable, because now you have this more rounded picture of what the person is doing online and offline.\n\nnoting that a large chunk of amazon's profits stem from its cloud services and data businesses rather than its online sales, mcknight says the new strategy could benefit both elements of amazon's business.\n\nit could also pose a threat to other grocers and retailers.\n\nnoting the recently struck deal between google and walmart, mcknight said, if you're not walmart, if you're not amazon and whole foods, who's your cyber partner to make you stand out in this evolution?\n\nif he were another retailer who was locked out of deals with amazon or google, mcknight said, i'd be wetting my pants now.\n\nthe two companies say they'll offer more price cuts and changes in the future, after they integrate their logistics and retail systems.\n\nonce the takeover is complete, whole foods will retain its own brand and keep its headquarters in austin, texas, amazon says. co-founder john mackey will remain as ceo.
for some new americans, capitol attack was an echo of turmoil they'd hoped to escape\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption julio cortez/ap julio cortez/ap\n\nearlier this week, 34-year-old management consultant rhazi koné was taking a walk through his washington, d.c., neighborhood when he noticed an unusual group of people.\n\ni think maybe four men and two women and they didn't have any masks on, he recalls. and i walked past them, and noticed that two of them had jackets on which said 'proud boys.' \n\nthe letters were in yellow on black jackets — the colors of the proud boys, a violent gang of self-described western chauvinists that have become a staple at pro-trump demonstrations. it was tuesday, the day before the attack on the u.s. capitol.\n\nkoné's apartment is only about 15 minutes away from the capitol. the next day, as he was watching the news, it began to dawn on him that something big was happening. he went to the rooftop of his building — he could see the capitol from there.\n\nit looked just like madness. just looked like a movie, he says. and it just really felt like something terrible was happening.\n\nfor many americans, this week's attack were shocking. but for the millions of americans born in countries with a history of political instability, the event has carried a different resonance.\n\nkoné grew up in the ivory coast, a country that's been marred by civil war, but he makes clear that while he was running away from war, he wasn't a refugee. he was a 17-year-old who wanted more opportunities — a wider choice of colleges and to live someplace where there was hope.\n\ntoday, koné is a permanent resident and on the way to becoming a u.s. citizen. so standing on the roof on wednesday afternoon, watching the attack on his adopted country unfold, he says he felt a multitude of emotions.\n\ni really felt sad. this is exactly what i ran away from and here i am again, experiencing the same thing, he says. i just always thought that america is better than that.\n\nkoné says never in his wildest dreams did he think an attack like this could happen in america. but nelly miguel, another american with roots in a country with a history of political upheaval, was less surprised.\n\nwhen you've seen something up close, then you know it's possible, she says.\n\nmiguel is in her early 60s. she's the assistant head of a private middle school in new jersey. but she grew up in venezuela. she left home to study in the u.s., where she has earned three masters degrees. after finishing her second masters, all of the sudden there was rampant inflation and no jobs in venezuela. facing uncertain prospects back home, she decided she wanted her future to be in the u.s.\n\ni am american now. but i'm not in the sense that i see americans think that what they have is inherited and doesn't need to be nurtured, and it can't change.\n\nmiguel says she has some advice for americans who haven't previously experienced the kind of political upheaval that descended on the nation's capitol this week. believe in our rules — in the constitution.\n\nif you lose that, then it's only a set of papers that say a few rules, she says.\n\nkoné says americans need to show curiosity about each other, and a willingness to listen to the other side. he says america has been very focused on trying to spread democracy outwards. now, he says, it's time to focus on what's needed at home, though he's not sure if americans are ready to do the work it will take to repair the country.
sen. sasse says capitol attack was inevitable after trump stoked division\n\nnpr's steve inskeep talks to republican sen. ben sasse of nebraska about president trump's involvement in wednesday's armed take over of the u.s. capitol, and whether trump should be held accountable.\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\nsenator ben sasse of nebraska is on the line. the republican was one of those in the u.s. capitol on wednesday when rioters attacked. when congress reconvened, sasse gave a speech saying, quote, lies have consequences, said the attack on the capitol was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the president's addiction to constantly stoking division. and then sasse voted to affirm the election results.\n\nsenator, welcome back to the program.\n\nben sasse: thanks for having me on, steve.\n\ninskeep: what did this week's events say about the state of democracy?\n\nsasse: well, we're not very healthy right now. but i want us to be sure we focus on the fact that we're going to get healthy again. but obviously, americans are angry right now, and our country's mourning. and particularly, i guess we should start by acknowledging the death of officer sicknick overnight and grieve with his family and obviously also with the families of the other four who've already died. the loss of life is gut-wrenching.\n\nbut on wednesday, the people's capitol, which is the greatest symbol of freedom and liberty and representative self-government anywhere in the world. all over the world, there's polling that shows when people think about freedom, they see the dome of the u.s. capitol in their head. and it was ransacked by a mob that was incited by the president of the united states. that's not a healthy situation.\n\ninskeep: i want to ask about one of your colleagues, one of a number who voted to object to the obvious election results - senator josh hawley of missouri. he was the first senator to say that he would join the objections. he raised his fist to the mob before they stormed the building. he continued his objections afterward and said, if i can paraphrase, listen, i'm just raising some concerns about ballot security. is there any doubt, though, that your colleague knew what he was inciting?\n\nsasse: well, let's begin by laying the blame first and foremost on those who actually committed the acts of violence at the capitol and then on the president of the united states, as well, because he was the one pouring gasoline on these fires of division.\n\ninskeep: sure.\n\nsasse: but a big part of the problem with our polarized politics at this moment is that there's a massive demand for it. this isn't just a supply problem. we have a big chunk of voters. they're not a majority. but they're really loud, and they're growing. there is a large group that is hopped up on rage clicks, and they're demanding nonsense stunts like the objection to the electoral college vote. so senator hawley was doing something that was a really dumb-ass, and i have been clear about that in public and in private since long before he announced that he was going to do this. this was a stunt. it was a terrible, terrible idea.\n\nand you don't lie to the american people, and that's what's been going on. the american people have been lied to, chiefly by donald trump, and lies have consequences. and those consequences are now found in five dead americans and a capitol building that's in shambles. and there's a lot of work that has to be done to rebuild. and legislators should not be aiding and abetting those kinds of lies.\n\ninskeep: david humphreys, who's a missouri businessman who spent $2 million to support hawley's election in 2018, now tells the missouri independent that hawley is, quote, a political opportunist willing to subvert the constitution. and he specifically has an idea. he would like the senate to censure senator hawley, would you - which would take a simple majority vote. would you vote for that?\n\nsasse: i heard late last night that mr. humphreys had made this recommendation, and i have not been shy in my criticisms of josh hawley, either in public or in private. this was a terrible, terrible idea. the mechanism of how the senate handles it next is something that we'll obviously need to talk about. but the most fundamental issue for any individual senator is their conscience to their oath of office to the constitution and their relationship with the citizens of the state that they serve. so missourians are the most important people in that conversation. but obviously, i think lots of deliberation needs to be had on the perverse incentives inside our article i branch right now.\n\nthe way people raise funds, the way they raise money during legislative debates is disgusting. fundamentally, this goes back to the demand side problem. we have - again, i want to be clear. it is a minority of america, but we have somewhere between four and 14% of americans who are identifying their political tribe as their most important community. and it's not a community of love. it's just - they're anti-communities. they're communities of hate.\n\ninskeep: let me just stop for one second there, senator.\n\nsasse: yep.\n\ninskeep: we could have a long discussion here. but you mentioned fundraising. hawley sent out a fundraising message on the day of the storming of the capitol - shortly before, according to the kansas city star. but the question about censure - should the senate be disciplining its own members for doing this sort of thing?\n\nsasse: i think we need to change rules that allow people to be fundraising while the senate is in session. you know, i'm a fan of term limits. i don't think the idea of constantly trying to get these feedback loops and make politics the center of kind of horse race rage, addiction, social media stuff. i don't think any of that is healthy. so the fundraising is gross. i have - i want to ban cameras in committee rooms, not audio. i want the american people to have transparency. but i want to end the constant grandstanding that drives so much of our politics at present. and so i want this kind of gross stuff, this kind of - these kinds of fundraising stunts to be ended.\n\ninskeep: i want to ask about the president of the united states and what happens to him now. i know there's talk of urging the 25th amendment. we haven't heard that vice president pence is a fan of that. there is talk in the house of impeachment, which would take a while. and we had jeh johnson on this program, the former homeland security secretary, earlier today, who told noel king simply that he thought the best option was for people around the president to urge him to leave town. go to mar-a-lago. delegate authority to the chief of staff, the vice president or somebody. just stop working. what would you have the president do in the final 12 days of his term?\n\nsasse: yeah. i think that the less the president does over the next 12 days, the better. you mentioned delegating responsibilities during this period to the vice president. in the midst of all of the pain and ugliness of the present, it is worth us pausing and affirming the fact that mike pence acted as a patriot through this. mike pence fulfilled his obligations on wednesday. while blood was being shed at the people's capitol, the president was actively rage tweeting against his vice president because the vice president was fulfilling his oath of office to the constitution to affirm the fact that joe biden won because joe biden won, and the congress' duty was to count and announce that joe biden had won.\n\nwe were in the senate chamber, and the secret service had to rush in and grab the vice president from the dais and rush him out of the room. and the president of the united states was rage tweeting against him at the same time. so, frankly, i think it's obvious that the president's conduct wasn't merely reckless and destructive, it was a flagrant dereliction of his duty to uphold and defend the constitution. and we need to know more about why the national guard wasn't deployed when calls were sent up for it.\n\ninskeep: senator ben sasse of nebraska.\n\nit's always a pleasure to talk with you. thank you very much, sir.\n\nsasse: thank you, steve.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
why analysts aren't laughing at these silly north korean photos\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption kcna/epa via corbis kcna/epa via corbis\n\nbruce klingner knows better than anyone how dangerous north korea really is. he spent years analyzing the hermit kingdom for the cia, and he now works as a northeast asia analyst at the heritage foundation.\n\nand yet even he finds himself having an occasional chuckle at the north's absurdity. the bombastic rhetoric and over-the-top propaganda are kind of like 1950s soviet union on steroids, he says.\n\nthe portrayals in films like the interview and team america: world police don't help either: in the back of your mind, you just have the image of kim jong il's puppet singing 'i'm so ronery,' he says.\n\nbut over the past few months, the experts have pretty much stopped laughing. that's because north korea has undertaken an unusual number of tests in the first quarter of 2016, everything from detonating a nuclear bomb underground to launching a satellite on a rocket that could be converted to a ballistic missile.\n\nkeeping up with the pace of activity is exhausting, to be honest, says melissa hanham, a north korea analyst at the east asia nonproliferation program of the middlebury institute of international studies in monterey, calif.\n\nnorth korean propaganda videos like this one appear over-the-top. but experts agree that the nation is developing long-range rockets. youtube\n\nwhat's clear, both analysts say, is that the north is working quickly toward its ultimate goal: a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on top of an intercontinental ballistic missile (icbm). and it's making pretty good progress.\n\na series of photos released by north korea's propaganda apparatus earlier this march is perhaps the best example of how views are changing. it shows the country's current dictator, kim jong un, the son of kim jong il, posing in front of a shiny silver ball placed atop a chintzy red tablecloth.\n\nthe ball is supposed to be a miniaturized nuke, capable of fitting on a missile. but, as with many north korean photos, it looks kind of silly.\n\na lot of people started calling it the disco ball, hanham says. there were disco inferno jokes on twitter.\n\nbut as experts started to analyze the pictures more closely, they weren't laughing. the ball on the table was obviously a model, but many of the details were reasonably close to a real miniaturized warhead.\n\nthey definitely know what a bomb looks like, hanham says. i mean, that model didn't come out of thin air. it's not a weird unicorn or anything. it has roots in the truth.\n\nthe north has now had four nuclear tests — enough, according to many experts, for it to figure out the basics of miniaturization. its progress has gotten the u.s. military's attention. earlier this month, adm. bill gortney, who heads the north american aerospace defense command, told lawmakers: it's the prudent decision on my part to assume that [kim jong un] has the capability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon and put it on an icbm.\n\nthis is a change in tone from just a few years ago, when the u.s. intelligence community stated that north korea didn't have all the tools it needed to send a nuke over american soil.\n\nboth klingner and hanham say there's no need to panic. north korea's newest ballistic missile is untested, and they have yet to prove they have vital re-entry technology that would allow their warhead to reach its target without burning up in the atmosphere.\n\nbut klingner also says it's clear that north korea is making lots of progress.\n\nthey're on a path to achieving a nuclear warhead capability that they can deliver to the u.s., japan and south korea, he says.\n\nand there is nothing funny about that.

bankrupt pacific gas & electric corp. will replace half of its board of directors\n\npacific gas and electric corp., california's largest utility, will replace half of its 10-member board of directors by may, the company announced monday.\n\nthe board currently expects that no more than five of the company's current directors will stand for election at the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, the company said in a statement. the board already has identified strong candidates who would add fresh perspectives and augment the board's expertise in safety, operations and other critical areas.\n\npg&e signaled a leadership shakeup last month when npr first reported that the utility company, beset by potential liability claims associated with california's devastating wildfires, was looking for ways to avoid bankruptcy. the company filed for bankruptcy in late january.\n\nin the wake of the wildfires, and with the company still under probation for its role in the 2010 gas pipeline explosion in san bruno, calif., pg&e acknowledged that its public image is wanting.\n\nwe fully understand that pg&e must re-earn trust and credibility with its customers, regulators, the communities it serves and all of its stakeholders, and we are continuing to make changes that reinforce pg&e's commitment to safety and improvement, the statement read.\n\na company critic, state sen. bill dodd, d-napa, whose wine-country district suffered through a massive wildfire in 2017, said the board changes were long overdue.\n\nwhile the change in the board is welcome, it's still taken way too long, said dodd in a statement. and it doesn't make sense to wait another day on these changes with another fire season on the horizon. time will tell if this new leadership instills the badly needed culture of safety at pg&e.\n\nstate investigators found that the napa fire was not caused by pg&e, but by a private electrical system.\n\nthe shakeup is already under way. pg&e's ceo, geisha williams, abruptly resigned from her post and her board seat in mid-january. another board member, roger kimmel, resigned a few days later.
kenyans of indian descent seek greater recognition\n\nin kenya, citizens of indian descent have often been seen as foreigners. now there is a movement to change that. asians, as they are called in kenya, want to be recognized as the country's 44th tribe.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nfor more than a century, kenyans of indian descent have played a big role in east african society, but they're also often seen as foreigners. npr's eyder peralta reports that there's now a movement to change that. asians in all their diversity want to be recognized as the country's 44th tribe.\n\nunidentified men: (chanting in hindi).\n\neyder peralta, byline: satish shah shows me around the baps hindu temple in nairobi. it was built using african wood that was shipped to india, where it was intricately carved and then was shipped back to africa.\n\nsatish shah: so it's unique and it's of its own kind.\n\n(soundbite of drumming, bells)\n\nperalta: every morning at 6:45 without fail, dozens of faithful come to the temple. it's just outside downtown. and at sunrise its sandstone walls beam in the light, becoming one of the most stunning buildings in the city.\n\n(soundbite of bells)\n\nperalta: it becomes a symbol of the life that many asians, as they are called here, have built in kenya. just across the city, i meet farah mannzoor at sarit center, which was the city's first modern shopping mall. it was also built by kenyan indians. mannzoor is a fifth-generation kenyan. yet every now and then, she says, she's told to go back to india. she's treated like a foreigner. but she says...\n\nfarah mannzoor: my home is kenya. i'm kenyan by blood and soil. my forefathers are buried here. this is where i will die. this is where i will be buried.\n\nperalta: mannzoor blames a lot of this tension on the complex history of asians in east africa. many were brought during the colonial period by the british to build the railroad. the asians stayed on and became economic drivers. but social integration did not match their business integration, and through the '70s they were scapegoated and ultimately expelled from neighboring uganda and tanzania. in kenya, former president arap moi would malign asians and accuse them of exploiting africans. after a failed coup to oust him in 1982, kenyans reacted violently.\n\nmannzoor: our houses were looted. our businesses were looted. our women were raped. so asians, out of fear, left this country.\n\nperalta: mannzoor and her family stayed. despite the sting of rejection, she says, she's always felt kenyan. and that reaction in the '80s always seemed out of place in a country as diverse as kenya, which today is home to 43 tribes. this month, the asian community led by mannzoor officially asked the president to recognize asians as the 44th tribe. in essence, he would be declaring asians an intregal part of kenyan society. for aleya kassam, an asian writer who has been tackling issues of identity, that recognition would be a mind shift not just for black kenyans but for asian kenyans, whom she says for reasons of survival and even because of some racism have always kept their eyes elsewhere, never really accepting that kenya is their home.\n\naleya kassam: there was this thinking - and there still is - i'll put my head down, work as hard as i can, send my kids to private school, get private health care, build high walls, employ a lot of security guards and i'll be fine.\n\nperalta: but things are not fine, kassam says. in the past two years, her own family was violently robbed and they lost all their wealth in a bank scam.\n\nkassam: we can't keep building higher walls. we've got to start participating and actively engaging for a better country for everybody. we can't keep thinking of just ourselves because that is not going to work.\n\nperalta: kassam went to college in canada. when she was done, she had to make a choice - stay within the comfort of western society or come back to kenya and fight endemic corruption, poverty and tribalism to build a better country. she chose home. she chose kenya. eyder peralta, npr news, nairobi.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
storming the capitol didn't change the election, some trump backers realize\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption john moore/getty images john moore/getty images\n\non wednesday, michelle laughlin realized something: joe biden would be the next president.\n\nshe had traveled from nevada for the stop the steal rally hoping that a second term for president trump was still possible. she sang patriotic songs as trump supporters forcibly invaded the capitol building. but as night fell, and the occupiers were pushed out and congress resumed its operations, laughlin saw with clarity where things are headed.\n\ni think they're going to certify biden, she said, and i think that's a terrible, terrible thing.\n\ntrump supporters like laughlin, convinced by the president's false claims that the election had been stolen, traveled from around the country to washington, d.c., for wednesday's rally. at the white house, the president urged them on. we will not take it any more, the president said, calling on his followers to head to the capitol.\n\nand they did, marching en masse to the building, overpowering police, breaching barricades and invading while elected officials took cover. one woman was fatally shot by capitol police in the hours-long chaos. very few people were arrested.\n\nthe mob succeeded in forcing congress to halt the certification of the electoral college votes, but only temporarily. senators and representatives returned to work after the building was clear and vowed to work through the night. the stated goal of the mass gathering — a reversal of the legitimate election results — remained out of reach.\n\nas that became increasingly clear, a sort of testosterone hangover took hold in the nation's capital. small crowds of trump supporters, not quite willing to let the day's events go, dispersed slowly in front of an impassive line of police in riot gear and drifted down streets back toward their hotels.\n\nthe forcible occupation of the capitol by a pro-trump mob was roundly condemned by virtually every prominent political leader — except for trump, who told the occupiers to be peaceful but also said we love you. you're special.\n\nbut some trump backers were unsettled by the invasion, and in some cases deny it really happened. adriel and kristina leddy from northern california arrived in d.c. too late to witness the breaching of the capitol. adriel leddy said he believed it had been carried out by leftists impersonating trump supporters. trump's people and patriots and people who just care about personal property and their country don't vandalize and break, nor do they use violence, he said.\n\nlaughlin, the trump backer from nevada, saw the crowds break in, and she said it wasn't great. but she mostly faults the police at the capitol who didn't do enough to block the mob, arguing they let it happen.\n\nshe reserves her irritation for right-wing media and politicians who encouraged the baseless hopes that brought her to d.c.\n\non the news, they keep saying now that they shouldn't have said that [vice president] pence can stop the certification, that was just a big lie ... they didn't say that before, she says. maybe some of the other news stations that i don't trust, but the ones that i do, that's not what they were saying.\n\nhad pence come out and said flat out like, 'no, i can't change this,' ... i would have been like, 'well, that's a big old bust,' but i would have believed him, she said. i mean, people would have moved along. \n\ninstead, pence waited until midday wednesday, after thousands of people had gathered to protest, to make it clear he would not overthrow the results.\n\nit's very frustrating, laughlin says.\n\nbut for trump fan tracey lawrence, at least, the stop the steal rally was a big success.\n\nthe missouri resident sells trump gear, and the assembled crowd was underdressed for d.c.'s chilly weather. they didn't have enough gloves and scarves, she says. because of that, we did great.\n\nand unlike laughlin, lawrence has not concluded that trump's only path forward is to leave the white house.\n\ni hope he calls martial law, she says.
white house cheers numbers on jobs, border crossings\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption getty images getty images\n\nthe white house is celebrating some encouraging numbers this week. factory jobs are up. illegal border crossings are down.\n\nthe new administration is claiming credit on both fronts, although much of the change so far is psychological.\n\nthe labor department released its first monthly jobs report of the new trump administration friday. the numbers were solid, if not spectacular. u.s. employers added 235,000 jobs in february. gains were especially strong in manufacturing, construction and oil drilling.\n\ni would characterize it as a very good report, said chief economist nariman behravesh of ihs markit. we had very strong, back-to-back gains in jobs in january and february. that puts us in a very good position. we've got some momentum going in the labor market. so this is good news.\n\nduring the campaign, trump repeatedly called the government's unemployment numbers phony — arguing the jobless rate was higher than reported. asked about the change in tune, press secretary sean spicer quoted trump in friday's press briefing: they may have been phony in the past but it's very real now.\n\nthe administration was so eager to trumpet that good news, officials ignored a long-standing rule to withhold comment for at least an hour after the official report. the president waited just 11 minutes before retweeting a drudge report item with the jobs number and the headline great again. his press secretary followed 11 minutes later.\n\n\n\nsome forecasters were expecting even stronger job gains, after an encouraging private payroll report earlier in the week. hiring in february was roughly on par with the last month of the obama administration, as well as hiring this time last year.\n\nit's important to remember that president trump inherited an economy that was already making steady progress towards full employment, said economist elise gould of the left-leaning economic policy institute. today's numbers of 235,000 are very much in line with what we saw in january — 238,000 jobs added — or what we saw in february of last year — 237,000 jobs.\n\neven if the latest jobs report was not a barn burner, it was certainly encouraging. unemployment inched down to 4.7 percent, and hundreds of thousands of new people started looking for work.\n\nthere definitely has been an improvement in business confidence since the election, even before mr. trump took office, behravesh said. small-business confidence, for example, soared. overall business confidence has improved. consumer confidence has improved. so i think there is a confidence effect and that is translating into jobs growth.\n\nthe young trump presidency is having a different kind of psychological effect on the southwest border, where the number of illegal crossings fell by an estimated 40 percent last month. would-be migrants tell npr they've been discouraged by the president's get-tough rhetoric as well as increased deportations. as with job growth, the white house painted the drop in illicit border crossings as a sign of progress.\n\nthese measures reflect that both the economy and the border are already responding to the president's agenda, even while we're still in the beginning stages of putting his policies in place, said spicer. the country and the world are clearly ready and waiting for the change the president campaigned on and is already delivering.\n\nthe stock market is also on a roll, with the dow up nearly 14 percent since the november election. many of these gains are based on expectations about what trump has promised to do, rather than what he has already done.\n\nthere is some concern that businesses are getting ahead of themselves in the sense that while there's been a lot of good talk about rolling back regulations, about cutting taxes, there's only been very, very limited progress so far, behravesh said. so the worry is that we could be setting ourselves up for disappointment.\n\nfor the moment, the white house is happy to tout some positive results, as it begins the tougher task of pushing a contentious legislative agenda.
yahoo confirms data from millions of accounts stolen in 2014\n\nyahoo says at least 500 million accounts were hacked two years ago. the company revealed the data breach on thursday, without saying whether it knew all along or just found out.\n\nrenee montagne, host:\n\none of yahoo's more popular services is its free email. now the tech giant has revealed at least half a billion user accounts have been hacked. it's one of the largest data breaches on record. yahoo says the theft occurred two years ago but they only detected it this summer. then they waited until now to warn customers. npr's aarti shahani has more.\n\naarti shahani, byline: no version of the story looks good for yahoo. either the company had an inkling about being hacked back in 2014 and just didn't say anything, or what the company claims is true - they just discovered the breach this summer, which means it took them two years to detect that half of their user accounts were stolen.\n\nanne mckenna: that's very unusual and very troubling on many levels.\n\nshahani: that's anne mckenna, a law professor at pennsylvania state university. most states in the u.s. have rules that require companies to inform their users when data has been stolen. and it has to happen in a reasonable period of time.\n\nit took yahoo an unreasonable period of time, cybersecurity experts say. and today, the company based in california has not shown compliance with its state laws. anne mckenna.\n\nmckenna: yahoo has yet to provide to the public - here's how we think the breach occurred. here's your exact information that was taken.\n\nshahani: the company issued only a generic letter to users yesterday, saying hackers got yahoo emails, real names, phone numbers, dates of birth and passwords. yahoo says hackers did not get credit card and bank account numbers. and the company did not offer credit monitoring, even though your stolen email and password might be used to access financial accounts, as many people recycle passwords.\n\nmckenna: yahoo's just telling everybody, hey, hey, if you haven't changed your password since 2014, just go ahead and change them.\n\nshahani: yahoo did not inform verizon, the company which had agreed to buy them over the summer for nearly $5 billion. verizon issued a curt statement yesterday, saying it was just informed this week of the break-in, while after, they jointly announced their deal.\n\nyahoo says federal agents are investigating. and the hackers were state-sponsored, meaning a foreign government was behind this. but the company provided no further details in order, quote, to prevent the actors from learning our detection methods. aarti shahani, npr news, san francisco.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
election security in georgia\n\nnpr's lulu garcia-navarro talks with marilyn marks of the coalition for good governance about the reasons behind the lawsuit seeking to bar georgia from using its paperless voting machines.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nthere are new developments in a legal fight over the security of georgia's election server. this past week, an election security expert said he found evidence the server was tampered with in 2014. the allegation was contained in an affidavit filed as part of a lawsuit brought by election integrity activists seeking to bar georgia from using its paperless voting machines.\n\nmarilyn marks is the executive director of the coalition for good governance, one of the nonprofit groups behind the lawsuit. we talked about the implications of a breach of the election server.\n\nmarilyn marks: the reason this is so concerning is because while it appears that the malicious attacker got in in 2014, they could have clearly stayed in quite a long time. this server was not shut down until the end of 2017. but the records that were on that server - and these would be millions of records. this would have been the hub for all of georgia's elections. those millions of records could have been, certainly, infiltrated. and then as copies of those records were removed from the server to put on new applications, they could have carried with them malicious code. there is still quite a lot we don't know. but there is no reason to believe that anything that an attacker did in 2014 and beyond is not still present in the system.\n\ngarcia-navarro: could these malicious actors have actually changed people's votes?\n\nmarks: unfortunately, yes. the reason is that on this central server, it was the mothership. it was the hub of all things elections in georgia. and every single one of the 30,000 voting machines that are used in georgia was programmed from that central server. so yes, they could've changed votes. do we have any evidence of that? not at this point. we will certainly be wanting to find out.\n\ngarcia-navarro: this sounds like an enormously problematic breach. who was responsible for the server's security?\n\nmarks: the secretary of state's office has run that particular operation. it's called center for election systems. at the time of the breach, it was located at kennesaw state university. it was operated as a little satellite organization that was really under the control of the secretary of state's office. after the breach and then after an explosive event when we sued them and then they deleted all of their files, then there was such a public outcry that that contract was canceled, and all of the work was moved back to the secretary of state's office but under the direction of the same managers.\n\ngarcia-navarro: what does this mean for the 2020 presidential election? how can georgia audit its vote if it needs to?\n\nmarks: lulu, it cannot. and it's not just the presidential election that's at risk because georgia programs every single machine centrally. it is the u.s. senatorial elections - and as you know, georgia has two senators up in the election this year - mayors, county commissioners and then all the way up to the presidential office. none of those elections will be able to be audited.\n\nthe secretary of state has chosen a new system. they've spent over a hundred million dollars on it. it is absolutely as vulnerable, if not more vulnerable, according to many experts, than the old system that we're talking about. so not only could the old malware have been transferred into the new system in various places, but the fact that it cannot be audited is really troublesome.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so you're saying, bottom line is that georgians can't be confident about their vote in 2020 unless some things change. what are those things?\n\nmarks: what needs to change is really simple, lulu. what needs to change is that paper ballots marked by hand by all those who are able have them counted using a optical scanner and then have audits done. the state should not be putting an electronic screen between the voter and the ballot. and then with an audit, they could be virtually 100% sure that the vote was what reflected the will of the people.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's marilyn marks, executive director of the coalition for good governance. thank you so much.\n\nmarks: thank you, lulu.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

people, a record, will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather, large infectious-disease outbreaks and intensifying, protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries. that's around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019, and the number is expected to continue to rise, up to 200 million people by 2022. the u.n. expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to $29 billion.\n\nhot spots include burkina faso, where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people; the philippines, where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen; and venezuela, where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years.\n\nshannon scribner, associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america, says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need, and that will continue to be a challenge.\n\nscribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict-affected areas such as syria and yemen.\n\nhumanitarian law isn't being upheld in some of the countries where we're working, says scribner. and we don't see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did.\n\none key solution, she says: channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately, rather than big international ngos. — tim mcdonnell\n\nsecond-tier diseases will go gangbusters\n\nover the last 12 months, the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers — hiv, malaria and tuberculosis. but other illnesses, some of them easily preventable, stole the limelight.\n\nthose second-tier diseases include measles and dengue, which did gangbusters in the tropics. cholera raged in yemen. polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat. in pakistan, polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018. in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort, a dozen countries that had been polio free (including china, angola and the philippines) reported cases of vaccine-derived polio in 2019. venezuela reported its first yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country's health care system continues its downward spiral. despite efforts to rein it in, a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east, and that will probably continue in the coming year.\n\nrecent high-profile measles outbreaks in the u.s., europe, the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year. to prevent outbreaks, the world health organization says that roughly 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles. more than half the countries in the world, including the u.s. at 94%, haven't reached that threshold, according to unicef. where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020? afghanistan, angola, bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40%.\n\nbut there are some signs of progress: this year, a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years. and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history: two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use, all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak. the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world's ability to battle this virus. if there's an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020, it would likely be contained and crushed quickly. — jason beaubien\n\naid will become even more political\n\nit seems we're returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for [political] friends and allies, says jeremy konyndyk, a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u.s. foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration.\n\ninstead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development, konyndyk says there's a growing mentality in the u.s. that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line. examples include trump's freezing and reinstatement of aid to el salvador, guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies; his threats to cut off countries that don't vote with the u.s. at the united nations; and his withdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan.\n\nthe u.k. has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office, a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing u.k. aid. these shifts by the u.s. and u.k., two of the world's largest aid donors, could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world, says konyndyk. — joanne lu\n\nunrest over inequality will grow\n\n2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world, and according to some experts, the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020.\n\nsince the 1980s, income inequality has been on the rise, says lucas chancel, co-director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics. in the u.s., for example, chancel says the richest 1% owned about 40% of the nation's wealth in 2016 — up from 20% in the 1980s — and trump's 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality, with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households.\n\nit is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different, he says, meaning inequality will deepen, despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it.\n\npart of the problem is that inequality has a new face, according to a new report by the united nations development programme. people are no longer just angry about income; they're concerned about inequalities in political representation and power, higher education, access to technology and the resources to survive climate change.\n\nchancel says the protests in chile, france, lebanon, hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions. until they do, the undp report warns, the social unrest will likely continue. — joanne lu\n\nwater taps continue to run dry\n\nin june 2019, chennai, india, reached day zero — the day on which the city's reservoirs ran almost completely out of water. by the fall, seasonal rains had resupplied the city, at least temporarily. but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020.\n\nin india alone, 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020, according to a government report. and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one-quarter of the global population — including botswana, india, iran and mexico — are using as much or more water than they can replace.\n\nupmanu lall, director of the columbia water center, says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity, in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources.\n\ni haven't seen any reasonable improvement, he says. so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year.\n\nthe indian subcontinent is a prime candidate, he says. but on the plus side, climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña, the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others. the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity.\n\neither way, victoria beard, an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow, says water scarcity will continue to be a problem, especially in cities, until governments of high-risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems.\n\npeople are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services, she says. there's no self-provision [of bottled water] that's going to solve this problem in the long term. there are no examples where it's a free-for-all and it works out well. you need coordinated massive public investment. — tim mcdonnell\n\ngender equality is not on the horizon\n\nthe u.n. calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world. yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality, as defined by the u.n.'s sustainable development goals, by 2030.\n\n2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality: it's the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action, which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women's rights. the global community will be taking stock of progress — and lack thereof — at gatherings such as that of the u.n. commission on the status of women in march.\n\nworldwide, women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence, less access to economic and educational opportunities, and exclusion from decision-making roles at the community and governmental levels.\n\nby one measure, the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century. the most current estimate by the world economic forum — which publishes an annual report to track country-by-country progress across economic, educational, health and political dimensions — is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99.5 years at the current rate.\n\nwhile the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment, which could be possible in as soon as 12 years, progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding. by that metric, parity is a lowly 57.8% and will take 257 years to overcome. — emily vaughn\n\nhopeful trends\n\nglobal health will get woke\n\nthis year, expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries, stripping them of resources and autonomy. people who work in the field know that much of the money, influence and decision-making about how to help low-income countries still comes from wealthy countries — with little input from the people who receive the assistance.\n\none reason for this mindset, says renzo guinto, a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health's editorial board, is the colonial roots of tropical medicine. in the colonial era, european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers — not the people living in those places — from getting sick.\n\nover the past couple of years, he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change. they aim to give medical professionals in low-income countries real leadership roles. at the university level, students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field's colonial history in global health curriculum. and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media. many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags #shiftthepower and #decolonizeglobalhealth.\n\njennifer lentfer, a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades, says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development. there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject. in the coming weeks, lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative. and in january, graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020.\n\nthere's a real question as to how to flip the leadership, says lentfer. and that's coming to a big head. — malaka gharib\n\nsatellite imagery could improve global health\n\nthis year, expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky-high point of view. imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive — and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty, disease and environmental challenges.\n\nmarshall burke, deputy director of stanford university's center on food security and the environment, is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them.\n\nlet's say you run a government agency in a low-income country and want to identify the poorest 10% of villages — or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito-borne diseases. satellite imagery can help you answer those questions, burke says, in a way that's much less expensive and time-consuming than traditional boots-on-the-ground surveys. cars, large buildings and well-tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space.\n\nsatellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining. it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters. in some cases, it might help us peer into the future: in december, the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery, in conjunction with other data, to predict water shortages and conflicts.\n\nin 2020, burke says, expect to see more satellite-based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers. and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u.s. and the european union, more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries — including ethiopia's first observatory satellite, launched in late december. — tim mcdonnell\n\nyouth activists will lead the fight for a better world\n\nit's not just greta thunberg, the 16-year-old swedish climate activist who seized time's person of the year cover for 2019. helena gualinga, a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon, took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights. university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants.\n\nyoung people are in the lead, said u.n. secretary-general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day. everywhere, they are marching against corruption, repression and inequality, and for human rights and human dignity.\n\nin 2020, youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see, says jessica taft, a youth-movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california, santa cruz.\n\nthat kind of involvement by young people isn't new, taft says. but what has changed, she says, is that today's social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other. with their phones set to retweet, they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away.\n\na common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make.\n\nmany of the issues that they're focusing on right now are ones that they're able to claim moral authority around as young people, says taft. that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence, which young people can address from personal experience, like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland, fla., who captured the world's attention after the shooting at their school.\n\nmatt deitsch, a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington, d.c., told npr in an interview in 2019: if we're not standing up and organizing ourselves, then we're not doing enough to save lives in america. — pien huang\n\ncash will be king (of aid)\n\nit's an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades: instead of giving poor people goods and services — say, a cow or job training — why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it?\n\ninterest in cash transfers — as this form of aid is often referred to — is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade, says david evans, a senior fellow at the washington, d.c., think tank center for global development.\n\none reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long-term effects of some of the earliest large-scale cash transfer programs — a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s. already we're starting to see the first wave of long-term evaluations, says evans, who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank.\n\nso far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short-term needs — like giving their families enough food each day — rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way. but these families were also able to give their children more schooling. and now that the kids are aging into the workforce, it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty. if so, says evans, that will be an exciting thing to find. — nurith aizenman\n\naccess to college will boom\n\nmore and more people are going to college. access to higher education has expanded rapidly across the globe over the last five years, says michael green, ceo of social progress imperative, and he expects it to continue in 2020.\n\ngreen and his organization, through its social progress index, have been tracking this every year since 2014. higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries, says green, but many countries are making significant leaps, both in terms of enrollment and quality, and it's leading to a growing global middle class. some of the biggest improvers, according to their data, include morocco, slovakia and turkey.\n\nour world in data, an online publication based at oxford university, also expects the number of people around the world with higher-education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies. the international institute for applied systems analysis projects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100, compared with 725 million in 2015. although the improvement isn't in every country, green says the rise in the global average is still a striking win. — joanne lu
food stall serves up a social experiment: white customers asked to pay more\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption deji osinulu deji osinulu\n\ncan a $12 lunch change the way people think about racial wealth disparity in america? how about a $30 lunch? that's the premise behind a social experiment playing out in a new orleans food stall.\n\nchef tunde way opened his pop-up stall in the city's roux carre venue in early february. the listed price for the nigerian food is $12. but when white people walk up to order, they are asked whether they want to pay $30. why? it's two-and-a half times more than the $12 meal, which reflects the income disparity between whites and african-americans in new orleans, says wey.\n\nthe median income for african-american households in new orleans fell from $32,332 in 2000 to $27,812 in 2013 in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the data center's new orleans index at ten. over the same time, median income for white households in the city remained roughly the same, $61,117 to $60,070. in 2013, the median household income for african-americans in metro new orleans was 54 percent lower than for whites.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption deji osinulu deji osinulu\n\nwey says that when customers come up to his window to place an order, he tells them that his food stall aims to engage people on the topic of racial income and wealth disparities and to share statistics on these disparities. he then informs them that customers who identify as white are being asked to pay the higher $30 price to reflect these disparities. customers also have the option to pay the listed $12 price. the difference between the $12 and $30 meals, all customers are informed, will be redistributed to minorities who buy food at the stall. how do white customers react to the proposition?\n\nsome of them are enthusiastic, some of them are bamboozled a bit by it, wey says. but the majority of white folks, nearly 80 percent, decided to pay.\n\nthat was definitely higher than we expected, says anjali prasertong, a graduate student in public health at tulane university who helped wey design the experiment and collect data.\n\ncustomers who agree to buy lunch were asked to fill out a brief survey online. a subset of these diners were also pulled aside and interviewed about how income and wealth disparities have played out in their own lives.\n\nprasertong points to one anecdote from an african-american customer whom she interviewed. i asked her, 'if you had been given access to more resources while you were growing up, would that have changed your life in any way?'  prasertong recalls. she immediately had an example.\n\nthe woman told prasertong that when she was a college student, she was offered an unpaid summer white house internship in washington, d.c. but that meant she would have had to find a way to support herself in another city instead of spending the summer earning money that she could use to help pay for school in the fall. the woman passed on the internship, prasertong says, because she realized, 'oh, it's just for rich people'  – meaning students whose parents could afford to subsidize them while they worked for free. she still went on to be successful, but if she'd done that internship, who knows what she'd be doing?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption deji osinulu deji osinulu\n\none of the things i took away from interviewing people was a greater awareness that people of color have thought about wealth disparity and how it has touched their lives and the kinds of things they've lost out on because they didn't have access to the resources their white friends did, says prasertong. not that [white people] weren't aware, but they never really thought about how ... that might have affected where they are in the world in relation to people of color. they never stopped to think, 'oh, that car my parents gave me in college allowed me to drive across town to get a good job.' \n\nas prasertong points out, it's not a strict scientific study. one limitation of this experiment is that the customers who came to the stall were all in a higher-than-average income bracket. prasertong says that may be one reason why the vast majority of customers of color – african-americans, latinos and asians – declined to sign up to receive the redistributed money made from charging whites the higher price.\n\nas of feb. 28, the day the premise of the experiment was revealed in a times-picayune article, 64 people had completed the survey, which included 32 whites, prasertong says. twenty-five white customers paid the extra $18, adding up to a pool of $450. only six people of color had signed up for distributions, which they would split evenly among them, $75 each.\n\nthe food stall — called saartj, a reference to a 19th-century black south african woman infamously paraded as a freak show in europe — will be open through sunday, though the data collection part of the experiment is now over.\n\nwhile this experiment focused on racial income disparity in new orleans, the numbers when it comes to the racial wealth gap in america are even starker. white families accumulate more wealth more quickly than do families made up of people of color. as npr's code switch team has reported:\n\nin 2013, the median white family held 13 times as much net wealth as the median black family and 10 times as much wealth as the median latino family, according to the federal reserve's survey of consumer finances.\n\nthere are many reasons cited behind this gap, including slavery and institutional and governmental discrimination that excluded people of color from programs that helped americans build wealth and pass it down through the generations. as code switch writes: segregation and redlining by banks made it impossible for many black and latino families to secure mortgages, for example. the gi bill, which helped establish an american middle class by helping veterans pay for college and buy homes after world war ii, mostly excluded people of color.\n\none goal of his experiment, says wey, is to get people to think about how the racial wealth and income gaps affect their own lives and also how they can as individuals be a force for change.\n\nwe think of this as a systemic issue, like something that happens outside of ourselves, when in fact the aggregate sum of all of our actions and choices exacerbates or ameliorates the wealth gap, says wey. that includes actions like where we choose to send our children to school, where we choose to buy a home and critically, how we choose to spend our money and where we choose to spend our money. 
what should we be teaching young children?\n\nenlarge this image brauns/getty images brauns/getty images\n\nearly-childhood and elementary school programs reflect a diverse set of commitments about what children ought to learn, and about how they ought to do so.\n\nsome focus on academic preparation and advancement, with extra attention to reading and mathematics. some emphasize social-emotional development and community values. others tout their language classes, or their music program, or the opportunities for children to engage in extended projects of their choosing. some praise structure and discipline; some prize autonomy and play.\n\nalongside this profusion of options is a rich diet of advice: parenting books, articles, facebook groups, and friends who swear by one approach or another. for the most part, though, these conversations miss an important question: not just what to learn and how to learn it, but when to do so. in other words, what should young children be learning while young? what's the argument for learning a particular skill sooner rather than later?\n\nyes, there are discussions about what's developmentally appropriate for children of different ages. and there are discussions about what's valuable to know at any age. but what, specifically, should a child learn now? are there good reasons to teach reading in kindergarten rather than in 2nd grade, or to expose children to music as toddlers rather than teenagers? why not wait until children are more mature, and better at engaging in structured study? beyond the basic premise that we shouldn't teach children something before it's developmentally appropriate to do so, are there general principles that govern what's valuable to learn sooner rather than later? and might recognizing such principles transform the way we think about early-childhood education?\n\nof course, educators and curriculum developers ask themselves these questions all the time — they're the ones deciding what to teach, and how and when to go about doing so. organizations like the national association for the education of young children, for example, have articulated principles of child development and learning, and different educational philosophies embody their own commitments. if we started from these general principles, though, rather than preconceived notions of what formal education ought to look like, might we arrive at very different views about the value of emphasizing social-emotional development versus geography, or music versus mathematics?\n\nbelow, i offer four guiding principles for resolving the early in early-childhood education — that is, for deciding what's worth learning sooner rather than later. these are not meant to be exhaustive, and i'm certainly not the first to suggest ideas along these lines. i offer them as a cognitive psychologist who studies learning, and as a parent who has thought about the question of when alongside the what and the how. i offer them to add fuel to ongoing conversations about whether we're teaching young children the right things.\n\n#1 capitalize on sensitive periods. research suggests that many organisms have sensitive periods for learning — windows of opportunity during which the right kind of environmental input can have an impact that won't occur at all, or in the same way, outside of that window. some of the most dramatic examples come from birds: a greylag goose will imprint on its mother (or on a suitable alternative) in a critical period hours after it hatches.\n\nhumans, too, seem to have sensitive periods, with language learning among the most studied. when learning a second language, for example, a child's age of exposure (up to puberty) predicts proficiency as an adult, even when total exposure is taken into account. similarly, when it comes to music, musicians who are trained early, versus late, perform better on various tasks, even when their total musical experience is equated. for these domains, at least, we have evidence that early exposure is beneficial, and there are surely many more.\n\n#2 create snowballs. sometimes, an early gain can snowball into a greater final outcome. money provides an easy illustration. two people who start out with different amounts of money might see the discrepancy in their wealth magnified over time as the richer party capitalizes on the opportunities afforded by their wealth: investments that pay off; education that opens doors; and so on. as the saying goes, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer — a phenomenon also known as the matthew effect. in such cases, it pays to bring about initial gains; a numerically comparable boost that occurs later in time is likely to make a smaller difference to the final outcome. for processes that snowball, there's a good argument for early learning.\n\nbut is learning really like money? in some domains it seems to be. for instance, there's evidence that children with larger vocabularies learn new words more readily than those with smaller vocabularies, as a result of which the gap between them can grow, rather than shrink, over time. and verbal abilities aren't just important because they beget further verbal abilities; they're important because they make new kinds of social interactions and information gathering possible. as with sensitive periods, targeting phenomena that snowball means that education can have a greater impact.\n\n#3 think about the present. sensitive periods and snowballs are important because they're investments in the future. by timing things just right, some future reward will be greater. but there's also something to be said for a child's experience in the short term — today and tomorrow and the next day. skills like emotion regulation, for example, may or may not involve sensitive periods or snowball over time (perhaps there's research that can tell us). but they can sure help a child deal with 3rd grade. some things are worth learning whether or not they improve the future; it's enough that they improve the present.\n\n#4 meet deadlines. some skills are important to acquire early because they're prerequisites to meeting a later goal. if you want a child to grow to be an independent, responsible, and kind adult, you can't start teaching the building blocks at age 17. some things need to start sooner because that's the only way to meet the deadline — the time by which the relevant knowledge or capacity needs to be more or less in place.\n\nnote that this is true whether or not earlier learning brings other rewards, such as feeding into a sensitive period, starting a snowball, or improving the child's immediate experience. and note that these other processes can impose their own deadlines: if being a proficient reader can snowball other kinds of learning in the grade school years, then achieving that proficiency imposes a deadline that might justify introducing key building blocks in advance. i'm going to speculate, for example, that teaching phonemic awareness to young children doesn't lead to deeper friendships or greater happiness (though i could be wrong). what it does do is set children up to be better readers and writers when those skills really start to matter.\n\nwould taking these four principles to heart change what happens in most preschools or grade-school classrooms?\n\nthe unsatisfying but honest answer is: it depends. these principles would need to be combined with a lot more information to yield any verdicts. we'd need to consult relevant scientific research (on sensitive periods, for example), and we'd need to know how different learning outcomes are valued relative to one another. we'd also need to recognize that individual children vary, as do their communities.\n\nbut my guess is that with all of this information in place, we'd find that there's a strong case to be made for easing off on some standard academic content in favor of foreign languages, music, social-emotional skills, and various forms of communication, including reading and writing. many things can be learned just as well later; it makes sense to focus on the ones that really need to be early.\n\ntania lombrozo is a psychology professor at the university of california, berkeley. she writes about psychology, cognitive science and philosophy, with occasional forays into parenting and veganism. you can keep up with more of what she is thinking on twitter: @tanialombrozo
trump still considering national emergency declaration as shutdown negotiations continue\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nthe government shutdown over the border wall continues. here this morning to talk about the political action or lack thereof is npr's mara liasson.\n\nhi, mara.\n\nmara liasson, byline: hi, lulu.\n\ngarcia-navarro: ok. so, mara, last night, the president called into judge jeanine pirro's show on fox news. and we'll talk russia elsewhere in the show. but he said about the shutdown that he was still thinking about declaring a national emergency. is that still a plan?\n\nliasson: well, like everything else about trump and the shutdown, it's unclear. he's been ping-ponging around this issue. sometimes, he says he definitely would declare a state of emergency. other times, he's said he's not in any rush. but that endgame of declaring a national emergency has been described to me by trump's advisers as the only plausible way out of this for him politically, a way for him to keep faith with his base, show him - show them he's fighting, even if he's stymied in the courts.\n\nand this promise to build a wall or, really, do everything he can to build a wall has become the sun, moon and stars of his administration. it's really become the white whale. it's become the no. 1 priority. and he's gotten pretty sensitive about press coverage of how he's handling this issue. he tweeted that the fake news washington post said he didn't have a plan. but he says, i have a plan. but to understand the plan, you have to understand that i won the election.\n\nthe promise with that - problem with that is he did win the 2016 election. but he lost the 2018 election, and he really hasn't absorbed the changes that that's brought. he also tweeted, quote, there's almost nobody in the white house but me. and i think that really sums it up. it's just him, almost all by himself, making it up as he goes along.\n\ngarcia-navarro: do we know where he's landed on declaring a state of emergency? you're describing this sort of back and forth. but do we know where his head's at?\n\nliasson: it seems that he's saying, i will do it if i can't get a deal. but the waffling around this is happening because some of his advisers say it's not a good idea. it's going to be tied up in the courts. the republicans in congress are split on this. some republicans say it would usurp congress's power of the purse. others say it's a terrible precedent because a future democratic president could declare a state of emergency around gun safety or health care or climate change.\n\nbut other republicans on the hill privately would be thankful for the president to take this whole issue off their laps because if he does declare a state of emergency, he would, presumably, have to open the government.\n\ngarcia-navarro: all right. so where do we stand on the negotiations right now?\n\nliasson: nowhere. we're nowhere. negotiations usually have a couple things associated with them - first of all, round the clock talks, a willingness for both sides to find a deal where both sides would win or maybe a creative solution that makes the problem bigger, like exchanging a path to citizenship for the dreamers with $25 billion for a wall. that was a deal that was tentatively made over a year ago, but trump walked away from that.\n\nthe other reason we're not anywhere is that mitch mcconnell, the senate republican leader, is nowhere to be seen. he is the guy who, in the past, has gotten presidents out of a lot of tight corners. he thinks of creative solutions.\n\nbut don't forget; this whole shutdown started when mcconnell passed - unanimously - a compromise bill through the senate for - to open the government not fund the wall. trump originally said he would sign it. then trump changed his mind, and the shutdown happened. and now mcconnell says he's not going to put anything on the floor of the senate if the president won't sign it.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and nancy pelosi, of course, is in puerto rico. so it's not like, you know, she's here right now talking to the president either. so i guess, you know, this leaves him taking his case to the american people. he tried to do that when he actually went and gave an address in the oval office. did that move the needle?\n\nliasson: it doesn't seem like he's moved the needle. he did a lot of things - oval office address, trip to the border, a lot of interviews. the latest polling we have is a washington post/abc news poll that shows by a very wide margin - 53 to 29 percent - more americans blame president trump and the republicans in congress for the shutdown rather than democrats.\n\none thing that has happened in the polling is that the border wall has gotten a little bit more popular. it's still net unpopular right now. forty-two percent of people say they support a wall. that's up from 34 percent a year ago. but 54 percent oppose the idea, down from 63 percent a year ago.\n\nand the other thing we see is that he hasn't been able to convince americans that there's actually a crisis on the border. that hasn't worked mostly because the people who are coming across are applying for asylum. that's a legal process, and it wouldn't be stopped by a wall.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's npr's mara liasson. thank you so much.\n\nliasson: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
oil production fuels earthquake surge in oklahoma\n\naudie cornish, host:\n\nwith the way things have been going in oklahoma, this didn't come as a surprise. the state opened 2016 with a 4.2-magnitude earthquake this morning. there have been at least a dozen earthquakes in the state just since tuesday. now, for all of 2015, oklahoma saw more than 800 earthquakes at magnitude 3.0 or greater. this is not the way it used to be. regulators and researchers say the rise in quakes is due to oil and gas production that involves re-injecting vast amounts of salty water into the earth. to talk more, we turn to todd halihan. he's a professor in the school of geology at oklahoma state. welcome to the program, todd.\n\ntodd halihan: thanks.\n\ncornish: so what can you tell us about today's quake? i understand it happened about 15 miles outside of oklahoma city.\n\nhalihan: right, so we've had a lot of seismicity that's happened out in rural areas, and the folks in the rural areas don't appreciate it very much. but we've had a couple recently right underneath edmond, which is one of our very populated areas with a lot of people sitting on top of it. so it's made a lot of press lately.\n\ncornish: we mentioned earlier about the quakes being connected to oil and gas production. obviously, people have heard about fracking. can you help us understand how this works? what's causing the quakes?\n\nhalihan: so when you're producing oil and gas, you're actually pumping a water well, and you happen to get some oil and gas out of it. and so in some formations, you get mostly oil, which is a great thing to do. in ours, you're getting about 10 gallons of water per gallon of oil. and then you have this leftover salty water that you can't do much with. it's much saltier than ocean water, and so the only choice that they found was we could put it down to depth and dispose of it. that process, for a very long time, has worked very, very effectively. but in the modern day with higher volumes and higher rates, it's caused seismicity. for us, that's not been something we've had to deal with previously until a few years ago.\n\ncornish: so what steps has the state taken to try and counter this pattern? what are they asking the companies to do differently?\n\nhalihan: so when they design an injection well, it's designed to protect the fresh water up above and keep it from coming into the surface or coming into groundwater where people are drinking. when you design for seismicity, you want to design to protect the well from the water going down below where you're injecting. and so they've done a lot of changes to the wells to try to prevent water from getting down into the - what we call the granitic basement and finding faults down there that it can lubricate and move. and so that change from protecting the upper part of the well to changing the lower part of the well - they put out some mandates saying, we'd like you to modify your wells in these ways if you're in the seismically active areas.\n\ncornish: are there any seismologists or researchers out there who still say that the link isn't strong enough - who are denying a connection?\n\nhalihan: there are still some people that the pattern for this type of activity is not a really clean one. it's not, hey, there's an injection well, and you made an earthquake right next to it. it's that there's an injection well, and miles away, there's an earthquake. and so the pattern isn't really simple. and in okla., if you're miles away from an injection well, you're close to another injection well. and so figuring out what caused it and where - that pattern isn't simple. it's really difficult to say, yes, we're really, really certain about this and that. but what you can check is when the rates have been lowered or wells have been shut in, seismicity has dropped, so that's a pretty good indicator that there's that nice connection where you see that those changes and injection have resulted in less seismicity in some areas.\n\ncornish: what does this mean for states who are watching okla. and try to figure out how to regulate this kind of activity in their communities?\n\nhalihan: well, one of the tricks is - is that you need to get the technical components out in the front. and that's been done in the airline industry. and i talk about if you have a plane crash, they don't want that to happen, but there's a neutral technical group that can look at that and make a call on it. it's difficult in the oil industry because there's not that neutral ref to say, what's the next step? and so i think what we're going to be looking at is, how do we properly address these problems so the public is comfortable, but the energy industry can operate with some certainty? and that balance is something that's difficult in the energy industry because there's no referee.\n\ncornish: todd halihan is a professor in the school of geology at oklahoma state. thank you so much for speaking with us.\n\nhalihan: thanks for having me.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
alabama sheriff legally took $750,000 meant to feed inmates, bought beach house\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption brynn anderson/ap brynn anderson/ap\n\na sheriff in alabama took home as personal profit more than $750,000 that was budgeted to feed jail inmates — and then purchased a $740,000 beach house, a reporter at the birmingham news found.\n\nand it's perfectly legal in alabama, according to state law and local officials.\n\nalabama has a depression-era law that allows sheriffs to keep and retain unspent money from jail food-provision accounts. sheriffs across the state take excess money as personal income — and, in the event of a shortfall, are personally liable for covering the gap.\n\netowah county sheriff todd entrekin told the news that he follows that practice of taking extra money from the fund, saying, the law says it's a personal account and that's the way i've always done it.\n\nsheriffs across the state do the same thing and have for decades. but the scale of the practice is not clear: it is presently unknown how much money sheriffs across the state have taken because most do not report it as income on state financial disclosure forms, the southern center for human rights wrote in january.\n\nbut in etowah county, the news found the paper trail.\n\n'following the letter of the law'\n\nthe news discovered the eye-popping figures on ethics disclosures that entrekin sent to the state: over the course of three years, he received more than $750,000 in extra compensation from food provisions. the exact amount over $750,000 is unclear, because entrekin was not required to specify above a $250,000 a year threshold, the paper writes.\n\nthe paper also found that entrekin and his wife own several properties worth a combined $1.7 million, including a $740,000 four-bedroom house in orange beach, ala., purchased in september.\n\nwithout the provision funds, entrekin earns a little more than $93,000 a year, the paper says.\n\nin a statement emailed to npr, entrekin said the liberal media has began attacking me for following the letter of the law.\n\nfrom the archives 2009: ala. sheriff jailed for starving inmates ala. sherriff jailed for starving inmates listen\n\nthe food bill is a controversial issue that's used every election cycle to attack the sheriff's office, entrekin said. alabama law is clear regarding my personal financial responsibilities of feeding inmates. until the legislature acts otherwise, the sheriff must follow the current law.\n\nbefore he made headlines for profiting off the law, entrekin was better known for being indebted by it.\n\nwhen entrekin's predecessor died while still in office, all the money in the food provision account went to his estate — as state law dictated, a county official told npr. entrekin had to borrow $150,000 to keep the inmates fed. he was paying down that debt for years, the gadsden times reported.\n\nin 2009, while he was still in debt from paying for inmates' food, entrekin told the times that he personally thought the law needed to be changed. but he noted that it might cost more money for taxpayers if the county commission had to manage jail kitchens through an open bid process.\n\ndavid akins, the chief administrative officer of the etowah county commission, agrees with that assessment. he says the commission is not eager to take on that duty, as some other local governments have done.\n\nthe sheriff can feed inmates cheaper than the county can, he said.\n\ninmate's diets, sheriff's responsibility\n\nalabama's controversial system hearkens back to a different era, when county jails were more of a mom and pop operation and feeding inmates was often the responsibility of a sheriff's wife.\n\ntoday in alabama, sheriffs are personally responsible for feeding inmates in their jails and receive funds to cover the cost. for state inmates, it's less than $2 per inmate per day; for county, city or federal inmates, the amount can be higher.\n\nif sheriffs feed inmates on less than that, they can keep and retain whatever is left over.\n\nlawyer aaron littman, at the southern center for human rights, said in a january statement that the practice of pocketing leftover funds was a dubious interpretation of the law that raises grave ethical concerns, invites public corruption, and creates a perverse incentive to spend as little as possible on feeding people who are in jail. he argues the sheriffs are supposed to manage the funds, not personally profit from them.\n\nbut local governments across the state say the law is clear that the money can be kept for personal use.\n\nthat's the way it was set up years ago, akins from the etowah county commission tells npr. that's just the way it's been in the state. ... of course, state legislators could always change that if they wanted to.\n\nhe doesn't see a problem with the practice.\n\ni think if the inmates were not being fed properly, it might be a concern, he said. but i'll guarantee you that if they're not fed properly, the federal government would let us know about it.\n\n'sheriff corn dog' and bankrupt car lots\n\nin some cases, the federal government has objected.\n\nin 2009, then-sheriff greg bartlett of morgan county was briefly tossed in jail after acknowledging that he had personally profited, to the tune of $212,000, from a surplus in the jail-food account. prisoners testified about receiving meager meals.\n\nto cut corners, bartlett used charitable donations and special deals, as cbs put it — including once splitting a $1,000 truck full of corn dogs with a sheriff of a nearby county and then feeding the inmates corn dogs twice a day for weeks.\n\nhe defended himself by noting that his profit was legal under state law, but an exasperated federal judge said the sheriff had an obligation to feed his inmates adequate food.\n\nthe story made national headlines, and bartlett agreed to no longer dip into the jail food fund.\n\nnewstime: alabama sheriff legally took $750,000 meant to feed inmates, bought beach house 5:10\n\nin 2015, a sheriff in morgan county loaned $150,000 from the inmate food fund to a corrupt car lot. the loan was revealed when the business, facing theft and scam charges, went bankrupt.\n\nagain, that sheriff's use of the food money was legal under state law; it was only prohibited in morgan county because of the county's particular history.\n\naside from individual lawsuits like those, it's hard to tell exactly how much money earmarked for inmate food is going to sheriffs.\n\nthis january, two advocacy groups sued for access to records that could reveal how much jail food money was being turned into personal profit. the groups said 49 sheriffs had refused to provide records of where funds were spent.\n\nthen in february, reporter connor sheets of the news began revealing entrekin's spending history and his ethics disclosures.\n\n'i put two and two together'\n\nsheets' investigation has also made headlines because of the arrest of a key source.\n\nsheets spoke with a landscaper named matt qualls who mowed entrekin's lawn in 2015 and noticed the name of the account on his checks — the sheriff todd entrekin food provision account. he shared pictures with sheets.\n\na couple people i knew came through the jail, and they say they got meat maybe once a month, and every other day, it was just beans and vegetables, qualls told sheets. i put two and two together and realized that that money could have gone toward some meat or something.\n\nsheets' initial story was published on feb. 18. on feb. 22, qualls was arrested and charged with drug trafficking after an anonymous call complained of the smell of marijuana from an apartment.\n\nqualls, who had never been arrested before, faces six charges and is being held on a $55,000 bond, sheets reports. he is detained in a jail that entrekin oversees.\n\nqualls was arrested by rainbow city police, not by the sheriff's department.\n\nthe etowah county drug enforcement unit added extra charges to his case, including a charge of drug trafficking, which the rainbow city police chief said was based on inaccurate weight calculations. (the unit counted 14 grams of pot, infused in five cups of butter, as more than than 1,000 grams worth of marijuana.)\n\npenalties for drug trafficking are extremely steep in alabama, where people have been imprisoned for life for the crime, sheets notes.\n\nthe sheriff's office denies involvement in qualls' case, noting that the landscaper was not arrested or charged by the sheriff's office. the extra charges were added by the drug enforcement unit, which consists of agents drawn from the sheriff's department, the fbi and other law enforcement agencies.
pro-trump crowd turns into violent mob, breaches u.s. capitol\n\none of the most shocking parts of wednesday's pro-trump mob attack on the u.s. capitol was just how quickly it all unfolded. we examine the historic, and troubling day.\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\nan assault on the united states capitol failed to prevent the confirmation of joe biden as the next president. early this morning, a little bit before 4 o'clock eastern time, congress formally finished counting the electoral votes, and vice president pence brought down the gavel to end the session. biden won the election, as previously affirmed by election officials from all 50 states and many courts. shortly afterward, the white house released a statement that conceivably represents a concession by president trump. the departing president promised a, quote, orderly transition on january 20, but he also referred to the end of his, quote, first term.\n\nshortly before the violence yesterday, the departing president incited a group of supporters outside the white house. he repeated the lie that he had won the election.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npresident donald trump: we will never give up. we will never concede. it doesn't happen. you don't concede when there's theft involved.\n\n(cheering)\n\ninskeep: he was speaking just before congress began its formality of counting the electoral votes. many republicans were honoring that democratic process. in november, senate republican leader mitch mcconnell had supported the president's baseless lawsuits. but yesterday, mcconnell said the challenges have failed.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nmitch mcconnell: president trump claims the election was stolen. the assertions range from specific local allegations to constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories.\n\ninskeep: mcconnell said all those assertions had failed, but some of his colleagues were moving to raise objections to democracy. senator james lankford of oklahoma was raising the first of those objections when he was interrupted.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\njames lankford: my challenge today is not about the good people of arizona.\n\n(soundbite of gavel banging)\n\nunidentified person #1: and it will stand in recess until the call of the chair.\n\ninskeep: the senate went into recess because lawmakers were soon taking cover. one democrat, house democrat dean phillips, yelled at his republican colleagues, this is because of you. lawmakers were forced to evacuate the capitol amid reports of shots fired. one person was killed.\n\nlast evening, lawmakers resumed deliberations, and several republicans backed off their baseless challenges. but republican josh hawley of missouri persisted.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\njosh hawley: for those who have concerns about the integrity of our elections, those who have concerns about what happened in november, this is the appropriate means. this is the lawful place where those objections and concerns should be heard.\n\ninskeep: hawley raised some. supporters of the defeated president did call for an audit of election results, to which republican mitt romney of utah said, no.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nmitt romney: i'd offer this perspective. no congressional audit is ever going to convince these voters, particularly when the president will continue to say that the election was stolen. the best way we can show respect for the voters who are upset is by telling them the truth.\n\ninskeep: early this morning, the vast majority of lawmakers voted to do so.\n\nso what was happening outside the chamber as lawmakers fled? npr's hannah allam was there and is on the line with us this morning. good morning.\n\nhannah allam, byline: hi, steve.\n\ninskeep: so how did the afternoon unfold?\n\nallam: it unfolded very quickly. we saw this massive swell of marchers kind of converge around 1 o'clock, around the time that, you know, congress was starting its discussion. and we just see this huge crush of people coming down pennsylvania avenue toward the capitol, a big contingent of the proud boys, a violent, far-right gang, sort of in the lead as a front-line force. they start rallying the crowd, chanting 1776.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified crowd: (chanting) 1776, 1776, 1776, 1776, 1776, 1776.\n\nallam: we follow the crowd as it goes up to the hill toward the capitol. there's scaffolding set up for the inauguration already, you know, stacks of folding chairs. but as far as protection, all we really saw were some mesh barriers and metal fencing and only a small contingent of capitol police. and we watched them being quickly overwhelmed.\n\nthey have pushed past the barriers.\n\nlauren hodges, byline: they're going up the steps.\n\nallam: pushed past the barriers. they're now going up the steps to the capitol. it's absolute pandemonium as far back as the eye can see.\n\n(soundbite of riot)\n\nunidentified crowd: (chanting) this is our house. this is our house. this is our house. this is our house.\n\nallam: cops are coming out very quickly. security is coming out to put up more barriers. it is definitely not going to stop...\n\n(soundbite of explosion, cheering)\n\nunidentified person #2: come on.\n\nunidentified person #3: here comes the tear gas.\n\nallam: so that really gives a sense of just how intense and chaotic the scene was. in some cases, you know, the police opened the gates. we also saw the mob trample and tear down barriers, climb up the scaffolding. there were booms from fireworks, paint guns, tear gas firing. people were running, shouting and celebrating.\n\nchris mcdermott: it is very chaotic. it's monumental, though. this is history.\n\nallam: that's what we heard a lot - you know, this is history. that was chris mcdermott. he says he came from pennsylvania to support the president, but he was actually uncomfortable with how dangerous it was getting. and he said he didn't want to see things turn more violent.\n\nmcdermott: this is not setting a good example. i don't want it to escalate. no, not at all.\n\nallam: but i have to say, he was in the minority.\n\ninskeep: what was the majority saying?\n\nallam: more common in the crowd were overt calls for executing democrats, targeting journalists, antifa, black lives matter activists. we spoke to one writer from ohio who'd only give his name as joe. a warning here that what he says is graphic and violent, but this is what he wanted to see.\n\njoe: the people in this house who stole this election from us hanging from a gallow out here in this lawn for the whole world to see so it never happens again - that's what needs to happen, four by four by four hanging from a rope out here for treason.\n\nallam: so just a lot of chilling rhetoric like that, people everywhere, you can barely move and, again, very minimal security presence. and we could hear the mob start to bang on the doors and just really looking for any way into that building.\n\n(soundbite of riot)\n\nunidentified person #4: (shouting) let us in or we're coming in (laughter).\n\nallam: and as we've all seen by now, what happened next - they rampaged through the halls of the capitol and for the most part were allowed to leave of their own accord.\n\ninskeep: hannah, i want to ask one other question. i'm just thinking about what these protesters are trying to do. they're trying to overturn a democratic election. they're trying to keep president trump in power. this is a president who was so uninterested in a second term, he didn't even put out a platform for what he would do. and they engaged in this operation, which utterly failed to change the result of the presidential election. at dinner last night, i got a question from a 15-year-old. i'd like to put it to you. what did they think they were going to accomplish?\n\nallam: good question, because there were - there was no clear objective beyond somehow stopping the certification. the president offered them no plan beyond what he said before, sort of fight like hell. and so you heard, you know, answers from people saying they wanted to force a whole new election to the most extreme who saw it as an opening shot in a wider rebellion of trump supporters.\n\ninskeep: wider rebellion. ok. thanks very much, hannah, really appreciate it.\n\nallam: thank you.\n\ninskeep: that's npr national security correspondent hannah allam.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further

trump epa erects new barriers to crucial science\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption dkar images/getty images dkar images/getty images\n\nthe environmental protection agency adopted a new rule restricting the types of scientific studies its own regulators can use to rein in pollution, in the trump administration's latest effort to undercut the use of science in establishing public health standards.\n\nthe rule goes into effect on wednesday and applies to all future epa regulations. it puts a premium on scientific studies that are based on underlying data that is available to other scientists or to the public. studies that do not meet that standard, which could include major epidemiological studies, will be given less weight by regulators unless the head of the epa personally intervenes. the rule also requires that the agency disclose which studies it uses to set future pollution limits.\n\nthe american public deserves to know which studies we are using to craft our regulations, which of those studies are key or pivotal to our decisions and, to the extent possible, that data should be available for the public to see, epa administrator andrew wheeler said in an announcement about the rule. the event was hosted by the conservative think tank the competitive enterprise institute.\n\nthe epa contends that the rule will improve public trust in environmental regulations by letting people know more about the data that regulators use to make their decisions about air and water pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions. these cause climate change and particle pollution that can exacerbate chronic diseases that make people more susceptible to severe covid-19.\n\nbut many scientists and public health groups warn that the new approach will instead put the health of americans at risk by excluding rigorous studies.\n\nthis rule will enable the exclusion of highly relevant scientific evidence from the policymaking process, sudip parikh, chief executive of the national science advocacy group american association for the advancement of science, wrote in an email. parikh argues that the rule directly impedes [the epa's] ability to use the best data and evidence in its mission to protect human health and the environment.\n\nepidemiological studies that examine the relationship between pollution and health sometimes rely on massive amounts of medical data that is anonymized or kept confidential in order to protect the privacy of study participants. however, rigorous scientific studies are reviewed by multiple experts in the field before publication and that peer-review process includes an examination of how the underlying data was analyzed.\n\ngiven the rigor of the modern scientific review process, the epa's own internal board of scientific advisers raised questions about the new rule. when the board reviewed an earlier draft of the new rule last year, they noted that there is already a trend among scientists toward making data publicly available when it's possible to do so without compromising confidentiality. the epa advisers said that the new rule could decrease efficiency and reduce scientific integrity.\n\nthis is the latest in a string of controversial decisions the epa has made in the final stretch of president trump's administration. in december, the agency decided not to strengthen air quality standards for ozone and soot, and it enacted a new rule that requires future clean air regulations to weigh economic costs of curbing pollution while ignoring benefits, such as the deaths that could be avoided.\n\namerican lung association chief executive harold wimmer calls the new science rule a dangerous step in the wrong direction — one that threatens the integrity and use of the best science, and consequently threatens our health and lives.\n\nlast year, the association co-signed a letter opposing the new rule, along with more than 50 medical, environmental and scientific groups including the american medical association, the american heart association and the american public health association.\n\nit has no merits from the standpoint of science or transparency, and it will make it vastly harder for the agency to do its job of protecting public health and the environment, andrew rosenberg of the union of concerned scientists, a national science advocacy group, wrote in an email after the final rule was announced. the damage will fall hardest on black, latinx and indigenous communities who already bear disproportionate harms from environmental hazards in the air, water and soil.\n\nthe biden administration could remove or rewrite the rule, but it would take months, if not years. because the rule gives the epa administrator the power to override the limits on which scientific studies epa regulators can use, the incoming administration could essentially sidestep the rule while it works to undo it.
ancient human remains document migration from asia to america\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption eric s. carlson and ben a. potter/nature eric s. carlson and ben a. potter/nature\n\nin alaska, scientists have uncovered something they say is remarkable: the remains of two infants dating back more than 11,000 years.\n\ntheir discovery is evidence of the earliest wave of migration into the americas.\n\nit's incredibly rare, says ben potter, an archaeologist at the university of alaska who is among the researchers on the project, at a site called upward sun river in central alaska. we only have a handful of human remains that are this old in the entire western hemisphere. the findings were published wednesday by the journal nature.\n\nthe remains were in such good condition that geneticists were able to extract dna from one of them. they compared the sample with the genes of people from around the world.\n\nthey conclude that the ancestors of these infants started out in east asia about 35,000 years ago. as they traveled east, they became genetically isolated from other asians. at some point during the last ice age they crossed a frozen land bridge from siberia to alaska called beringia.\n\npotter says during this great migration, either before or after they crossed the land bridge, this group (which the researchers call the founding population for all native americans) split again, into two populations. scientists had suspected this and surmised that one group stayed put in and around beringia. they call them ancient beringians.\n\nthe two infants are the first hard evidence that they did indeed do that.\n\nthe ice age was still on, but these people hunkered down and made the best of what was there in this arid, frigid landscape, says potter. bison, horses, mammoth. big grazers were very common.\n\nthe other group moved down into north and south america and are believed to be the direct ancestors of current native americans.\n\ndavid reich, a geneticist at harvard university who studies ancient dna, says genetic material like this tells a more detailed story of how people came to america, but not the whole story. there were presumably many related populations like this, he says, one of which split to form these two lineages that have diversified into native americans today.\n\nthat group, the one that moved south, eventually spread far and wide: up into canada, the east and throughout central and south america. their descendants are the native americans of today.\n\ntwo native american groups cooperated with the researchers in the excavation in alaska.\n\nfor the beringians who stayed behind, potter says, it would have been a rough living as the last ice age drew to a close. they're dealing with climate change that we can only imagine now — major changes from [the] ice age, to extinction of a wide range of mammal species, including mammoth, he says. and these are the people that adapted in this region.\n\nfor a while at least. writing in nature, the researchers say the infant remains show the beringians lasted at least until about 11,500 years ago. how their end came is still unknown.
rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez releases green new deal outline\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption amr alfiky/npr amr alfiky/npr\n\nupdated 4:30 p.m.\n\nwhether it's a deadly cold snap or a hole under an antarctic glacier or a terrifying new report, there seem to be constant reminders now of the dangers that climate change poses to humanity.\n\npolitics ocasio-cortez talks about ambitious plan to combat climate change ocasio-cortez to unveil ambitious plan to combat climate change listen · 8:53 8:53\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., and sen. ed markey, d-mass., think they have a start to a solution. thursday they are introducing a framework defining what they call a green new deal — what they foresee as a massive policy package that would remake the u.s. economy and, they hope, eliminate all u.s. carbon emissions.\n\nthat's a really big — potentially impossibly big — undertaking.\n\neven the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, ocasio-cortez told npr's steve inskeep in an interview that aired thursday on morning edition.\n\nshe added: it could be part of a larger solution, but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. and so that's really what we're trying to accomplish with the green new deal.\n\nwhat is the green new deal?\n\nin very broad strokes, the green new deal legislation laid out by ocasio-cortez and markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy, from electricity generation to transportation to agriculture. in the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy.\n\nin that vein, the proposal stresses that it aims to meet its ambitious goals while paying special attention to groups like the poor, disabled and minority communities that might be disproportionately affected by massive economic transitions like those the green new deal calls for.\n\nimportantly, it's a nonbinding resolution, meaning that even if it were to pass (more on the challenges to that below), it wouldn't itself create any new programs. instead, it would potentially affirm the sense of the house that these things should be done in the coming years.\n\nlawmakers pass nonbinding resolutions for things as simple as congratulating super bowl winners, as well as to send political messages — for example, telling the president they disapprove of his trade policies, as the senate did in summer 2018.\n\nwhat are the specifics of that framework?\n\nthe bill calls for a 10-year national mobilizations toward accomplishing a series of goals that the resolution lays out.\n\n(note: ocasio-cortez's office released an updated version of the bill on thursday. the earlier version, which we had included in a prior version of this story, is still available here.)\n\namong the most prominent, the deal calls for meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the united states through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources. the ultimate goal is to stop using fossil fuels entirely, ocasio-cortez's office told npr, as well as to transition away from nuclear energy.\n\nin addition, the framework, as described in the legislation as well as a blog post — containing an updated version of faqs provided to npr by ocasio-cortez's office — calls for a variety of other lofty goals:\n\nupgrading all existing buildings in the country for energy efficiency;\n\nworking with farmers to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions ... as much as is technologically feasible (while supporting family farms and promoting universal access to healthy food);\n\noverhauling transportation systems to reduce emissions — including expanding electric car manufacturing, building charging stations everywhere, and expanding high-speed rail to a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary;\n\na guaranteed job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations and retirement security for every american;\n\nhigh-quality health care for all americans.\n\nwhich is to say: the green new deal framework combines big climate-change-related ideas with a wish list of progressive economic proposals that, taken together, would touch nearly every american and overhaul the economy.\n\nare those ideas doable?\n\nmany in the climate science community, as well as green new deal proponents, agree that saving the world from disastrous effects of climate change requires aggressive action.\n\nand some of the green new deal's goals are indeed aggressive. for example, ocasio-cortez told npr that in 10 years, we're trying to go carbon-neutral.\n\naccording to jesse jenkins, a postdoctoral environmental fellow at harvard's kennedy school, that may be an unreachable goal.\n\nwhere we need to be targeting really is a net-zero carbon economy by about 2050, which itself is an enormous challenge and will require reductions in carbon emissions much faster than have been achieved historically, he said. 2030 might be a little bit early to be targeting.\n\nsimilarly, removing combustible engines from the roads or expanding high-speed rail to largely eliminate air travel would require nothing short of revolutionizing transportation.\n\nlikewise, some of the more progressive economic policies — universal health care and a job guarantee, for example — while popular among some democrats, would also be very difficult to implement and transition into.\n\non top of all that, implementing all of these policies could cost trillions upon trillions of dollars.\n\naltogether, the green new deal is a loose framework. it does not lay out guidance on how to implement these policies.\n\nrather, the idea is that ocasio-cortez and markey will begin work immediately on green new deal bills to put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this resolution.\n\nand again, all of this is hypothetical — it would be tough to implement and potentially extremely expensive ... if it passed.\n\nso did the idea of a green new deal start with ocasio-cortez?\n\nnot at all.\n\npolitics congressional democrats say climate change is a priority as they control the house congressional democrats say climate change is a priority as they control the house listen · 3:20 3:20\n\nwhile the green new deal has in the last year or so grown central to progressive democrats' policy conversations, the idea of a green new deal itself is well over a decade old. environmentalists were talking about it as far back as 2003, when the term popped up in a san francisco chronicle article about an environmentalist conference.\n\nit gained traction with a 2007 new york times column from thomas friedman, where he used the phrase to describe the scope of energy investments he thought would be necessary to slow climate change on a large scale.\n\nthe phrase was also used around president barack obama's 2009 stimulus, which had around $90 billion worth of environmental initiatives.\n\nwhile the idea gained some currency in europe and also in the green party, it wasn't until after the 2016 election that it really gained broad popularity on the left in the u.s. (vox's dave roberts has a more thorough history here).\n\nthis latest iteration is different both in the political energy that it has amassed and the grand scope it is taking. while it was a product of the progressive activist community, ocasio-cortez has been perhaps the most visible proponent of the plan and has helped it gain nationwide attention.\n\nso will it pass?\n\nthat looks unlikely.\n\nyes, there's some energy for it on the left — some house democrats have already said they will support the bill. however, there are indications house leadership isn't prioritizing the idea as much as those more liberal democrats would like — speaker nancy pelosi frustrated green new deal proponents by not giving them the kind of committee they wanted to put the policies together.\n\nafter the deal's thursday release, she also cast the plan as simply one of any number of environmental proposals the house might consider.\n\nit will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive, pelosi told politico. the green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?\n\nin addition, it's easy to see how the bill could be dangerous for moderate house democrats, many of whom come from swing districts and may be loath to touch such a progressive proposal.\n\namong republicans — even those worried about climate change — the package, with its liberal economic ideas, will also likely be a nonstarter.\n\nsomeone's going to have to prove to me how that can be accomplished because it looks to me like for the foreseeable future we're gonna be using a substantial amount of fossil fuels, said rep. francis rooney, r-fla., co-chair of the bipartisan climate solutions caucus, speaking to npr before the green new deal's text was released.\n\nfor his part, rooney is in favor of a carbon tax, a policy he helped propose with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in november. information from ocasio-cortez's office says that the green new deal could include a carbon tax, but that it would be a tiny part of the total package of policies.\n\nmeanwhile, there's little chance of a green new deal getting a vote in the republican-controlled senate.\n\nif it's not going to pass and it's not even binding, why is it worth even talking about?\n\nit's worth talking about because it already is a politically powerful idea among democrats.\n\nalready, presidential candidates are being asked whether they support the idea of a green new deal, meaning it's easy to see the issue becoming a litmus test for some voters in both the 2020 congressional elections and the presidential election.\n\nto more liberal democrats, the prospect of such an ambitious economic and environmental package at the center of the 2020 campaign may be particularly energizing.\n\ni think it's like a really weird instinct that the democratic party develops to not be exciting intentionally, said sean mcelwee, co-founder of the progressive think tank data for progress. most of politics is getting people excited enough to show up and vote for you. and i think that a green new deal and medicare-for-all — these are ideas that are big enough to get people excited and show up to vote for you.\n\nfor her part, ocasio-cortez says that a policy like the green new deal could get voters excited enough to pressure their congress members to support it.\n\ni do think that when there's a wide spectrum of debate on an issue, that is where the public plays a role. that is where the public needs to call their member of congress and say, 'this is something that i care about,'  she told npr, adding, where i do have trust is in my colleagues' capacity to change and evolve and be adaptable and listen to their constituents.\n\nthat said, it's easy to see how a green new deal litmus test could backfire on that front, endangering some democrats — particularly in swing districts.\n\nbut it's not just about national politics. the national-level energy for a green new deal could boost efforts in cities and states. new york gov. andrew cuomo, for example, has been pushing a green new deal in his state.\n\naside from the politics, there's the fact that climate change remains an impending threat — one for which the world has yet to come up with a fix.\n\nit's a big legislation because it's a huge [expletive] problem! we're all going to die, said mcelwee. every week it seems like the risks of climate change become more real, and the amount of devastation it is going to wreak upon humanity becomes larger, and that means we have to do bigger things.
how california's worst oil spill turned beaches black and the nation green\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bettmann/getty images bettmann/getty images\n\non january 28, 1969, an oil well off the coast of santa barbara, calif., experienced a blowout. the result was an oil spill that at the time ranked as the largest in u.s. waters.\n\nthe disaster, which made headlines across the nation, helped create the modern environmental movement. it also led to restrictions on offshore drilling — restrictions the trump administration is trying to loosen.\n\nthe events that led to the spill began one morning on platform a, a rig located about six miles from the coast and operated at the time by union oil.\n\nworkers had already drilled four wells from the platform and were drilling a fifth when they ran into a problem.\n\nyou punch into some of these oil reservoirs and you get a lot of back pressure, says douglas mccauley, a marine biologist at the university of california, santa barbara.\n\nmccauley has brought me out to platform a on a boat, which circles the rig as he talks.\n\nhe tells me that in this case, the back pressure overwhelmed the well's safety systems. this allowed crude oil and natural gas trapped thousands of feet down to rocket toward the surface.\n\nso they're taking these big drilling pipes and shoving them back down the hole and these gigantic steel blocks on top of that to seal off this blowout, mccauley says. it worked, but only for a few minutes.\n\nthey had capped off the blowout successfully, mccauley says. but they created so much pressure at the bottom of this well that it actually broke open the seabed.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jon hamilton/npr jon hamilton/npr\n\nbetter reinforcement of the well might have prevented the spill. but union oil had received a waiver from the government that allowed the company to drill without installing steel casing pipe to the depth usually required by federal regulations.\n\nunimpeded, oil and gas under tremendous pressure opened five separate gashes in the soft sandstone seabed. so much gas bubbled to the surface near platform a that the water appeared to boiling. and oil from the underwater fissures began to form a slick that would eventually cover an area nearly the size of chicago.\n\nthe effect on marine life was profound.\n\nright where we're sitting right now you transformed from this ecosystem of amazing richness, amazing biodiversity, amazing biological activity into a sort of armageddon of blackness, mccauley says.\n\nit took a few days for the oil to reach santa barbara's famous beaches.\n\ni smelled it long before i saw it; it really stank around here, says marc mcginnes, a lawyer who came down from san francisco. and when i looked at the oil on the beach, i cried.\n\nmcginnes left his job at a big law firm to help launch a legal response to the spill. he would go on to become a key figure in the environmental efforts that grew out the event as well as a faculty member at ucsb.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ap ap\n\nthe spill received enough media attention that president richard nixon made a trip to survey the damage in a helicopter. he also visited an oil-soaked beach near santa barbara harbor.\n\nnixon spent his time on the beach walking around gingerly to avoid stepping on the sticky blobs of oil, mcginnes says.\n\nthe oil killed thousands of birds and an unknown number of sea mammals. hundreds of oiled birds that were still alive were taken to the santa barbara zoo, which is just a few steps from the beach.\n\nat the time there was really no place or process to care for the oiled wildlife that was showing up on the beaches, says nancy mctoldridge, the zoo's director. so the zoo closed its doors and concentrated its time and energy into taking in these oiled birds, treating them and then rehabbing them back out into the wild.\n\nthe suffering and deaths of so many animals helped get the public's attention and spur lawmakers to action. and 1969 marked a turning point for environmental activism.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bettmann/getty images bettmann/getty images\n\nthe santa barbara oil spill really helped to take an issue that was growing and really convert it into legislative action and a whole body of environmental law at the federal level and also at the state level that we still have with us today, says peter alagona, a historian at ucsb.\n\nthe first earth day took place just over a year later in april of 1970. the environmental protection agency was created in december of that year. environmental laws passed or strengthened during this period included the clean air, clean water and endangered species acts.\n\none reason the 1969 oil spill had such an impact was that santa barbara was home to a lot of wealthy republicans who had helped elect nixon, alagona says.\n\nnixon himself was no environmentalist, alagona says, but he realized during a time when there were many other extremely controversial, divisive issues like the vietnam war for instance, that as american public concern grew about damage to the environment that this could potentially be a winning issue for him.\n\nso nixon signed the environmental legislation, even though many in his own party opposed it.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption usgs usgs\n\ntoday, santa barbara is much better prepared for an oil spill than it was in 1969. there's a 46-foot fast-response vessel in the harbor. and animals exposed to oil are cared for by a statewide group called the oiled wildlife care network.\n\nthe response system got a test in 2015, when an oil pipeline burst a few miles up the coast. workers deployed thousands of feet of floating boom to help contain the spill and skimmer boats began removing the oil from the water's surface.\n\nmeanwhile, members of the oiled wildlife care network sprang into action, rescuing and caring for oiled animals. and those animals were more likely to survive than the ones oiled in 1969.\n\nmany more animals survive now than they would have back in the '60s or '70s or even the '80s, says julie barnes, a veterinarian and vice president for animal health and care at the santa barbara zoo.\n\nthat's partly because of what animal care experts learned from the santa barbara spill, barnes says. but they've learned even more from the exxon valdez spill in alaska in 1989 and the 2010 deepwater horizon spill in the gulf of mexico.\n\nit's got to the point that there's so many spills that for animals there's a highly organized system in place, barnes says.\n\nthese days, the greatest environmental danger from oil probably isn't another spill, mccauley says. it's the climate change caused by burning all that oil.\n\nsanta barbara got a preview of what that might mean a year ago, he says. it came in the form of a mudslide that careened through the community of montecito.\n\nthere were boulders and trees traveling at like 22 miles per hour down the street, mccauley says. it destroyed 100 houses and killed 21 people.\n\nit's difficult to peg any one incident to climate change. but the mudslide followed the sort of extreme weather thought to accompany global warming.\n\ni think of that as being the most insidious, the worst thing the oil industry has done to our community, mccauley says.\n\nan end to offshore drilling would help reduce the effects of climate change by reducing the supply of oil, he says.\n\nbut the trump administration seems headed in the other direction. the bureau of ocean energy management is preparing a five-year plan expected to greatly increase offshore drilling in federally controlled waters, including those off the coast of santa barbara.
why viruses mutate: breaking down the new coronavirus variant\n\nwith new variant in the coronavirus cropping up in several states, we take a look at how viruses mutate and how those mutations can make the coronavirus more contagious.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nmore than 20 million people have now been confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus in the united states. about 350,000 americans have died of covid-19. now health officials have detected the new variant of the virus first seen in the u.k. in california, colorado and florida. because it is believed to be more contagious than previous versions, there are concerns this could mean even more infections across the country. npr global health correspondent michaeleen doucleff joins us now. thanks so much for being with us.\n\nmichaeleen doucleff, byline: thank you, scott.\n\nsimon: i understand this version of the virus has a set of mutations in its genes. to try and understand it, where do those mutations come from?\n\ndoucleff: yeah. so this version has actually 17 mutations. and mutations in viruses crop up all the time when the virus grows inside a person, specifically when it reproduces and makes a bunch of copies of itself. i talked to bettie steinberg. she's a virologist at the feinstein institutes for medical research on long island. she says that to grow inside a person, the virus has to make copies of its genes.\n\nbettie steinberg: it's just like copying a manuscript. sometimes there's typos. the virus just makes random mistakes when it gets copied.\n\ndoucleff: in the vast majority of cases, these mistakes are harmless, or they even weaken the virus. but in rare instances, mutations can help the virus. they can give it this little boost or advantage over the other versions.\n\nsimon: so what's happened with this new variant? have the mutations - can they tell so far? - given the virus what amounts to an infectious advantage over the previous version?\n\ndoucleff: yeah. so scientists first detected this new variant, like you said, in the u.k. back in september. by december, it had become the dominant one in london. and it is responsible for the huge surge in cases there now. this variant has also spread to at least 32 other countries. and right now, here in the u.s., scientists think it's still pretty uncommon. but they believe that could change pretty fast, like in the next month or two, because they estimate the variant is about 50% more transmissible than the previous ones.\n\nsimon: and how does that happen? why would mutations make a virus more contagious?\n\ndoucleff: yeah. so they're not quite sure yet, but they have some data that is pointing to two main hypotheses. stephen goldstein studies virus evolution at the university of utah. he says that there's some evidence that the new variant generates more virus particles inside a person's nose or respiratory tract, possibly a lot more.\n\nstephen goldstein: when you expel virus when you talk or breathe, you're going to get more virus out than somebody who doesn't have this variant simply because you have more virus in you to begin with.\n\ndoucleff: the other hypothesis is that the new variant binds to human cells more easily, so people can get infected with lower doses of the virus.\n\nsimon: can this variant be stopped?\n\ndoucleff: well, the good news here, goldstein says, is that all the measures that we've been doing so far to stop the previous variants will stop this new one.\n\ngoldstein: it's not a new variant that can go through masks. those things will work, but it requires a greater level of rigor in the adherence to those things.\n\ndoucleff: for example, right now, if, say, only 80% of people in a community are following these guidelines, then to stop this new variant, you would need something like 90% or 95% of people to follow the guidelines. and all the scientists i spoke to say the vaccine needs to roll out as quickly as possible because, so far, scientists do believe that the vaccine will still be effective against this new version of the virus.\n\nsimon: npr's global health correspondent michaeleen doucleff, thanks so much for being with us.\n\ndoucleff: thank you, scott.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
n.y. bill would allow prosecution despite presidential pardon\n\nnpr's lulu garcia-navarro talks to former u.s. attorney joyce vance about a proposal to change new york's criminal code to allow the state to prosecute people already granted presidential pardons.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\npresident trump recently pardoned lewis scooter libby, the former chief of staff to vice president dick cheney who was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice in 2007. and yesterday, the president touted his power further, saying on twitter that he was considering a posthumous pardon of heavyweight boxer jack johnson. critics of the president have accused him of signaling that he may pardon his own associates, who are now under investigation.\n\nnew york attorney general eric schneiderman would like to have the power to prosecute any people the president may pardon. and so last week, he proposed to change the state's laws so that anyone pardoned will not be protected from being brought to court in new york. schneiderman and president trump have had business before. the new york ag led the investigation into trump university. that resulted in a $25 million settlement. trump, for his part, has called mr. schneiderman, quote, the nation's worst ag. but the proposal is complicated. and here to break it down for us - we're joined by former u.s. attorney of alabama joyce vance. welcome.\n\njoyce vance: hi, lulu.\n\ngarcia-navarro: what is the current new york law regarding prosecutions of people who've been pardoned for federal crimes?\n\nvance: so new york law goes a little bit further than it has to go. the fifth amendment protects a defendant who's been tried on a charge once from being tried again. we call that double jeopardy. but it really only applies if you're tried by the same sovereign. there's a little loophole in new york law that apparently was unintended because it provides protection from being tried a second time not just for defendants who were acquitted the first time they were tried on a charge but also for defendants who received a pardon.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so if this proposal passes, what changes?\n\nvance: it's an issue of timing. so fast forwarding and putting this in the context of the trump investigation, defendants who've already pleaded guilty or future defendants who might plead guilty or go to trial and have a jury impaneled in their case would then be ineligible for retrial in the state of new york if they were to be pardoned by president trump at that point in the proceedings. and that technical timing issue is what's given prosecutors in the state of new york some concern.\n\ngarcia-navarro: i guess the crux of the matter is, is there a specific reason, in your view, that eric schneiderman is bringing up this legislation? who could president trump potentially pardon that could end up under new york jurisdiction?\n\nvance: eric schneiderman is being a good prosecutor and being extremely careful. they've obviously looked at the law on double jeopardy very carefully - and thinking that a defendant, perhaps mr. cohen, whose house and business were the subject of a federal search warrant over the past couple of weeks. and really anyone else who engaged in criminal activity in the state of new york could theoretically be prosecuted by the attorney general or by a district attorney.\n\ngarcia-navarro: as long as i have you, i want to ask you about developments in the mueller investigation. the president was having some trouble filling his legal team after john dowd left. this week, rudy giuliani joined the team, saying he wants to bring an end to the mueller investigation. does that sound possible to you?\n\nvance: it seems unlikely. mr. giuliani has said he expects that he will negotiate a settlement within the next couple of weeks. and among many other reasons, we know that's not possible because paul manafort faces two trials that won't take place until later this year.\n\ngarcia-navarro: what does he bring to the team then?\n\nvance: that's a good question. obviously, the president has a comfort level with him. mr. giuliani is a former u.s. attorney, former leadership at the justice department. and one would hope that perhaps he can help the president understand that system a little better, as well.\n\ngarcia-navarro: joyce vance is a former u.s. attorney of alabama. thank you so much.\n\nvance: thanks for having me.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
white house wants democrats to come to the table, spokeswoman says\n\nsteve inskeep talks to director of strategic communications mercedes schlapp about two senate votes on bills that would end the government shutdown. npr's domenico montanaro weighs in on the issue.\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\nhere is the state of play in efforts to reopen the federal government. the senate votes on two bills today. the republican measure has funding the president demanded for a wall along the border with mexico along with some other immigration measures. the democratic measure just reopens the government. in the house, a leading democrat, james clyburn, says his party is ready to give the president all the money he is asking for border security, just not a wall.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\njames clyburn: if his $5.7 billion is about border security, then we see ourselves fulfilling that request, only doing it with what i like to call - using a smart wall.\n\ninskeep: republican mark meadows sees no change here.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nmark meadows: on day 1, there was zero dollars for new border fencing measures. on day 33, there's still zero dollars for new border fencing measures.\n\ninskeep: so how's all this look from the white house? our next guest is mercedes schlapp. she is white house director of strategic communications.\n\nwelcome back to the program.\n\nmercedes schlapp: thank you for having me.\n\ninskeep: would the president consider that offer, all the money - $5.7 billion - just not a wall?\n\nschlapp: well, why don't we have the democrats come over and propose that over to the president? what we have not seen, sadly, is the democrats willing to - especially democrat leadership with speaker pelosi - come wanting to negotiate. we have been waiting for a counteroffer. the president, last saturday, presented a good faith, reasonable proposal that would immediately reopen the government and as well as provide measures that would secure the border. they not...\n\ninskeep: are you - forgive me. are you saying the president would seriously consider what clyburn just put on the table there?\n\nschlapp: well, what we need is a conversation to happen...\n\ninskeep: so yes?\n\nschlapp: ...'cause democrat leadership...\n\ninskeep: is that a yes or just come and talk?\n\nschlapp: we've been waiting. what we need to determine - is that their counteroffer? speaker pelosi hasn't told us what their counteroffer is. what we know in the president's proposal is that includes several elements that the democrats would agree with, including an extension of daca, an extension of temporary protected status and as well as asylum laws that would actually - that they would support, which would be that young minors would be able to apply for asylum in their home country.\n\nbefore - when the president was about to give the address - even before that, speaker pelosi put out a statement. and she said that democrats want stronger, more effective border security. two of the bullet point she included, which was more immigration judges to deal with the backlog and also basically allowing for counternarcotics technology. those are two elements that are included in the president's proposal.\n\ninskeep: we should...\n\nschlapp: we are ready to have this discussion with the democrat leadership. question is, are they going to come to the table?\n\ninskeep: we should...\n\nschlapp: and so far, we have not seen a counteroffer.\n\ninskeep: we should note that democrats disagree with the way the president has laid out the daca protections as well as the asylum protections. we'll discuss at another time. but i want to ask about this shutdown because it goes on. it's more than a month old.\n\nand the national air traffic controllers association has put out a statement because, of course, air traffic controllers are affected here. they're not being paid. there are some things they can't do. the statement says, quote, we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. if a plane crashes and people are killed because of this shutdown, is the wall worth that?\n\nschlapp: well, i will say that at this point, what the president and speaker - what the president wants to do is have the democrats come to the table. the democrats keep...\n\ninskeep: is a plane crash...\n\nschlapp: ...delaying the process (unintelligible).\n\ninskeep: the president is the one who's making a demand. is the...\n\nschlapp: no, no, no. the demand is...\n\ninskeep: ...wall worth people getting killed?\n\nschlapp: the democrats' demand is not going to work because of the fact that they don't even want to have a discussion with the president. the president has asked time and time again to come to a compromise, and they refuse to do so. so we want to open the government. we want the democrats to come to the table. we want to secure the border where we have seen increased crime, where we have seen increased gang activity, where we have to deal with a decades old problem. and it's time we - and we have put forward a good faith proposal, and yet we have no answer coming from the democrats.\n\ninskeep: you also have dhs leaders, former dhs leaders - five of them, including john kelly, the former white house chief of staff and the president's dhs secretary - saying that it's unconscionable that homeland security workers are not being paid. we have the fbi agents association saying that investigations are being hampered. so that leads to another question. if the shutdown leads to a terror attack that gets americans killed, is the wall worth that - yes or no?\n\nschlapp: again, i'm going to say that the democrats need to come to the table. we are ready to open this government immediately. we want to be able to secure the border, which we know is an issue that is incredibly important, especially as our border patrol agents have asked for these resources. and so it's time for the democrats to stop going home - because this is what's happening. speaker pelosi will be going home this weekend, will not be in washington. she is not taking this seriously.\n\ninskeep: well, the senate will be out as well. why are you uncomfortable answering yes or no to that question?\n\nschlapp: i think, at the end of the day, no one - not any american thinks, you know, that we want a plane to crash, any safety concerns. and that is why the president wants to open up the government, secure our border, have the democrats come to the table - as opposed to the democrats continuously going home and not working and not getting to a resolution.\n\ninskeep: mercedes schlapp, thanks for taking the time. i really appreciate it.\n\nschlapp: thank you.\n\ninskeep: she is the white house director of strategic communications. npr's domenico montanaro was listening along with us.\n\ndomenico, what did you hear there?\n\ndomenico montanaro, byline: well, you certainly heard much less about a border wall. there certainly wasn't the idea of, you know, build a wall; crime will fall - as the president talked about yesterday. instead, when you asked her if the president would accept $5.7 billion or potentially more than that that democrats could put on the table as early as today for border security, she said, well, why don't we have the democrats propose that to the president? certainly sounds like an openness and a potential way out of this shutdown. at the same time, of course, we don't know inside the mind of the president. we don't know if he will accept that, but it certainly sounds like an opening, steve.\n\ninskeep: we should be clear. people close to the president, including the vice president, mike pence, have sounded more willing to deal than the president has sounded over the past several weeks.\n\nmontanaro: they are always more willing to deal. they just don't know what the president will exactly sign off on.\n\ninskeep: ok. domenico, thanks for the update. really appreciate it.\n\nmontanaro: you're welcome.\n\ninskeep: that's npr's domenico montanaro.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump holds rally in pennsylvania as journalists gather at annual d.c. dinner\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption carolyn kaster/ap carolyn kaster/ap\n\nupdated 10:30 p.m. et\n\npresident donald trump passed saturday on one of the biggest events on washington's annual social calendar and, instead, opted to spend his 100th day in office focused on trade and holding a campaign-style rally in harrisburg, pa.\n\nbreaking with tradition, trump was a no-show at the annual white house correspondents' association dinner saturday night in d.c. it was the first time in 36 years that the president has not attended the event. back in 1981, president ronald reagan did not attend because he was recovering from an assassination attempt. president jimmy carter did not attend in 1978 and in 1980. president richard nixon did not attend the dinner in 1974 and 1972.\n\nrather than attending the annual dinner — where the president traditionally is the opening act for a well-known hollywood comedian and is also the butt of many of the event's jokes — trump opted to take a short trip from washington to pennsylvania where he visited a tool manufacturing company in harrisburg and signed two executive orders focused on trade. one of the orders directed the commerce department and the u.s. trade representative to conduct a review of existing u.s. international trade and investment agreements and another created a new white house office of trade and manufacturing to be led by trump adviser peter navarro. then trump held a rally in in the pennsylvania city and gave a nearly hourlong stump speech.\n\nthe move — to hold a rally in a battleground state and miss the annual dinner known for glitzy elbow-rubbing between washington journalists and hollywood celebrities — seemed designed to thumb the presidential nose at the washington press corps, with whom trump continues to have a tense relationship, while also highlighting trump's accomplishments on his 100th day in the oval office.\n\npredictably, trump spent roughly the first 10 minutes of his remarks bashing the media. a large group of hollywood actors and washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now, the president told the enthusiastic crowd of supporters. he added that back in d.c. they are gathered together for the white house correspondents' dinner — without the president. trump then told the crowd he was thrilled to be with them instead, many miles away from washington.\n\ntoggle caption carolyn kaster/ap\n\nreprising familiar themes from his campaign and his tweets, trump declared that cnn and msnbc were both fake news. he also once again referred to the new york times as failing. turning one of the traditions of the 100th-day milestone on its head, trump suggested to the crowd that they rate the media's 100 days, adding, because, you know, they are a disgrace. after rattling through a litany of what he saw as the times' bad business decisions over the years, the real estate mogul and former reality tv star declared that the national newspaper of record was incompetent and dishonest people.\n\nbefore turning his attention to what his administration has done since his inauguration, trump rendered his verdict media critic in chief. the media deserves a big fat failing grade, the president said.\n\nthe remainder of the rally was ripped from trump's familiar political playbook and was like traveling back in time to his best moments on the 2016 campaign trail. he faulted his predecessor, former president barack obama: the previous administration gave us a mess.\n\nthen, on the same day that marches had been held worldwide protesting his skeptical views on climate change and seeking great investments in protecting the climate, trump informed that crowd that he would be making a big decision about the paris climate agreement in the next two weeks.\n\nthe new president also sought to explain his decision in the past 100 days not to label china a currency manipulator by pointing to the tense situation on the korean peninsula and china's critical role in dealing with the north korean regime. trump called chinese president xi jinping a good man, adding let's see what happens.\n\ni think it's not exactly the right time to call china a currency manipulator right now, the president told the crowd.\n\ntrump spent the remainder of his remarks focused on what he referred to as his administration's 100 days of action and all the things he and his team of aides have done since inauguration:\n\nthe confirmation of neil gorsuch to the supreme court;\n\nwithdrawal of the u.s. from the the trans-pacific partnership;\n\nhis recently announced plan to renegotiate nafta, and, failing that, to terminate the trade agreement with canada and mexico;\n\nhis recent directive to buy american and hire american;\n\nthe performance of the stock market since election day;\n\nmaking energy exploration easier;\n\nclearing the way for the construction of the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines;\n\ncutting back on regulations emanating from washington;\n\nthe signing of more than two dozen new pieces of legislation;\n\nmultiple moves by his administration to protect veterans as they seek care from the veterans administration health care system;\n\nhis efforts to drain the swamp in washington through prohibitions on lobbying after government service;\n\nincreased immigration controls especially at the nation's borders and increased efforts to help victims of crimes committed by people in the country illegally;\n\nhis continuing commitment to build a wall on the mexico border (we'll build a wall, folks. don't even worry about it. go home and go to sleep. rest assured.);\n\nstepped-up efforts to fight crime caused by gangs and drug cartels and remove their compatriots who are in the u.s. illegally;\n\na focus on so-called sanctuary cities;\n\nincreased support for law enforcement;\n\nincreased efforts to fight terrorism (we are going to keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.);\n\na commitment to rebuilding the military (with a special shout-out to defense secretary james mattis);\n\na new plan to cut taxes and overhaul the tax system including cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent;\n\na continuing commitment to repeal and replace obamacare (which the president variously described as dying, dead, gone, and in a death spiral);\n\non gun rights, a commitment to defend the second amendment;\n\non education, a commitment to increase local control of schools and end common core;\n\nand a commitment generally to stop federal overreach.\n\nand echoing some of the rhetoric of his inaugural address, trump told the crowd that regardless of race, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, that we are all made by the same almighty god, and that we are americans and the future belongs to us.\n\nthe rally was the capstone of a past week the white house spent holding events, putting out press releases and otherwise seeking headlines intended to highlight what it views as the new administration's successes in the last 100 days. even before his rally saturday night, the president himself seemed keenly aware that the day is historically a symbolic moment for the media, pundits, the country and perhaps even much of the world to assess his young presidency.\n\nmainstream (fake) media refuses to state our long list of achievements, including 28 legislative signings, strong borders & great optimism!, trump tweeted saturday afternoon.\n\ntrump also used his annual weekly address to amplify his 100th day message. my fellow americans, i truly believe that the first 100 days of my administration has been just about the most successful in our country's history, he said in a video posted on youtube saturday. the president spent the remaining four minutes of the weekly address laying out his actions and accomplishments since taking office.\n\ndespite trump's efforts to focus on his successes, he did not make it through his 100th day in office without another major protest.\n\nthe people's climate march occurred in washington and other cities across the globe in an effort to bring attention to the new administration's skeptical views on climate change, planned cuts to the environmental protection agency and generally more solicitous approach to business interests that might adversely impact the climate and the environment in various ways.\n\nin washington, thousands of demonstrators braved sweltering heat approaching 90 degrees and marched down pennsylvania avenue from near the u.s. capitol to trump's new home, the white house.\n\nasked shortly before the pennsylvania rally what his message was for the climate protesters back in d.c., the president responded, enjoy the day. and the weather.
progressives gear up for broad new push on climate action\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption richard vogel/ap richard vogel/ap\n\na coalition of progressive groups say they are organizing a sweeping network to mobilize around climate change, racial and environmental justice, making a new unified push as president-elect joe biden is days away from taking office with democrats set to control both the house and the senate.\n\nthe group, the green new deal network, plans to invest in partner organizations in 20 key states to mobilize grassroots power to pressure elected officials to support their goals; introduce green new deal-related legislation at the state and local level, spearhead federal legislation that would implement parts of the green new deal agenda, and to pressure the incoming biden administration to enact a series of executive actions related to climate, jobs and justice.\n\nevery day [seiu members] confront the crisis of climate, as well as environmental racism and economic inequality, so the green new deal is not something that is abstract to them, said rocio sáenz, the executive vice president of the service employees international union. for our members the green new deal means clear air, clean water, safe communities, good jobs and a growing economy. so this, for us, is why we are part of this network. what we see, especially now more than ever, is that we cannot think about these issues in siloes.\n\nnamed for the sweeping proposal for cutting u.s. contributions to climate change over the next decade, the coalition has already raised more than $20 million, organizers say.\n\nintroduced by rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york and sen. ed markey of massachusetts, the green new deal sparked a fierce political debate on how to best combat climate change. the plan drew significant attention from president trump and republican lawmakers, who have panned the plan as costly and unrealistic and used the policy to cast democratic supporters of the framework as socialists. the green new deal was introduced as a nonbinding resolution, written with out some specifics, making it challenging to specify a price tag. supporters say the plan will pay for itself through economic growth, and that the urgency of the climate crisis requires a bold and immediate response.\n\nthe groups coming together to back it now include the center for popular democracy, climate justice alliance, grassroots global justice, greenpeace, indigenous environmental network, indivisible, the movement for black lives, moveon, people's action, right to the city, service employees international union, the sierra club, sunrise movement, us climate action network and the working families party.\n\nleaders of the coalition say they plan to put the majority of their resources into a coordinated campaign stitched-together across key states, that rely on local activists and organizers.\n\nwe have a shot to create millions of green jobs, to transform the way our economy works so it actually helps working people, said kaniela ing, the climate justice campaign director for people's action. change doesn't happen from the top down. you can't just hire a bunch of experts and lobbyists if you want something to be lasting. we're not just lobbying d.c., we're actually lobbying on the ground in all 50 states.\n\nthey are also applying pressure at the federal level. the green new deal network has already written a letter to president-elect biden and his transition team, arguing that there is a dire need for action beyond legislation.\n\nmassive federal investment is past due and a down payment on a regenerative future is urgently needed, the coalition wrote, calling on the incoming biden administration to do everything within its authority to ensure healthy communities, a more just economy and a livable planet.\n\nthe letter calls for a number of steps that the coalition argues that biden could take unilaterally, including an executive order upgrading public buildings, transportation and energy in a transition to a clean energy economy; an executive order that requires federal agencies to secure informed tribal consent from indigenous nations; declaring a national climate emergency; and banning new fossil fuel projects on federal and tribal lands and waters, as well as in environmental justice communities.\n\nfor his part, biden has announced his own climate change agenda that stops short of endorsing the green new deal. it includes trillions of dollars in spending on green initiatives and calls for the elimination of greenhouse gas pollution by 2050. late last year, he named key members of his climate change team, including former obama-era epa director gina mccarthy to lead a new white house office of climate policy and new mexico rep. deb haaland to lead the department of the interior. haaland is a congressional co-sponsor of the green new deal.\n\nwe're going to call on president-elect biden to lean into the agenda that he ran on, which was bold with a vision for addressing climate change and racial and economic justice, said saenz. we know that our job will continue to be to hold him accountable to his promises, to support him and support other elected officials when they do right, and to campaign hard against those that would stand in the way.\n\nsome compared the scope of the effort to that of the health care for america now coalition, the vast, progressive coalition that was crucial to the affordable care act cause.\n\nthat work was critical to convincing the obama administration that there was a real path to get the legislation through, said maurice mitchell, the national director of of the working families party. so we plan on using that strategy. sometimes, the best way to influence a president is indirectly by doing the work on the ground and shoring up members of congress to inspire in the administration the belief that there actually is a legislative path.\n\n\n\npart of that work, said ing, is helping to build capacity on the ground in a state-by-state level.\n\npeople in their communities know their communities best, ing said. we are all the expert of our own experiences, just kind of recognizing that and supporting that by not just bringing money into a state, but creating a way where people can come together cooperatively, build their own local coalitions and then we can support that.\n\nlindsay harper, the national coordinator for arm in arm, a group organizing to end the climate crisis through fighting for racial and economic justice, said that she views this as an opportunity to focus on local fights that have real, true national and international implications.\n\ni'm really excited about bringing people's faces and experiences into a conversation where folks from the south, black folks, black women, people of color and in some low wealth communities have not been at the table. harper said. they have not been a part of the fabric. they have not been in an opportunity to lead and to contribute. i think that georgia spoke very loudly in the last election, so it's very clear that we are an integral point of moving what needs to be moved forward.\n\nthe coalition is also taking lessons from past attempts at climate actions including the comprehensive climate package, known as waxman-markey, that attempted to create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions. the bill, colloquially named for then-rep. henry waxman of california and sen. ed markey, then a representative, passed the house in 2009 and died in the senate. leaders of the effort say that one of the reasons that effort collapsed was that it was too much of an insider play and did not engage organizers and workers in the field, mistakes that organizers say they won't repeat.\n\nwhen the far-right movement built a ground swell and pushed back on things like waxman-markey, there was no countervailing movement force to challenge that, said mitchell. we plan on having a 50-state strategy that is rooted outside, in order to shore up congress because we know that every single member is going to need to be held accountable.\n\nthe new group's leaders also say they will not shy away from backing primary challenges to sitting lawmakers.\n\nto me and to us, this is a moral imperative, said mitchell. we don't have another shot at this. so if the science, if the wildfires in california, if the increased intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes... if all of this isn't enough for you, you don't deserve to be in office.
oxycontin manufacturer says it will stop promoting opioid painkiller to doctors\n\nnpr's ari shapiro talks with journalist sam quinones about purdue pharma's announcement that it would stop promoting its blockbuster opioid painkiller oxycontin to doctors. purdue's move comes as it faces dozens of lawsuits.\n\nari shapiro, host:\n\neffective today, purdue pharma is no longer promoting its blockbuster painkiller oxycontin to doctors. in an open letter, the company has said it is doing more to fight the opioid crisis. the letter concludes, this is our fight too. purdue faces lots of fights. states and cities across the u.s. have sued the drug company for contributing to the addiction epidemic. sam quinones has reported on purdue pharma for years. he's author of the book dreamland: the true tale of america's opioid epidemic. welcome.\n\nsam quinones: thanks for having me.\n\nshapiro: purdue pharma used to market oxycontin really aggressively. it's been less of that recently. what exactly is the change that's starting today?\n\nquinones: my impression is that they are simply not going to be promoting it to doctors at all. they have been promoting it as a reasonable painkiller. and my impression is now that they will be ceasing that, which would be a big step for them - considering that i think it's one of the few drugs they actually have.\n\nshapiro: why do you think they're doing it right now?\n\nquinones: i think they are seeing a groundswell of concern across the country and communities everywhere because this is a problem. opiate addiction is a problem all across the country from coast to coast. they're also seeing, of course, as you mentioned, dozens of lawsuits filed by states' attorneys general, by counties, by towns alleging that several companies, purdue foremost among them, lead a kind of a campaign to dupe the public into believing that their drug was not addictive. and these lawsuits, particularly in the last - i would say - year and a half, have really gained steam as local entities, counties and towns, have seen themselves buckling under the cost of paying for the consequences of this epidemic and having done nothing to really create it - are looking for ways of paying for the increase in foster care that they now have to provide, the full jails, the courts that are that are overwhelmed with new addicts.\n\nshapiro: so do you think this change is likely to affect those lawsuits?\n\nquinones: i doubt it. the lawsuits were filed based on what has gone on up to now. a lawyer could tell you better. but my feeling is that these lawsuits were - are based on evidence or facts they say they have that show that the company did this in the past - not what's going on today. i think it may be more a pr move, as a way of kind of softening feelings toward the company, because i can tell you in many parts of the country this company is very roundly hated.\n\nshapiro: well, i was going to ask. purdue pharma is not ending sales of oxycontin. they just say they're going to stop marketing oxy. how much of a difference will that make?\n\nquinones: it's hard to say because by now purdue pharma and oxycontin, they're household names. in any doctor's office, certainly everybody knows the drug. most pain patients know the drug. it's not clear to me how much more promoting they actually have to do to get this drug well-known. it's also got a very bad reputation too. a lot of people are very wary of it. doctors are very wary of it now, i think. and so what exactly is - how this will help? i'm not sure. they may have their own calculations as to what effect it will have.\n\nshapiro: how much money has this drug made for purdue pharma over the years?\n\nquinones: well, it's a private company. i'm not sure exactly. but estimates that i have read - between $35 and $40 billion in sales since the drug came out in 1996. it's basically the reason why the sackler family, which owns purdue, is one of the wealthiest families in america. forbes magazine pegged it as one of the wealthiest families in america due almost entirely to the sales of oxycontin.\n\nshapiro: oxycontin is not the only addictive opioid out there. other drug companies continue to sell addictive painkillers. how much of a difference does it make that this one company will no longer market this one drug? do you think other drug companies will follow?\n\nquinones: i suspect they may. i think it's more of a - kind of a bellwether of where this issue is going because when you talk about how we got into this, really purdue pharma is the company that led the way. their promotions and their sales and their aggressive marketing really led the way into all this. and so people are now looking to say, well, look. we are turning away from that. we have learned our lesson. we want to be part of the solution - i think as they said in that statement that you read. i'm not sure how much effect it will actually have. and i think time will tell that this is a problem that is not going away. it's very deeply rooted now in american culture. and will this change in marketing and promotion mean much after the company's gone to such lengths to root this in america? i don't know. i guess we'll see.\n\nshapiro: journalist and author sam quinones, thanks a lot.\n\nquinones: my pleasure.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump administration gets an earful on new campus sexual assault rules\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tovia smith/npr tovia smith/npr\n\nthe department of education has been inundated with approximately 100,000 public comments on its proposed new rules for how campuses handle cases of sexual assault. secretary betsy devos opened the public comment period two months ago, after unveiling her plan to replace obama-era rules with regulations that, she says, would better protect the accused. the window for comments closes wednesday at midnight.\n\nmany who have weighed in praise the new rules for restoring sanity and fairness to the process but many more are critical.\n\nthose comments range from short expletives and insults aimed at devos, to personal and sometimes graphic accounts of sexual assaults,and pleas not to return to the bad ol' days, when victims were not believed and incidents were swept under the rug.\n\nthe deluge of comments comes as survivor advocates have been mobilizing their troops on social media, at comment-writing pizza parties, and through crash courses in commenting on college campuses.\n\nat a recent meeting of the boston university students for reproductive freedom club, sage carson with the survivor advocacy group, know your ix joined in by video conference, updating students on what the proposals would do.\n\ni'll be blunt, she says, it's devastating. she tells the students the proposed rules would mean schools don't automatically have to investigate incidents alleged to have occurred in private, off-campus apartments, or misconduct that is reported to a coach or resident advisor, for example, instead of the official title ix officer.\n\nshe then instructs students how to formally file their objections through the hands off ix website. a mad libs-type of template makes commenting easy, and then forwards submissions on to the official regulation comment website.\n\nstudents first fill in their name, and identify as a survivor or concerned citizen, for example. then they can pick from a list of rules they take issue with, and then from a list of studies and data that bolster their case. carson urges the students to make it their own.\n\nas long as you submit something that is personal, and you say why this is important, the department is legally required to respond, she says. it takes about 5-10 minutes ... it's super simple and can have real-world implications.\n\nafter the meeting, sophomore blaire thomas launches the website on her phone, checks out the sentence starters and decides to write about the off-campus exclusion.\n\nmost of the places that me and my friends spend time on nights and weekends are off campus, she explains. and i feel like this is a direct attack on the protections that students have a right to.\n\nit's incredibly disturbing, says julia mullert. i live off campus and the fact that i could be few minutes away and that would change everything, is really devastating. but it also motivates me to push back against it and fight harder.\n\nactivists hope the sheer volume of comments will force officials to pay attention.\n\nsupport for the regulations\n\nthere's no official count of supporters and opponents, but even those who favor the new rules concede they're getting beat.\n\nwe know we'll never match the number of comments of victims' advocates, says cynthia garrett, co-president of families advocating for campus equality, a group representing those who say they were wrongly accused. but the department [of education] is smart enough to understand that quality is more important than quantity.\n\ngarrett has been encouraging comments from accused students who say they were victims of an unfair system, that left them kicked out of school with dashed prospects, ruined reputations, and in many cases, severe depression.\n\nwe have a kid who planned to paddle out on a surfboard with a concrete block, says garrett. we have another one [who was found in his garage] standing on a stool with a rope in his hand. i mean this is very devastating.\n\ngarrett says the new rules better protect the wrongly accused, for example, by allowing schools to demand more proof of wrongdoing, by guaranteeing the right to cross-examine accusers, and by narrowing the definition of sexual harassment.\n\nwill public comment sway policy?\n\nfighting these issues through agency regulations — once the domain of wonky lawyers — is something of a newer frontier in political activism. harvard law school professor jacob gersen, an expert in the administrative law process, and a proponent of many of the changes devos has proposed, says most regulations still get just a smattering of comments — certainly not a hashtag campaign on social media. but it's increasingly a part of political strategy.\n\nparties and activists have gotten good at this over the years, gersen says. they recognize that the bureaucracy and the administration is actually where the power is and that's a much more effective place to spend your political energy. and they're right about that.\n\njess davidson, executive director of end rape on campus, that's part of the hands off ix partnership, agrees. we have really revolutionized the way that people can participate in this process ... and we're making this incredibly powerful democratic tool one in which you can clearly sue the department if they don't listen to you and take your voice seriously.\n\nthe regulations.gov website discourages mass-generated submissions, warning that some agencies may choose to 'redact, or withhold' submissions containing duplicate/near duplicate examples of a mass-mail campaign. a tip-sheet further advises that many ... mistakenly believe that their submitted form letter constitutes a 'vote' but in fact, while public opinion may guide policy, decisions are made on sound reasoning and scientific evidence rather than a majority of votes. a single, well-supported comment may carry more weight than a thousand form letters. (npr reached out to education officials with additional questions, but did not receive answers before deadline.)\n\ndavidson dismisses suggestions of a copy-and-paste campaign. the website template gives people the tools ... to write unique, substantive comments. we're democratizing [the process] and making it more accessible to the people who are disproportionately harmed by [devos' proposed] rules.\n\ni think these stories deserve to be read by a human, not just robots. women deserve that.\n\nsuccess however, is hardly certain. past efforts for example the one that generated millions of comments on net neutrality, ultimately failed to sway administration officials' minds.\n\nmass mailings can also be the victims of their own success, as the overwhelming quantity of comments forces officials to use machines to read them. it's a prospect that infuriates activists, like stanford law school professor michele dauber.\n\nhow insulting, she says. i think these stories deserve to be read by a human, not just robots. women deserve that.\n\nit's one of the reasons dauber, who also chairs the enough is enough voter project pac, helped distribute tens of thousands of postcards at womens' marches around the nation. she's hoping hand-written notes will force a human read.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy kimberly kirchmer courtesy kimberly kirchmer\n\nif the department doesn't read — and heed — the comments, dauber says, a legal challenge will follow.\n\nbut joe cohn, legislative and policy director for the foundation for individual rights in education says comment quantity should not drive policy.\n\nconstitutional rights aren't decided by majority vote, he says. due process is not subject to the whims of the masses.\n\nofficials may take months to review the comments and respond. they will likely give schools some lead time before enacting the new regulations, and inevitable legal challenges may bring further delays. that means it could be close to the 2020 election before any new regulations take effect. activists say that may ultimately be how the issue is decided. as dauber put it, the way to get rid of these regulations, is to get rid of the people who wrote them.
trump surpasses number of delegates needed to secure gop nomination\n\ndonald trump crossed the threshold of required delegates to secure the gop nomination. the change came as a small number of unbound delegates said they will support him at the party's convention.\n\naudie cornish, host:\n\ndonald trump is now the presumptive republican nominee for president. he's reached the magic number of delegates - 1,237.\n\nkelly mcevers, host:\n\nno, there wasn't another primary election that put him over the top. instead, the associated press reports a handful of uncommitted delegates decided to support trump. it's now certain the he will clinch the nomination at the party convention this summer.\n\ncornish: donald trump has never done anything conventionally. his journey began last june at trump tower in manhattan.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\ndonald trump: i am officially running...\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: ...for president of the united states.\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: and we are going to make our country great again.\n\nmcevers: not long after that, he shot to the top of the polls and never looked back.\n\ncornish: republican strategists brushed him off, but they did worry that he could hurt the party's image with some of the things he said, like about mexicans here illegally.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\ntrump: they're bringing drugs. they're bringing crime. they're rapists.\n\nmcevers: he also called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the u.s. despite those remarks or perhaps because of them, trump's support grew and grew.\n\ncornish: in february, voting began. trump finished behind ted cruz in the iowa caucuses, but the next week in new hampshire, he won. as he racked up more wins through the spring, the stop-trump movement gained steam. the republican establishment had a sort of identity crisis. what was trump doing to the grand old party?\n\nmcevers: but reality set in for many republicans three weeks ago. in indiana, trump delivered a final blow to his competition. that night, he struck a rare note of conciliation.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\ntrump: we want to bring unity to the republican party. we have to bring unity.\n\ncornish: and now trump is looking forward to battling hillary clinton. she has yet to clinch her party's nomination.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
remembering mary tyler moore, the smart, comic actress who inspired a generation\n\nmoore, who died wed. at the age of 80, played a single professional woman on the 1970s show named after her, and became beloved for her role on the dick van dyke show. originally broadcast in 1995.\n\ndavid bianculli, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm david bianculli, editor of the website tv worth watching, sitting in for terry gross. mary tyler moore died wednesday at age 80, and many radio and television programs have been offering salutes and appreciations ever since. today, it's our turn. we're going to replay a 1995 interview mary tyler moore did with terry gross back when the star of the dick van dyke show and the mary tyler moore show had just released her memoir. but first, an appreciation from my perspective as a tv critic. mary tyler moore managed to star in one of the best and smartest comedies of the decade in two different decades.\n\nin the 1960s, when almost all of the situation comedies were dumbed-down fantasy shows like my mother the car, the dick van dyke show was a singularly modern and believable comedy about, in part, a loving husband and wife. in the 1970s, the mary tyler moore show was a subtle but undeniably feminist role model; as single working women on tv go, a direct ancestor of such later series as hbo's sex and the city and girls.\n\nbut what i loved most about the roles of new rochelle housewife laura petrie and minneapolis tv producer mary richards wasn't what they represented or how they were written but what mary tyler moore brought to them. as an actress, she brought vitality, sexuality and an awful lot of stubbornness and strength. whatever part she played, mr. grant was right. she had spunk. here she is in a flashback sequence on the dick van dyke show, angrily lashing back at rob after he jilts her at the altar. he'd gotten in an accident on the way to the wedding, but she doesn't know that yet.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, the dick van dyke show)\n\ndick van dyke: (as rob petrie) honey, you promised you'd stay and listen to me.\n\nmary tyler moore: (as laura petrie) and you promised you'd marry me. where were you?\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) that's what i want to explain.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) i've never been so humiliated in my whole life. everybody was here. even my aunt mildred was here. she came all the way from ohio.\n\n(laughter)\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) oh, honey, please, i hate to see you cry like this.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) well, it's the only way i know how to cry.\n\nbianculli: her defiance and her humor also were on display in another flashback sequence when rob and laura have just come back from the hospital with their new baby. rob suspects the hospital accidentally switched infants, giving their kid to another couple on the maternity ward named peters.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, the dick van dyke show)\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) our baby is probably just as cute as that one is.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) will you stop? where did you ever get such a crazy idea?\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) at the hospital. that's where we got it.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) we got the wrong flowers.\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) you forgot about the blueberry tarts and the rice pudding pretty fast, did you, not to mention dried figs.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) dried - rob, this is our baby and that's all there is to it.\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) honey, he doesn't even look like us.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) rob.\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) you see.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) all i see is our baby with a blue foot.\n\n(laughter)\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) rob.\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) ink.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) how did it get there?\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) jerry and i put it on.\n\n(laughter)\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) why?\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) we were just running a series of tests.\n\n(laughter)\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) rob, there are no series of tests in the world that are going to convince me that is not our baby.\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) oh, honey, i don't blame you. you can't face the facts.\n\n(soundbite of doorbell ringing)\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) poor kid.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) oh, rob.\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) well, honey, that's probably the peters now. brace yourself.\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) rob, nobody is taking this baby. do you hear me? nobody.\n\nvan dyke: (as rob petrie) laura, i think it'd be better if you went to your room. i can handle it.\n\n(laughter)\n\nmoore: (as laura petrie) i am staying right here.\n\nbianculli: and then, from the mary tyler moore show, there's one of the best pieces of acting she ever did and without hardly any dialogue. it's at the funeral of a colleague, the children's show tv host known as chuckles the clown. mary had spent most of the episode berating her colleagues for making tasteless jokes all week at the weird way the clown died. if you don't know, find the episode, which is called chuckles bites the dust. she doesn't find their humor the least bit funny, but at the service itself, as the reverend - played by john harkins - gives his eulogy for chuckles, mary - and mary alone - starts giggling and laughing until the reverend singles her out. it's hilarious, and it's all built on character.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, the mary tyler moore show)\n\njohn harkins: (as reverend burns) excuse me, young lady.\n\n(laughter)\n\nharkins: (as reverend burns) yes, you, would you stand up please?\n\n(laughter)\n\nharkins: (as reverend burns) please, please, won't you? you feel like laughing, don't you?\n\nmoore: (as mary richards, laughter).\n\n(laughter)\n\nharkins: (as reverend burns) don't try to hold it back. go ahead. laugh out loud. don't you see? nothing would have made chuckles happier. he lived to make people laugh. tears were offensive to him, deeply offensive. he hated to see people cry.\n\n(laughter)\n\nharkins: (as reverend burns) so go ahead, my dear, laugh for chuckles.\n\nmoore: (as mary richards, laughter).\n\nbianculli: nothing else mary tyler moore did in her career matched the popularity and the impact of those two sitcom roles. but to embody a decade, a gender and a generation not once but twice is plenty for any one lifetime. terry gross spoke with mary tyler moore in 1995. she asked her about her first big break, playing the happy hotpoint elf for hotpoint appliance commercials broadcast during the adventures of ozzie and harriet tv show.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nmoore: happy hotpoint was the logo of hotpoint appliances come to life, an elf, a little figure with a shock of blond hair protruding from her little gray pixie cap that also had ears on it. but i was happy hotpoint, and i would, in these commercials, be superimposed on ice cube trays, skating, popping out of the washing machine, speaking to harriet nelson and saying things like, hi, harriet, aren't you glad you use hotpoint appliances? except my voice was higher then, so it sounded a lot more pixie-ish (ph) than it does now.\n\nwhat had happened was that at that time, and this was immediately after graduating from high school, i also got married immediately after graduating from high school. and about a month after that, i was pregnant, and these commercials were almost impossible to do anymore because i had my breasts bound down to begin with even before i was pregnant because pixies are supposedly of neuter gender. and to try to do that after i was even 1 month along and certainly into two and three was impossible, and so we had to stop. and i think they just went to straight commercials after that. and i went on to happily have my baby a few months after that.\n\nterry gross, host:\n\nwell, after you had your baby, you were the voice of the woman in the answering service for the tv detective richard diamond.\n\nmoore: right. that was played by david janssen, and it was - i guess it had started on radio. and one of the successful elements of it was a character called sam - short for samantha - who was the answering service woman who took richard diamond's telephone messages. this was, of course, predating answering machines, and he would check in with me two or three times every episode. and i would answer in the sexiest imaginable voice, hi, mr. d., i have some messages for you. and nobody ever saw sam. you were allowed to imagine her to be your idea, your fantasy of the most gorgeous creature ever, certainly far from the reality of mary tyler moore who, at the time, was a fast 23 or 22 years old freckle-faced, all-american, girl-next-door type.\n\ngross: now, let me jump ahead to the dick van dyke show. what were you told about the character of laura?\n\nmoore: just that she was going to be a wife, a television wife. and that really had its classical parameters and dimensions, and they were established and they hardly ever varied, except as to whether or not the wife was the star of the show, in which case she was the funny one. or if she were the straight man for the male star and she was then totally supportive. but all these wives were kind of obedient and, you know, a representative of the vows to love, honor and obey. they hardly varied from that. and with carl reiner's character the way she was written, laura actually had opinions of her own. and while she was asserting herself, she also didn't make dick van dyke look like a dummy. it was a matter of two people. i mean, society's expectations at that point still said, hey, wait a minute, lady. you only go so far here.\n\nbut i think we broke new ground. and that was helped by my insistence on wearing pants, you know, jeans and capri pants at the time because i said, i've seen all the other actresses, and they're always running the vacuum in these little flowered frocks with high heels on. and i don't do that, and i don't know any of my friends who do that, so why don't we try to make this real? and i'll dress on the show the way i do in real life.\n\ngross: but it wasn't that easy. the sponsors were afraid you'd look brazen.\n\nmoore: right. they pointed specifically to - they used the term cupping under. and i can only assume that that meant, you know, my seat, that there was a little too much definition. and so they allowed me to continue to wear them in one episode - one scene per episode and only after we checked to make sure that there was as little cupping under as possible. but...\n\ngross: cupping under referring to the fit of your pants.\n\nmoore: the fit of the pants, yes.\n\ngross: on your behind.\n\nmoore: on my behind, right. but within a few weeks we were sneaking them into a few other scenes in every episode. and they were definitely cupping under. and everyone thought it was great.\n\n(laughter)\n\nmoore: and the funny thing is, you know, women liked me. they were not envious of the fact that their husbands had a crush on me. it was ok with them. they were the first to - you know, when i would meet people, they'd say, my husband loves you so much and he thinks you're so sexy. and this was - it was an odd thing because they were also able to identify with me as a friend, as a girlfriend. there was no resentment and no fear.\n\ngross: yeah. well, i think that that speaks so well for the character and your portrayal of her. why capri pants? why not...\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: why not longer pants?\n\nmoore: there was a store in los angeles, in beverly hills called jax, j-a-x. and a man named jack hanson owned it, and it's now no longer there. and he designed these trousers. and they came in all fabrics and all price ranges from cotton to the finest moire silks. and i adored these pants. i loved them. i lusted after them. and i could just barely afford the cotton ones. but when i had a paycheck and it was on a regular basis from, you know, dancing in the chorus, i would make sure that i added another pair of pants to my wardrobe. and those were the design that i wore, along with several hundred other young women who shopped in beverly hills then.\n\nbianculli: mary tyler moore speaking to terry gross in 1995. we'll continue their conversation and our salute to mary tyler moore after a break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of b.j. thomas song, raindrops keep falling on my head)\n\nbianculli: we're remembering mary tyler moore, who died wednesday at age 80. terry gross spoke with her in 1995, when the actress had just published her memoir.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: i have a colleague here who said, the mary tyler moore show made me who i am today - single.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: and i thought that was particularly funny because, you know, all those years you were playing mary tyler moore you had no idea what it was like to be single. you got married as soon as you got out of high school. you divorced, but you were only single for about six months before marrying grant tinker.\n\nmoore: that's right. boy, you've read the book, haven't you?\n\ngross: yes.\n\nmoore: yes.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: so really you'd never lived that kind of single life.\n\nmoore: no, i hadn't. and when grant and i finally ended our marriage and i went to new york to do a broadway play, whose life is it anyway? i decided to stay in new york and try to capture my life for myself. i had never been on my own. i had never experienced any of the situations that mary richards had lived for the rest of the world every week.\n\nand i set about to make that happen for myself. i dated. i made friends. i had a little apartment. i did my own shopping and schlepped my own clothes to the dry cleaner and back and the laundry and all of that stuff. and i sort of generally played house, but in real life.\n\ngross: now, how did you come up with the voice to say, oh, rob?\n\nmoore: (laughter) i don't know. i guess it began with the cry. the first time i cried was the episode in which laura bleaches her hair blonde, looks in the mirror and with her friend millie's help decides she looks more like harpo marx than what her goal had been. and so she quickly tries to dye it back before rob gets home from work. now, this is a real stretch of the imagination. she decides to dye one half of her head back, not being able to get the other half done before dick walks in the door. and so she greets him half blonde, half brunette and sobbing.\n\nand i had always been a big fan of nanette fabray, who worked with carl reiner and sid caesar on the show of shows, and i loved her humor. i loved the way she cried. and so when i was called upon to bring forth the tears in my scene, i'm not sure how much of it was out-and-out stolen from miss fabray and how much of it was just a matter of influence.\n\nbut there was definitely a cracking in the voice and an inability to maintain a tone and a certain amount of verbal yodeling that took place. and from that came, oh, rob (laughter).\n\ngross: did you do a lot of rehearsing with dick van dyke, or did you just have to do it minutes before the actual broadcast?\n\nmoore: oh, the whole show was done in what they call multiple-camera technique. it's still done today. but back then, we were maybe the sixth or seventh show to use the technique. it began with joan davis - not lucille ball, as everyone thinks. joan davis did a show called i married joan.\n\ngross: (singing) what a girl, what a world, what a life.\n\nmoore: hey, good for you.\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\nmoore: and then lucy and several other shows followed. but in that show it's a little like doing theater that's captured on film. you rehearse for five days. and then on the evening of the fifth day, the audience comes in and the cameras, having blocked their moves and yours lined up with them, you film it from top to bottom in continuity.\n\nso during those five days, it was - at least the first three days it was very much a matter of rehearse and contribute and attempt things and not be afraid to fail, to make a fool of yourself. just pick yourself up. and if it didn't happen this time, then the next time you experiment maybe it will. it was a wonderfully supportive, creative environment.\n\nand dick van dyke was the most generous and supportive human being that i have ever worked with. and he very strongly influenced my life and my standards when i went out on my own later on.\n\ngross: oh, i have another question about laura petrie's look.\n\nmoore: yeah?\n\ngross: laura wore a flip.\n\nmoore: (laughter).\n\ngross: a perfect little flip.\n\nmoore: yes.\n\ngross: whose idea was the flip, and how were you wearing your hair in real life at the time?\n\nmoore: in real life, i was wearing it in a flip. but it wasn't quite as back-combed and lacquered as it was on the show. i mean, that thing had so much hair spray on it, you could hang clothes from it.\n\ngross: when you say that thing, was it your hair, or was it a wig?\n\nmoore: yeah. it was my hair. but it was quite thoroughly sprayed and done by somebody else. but my - in person in between shows, that was the way i wore it. it was just a little limper.\n\ngross: let's talk about the mary tyler moore show, a show which i still love to watch. i'm so glad that nick at nite (laughter) carries the shows. i still love to watch the dick van dyke show and mary tyler moore. the mary tyler moore show got started because cbs wanted to build a series around you. and you and grant tinker hired people to, you know, write - come up with the idea, write a series. what was the original premise?\n\nmoore: the original premise was not too different from the one that we ended up pursuing. but i was to be divorced from a doctor. and rather than having - as we ended up doing - having me live with this doctor through medical school and internship and residency and then been dumped, cbs felt that having been divorced was unacceptable from a societal point of view - that people would see nothing humorous in divorce. how could you possibly laugh at a woman who had a broken marriage in her past? and not only that - but, my god, they would think you were divorced from dick van dyke, the world's most wonderful, adorable person.\n\ngross: that's so silly.\n\nmoore: yeah. and instead, what's so odd from a morality point of view is that they found it acceptable that i had lived with this doctor, never married him. and then the relationship broke up. and i went off to start my new life. so i don't know. morality, i guess, is a very personal thing.\n\nbianculli: mary tyler moore speaking with terry gross in 1995. we'll continue their conversation after a short break. but first, a musical selection from one of moore's lesser-known tv shows. in 1976, a year before the mary tyler moore show ended and four years before she starred in the movie ordinary people, mary tyler moore starred in an ambitious, surrealistic variety special. it was called mary's incredible dream.\n\nand one of its musical numbers was her dressed up as an elderly actress near the end of her career, singing one of stephen sondheim's showstoppers from the broadway musical follies, i'm still here. it was an unexpected choice for someone at the peak of her popularity on primetime television. i'm david bianculli, and this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of film, mary's incredible dream)\n\nmoore: (as woman) good times, bum times - i've seen them all. and, my dear, i'm still here. plush velvet sometimes - sometimes just pretzels and beer. but i'm here. i've stuffed the dailies in my shoes, strummed ukuleles, sung the blues, seen all my dreams disappear. but i'm here. i've slept in shanties, guest of the wpa. but i'm here. danced in my scanties - three bucks a night was the pay. but i'm here.\n\n(singing) i've stood on bread lines with the best, watched while the headlines did the rest. in the depression, was i depressed? nowhere near. i met a big financier, and i'm here. i've gotten through herbert and j. edgar hoover. gee, that was fun and a half. when you've been through herbert and j. edgar hoover...\n\nbianculli: this is fresh air. i'm david bianculli, in for terry gross, back with more of our salute to mary tyler moore, who died wednesday at age 80. terry interviewed mary tyler moore in 1995. we'll pick up with terry asking about the character of ted baxter, the pompous and clueless tv newscaster played by ted knight in the mary tyler moore show.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: the character of ted baxter was originally conceived as being someone of your age.\n\nmoore: right.\n\ngross: and there might be some, like, romantic attraction between you?\n\nmoore: exactly. he was probably going to be tall, dark and handsome. and instead, what walked through the door was ted knight, short, white-haired and handsome, yes, but not what you'd call a love interest. but the writers - the writer-producers, jim and allan, were so open, and i think that's an important part of being a successful artist is being open to new ideas and input. and they saw this man, and they began to think potential. all right, so it isn't our original idea but oh, wow, look and feel and salivate over all the juicy stories we could do in another direction. and that's what happened, and they cast ted.\n\ngross: what won them over? was that big, pretentious voice part of it (laughter)?\n\nmoore: you know, there was another thing that won them over. it wasn't just the fact that he was pomposity to the nth degree but that there was a vulnerability and a sweetness to ted. we found out later that ted, who was a more out of work than in work actor, had gone out and bought himself a blue blazer and a crest and had it sewn on the pocket so that he would look the part. and everybody just thought that was, you know, real throat-clenching stuff. and you know, if there had been any doubt about whether or not he was the right one, that clinched it.\n\ngross: you write in your book that later into the series, ted knight wept because people thought he was really stupid.\n\nmoore: yeah.\n\ngross: they confused him so much with the character.\n\nmoore: yes. i don't remember exactly what year it was. i think it might have been the second year or the - maybe no. i think it was the first year. and he was so successful. i mean, he was a unique character. no one had ever seen anybody like him as a continuing role in a series. and people were mistaking him for the character he played, which is so often true for those of us in television. and they would - and of course both their - the first name was the same ted, ted. and they were calling him stupid and, oh, you're the funniest dumbbell we ever met. and, boy, are you dumb and stupid, and somebody called him a dumb schmuck. and he came in to jim brooks and allan burns' office. actually it was only allan in the office this day. and he was unable to speak.\n\nhe was just sobbing, and apparently it had just spilled over at that particular moment. he said, i can't go on, i can't do this. i am a dignified man. i have standards, and i am proud and i'm well-read and everybody thinks i'm stupid. and so allan pulled out all the stops and reminded him of all the great clowns in history who were cerebral and admired and who did great works in life by not only the good works themselves but by making fools of themselves by pratfalling, by doing all the dumb things that make people think you're dumb. and he was pretty much convinced and on his way out of the door when jim brooks came in and said, ah, ted, ted, ted, ted, the world's favorite schmuck.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: oops.\n\nmoore: but he had a sense of humor about it, and he got it out of his system. i think that's all he needed to do. i think, you know, that's probably all a lot of us need to do on many occasions of frustration is just say it, get it out and sort of let the steam out, you know? let the top of the kettle off for a minute.\n\ngross: i think one of the real famous moments in television openings, you know, one of the famous freeze-frames is you throwing your hat in the air (laughter) in the opening of the show with the jingle underneath. do you remember that moment?\n\nmoore: oh, do i. it was freezing cold. it was in minneapolis in january, i think, or february. and we didn't know what we were doing. we were just there to grab a lot of footage that shows a young woman's exuberance being in a new city, looking around, gazing at the sights. and i had in my hand a hat, a little beret that my aunt had given me for christmas. and i had packed that along with whatever other warm things that i had, which weren't too many because i was a californian, to go to minneapolis to do these film spots. and jim brooks said, oh, i have a good idea, mary. take that hat, put it on your head and now run into the intersection. and it'll be all right. we'll watch for cars. and (laughter) throw it up in the air as if to say this is my town and i'm celebrating my life that is taking place. and i did it and luckily, magically, wasn't hit by a car, although i got some pretty strange looks. and in fact, in - i guess it must be in every episode you can see this one woman in the background who looks at me as if not only am i the world's strangest person but that she would like to personally lock me up.\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\nmoore: but it's interesting, isn't it, that something that becomes burned in people's impressions and memories can happen so happenstancely (ph) out of nowhere. it wasn't written. it was just a spur-of-the-moment idea.\n\ngross: so that traffic was the real thing.\n\nmoore: oh, yeah, it was. and it's a good thing i didn't have to speak any lines because my lips weren't working it was so cold. i literally could not form words.\n\nbianculli: mary tyler moore speaking to terry gross in 1995. we'll continue their conversation and our salute to mary tyler moore after a break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of jake shimabukuro's 143 2011)\n\nbianculli: this is fresh air. we're remembering mary tyler moore, who died wednesday at age 80. terry gross spoke with her in 1995 when the actress had just published her memoir.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: i'm interested in hearing a little bit about your own family when you were growing up since, after all, you know, you portrayed one of the most famous couples on television on the dick van dyke show and then had a wonderful family of friends and colleagues...\n\nmoore: yes.\n\ngross: ...on the mary tyler moore show. when you were growing up, your own family was probably what we'd now call dysfunctional.\n\nmoore: yeah. yeah. i suppose so. it's an overused phrase, and i wish we could be a little more specific about it.\n\ngross: i agree.\n\nmoore: my - no, and i didn't mean to criticize you for that (laughter).\n\ngross: no, no, no. oh, no, no, no, no, i didn't take it that way (laughter).\n\nmoore: my mother and father were very much the couple that grant tinker and i became. they say that you do follow the patterns that you grow up in, and this was certainly true in my case - wasp, repressed, unable to deal with things that are uncomfortable, pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps, not discussing anything that's ugly or unpleasant and just muddling through.\n\na little of jeff (ph) - beth jarrett in ordinary people came from those people, from myself. and i emulated that with grant tinker. my father is very well educated, intellectual, a lover of classical music and classical literature. my - my mother was an english major. and everything was just perfect in that house, but nobody was talking to anybody.\n\ngross: well, another thing that was less than perfect was your mother drank.\n\nmoore: my mother was an alcoholic, as i was to become. her alcoholism took another form from mine. she would, by the dint of determination, be sober for months at a time and then be unable to continue. and all of the problems that had been building up and she had been stuffing under the rug of her emotions would burst forth, and she would start drinking in the day. and she would not stop until somebody found the bottle and took it away and pretty much held her captive in the house until she sobered up and we were able to plead with her to stop. and then she would try again.\n\nback then, nobody knew what we know about alcoholism today and the kind of counseling it takes and the kind of sharing and support that is needed to get through this, to break this cycle. they feel now - i think most scientists agree that there is a genetic predisposition to alcohol which, in combination with other factors in life, is going to almost guarantee some form of dependency in later life.\n\nmy form of alcoholism was much more controlled because i grew up in that very uncomfortable, very sad situation, and i determined that i was never going to do that, never be drunk. and i probably never was really out-and-out drunk. and i certainly never drank during the daytime. but i wasted a lot of my time, and i forgot a lot because i didn't remember much of what had happened the night before. i got out-of-proportion angry about things that were really unimportant. but that's what alcohol does to you.\n\ngross: did being an actress help you be able to drink and not show the signs of it, help you cover it up?\n\nmoore: maybe so. i don't think so, though, because once your speech is slurred, once you lose balance, you know, there's no way you can pretend that away. but i paced myself. i never allowed myself to drink any more than the company i was with. and there - that way nobody could judge me. nobody could see.\n\ngross: did you drink alone?\n\nmoore: yeah, i did. but i was seldom alone except when i moved to new york. and then i was alone, and then my drinking really escalated. and i found myself not going out after 5 o'clock and making sure that everything was set up for me to have my dinner there on the bed that was by the air conditioner, that was near the phone, that was near the television set. and that i had my blender full of drinks that i was concocting in an attempt to do something worthwhile in the kitchen. it was a pretty sad lady that was emerging.\n\ngross: were you afraid that the press would find out that you drank a lot and it would be this whole thing...\n\nmoore: no, because...\n\ngross: yeah.\n\nmoore: ...i didn't think i drank a lot.\n\ngross: oh, i see.\n\nmoore: that's the amazing part of it. most alcoholics are in such a state of denial about their condition. they will blame everything but themselves for whatever is going on. i didn't have hangovers, per se, but i found that it was getting very difficult to hold the eyeliner brush steady when i was applying my makeup in the morning.\n\nso i thought, well, i guess that's just something that happens when you enter your 40s. and it's a nerve-wracking city, so i'll just have to, you know, take a little more time with it or use a thinner brush, whatever. and i had nobody to point out to me the lack of sense that i was making and the deterioration of my thinking.\n\ngross: you stopped drinking - i think it was - what? - the mid-'80s?\n\nmoore: it was 11 years ago, yeah. i guess that was the mid-'80s, yes. '86.\n\ngross: you did betty ford.\n\nmoore: right.\n\ngross: do you think your emotional character changed after you stopped drinking?\n\nmoore: oh, there's no question about it. in a way, i sometimes feel grateful that i did have this alcoholism, except that there were so many sad events that were caused by it that i can't wholeheartedly say that. but at least it got me to the betty ford center where i was able to, with the help of some counselors and a lot of group therapy sessions, examine myself and the way i handled my life and the way i handled problems and the way i reacted to any given situation and was able to make major changes.\n\ni allowed myself to be imperfect. i allowed myself to make mistakes and laugh at it, to handle my real-life mistakes the way i handled the acting mistakes on the dick van dyke show, to think of those as positive steps forward rather than anything to be ashamed of.\n\ngross: one of the movies that you've made over the years is change of habit, (laughter) which is...\n\nmoore: (laughter).\n\ngross: ...an elvis film in which he plays a doctor in the ghetto and you're...\n\nmoore: ...he plays a singing surgeon (laughter) and i play a nun.\n\ngross: a plainclothes nun.\n\nmoore: a plainclothes nun who was out of the habit. and it was the story about these two dedicated social workers who come together in the ghetto to bring about goodness to all mankind.\n\ngross: but you start to fall in love, and at the end you must choose between god and elvis.\n\nmoore: right. and you see a shot of me in church looking from the - jesus, the statue of jesus, and elvis playing guitar, and then to jesus and elvis and jesus and elvis and jesus and elvis. and you never know at the end who i finally chose. i was elvis' last leading lady. and he apparently said in somebody's book - he is quoted in somebody's book as having said, there's only one leading lady that i didn't sleep with. and guess what? i know who she is.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: right. so what was it like to play opposite him?\n\nmoore: it was wonderful. and he was nothing like the image that a lot of us have about him. back then - gosh, what was the year? i don't know. maybe '67 or '68 - something like that. he was in great shape, and he was working out, and he was watching his diet. and he was living a good life. i mean, yes, there were a lot of ladies in and out of his trailer.\n\nbut he was sweet and wholesome. and he knew his dialogue, and he had done his homework. and he was - he had a big crush on me from the dick van dyke show but, you know, in a reserved, from-a-distance kind of way. if he didn't watch himself, he'd call me ma'am. and he was very shy and kind of awkward with me.\n\ngross: now, this was hardly the film that either you or elvis became best known for (laughter).\n\nmoore: right. i think it's better said that we triumphed over.\n\n(laughter)\n\nmoore: in spite of this film, we continued.\n\ngross: did you regret making the film as it was being made? did you have a sense that this was not going...\n\nmoore: oh, no. i didn't know what i was doing at that time.\n\ngross: uh-huh.\n\nmoore: movies were new to me. and, you know, they may have not felt as well-written and directed as the television shows that i had been involved in. but i thought, well, see, that's the difference in the medium. you know, this is a movie. and so they know what they're doing. and, as it turned out, they didn't. but (laughter) it's all right.\n\ni really don't regret anything that i've done, in terms of my work. if i were writing a happily-ever-after piece, looking back, sure, there are things that would probably be better if they were erased and maybe not included at all. but i think i've learned from everything i've done. and i can't help but bring those experiences to what i do today.\n\ngross: mary tyler moore, thank you very much for talking with us.\n\nmoore: thank you. i really enjoyed it, terry. it's like talking with a pal.\n\nbianculli: mary tyler moore speaking to terry gross in 1995. the star of the dick van dyke show and the mary tyler moore show died wednesday at age 80. coming up, ed ward reconsiders the music of the monkees. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of jimmy amadie's you'd be so nice to come home to)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
president trump and allies push to save a very specific coal plant\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption dylan lovan/ap dylan lovan/ap\n\nin his latest effort to boost the coal business — and in the process help a major supporter — president trump has called on the tennessee valley authority to, essentially, ignore the advice of its staff and keep a large coal-fired power plant operating.\n\nthe move has drawn extra scrutiny because that plant buys coal from a company headed by a large campaign donor to trump, murray energy corp. chairman, president and ceo robert murray.\n\nthe facility at issue is the last remaining unit at tva's paradise fossil plant in western kentucky.\n\nin an environmental assessment signed monday. tva staff proposed retiring the coal-fired plant. the report says, as a large coal unit with medium operating costs and a high forced outage rate, as well as the need for significant repairs, paf unit 3 does not fit current and likely future portfolio needs.\n\nthe staff also has proposed closing another coal power plant in eastern tennessee called the bull run fossil plant.\n\nthis continues a trend at the tva of shuttering coal plants in favor of other sources for generating electricity, including natural gas and renewable energy. the move has helped attract companies like google that build large data centers and want to power them with cleaner sources of energy.\n\ndespite that, president trump said on twitter monday evening, coal is an important part of our electricity generation mix and @tvanews should give serious consideration to all factors before voting to close viable power plants, like paradise #3 in kentucky!\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky and energy secretary rick perry also took to twitter to echo the president's message.\n\nthe agency responded on twitter, mr. president, coal is an important part of tva's power generation mix and we will give serious consideration to all factors as we make this decision.\n\ncaught between market reality and political pressure\n\nfour of the nine members of tva's board of directors were appointed by trump. two other posts are currently unfilled. the board could vote on whether to close the plants at its quarterly business meeting thursday in chattanooga, or the agency could choose to delay the decision.\n\nfirst the board will hold a public hearing on wednesday, at which environmental groups say they will show up in force to ask the board to close down the coal plant.\n\ncoal is a bad choice for the people of the tennessee valley. not only because it's uneconomical but because it's a dirty way to generate energy, says jonathan levenshus with the sierra club's beyond coal campaign.\n\nin an emailed statement, murray energy corp. reached the opposite conclusion of tva staff and said, in the interest of the tva ratepayers, the remaining coal-fired unit at the paradise plant must remain in operation. the power will be more reliable and lower cost.\n\ndespite concerns about coal's significant contributions to climate change, president trump has made his support for the coal business a key point during his election campaign and presidency.\n\nlast year trump ordered perry to take steps to help struggling coal and nuclear power plants, which have trouble competing against cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. no such plan has been carried out so far. meanwhile, coal plants have continued to close during trump's time in office, and coal consumption in the u.s. has hit its lowest point in nearly four decades.
are cyborgs in our future? 'homo deus' author thinks so\n\nhomo deus a brief history of tomorrow by yuval noah harari hardcover, 449 pages | purchase close overlay buy featured book your purchase helps support npr programming. how?\n\nthe human species is about to change dramatically. that's the argument yuval noah harari makes in his new book, homo deus: a brief history of tomorrow.\n\nharari is a history professor at hebrew university in israel. he tells npr's ari shapiro that he expects we will soon engineer our bodies and minds in the same way we now design products.\n\ninterview highlights\n\non how we will begin to engineer bodies\n\nthe three main ways of doing that, first of all, is to take our organic body and start tinkering with it with things like genetic engineering, speeding up natural selection and actually replacing it with intelligent design — not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds, but our intelligent design.\n\nthe other way is to start combining organic with inorganic parts and creating cyborgs. for four billion years all of evolution — not just of humans but of all beings — was confined to the organic realm, but very soon we might be able to break out of the organic realm using things like brain-computer interfaces, which combine organic parts like an organic brain with inorganic parts like bionic hands or eyes or ears.\n\nand then the third and most extreme path is to create completely inorganic beings not even needing an organic brain, but using instead artificial intelligence.\n\non one way a future medical breakthrough could be used to upgrade a healthy person\n\ni think in general medicine in the 21st century will switch from healing the sick to upgrading the healthy. ... if you find ways to repair the memory damaged by alzheimer's disease or dementia and so forth, it is very likely that the same methods could be used to upgrade the memory of completely healthy people. and if you find ways to connect brains and computers, you can rely on memory's immense databases outside your own brain. we are starting to do it, in a way, with our smart phones and computers, but what we may see in coming decades is humans actually merging completely with their smart phones and computers.\n\non biological inequality\n\nit's likely that all the upgrades, at least at first, will cost a lot and will be available only to a small elite. so for the first time in human history we might see economic inequality being translated into biological inequality. and once such a gate opens, it becomes almost impossible to close it because then the rich will really be far more capable than everybody else.\n\non what can be done to control the growth of bioengineering and artificial intelligence\n\none thing that we need to do is start thinking far more seriously about global governance because the only solution to such problems will be on a global level, not on a national level.\n\nactually, of course, in the last year or two we are seeing a retrograde movement away from globalist thinking and into more nationalist and isolationist thinking, and this is very dangerous. i mean, traditionally, people said that nationalism is dangerous because it leads to war. but now nationalism is far more dangerous because not only it leads to war, it also may prevent us from having any effective answer that can help us cope with dangers like the rise of artificial intelligence or the implications of bioengineering.
after attacks on election integrity, georgia officials work to rebuild confidence\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption stephen fowler/georgia public broadcasting stephen fowler/georgia public broadcasting\n\nit's been more than a week since the georgia senate runoff elections delivered control of congress to democrats.\n\nbut inside the bartow county, ga., senior center on tuesday, a dozen teams worked in pairs to do a hand recount of more than 43,000 votes cast in the jan. 5 runoffs.\n\nthe final margin for the races are outside the threshold for a recount, and the voters in this county an hour northwest of atlanta are about 75% republican — so the result isn't close, or expected to change.\n\nso why did poll workers spend a day conducting a voluntary audit at the end of an exhausting election cycle?\n\na lot of my voters, a lot of my citizens, do not trust the voting system after november, after a lot of misinformation went out about this specific system, elections director joseph kirk said.\n\nkirk is a firm believer in transparency and education when it comes to the state's voting system - especially after one of the most secure elections in state history, one that saw record turnout and few reported problems.\n\nbut georgia was also ground zero for misinformation and attacks on election integrity, led by president trump and a number of top republicans in georgia and beyond.\n\noutgoing sens. kelly loeffler and david perdue made last-minute pushes to support a challenge to the electoral college, the chair of the georgia republican party and other lawmakers backed lawsuits seeking to overturn the state's presidential results and the republican-led legislature held hearings that promoted false claims of voter fraud and promised to crack down on voting rights.\n\nthe november election saw president trump lose georgia by about 12,000 votes and the 5 million ballots cast were counted three times, including a full hand audit required by law.\n\nkirk believes audits should happen after every election as a way to help the public trust their votes are counted and verify voting equipment functions correctly.\n\ni've spent a lot of time since the november election explaining to people on the phone that i know your vote was counted accurately, because we went back and checked that we did, he said. why would i want to stop saying that now?\n\nin this case, the audit examined the senate election between former republican sen. david perdue and democratic sen.-elect jon ossoff. ballots were checked by pairs of election workers that audibly read off votes on the page, confirming with their partner before moving to the next one. from there, stacks of ballots are then counted in groups of 10 before each batch is entered into a tally sheet and eventually compared to the final totals.\n\nstate election board member matt mashburn stopped by the audit and was pleased with the process but frustrated with fellow republicans who have spent weeks pushing conspiracies about the election and eroding faith and trust.\n\nthe paradox is that we have these tools that we've never had before so that we can have a fair count and be confident with the tabulation and the results, he said. but the public has the least amount of confidence.\n\nin deep-red bartow county, many republicans expressed concerns with 24/7 absentee drop boxes, vote counting and the machines picked by the gop legislature. in november, one voter even called the police to investigate a polling place for having a mysterious connection to china. it was just a power cord.\n\nwhile fewer members of the public were there to watch the audit than november's vote count, those who were there said it was still an important step in becoming an informed voter.\n\nfor republican monitor judy kilgore, it helped seeing things with her own eyes, and knowing that some of her friends and neighbors she trusted were the ones doing the counting.\n\ni can personally hear them, i can walk around the tables, i can observe what they're doing, she said.\n\nkilgore said rhetoric around voting wasn't helping turnout, especially for republican candidates in an increasingly competitive state.\n\nyou want to be able to get people to the polls to vote, you want them to have confidence in their vote, that it does count, she said. if you want your candidate to win... put a little bit more effort in it, but don't sit back and be an armchair supervisor.\n\nin the aftermath of the 2020 election cycle, observing how the electoral sausage gets made isn't just something for skeptical republicans. democratic monitor karen tindall threw herself into volunteering this year at the age of 71, in part because she wanted to help take partisan politics out of the way our votes are counted.\n\ni think we just need to talk about the process and explain it to people because the elections are safe and they are fair, she said. i think our elected officials have to think more about their oath of office to the constitution and not their allegiance to their party... i mean, you have elected officials who are outright lying about how the elections went!\n\nafter working for about eight hours, the final margin of error in bartow county was less than a tenth of percent from the original results - expected, kirk said, because humans are involved in the counting process that is normally done by machine.\n\nthe audit comes as georgia's legislature gets back to action, and some republican lawmakers have promised to crack down on absentee ballots after spending weeks spreading misinformation and false claims of fraud.\n\nthere are signs that changes might not be so extreme: state sens. brandon beach and burt jones were stripped of their committee chairmanships after backing lawsuits trying to overturn georgia's election results. a third senator, matt brass, was removed from the prestigious redistricting committee in favor of a lesser post.\n\nand while some lawmakers floated the idea of removing no-excuse absentee voting enacted by (and primarily used by) republicans for the last 15 years, republican house speaker david ralston said he would appoint a new bipartisan committee to tackle any changes.\n\nmany georgians are concerned about the integrity of the election system: some of those concerns may or may not be well founded, but there may be others that are, he said wednesday at a georgia chamber of commerce event. what we are trying to do is go through the perceived problems in a very thoughtful and responsible way.
u.k. judge rejects julian assange's bail request, citing flight risk\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption matt dunham/ap matt dunham/ap\n\nupdated at 8:20 a.m. et\n\njulian assange will remain in a british prison after a u.k. court denied his request to go free on bail wednesday, citing the u.s. government's ongoing attempts to extradite the wikileaks founder to face espionage charges.\n\ndistrict judge vanessa baraitser — who gave assange a court victory earlier this week by rejecting the u.s. extradition request — ruled that assange must be held in custody while the u.s. government appeals, saying he poses a flight risk.\n\nassange will remain in belmarsh prison in south-east london, where he has been held since the spring of 2019. he was arrested after spending seven years in the ecuadorian embassy in london.\n\nit is extremely disappointing that even though the request for mr. assange's extradition to the united states has been denied, he will continue to be held in a maximum security prison in london, under lockdown during a pandemic, assange's attorney barry pollack said after the ruling. he added, we look forward to the day that he can be reunited with his family.\n\nbaraitser denied assange's application for bail days after she ruled that because of assange's mental health and the risk of suicide, it would be oppressive to extradite him to the united states of america.\n\nin court wednesday, baraitser said that assange's mental health condition is being sufficiently managed by prison officials and staff, contrary to the views of assange's legal team and supporters.\n\nassange has now been fighting extradition for the better part of a decade, initially avoiding being sent to sweden to face a criminal inquiry there, and then eluding u.s. attempts to haul him into federal court to face a raft of charges related to the publication of sensitive diplomatic cables and secret military records from the iran and afghanistan conflicts.\n\nin court wednesday, lawyers representing the u.s. said that if assange goes free on bail, at least one other country has already offered him political asylum. mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador made the offer earlier this week, saying, assange is a journalist and deserves a chance, i am in favor of pardoning him.\n\nassange's legal team insists he does not represent a flight risk, noting the protections of the british legal system as well as the looming change in u.s. leadership, as the associated press reports. it's not yet known, his attorneys said, whether a biden administration would pursue assange's extradition. his attorneys also say assange has personal reasons to stay put, citing his relationship with his partner, stella morris, and their two children.
trump administration rule endangers chesapeake wetlands, environment advocates say\n\ntoggle caption gary emeigh/ap photo\n\ntens of thousands of acres of wetlands in the chesapeake bay watershed will lose federal protection under a new trump administration rule that was finalized on thursday. it's the latest regulatory rollback that could impact the bay's health.\n\nprior to his election, president trump promised to do away with the obama-era rule known as waters of the united states, or wotus, which defined which waters are protected under the clean water act. trump's replacement for that rule only protects wetlands if they are directly touching a major body of water. it's known as the navigable waters protection rule, and the epa says it will result in economic growth across the country.\n\nbeth mcgee with the chesapeake bay foundation says the rule will open up many wetlands on the eastern shore to development.\n\nwetlands are really great filters of pollutants, mcgee says. we would lose that filtering capacity.\n\nandrew wheeler, administrator of the environmental protection agency, said in a press release that the change would provide much needed regulatory certainty and predictability for american farmers, landowners and businesses. the question of which waterways are protected by federal law has been subject to argument and litigation — all the way up to the u.s. supreme court — ever since the passage of the clean water act in 1972.\n\nbut environmental groups say the new rule puts business interests ahead of clean water.\n\nit really flies in the face of all this good science, says mcgee. she says wetlands that appear isolated are still connected to the bay and have a big impact on water quality. it doesn't have to be a visual connection, and those connections are important ecologically as well as in terms of our ability to manage and reduce pollution.\n\nthe epa's obama-era wotus rule was based on a review of more than 1,200 peer-reviewed scientific articles. the review found ample evidence that isolated wetlands provide physical, chemical, and biological functions that could affect the integrity of downstream waters. wetlands closer to the water, in the riparian zone, are physically, chemically, and biologically integrated with rivers, according to the review, published in 2015.\n\none of trump's early acts as president was an executive order in february 2017 to review and revise the wotus rule.\n\ntrump said in a speech earlier this week that he terminated one of the most ridiculous regulations of all: the last administration's disastrous waters of the united states rule. he gave those remarks at the american farm bureau federation's annual convention.\n\nthat was a rule that basically took your property away from you, trump said.\n\nbut tom pelton of the environmental integrity project, a nonprofit working to support environmental law enforcement, says the biggest winners won't be farmers.\n\nwhat this is really is a huge victory for someone like — i don't know, a donald trump or another developer who wants to build 1,000 homes in the middle of fields and including some wetlands. they now will have more of a free hand to destroy that natural habitat, pelton says.\n\npelton co-authored a report in 2018 finding that more than 30,000 acres of wetlands would lose protection under trump's regulatory rollback. he says that while state regulations do protect some of these wetlands, those rules may not be enforced as stringently.\n\nthis is going to be a real setback for the chesapeake bay cleanup, pelton says.\n\nbeth mcgee of the chesapeake bay foundation says that within the chesapeake watershed, maryland, virginia and pennsylvania have state protections in place for isolated wetlands, but d.c. and delaware do not. in d.c., she says, about 10% of remaining wetlands could lose protection under the rule change.

census bureau stops work on trump's request for unauthorized immigrant count\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrew harrer/bloomberg via getty images andrew harrer/bloomberg via getty images\n\nupdated friday at 9:26 p.m. et\n\nthe u.s. census bureau has halted all work on president trump's directive to produce a state-by-state count of unauthorized immigrants that would have been used to alter a key set of census numbers, npr has learned.\n\nsenior career officials at the bureau instructed the internal team assigned to carry out trump's presidential memo to stand down and cease their work immediately on tuesday night, according to a bureau employee who spoke to npr on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation in the workplace for speaking out.\n\nthe move by civil servants effectively ends the bureau's participation in trump's bid to make an unprecedented change to who is counted in the 2020 census numbers that will be used to reallocate each state's share of congressional seats and electoral college votes for the next decade. according to the 14th amendment, those counts must include the whole number of persons in each state.\n\nin a court filing friday, justice department attorneys confirmed that none of the data trump would need to alter the congressional apportionment counts would be released before trump's term ends. it is impossible now for the administration to carry out trump's plan, doj attorney brad rosenberg told u.s. district judge lucy koh during a virtual court conference for a national urban league-led lawsuit over the census schedule.\n\nthe president's memo, which was issued in july, was found to be unlawful, unconstitutional or both by three lower courts last year before the supreme court ruled in december that it was too early for any court to weigh in because the case is riddled with contingencies and speculation.\n\ntrump's effort has already been hampered by schedule delays stemming from irregularities in the census records that, in addition to the coronavirus pandemic, have resulted in the bureau extending the time for running quality checks and pushing back the release for the first set of census results.\n\nthis week, a justice department attorney informed koh, the federal judge hearing the lawsuit about the census schedule, that the state population counts needed for reapportioning house seats and electoral votes are not expected to be ready until march 6, more than a month into the administration of president-elect joe biden, who has condemned trump's attempt to exclude unauthorized immigrants.\n\nthe american civil liberties union, one of the groups that led a lawsuit against trump's memo, is calling for biden to formally rescind trump's policy after becoming president.\n\ndoing so would send the message that under our constitution, everyone in this country counts, dale ho, director of the aclu's voting rights project, said in a statement.\n\nthe census bureau's public information office has not responded to npr's request for comment.\n\non tuesday, another trump administration push for data about unauthorized immigrants, as well as other noncitizens in the u.s., suffered a blow after the bureau's internal watchdog issued a memo revealing that the agency's trump-appointed director had pressured employees to produce a report by friday.\n\naccording to a memo by commerce department inspector general peggy gustafson, multiple whistleblowers at the bureau reported that they are concerned census bureau director steven dillingham was trying to rush out a data report on noncitizens that would be statistically indefensible and could be misinterpreted, misused, or otherwise tarnish the bureau's reputation.\n\nit remains unclear what exactly the trump administration would do with the data report on noncitizens. gustafson asked dillingham to provide a written explanation.\n\nin a reply on wednesday, dillingham said he told career employees to stand down on working on the technical report immediately after learning of staffers' concerns through the inspector general's memo.\n\ndillingham said that the report was a mechanism to assess the bureau's progress in fulfilling an executive order trump issued in 2019 after the supreme court blocked the administration's effort to add a citizenship question to census forms. that order calls for the bureau to use government records on citizenship from other federal agencies and some states to produce data on the number of citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens in the u.s.\n\nin response to npr's reporting on dillingham's directive, sen. jeanne shaheen of new hampshire, the top democrat on the senate appropriations subcommittee that funds the bureau, issued a tweet on tuesday criticizing trump for making a mission out of manipulating the census. the senator said she will work with the biden administration to repair the damage trump caused.\n\nleaders of civil rights groups — including the leadership conference on civil and human rights, the national association of latino elected and appointed officials educational fund and asian americans advancing justice - aajc — are calling for dillingham's immediate resignation. his appointment at the bureau is set to continue past the end of the trump administration and until the end of this year.\n\nafter considering director dillingham's efforts to undermine the agency's core standards of data quality in order to carry out a political agenda, the organizations' leaders — wade henderson, arturo vargas and john yang — said in a joint statement, we believe that he can no longer carry out his duties as the leader of our nation's most prestigious statistical agency.
shutdown could have long-term effects on wildfire disaster response\n\nfirefighters and forest managers are losing valuable time to prepare for the upcoming wildfire season. it's one of the long-term impacts of the government shutdown as it continues to linger on.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nlonger lines at airports, national parks closed and, of course, for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, missed paychecks and worry about keeping food on the table. the partial government shutdown has had some immediate impacts. the longer-term ones can be harder to see. npr's nathan rott has been reporting on how the shutdown could hurt the disaster response to wildfire. and, of course, this is happening after the worst wildfire season in california history. hey, nate.\n\nnathan rott, byline: hey, lulu.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so, nate, it's not fire season for most of the country right now.\n\nrott: no.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so what is that potential long-term impact?\n\nrott: well, so the issue is that this is the time of year where forest managers and firefighters usually do a lot of the administrative duties and preparatory work they need to for the upcoming season. and because so many - so much of the federal workforce is furloughed right now, those things aren't happening. so that's hiring for seasonal positions, contracts for aircraft that aren't getting done, contracts for heavy equipment.\n\na number of training academies and workshops have been canceled or put off, which means firefighters might not be able to get a specific qualification in time for the next season. perhaps more concerning than lost training, though, is lost time for projects that would reduce fire risk.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so make that real for us. what kind of projects are we talking about exactly?\n\nrott: so fuel mitigation projects, thinning operations to reduce vegetation in federal forests and prescribed fires. so prescribed fires are widely viewed as the best tool forest managers have to avoid the types of big, catastrophic wildfires that have, you know, become all too common each year. but because of the shutdown, those aren't happening on federal land right now.\n\nand the window in which to do them is closing in places like the southeast. this is prime time for prescribed fire there. i talked to jim karels, the director of the florida forest service, and he says the feds have already missed out on three weeks of good burning conditions there.\n\njim karels: you know, if you miss a whole month of the prime time, it's hard to catch up those acres at least for another year.\n\nrott: you know, and it's important to note most fire ecologists would tell you we're already way behind in that regard.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so it could be quite dangerous. and, nate, hasn't president trump tweeted repeatedly that there needs to be more forest management to prevent megafires?\n\nrott: yeah.\n\ngarcia-navarro: the shutdown clearly isn't helping that.\n\nrott: yeah. you know, and look, president trump is not wrong there. bad or misguided forest management, let's say, is one of the big reasons that we do have these big fires, you know, as well as climate change. the irony here though is that in a place like california, where i am now, the president keeps berating our forest management, threatening to withhold emergency funds. but more than 50 percent of california's forests are managed by the federal government. and right now, due to the shutdown, federal management isn't happening on those lands.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's npr's nathan rott. thank you so much.\n\nrott: thank you, lulu.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
'guide to freedom' documentary chronicles the real life 'green book'\n\nfilmmaker yoruba richen's documentary, the green book: guide to freedom, tells the story of the manual that helped african-americans find safe places to stay, eat, shop and do business on the road.\n\nterry gross, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm terry gross. the movie green book won three oscars last night, including best picture. we're going to talk about the new documentary the green book guide to freedom, which will be shown on the smithsonian channel tonight. the green book was a travel guide that was first printed in 1936, in the era of segregation, listing restaurants, hotels, shops and gas stations that would serve african-americans and that were safe for them. in 1967, following the signing of the civil rights act, the green book stopped publication.\n\nour guest is the director of the documentary, yoruba richen. she tells the story through archival home-movie footage and interviews with descendants of african-americans who used the green book and the children of business owners who were listed in the guide. the film shows the challenges and dangers black travelers faced, the limited options they had while on the road and the role business owners listed in the book played in the civil rights movement. yoruba richen is the director of the documentary program at the city university of new york's graduate school of journalism. her previous films include the new black and promised land. richen spoke to fresh air's dave davies about the green book.\n\ndave davies, host:\n\nwell, yoruba richen, welcome to fresh air. one of the things that makes the film so great is footage from the era and interviews from people who recalled these events. how'd you gather the material?\n\nyoruba richen: well, in terms of the footage, we initially went down to the national african museum of history in washington, d.c. they're a smithsonian partner. and as soon as i started to see this footage, this amazing home-movie footage of african-americans traveling, vacationing, working, i wanted to tell the film through this archival footage. and i really wanted to have a home-movie feel to it because that's what the green book was about. it was about african-americans traveling for, you know, vacation, to visit family and what their experience was like.\n\nand also the industry, the automobile industry, as we say in the film, was a huge employer of african-americans. helped us as we came out of the south from the great migration and get these jobs in the car factories, enter the middle class and the upper class. so the automobile is very significant for the african-american population.\n\ndavies: well, let's talk a little bit about kind of what conditions were like that led to the need for the green book. and i want us to hear a little scene from the film where we hear two sisters reminiscing about traveling when they were kids. their names are jennifer ivy (ph) and karen allen baxter (ph), who speaks first.\n\n(soundbite of documentary, the green book: guide to freedom)\n\nkaren allen baxter: we would go places. and i remember the routine had been my dad would get out first, check it out, and we sat in the car. then he would come out after a few minutes and say, ok, we can go in. but jennifer reminded me of one time where we had reservations. was it a...\n\njennifer ivy: hotel.\n\nbaxter: it was a hotel reservation. and when daddy showed up, they said all of a sudden there was no reservation.\n\nivy: he got back in the car very quickly and was upset. it was because it was late at night and dark.\n\nbaxter: they sent us down the road someplace. i remember my mother being very upset. and we ended up in this hotel or motel that was a converted barn. and i remember mommy saying it smelled like the animals were still there.\n\nivy: and it did.\n\ndavies: and that's from the film, the green book: a guide to freedom. our guest is the director yoruba richen. just talk a bit about the challenges african-americans faced traveling back in those days.\n\nrichen: you know, karen and jennifer are from new york. they traveled through new england with their family, and that instance happened when they were traveling to new england. and i say that because it's important to understand that this was not relegated to the jim crow south. the dangers and the humiliations and the fear were really all over the country.\n\nand in fact, in some ways the south was a bit easier to navigate because there were signs, so you knew exactly where you could and couldn't go. whereas in the north and the west, there weren't necessarily the signs but still the same conditions. so african-americans had to figure out where they would go, where they would be able to sleep and where they would be served. and as you just heard, they would walk into places sometimes and would be denied.\n\nand then, of course, there's the danger, the potential threat of violence that met african-americans. there were places called sundown towns that are all over the country, mostly in the north and the west. and these were places that african-americans had to leave before the sun went down. sometimes there were signs. sometimes they rang a bell so the workers who worked, the black workers who worked there, knew they had to get out of the town. and these were all over the country.\n\ndavies: right. and it was really striking how many more sundown towns there were in the north and midwest and west than in the deep south. why would that be?\n\nrichen: you know, i think it's because the south had legal segregation. i mean, it was legal. and that's where you know, obviously, with the history of slavery and all that, there was a system that was set up to discriminate against african-americans. and in the north and the west, that system was not as sort of visible, even though it was still there. so i think that the - those sundown towns, i mean, there were - you know, they were all over. and that racism that was throughout the country, these were specific places where african-americans were either run out of the towns for various reason, or they just never allowed african-americans to live in that town.\n\ndavies: and these were places where african-americans worked during the day but had to...\n\nrichen: some, yes. exactly. yeah.\n\ndavies: and if you happened to be driving through a sundown town without knowing it was a sundown town, you would...\n\nrichen: yeah, that's - you want to not do that (laughter).\n\ndavies: you know, when a lot of us are on a road trip, you take for granted that when it's lunchtime, you know, you could find a restaurant, or maybe you want to grab some food to eat in the car or go to a grocery store and get stuff for a picnic. an african-american family in this era faced a whole different challenges. they really had to think hard and prepare before they left, didn't they?\n\nrichen: yeah, absolutely. you know, at the screenings that we've had, we've had people stand up after the screenings and talk about how they remember, you know, their mom wrapping the fried chicken to bring on the road and the fruit that they would bring. and - you know, and they would just drive and not stop, or they knew only where to stop, specific places. we had one woman say, you know, she never knew why we only went to certain places. but, you know, as she got older, she knew that that was because they were using the green book. the family was using the green book and only going to the places that were designated. and they did. they had to prepare for these long journeys.\n\ndavies: and there's the matter of using the bathroom. that's hard to plan. how did people figure out how to do that?\n\nrichen: well, a lot of times there were, you know - you used the green book to figure out where you could do that, where there were gas stations and restaurants. you had to go on the side of the road. i think that one of the things that is interesting is rosa parks, before she was, you know, the woman that we know who refused to give up her seat on the bus, she worked investigating harassment of african-american women in the south. and one of the places that african-american women were most vulnerable was on public transportation or on train stations because they could not - they didn't have access to the facilities and had to go in the open sometimes.\n\nso this is a very deep reality that african-americans lived with and a big - a really big part of our experience that we don't talk about, really, when we talk about the black experience. you know, we have - often have a very narrow lens in looking at african-american history. and i think that the green book allows us to look at so much more.\n\ndavies: yeah. one of the men in the book said that when they would travel, he would bring a sheet in case they needed some kind of a screen or barrier just so...\n\nrichen: exactly.\n\ndavies: ...people could relieve themselves. wow.\n\nrichen: exactly. exactly.\n\ndavies: yoruba richen's new film is the green book: a guide to freedom (ph). it premieres at 8 o'clock eastern time tonight on the smithsonian channel. it's also available for streaming on the smithsonian channel. we'll be back in just a moment. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ndavies: this is fresh air. and we're speaking with filmmaker yoruba richen. her new film, about the travel guide to help african-americans find places they could stay and eat back in the days of segregation, is called the green book: guide to freedom. so how did the green book get started?\n\nrichen: it was created by a man named victor green, victor hugo green. first, you know, very good at branding, (laughter) called it the green book. and he was a postal worker based in harlem. and he had a jewish friend who had a guide to places in the catskills where jewish families could go and have recreation and pleasure and be safe. and he thought that would be a really good idea for african-americans. he knew that we needed such a guide. he also had a wife named alma, and alma had family in virginia. and they would go, and they'd travel from new york down to virginia to visit family. so he experienced what it was like to drive on the segregated roads.\n\ndavies: and how did he get the information for it? it's a big country. i mean, there was no internet obviously.\n\nrichen: (laughter) that's right.\n\ndavies: and people didn't call long-distance routinely. how did he build...\n\nrichen: i know.\n\ndavies: how did he build his network?\n\nrichen: yeah. i mean, it's pretty incredible, right? he did this all before computers. he was kind of the - one of the original crowd-sourcers. he had his network of black postal workers. and that was one of the industries, of course, where african-americans could break into, the postal service. and he had a network of black postal workers who he would get information from. so you know, where are the black businesses? where are the black communities? let me know.\n\nand they also encouraged business owners to advertise in the book. so these postal workers would be out, you know, delivering mail. and they saw black businesses, and they would tell them about the green book and encourage them to advertise in it. and then, a little bit later, he would always say in the green book - like, in the pages of the green book, he would always say, please send in your businesses.\n\nsometimes he would target markets that he was looking for. hey, we need more listings in springfield, miss., or what have you. so you know, it was a real early form of crowdsourcing. and of course, the distribution, he was able to partner with esso gas station. and esso distributed the green book in its gas stations.\n\ndavies: well, that's a big deal because corporate america were not exactly open to, you know, black employment, certainly not black management back then.\n\nrichen: absolutely. so esso's a really interesting case of how a corporation was really trying to be, like, on the progressive edge.\n\ndavies: and we should probably just say for younger listeners...\n\nrichen: sure.\n\ndavies: ...this is the parent company of what's now exxon, so a big, huge oil company.\n\nrichen: that's right.\n\ndavies: right.\n\nrichen: yes. it was standard oil then, and it was owned by rockefeller. rockefeller was one of the owners. and rockefeller was married to a woman. her last name is spelman. they were from a family of abolitionists. spelman was - they started the hbcu spelman college in atlanta, the women's college. so there was a history of working to advance racial african-american rights that rockefeller had. and he hired black chemists very early, or esso did. they had - they marketed to the african-american community. you know, they were also smart, and they knew that this was a a potential customer base.\n\ndavies: right. so he began this in 1936 when, you know, the auto industry was booming, and a lot of african-americans got jobs and could afford cars and were traveling more. how did he market it? i guess the esso gas stations were a good way.\n\nrichen: yep, esso gas stations. he eventually printed around 15,000 copies. and somebody actually got up at one of my screenings too and said, you know what? it's also important to remember that not everybody bought a copy. they would share a copy, so they would pass it to their neighbor, to their family member who was traveling, you know, who was about to take a road trip. and i think it was word of mouth. and the businesses had had them as well.\n\nand so i think it became - he had distributed 15,000 copies because of the esso connection. that really, you know, gave it a visibility that i think other travel guides didn't necessarily have. because there were some other black travel guides too, but the green book was the one that was the most well-known.\n\ndavies: so it really was nationwide. it wasn't primarily in the jim crow south.\n\nrichen: no, it was nationwide. i mean, victor green started in new york. he started with new york listings because there were places even in harlem at the time that african-americans were not allowed to go to. even in the, you know, african-american mecca, there was segregation, de facto segregation. so he started with with new york listings. and then, soon it went all over the country, really by the second or third edition. and then he was all over the world. by the end, he had incorporated europe, canada, mexico, the caribbean.\n\nand i think it's also important to know too that he started it as - it was called the negro motorist guide. and then, really by the early 1940s, he incorporated the negro motorist guide to travel and vacation. so that's another part of it too, that it was - the guide helped african-americans go to and find places where they could have vacation and leisure and recreation. so safety was a big part of it obviously, but this pursuit of leisure and vacation was also a part of it.\n\ndavies: yeah, i wanted to talk about some of those resorts. but first of all, what other kinds of businesses were in it besides hotels and restaurants?\n\nrichen: gas stations were listed, clubs, liquor stores, resorts, beauty shops, tailors. in the early ones, there were doctor's office and hospitals, i mean, because - and that just goes to show you, as someone says in the film, the breadth of businesses and services that african-americans were locked out of at the time.\n\ndavies: right. and auto repair could be a big deal if you're on the road too, i guess.\n\nrichen: absolutely, yeah. if your car breaks down, we can't all - you know, not all of us know how to change a tire on the road. so auto repair and gas stations were definitely a big part of the green book.\n\ndavies: besides places to stop and eat and stay, victor green started advertising resorts. tell us about a couple of them.\n\nrichen: that's right. yeah. very early on, the african-american vacation resorts started to be listed in the book. and one of the places that we profile in the film is idlewild in northwest michigan. idlewild was one of the biggest black resorts in the country. it had - they said there were, you know, during its heyday in the early '50s, 25,000 people coming out to idlewild.\n\nand it's so - such a fascinating place. it was developed. it started being developed in 1910. so really, really early on, african-american middle and upper class were coming to this, you know, coming to buy lots and build houses. one of the early developers was a - the first african-american surgeon at the university of chicago who started buying plots there. african-american developers, real estate owners. so it really allows us to see too the - how the african-american middle and upper class have always been a part of this country as well.\n\nand they had amazing entertainers who were there - sarah vaughan, louis armstrong, diahann carroll. all the entertainers would come to idlewild, and it was a safe haven. that's what - how everybody described it. it was a safe haven where african-americans could go and go into the lake and own property and have friends and reunite and really have a community. and it's still there. idlewild is still there. they are folks who are trying to redevelop some of the buildings, who've bought property there. they have events there. it's really a beautiful place. and there are other ones, too. there was american beach in florida, highland beach in maryland, murray's dude ranch in california, martha's vineyard in massachusetts. i mean, these african-american resort - vacation resorts were all over the country.\n\ndavies: one of the other interesting things about the film is that you note how many businesses that were advertised in the green book were owned by african-american women.\n\nrichen: as we were, you know, developing the film and finding the stories, the women owners became, you know, a real part of what we were finding - a real part of the, you know, how we were telling the story. and at one point, we looked in the green book, as they're all online, and there were just tons of these advertisements that women had sent in - women business owners had sent in. that's one of the backbones of our community, african-american women.\n\nand we have always been entrepreneurial and had that spirit of business creation. i think, even today, african-american women are the largest fastest-growing number of entrepreneurs. so, you know, they owned restaurants, and beauty parlors, tourist homes. and they're all through the book. and it's really a wonderful way to bring that history through the green book.\n\ndavies: right. and some of them were very small businesses. but some of these women were really, like, major business leaders in their communities.\n\nrichen: absolutely.\n\ndavies: you tell - talk about a woman named alberta ellis in springfield, mo.\n\nrichen: yes.\n\ndavies: tell us about her.\n\nrichen: yeah. she was amazing. i wish i had known her, but we talked to alberta's grandchildren. and alberta owned alberta's motel in springfield, mo. and she - at one point, she was one of the only listings in springfield. she started with a snack shop, and then she was able to buy - i think the local hospital, the land for the local hospital had closed. the local hospital had closed, and she bought that property and put it into...\n\ndavies: showed up with cash she had saved...\n\nrichen: yes.\n\n(laughter)\n\ndavies: ...and just got it. you know, it's a great story.\n\nrichen: exactly. and then bought that and created alberta's motel. and alberta's - i mean, everybody came through alberta's. they talk about james brown coming through and all the singers. and she was really a woman about town. she had her own money. she was independent. she had the family working there, working the motel. it was a real thing. and unfortunately, it's not still standing, but her grandchildren have really brought her story and kept her story alive.\n\ngross: we're listening to the interview fresh air's dave davies recorded with yoruba richen, director of the new documentary the green book, which will be shown tonight on the smithsonian channel. the documentary is about the travel guide for african-americans that's also referred to in the title of the feature film green book, which won the oscar for best picture last night.\n\nafter a break, we'll hear more of the interview. ken tucker will review a reissue of two ray charles country and western albums, and john powers will review a spy novel about an african-american woman working as an fbi agent during the cold war. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of jay mcshann's rose room)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to the interview dave davies recorded with filmmaker yoruba richen. her new documentary, the green book: guide to freedom, tells the story of the travel guide first published in the pre-civil rights era, listing places across the country where it was safe for african-americans to eat, shop, stay overnight and find medical help while travelling on american highways. the documentary will be shown tonight on the smithsonian channel.\n\ndavies: what role did the business owners that were in the green book play in the civil rights movement? there were some interesting stories here, weren't there?\n\nrichen: yeah. you know, i keep saying we've seen the footage of, you know, civil rights footage of marches and hoses being, you know, put upon african-americans, african-americans fighting back. but who pays for the movement? who - movements costs money. and the green book, lists one of the places - the gaston motel in birmingham, ala., whose owner is a man named a.g. gaston. a.g. gaston was one of the most successful black business people up until that time - multimillionaire. he had many different businesses. and one of those was the gaston motel. and the gaston motel was one of the headquarters where martin luther king - dr. martin luther king - fought the birmingham campaign.\n\nand with - the birmingham campaign was an effort to desegregate the businesses downtown. and birmingham was policed by a notorious, racist sheriff who had a lot of power in the town, bull connor. so the photo footage that we - you know, that we've found show martin luther king at the motel with dr. reverend abernathy really orchestrating this campaign. and a.g. gaston was the owner, let them stay for free and also gave money even though he disagreed - he was more conservative. and he disagreed with a confrontational approach, initially. so he and dr. king would kind of go at it about, you know, what's the right way forward to fight - you know, to fight for civil rights. but he's a really unsung hero of the movement. and so it was really wonderful to be able to talk to his niece carol jenkins, who is an esteemed reporter in her own right, about that history.\n\ndavies: right. i have to say one thing that made this part of the story really fascinating is, you know, when movements for change occur - years later, we know kind of the outcome. and it all seems predetermined. but back then, there were these real debates. i mean, how hard can you push? how far do you go in potentially alienating other supporters? and king was pushing harder. gaston was an established businessman, and so while king was pushing action on the street - had lines of communication to the department store owners. and did they work together? did they - i mean, how did that - was it an alliance? was it an - what was the relationship like?\n\nrichen: i think it was an alliance and also a give-and-take. so there are things i know that king did that gaston did not support. one of those was the children's march. during that campaign, they had all the students come out and march. and gaston thought that was a bad idea, and there was violence around that. and gaston didn't want the children - was worried about the children being attacked. but also, too, gaston bailed king out of jail. he let them stay for free. and he does talk about how he realized that there needed to be a more confrontational approach when he saw the hoses on the people in the park and - you know, the strength of the hoses literally making someone barrel down the sidewalk. and he knew that things had to change and that confrontation was going to - you know, it was the only way to attack this problem.\n\ndavies: and there's this amazing footage. and i think it's in the parking lot, maybe, of the a.g. gaston motel in birmingham in which gaston himself is announcing an agreement to integrate some of the shopping areas, right?\n\nrichen: absolutely, yeah. so they did win in that they had an agreement with the business owners for - to integrate the downtown. now, of course right after that, riots and violence kind of blew up all over the country. so, you know, there was progress made in this particular moment, but it's - it certainly didn't solve the problem of what was happening nationally. we were in the midst of the heat of the movement.\n\ndavies: the green book was published over, like, a 30-year span. but i'm curious whether the copy in the book addressed issues of racism and discrimination, or did it simply accept it as a fact of life and say, this is how we're going to get around it?\n\nrichen: it wasn't until the later editions where you had the book addressing what the conditions were. in one of the later copies in the '60s, it says - you open it up, and it says know your rights. and it had, you know, the places - the civil rights laws that were passed on a state level in every state. but it was not a political - necessarily a political book. remember how it was being distributed. it was being distributed by a white-owned business. so it wasn't going to be too political in its pages. but it did have - i mean, the way...\n\ndavies: but that - that business being the standard oil company at its gas stations.\n\nrichen: yeah, exactly.\n\ndavies: right. yeah, yeah.\n\nrichen: yeah. yeah, i mean, i would imagine that there is certain - you know, he knew what he had to do in order to get wide distribution. but later in the - later in its pages, it did have more acknowledgement of, you know, what was going on and the fight for civil rights that was happening in the country.\n\ndavies: were there white-owned businesses advertising in the book also?\n\nrichen: yes, there were. there were white-owned businesses. i don't know if they advertised. i didn't necessarily see any advertisements in terms of, like, pictures. i do remember seeing in one one chinese-owned business that advertised in the book. i remember that. so there were some white-owned businesses and other races as well who owned businesses in the book.\n\ndavies: so the green book ceases publication in 1967. is that right?\n\nrichen: that's right. 1967 is the last year it's published.\n\ndavies: right. and i guess that obviously has to do with advances in the civil rights movement and the end of legal segregation.\n\nrichen: that's right.\n\ndavies: what did that mean for all these businesses that were - you know, that offered these services over the decades?\n\nrichen: it's kind of the unintended consequences of desegregation. i mean, when we had segregation, we also had many businesses that served the african-american community and that we went to as african-americans. obviously with the end of the passage of the civil rights act, that ended legal segregation. the businesses opened up, and that meant that african-americans could now go to the holiday inn - not just the gaston motel, for example.\n\nand it also meant that there was competition for those african-american dollars. and with that competition, you also need money in order to have your place meet certain standards or to have it, you know, be able to compete against the holiday inn or what have you. and that was a challenge for black businesses. you know, we had these businesses. and we're entrepreneurs, but we didn't necessarily have the economic support from the banks, for example, that could help us maintain these businesses. so what you find is that after the passage of the civil rights act, many of these businesses started to close.\n\ndavies: right. and there's plenty of footage in the film of parking lots that are overgrown and buildings, you know, in disarray. about a third of them still standing, right?\n\nrichen: that's right - about a third. yeah.\n\ndavies: is there an effort to preserve or revive these businesses?\n\nrichen: yeah, there is in some cases. one of the most exciting cases is the gaston motel where the national historic trust made the gaston - designated the gaston a historical landmark and is in the process of renovating or will begin renovating the motel for reuse. so that's a really big effort that was helped by the fact that it was - that president obama named it a historical landmark. in places like idlewild, there is definitely an effort to get african-americans - and not just african-americans but people to buy land there, to renovate, to hold on to that history. it's more of, you know, a - unofficial effort. but that - those efforts still are going on.\n\ndavies: you know, your film comes out the same year as the feature film green book, starring viggo mortensen and mahershala ali, based on the story of tony vallelonga driving don shirley, the african-american pianist around the south. have you seen the green book movie, the commercial film?\n\nrichen: i have. yeah.\n\ndavies: yeah.\n\nrichen: yeah.\n\ndavies: yeah. and your thoughts?\n\nrichen: before i saw it, i had - you know, definitely had kept up with the sort of criticism it was getting around - of course it's winning a lot of awards, but the criticism it was getting from the family of dr. shirley - that this was, you know, a story told by the white driver's perspective. and that's certainly the case. it's not really - it's definitely through a certain lens. that's the white driver's lens. but in terms of the green book - the thing that i found frustrating is that it only shows places that they go to, you know, through the green book as being - really as dumps, as really not nice places. and that's not the case.\n\nthere were so many - you know, there were more than 9,500 listings in the book over the years and places like the gaston, which was considered the finest negro motel in the country. so that was frustrating to see that portrayal of the green book in the film. and the other thing is that they only used it - they only picked up the green book when they were in the south. and that plays into the mythology that this was - you know, racism was something that was only in the south. so those were my two big criticisms in terms of, you know, how the green book was portrayed.\n\ndavies: well, yoruba richen, it's been great. thanks so much for speaking with us.\n\nrichen: it's been a pleasure. thank you so much for having me.\n\ngross: yoruba richen directed the new documentary the green book: guide to freedom. the film will be shown tonight on the smithsonian channel and will also be streaming. her interview with fresh air's dave davies was recorded last week. the documentary is not to be confused with the feature film green book, which won the oscar for best picture last night. coming up, ken tucker reviews the reissue of two ray charles albums of country music songs. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of sonny rollins' toot, toot, tootsie)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website

got a second for 'haikus with hotties'? now you can enjoy them all year\n\ntoggle caption lane dorsey\n\nin my house growing up, the walls of every room — including the bathroom — were decorated with several calendars. (is this a chinese-american thing? an immigrant family thing? i've always wondered.)\n\nsubject matter didn't matter. my mom tacked up the glossy freebies mailed to us by various insurance companies, featuring flowery landscapes and vintage muscle cars. these hung next to the calendars handed out to customers at the 99 ranch grocery checkout line, which featured the same image all year long: the chinese character fu — luck — rendered in brush calligraphy and gold foil on crimson card stock.\n\nthese days, i rely on a digital calendar synced to my email and smartphone; i couldn't tell you the last time i consulted a paper calendar hanging anywhere, least of all the bathroom (though at my mom's house, that decorating choice still persists).\n\nbut i recently came across a tweet from phil yu, the angry asian man blogger, about an intriguing new kickstarter campaign: the haikus with hotties 2016 calendar.\n\nnow, if the producer of asian-america's pre-eminent news and pop culture site deems something #veryimportant, i of course have to click to find out more. also — ok, fine — maybe it had something to do with the picture attached to the tweet: two shirtless men lounging at the beach with neon floaties hugging their tanned, chiseled abs.\n\ntoggle caption courtesy of haikus with hotties\n\nthe hotties in question were yoshi sudarso and peter adrian sudarso, chinese-american actors who also make comedy videos on youtube. in august, the sudarso brothers appeared in audrey magazine, the asian-american women's lifestyle publication, as a part of haikus with hotties, a photo-and-poetry series that runs in every issue. interview questions are posed in the 5-7-5-syllable haiku verse scheme, and must be answered in form. one choice poetic exchange from audrey's collaboration with the sudarsos:\n\naudrey: does good emoting come from the heart, the soul or those hot pink swim trunks? yoshi and peter: it comes from long hours spent on selfies on our phones but the trunks did help!\n\nada tseng, a former contributing editor at audrey, conceived of haikus with hotties back in 2013 when the magazine assigned her to interview godfrey gao, the taiwanese-canadian model/actor named the world's first asian male supermodel after appearing in an ad campaign for the luxury brand louis vuitton.\n\nit was going to be an email interview, tseng explains, and she wanted to find a way to have fun with it. gao agreed to the idea of writing haiku, and the series was born.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of haikus with hotties courtesy of haikus with hotties\n\nsince her interview with gao, tseng has exchanged poetry with several asian and asian-american men of aesthetically pleasing genetic dispositions and/or physical prowess for the magazine, including comedic actor randall park (fresh off the boat, the interview), and yen chen, the piano prodigy turned american ninja warrior game-show competitor.\n\nlast summer, tseng and audrey decided to mount a kickstarter campaign to collect the magazine's photo series into a 12-month wall calendar for 2016, adding six more asian-american hotties to round out the year, plus a cover model (that honor went to shannon kook, a hapa chinese actor from south africa).\n\na freelance journalist and editor, tseng is a longtime contributor to asia pacific arts and xfinity asia and is the host and producer of bullet train, a podcast on asian-american culture and arts. when we chatted about the calendar and her work for audrey and other culturally specific media outlets, tseng could be wryly facetious — maybe some people supported the calendar because they think there isn't enough representation of asian-american men in hollywood ... but really, it's probably just people who think these guys are hot, right? — and then absolutely sincere about her belief in the power and influence of diversity in pop culture and media representation.\n\nyou see the statistics, for example, of how with online dating, asian-american men are the least desirable, she says. for me, that's so strange. i've been covering asian and asian-american pop culture for so long. if you watch korean dramas, or bollywood films, how could you not find the men attractive?\n\nthere's been a lot of discussion lately on how race and ethnicity affect success in romantic matches. an okcupid report surveying data from 25 million accounts from 2009-2014 revealed that asian-american men were consistently rated the least attractive (in comparison with black, latino and white men) by non-asian women.\n\nracial preferences in dating, a 2008 columbia university study of more than 400 individuals in speed-dating sessions, found that while women of all races expressed a higher preference for dating a man of their same race, non-asian women were up to 65 percent less likely to indicate interest in seeing an asian-american man again after the four-minute speed date, the highest rate of rejection across the board.\n\nof the 14 men featured in the haikus with hotties calendar, 13 are pursuing careers as entertainers (the sole exception being mr. december, viet pham, a chef from utah who bested bobby flay on iron chef america), including several viral video producers, a stand-up comic, a reality tv star, and actors with credits in film and television. there was a political angle to the calendar, that there should be more hot asian men in hollywood, says tseng. i would guess that most of the guys, if not all, in the calendar have been asked about this issue at some point in their careers.\n\ntoggle caption courtesy of haikus with hotties\n\ntseng launched the kickstarter with a modest goal of raising just $1,000 to prove there was interest in such a project. one of the pledge levels, be the change you want to see, promised backers that in addition to getting a calendar of one's own, a second would be shipped to a hollywood casting agency with a note telling them to cast these hot asian-american male actors in their upcoming projects.\n\nwithin three days, the project was fully funded by nearly 100 backers who more than doubled the original goal.\n\ni didn't know who would be interested in this, tseng says with a laugh. my guess was that it would be people like me, other asian-american women, people who read audrey. she discovered, however, that the kickstarter backers weren't entirely asian, at least going by their last names. it seems much more diverse, she says.\n\nas for twitter feedback, tseng says, we got a mix of both men and women, and lgbtq supporters of the calendar. a quick search for the hashtag #haikuswithhotties turns up pages and pages of exuberant fans, many of them tweeting selfies with their calendars and tagging their favorite calendar models. one poetry enthusiast recently brought hers to be autographed at a comedy show with comedian hari kondabolu, the calendar's mr. october.\n\nlast year, on the heels of the haikus with hotties success, audrey announced that after 12 years as an independent publication, the magazine had been acquired by investors (along with sister publication koream journal) and would no longer be producing print issues. tseng, along with the rest of the editorial staff, was laid off.\n\nbecause the magazine's future is unclear — it may continue in a web-only format — the 2016 haikus with hotties calendar may become a one-time-only collector's item after this year. i would love for there to be a 2017 calendar, but there are no plans right now, tseng says. but if anyone wants to sponsor it ... \n\njean ho is a writer in los angeles. she is currently a doctoral candidate in usc's creative writing and literature ph.d. program.
devastating wildfires force california's largest utility to plan sale of gas assets\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption noah berger/ap noah berger/ap\n\nupdated at 6:29 p.m. et\n\nfacing staggering liability costs for its potential culpability in a series of deadly wildfires, the parent company of california's largest utility is exploring whether to sell off a major part of the company, npr has learned.\n\ninternally, pacific gas & electric has dubbed this strategy project falcon. under the plan, the company would sell its natural gas division this spring. after years of deadly errors and safety violations, the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy, a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell npr.\n\nall net proceeds from the sale of pg&e's gas division would be used to set up a fund to pay billions of dollars in potential claims from wildfires, the sources said. they requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nthe company also is exploring selling key real estate assets, including its san francisco headquarters, and moving its operations elsewhere in the bay area, the sources say.\n\non friday, the company announced it would bereviewing structural options to best position the company to meet customer and operational needs. in addition, pg&e said it is searching for new directors for its board to augment its existing expertise in safety.\n\npg&e declined to make any senior leaders available to comment on project falcon. a written statement from spokesman andy castagnola said, safety is and will continue to be our top priority as we work to determine the best path forward for all of our stakeholders. pg&e remains fully committed to helping our customers and the affected communities recover and rebuild — and to doing everything we can to reduce the risk of future wildfires.\n\nwildfire damages\n\nin june, the state's fire agency, cal fire, determined that pg&e power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across northern california in 2017. and now, regulators are investigating whether pg&e equipment sparked november's camp fire, the deadliest and most destructive in state history.\n\nthe company could end up having to pay billions from legal action stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons.\n\nequity analysts project that pg&e's damages from the wildfires could exceed pg&e's market value and its insurance coverage. one citigroup analyst estimates the company could be on the hook for up to $15 billion in damages.\n\ninsurance companies allstate, state farm and usaa have filed lawsuits against pg&e, blaming the utility for the camp fire.\n\nthe gas sale strategy would have to be approved by the state regulatory agency, the california public utilities commission, which has already expressed deep concerns about pg&e's shoddy safety record, lack of transparency and past efforts to pass liability costs on to the state's ratepayers.\n\nso far, state regulators and lawmakers have been kept out of pg&e's planning loop for project falcon, named for a group of peregrine falcons nesting on the roof of the company's headquarters.\n\nthe current and former pg&e officials say they're speaking with npr out of concern that senior management is not acting in the best interests of ratepayers, safety and the state. there's a public trust element in being a utility monopoly, said the senior company official.\n\nbailout?\n\npg&e is under no legal obligation to disclose its internal discussions about ways to stave off bankruptcy. but given the potential impact on ratepayers and taxpayers if the utility eventually needs a bailout, michael wara, a lawyer and research scholar at stanford university, calls the lack of transparency extremely disappointing.\n\nthey need to be thinking very hard about how to create safety for californians rather than how to make money for shareholders when they're not being totally transparent, especially in the current context where there's a lack of trust and so many people that have been harmed by pg&e's infrastructure, wara said.\n\nwhat california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. and it's hard to see that going on.\n\nwara added, what california urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. and it's hard to see that going on.\n\nwall street wants to see hard thinking, too.\n\nsteve fleishman, senior utilities analyst and a managing director at wolfe research, said pg&e's plan for dealing with fires in the future is unclear. they clearly seem to be more at risk for that, fleishman said. this kind of risk profile is not sustainable.\n\npg&e's stock is down about 50 percent since the camp fire broke out on nov. 8.\n\nconsumer watchdog groups want any big move done with transparency.\n\nanything pg&e wants to propose should be done in an open, public manner and include a comprehensive, coherent wildfire mitigation strategy, says mark toney, the executive director of the utility reform network.\n\nthere is widespread anger in the state over pg&e's shoddy safety record. protests broke out at recent public oversight meetings and at the company's san francisco headquarters, where environmentalists and activists read the names of the more than 100 people combined who died in the camp fire and 2017's wildfires in napa and sonoma counties. at one customer service center, the company has installed bulletproof glass.\n\n'serious safety problems'\n\nin late december, state regulators said they were considering several proposals in response to ongoing concerns about the utility's role in a deadly gas explosion in 2010 and in the more recent wildfires.\n\npg&e has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years, the california public utilities commission said in a statement.\n\npossible changes put forth by the commission include splitting up the gas and electric divisions and either making the company a public utility or making the company's return on equity contingent on safety performance.\n\nwe must be careful and practical, the commission's president, michael picker, said in a statement last month. this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it's in flight. crashing a plane to make it safer isn't good for the passengers.\n\nthe commission declined further comment for this story. a spokesman said only that state regulators are looking at a range of options for the utility.\n\nwe must be careful and practical. this process will be like repairing a jetliner while it's in flight. crashing a plane to make it safer isn't good for the passengers.\n\nin a separate development, the state's top law enforcement official, attorney general xavier becerra, said in a court filing in late december that pg&e could face criminal charges up to murder if it's found liable in any of the recent deadly california wildfires.\n\npg&e was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a san francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood. the federal judge overseeing the utility's five-year criminal probation in that case had asked becerra's opinion on whether pg&e's possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation.\n\nthe stakes\n\na sale would have big implications for the company, which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million california households and has more than 20,000 employees. pg&e's natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company.\n\nthe company sources who spoke to npr and provided supporting documents say the planning for project falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past june, when cal fire determined that pg&e was responsible for at least a dozen northern california fires. the planning, the sources say, has accelerated since the camp fire.\n\nthe sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators.\n\ncalifornia applies inverse condemnation to utilities, meaning they can be held liable for damage even if they are not found negligent.\n\nstructuring the deal\n\npg&e shareholders and institutional investors may welcome a gas sale as a way to cover, at least in part, wildfire liabilities.\n\nas part of the gas sale plan, all gross proceeds from the sale would go into the wildfire fund with no direct shareholder benefit from cash, according to the pg&e source. but shareholders could get new shares in the company that purchases the gas arm.\n\nregulators and lawmakers may argue that a deal should be structured to solely benefit wildfire victims and that any deal should come with protections for ratepayers.\n\nwe need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale, warns wara, the stanford researcher.\n\nthe inside sources say the company is hoping to get between $10.7 billion and $15.5 billion for its gas assets. given the company's safety, liability and political challenges — including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations — analysts say it's not at all clear they would get that on the open market.\n\nin mid-december, state regulators found that pg&e had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five-year period.\n\nat the time, pg&e spokesman matt nauman said in an emailed statement to npr that the company is committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record-keeping, and we didn't live up to that commitment in this case.\n\nthis comes on the heels of a $1.6 billion fine from regulators — the largest in state history — and six felony convictions related to 2010 san bruno explosion.\n\ntravis miller, senior utilities equity strategist at morningstar, is skeptical that a potential gas sell-off would fly with regulators or wall street. he said he doesn't think another utility would step forward to buy the gas assets.\n\nyou may get a good price, but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk, miller says. there's no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders, either.\n\nproject falcon and the camp fire\n\nthe company's fiscal woes deepened in the wake of november's camp fire in butte county, calif., which killed at least 85 people and displaced tens of thousands who continue to face a desperate housing crisis. paradise and neighboring towns were all but wiped out.\n\nthe cause of the fire is still under investigation by the state's fire agency cal fire. pg&e has told state regulators that it experienced problems on two sections of its electric system near where the camp fire erupted.\n\nthe company faces nearly two dozen lawsuits from fire victims over its possible culpability for the camp fire, including allegations of possible equipment failures and poor maintenance. in one lawsuit, residents accuse the company of prioritizing advertising spending over fire and public safety.\n\nnow it's clear there are problems on both sides of the business, says steve fleishman, an analyst with wolfe research, referring to the gas and electric divisions.\n\nfleishman says a gas sale and new management on the electric side might allow pg&e leaders to focus solely on improving safety. i think the company is willing do anything structurally if they think it can help with safety, fleishman says.\n\nanalysts warn that the company risks running out of access to capital, not just because of present liability, but also because of the risk of future catastrophic fires, a specter sharpened by climate change and a century of fire suppression policy in the nation's forests.\n\nthe company in november said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines. and the ratings agencies, moody's investor service and s&p, have downgraded the company's credit rating to near junk status.\n\napproval process will be complicated\n\ninternal pg&e planning documents on the potential sale, labeled privileged and confidential, show that company officials are concerned about regulatory approval.\n\nthe cpuc approval process will be complicated and lengthy, so phasing the proceeding to obtain early decisions on matters that are crucial to the viability of the transaction is desirable, one document reads.\n\nwhile the gas sale would cover some liabilities, the legislature also may be asked to step in. state lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout.\n\nanalysts and consumer advocates worry that lawmakers may expand that protection for this year and beyond, putting taxpayers and ratepayers on the hook.\n\nultimately, we're going to be left holding the bag, says michael wara of stanford university. if pg&e can't pay all of these costs, then it's the california taxpayer that ultimately will.\n\nbut some lawmakers are already balking.\n\nstate sen. bill dodd, who originally supported shielding pg&e from liability costs related to fires in 2017, has lost patience with the company.\n\npg&e has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across california, dodd said in an emailed statement. he called for systemic change, which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite.
on broadway, 'network' goes from satire to tragedy\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bruce glikas/wireimage bruce glikas/wireimage\n\none of the hottest tickets on broadway this season is network, the stage adaptation of the 1976 movie about a news anchor who cracks up on the air and the executives who exploit his ravings for ratings.\n\n\n\nivo van hove is directing the stage show. he says he first saw network in a belgian movie theater when he was a young man. my memory of it is that it felt like science fiction, he says. something which was impossible, which could never ever happen. when i read the script, now a few years ago, i thought well, this is the world that we live in today. so this was also the challenge, of course, how to make this work that was a little bit of a parody in its time — how to turn it into a tragedy.\n\nhoward beale's original rant youtube\n\nin network's climax, anchor howard beale hears a voice ordering him to go on the air and tell his audience the truth. in his pajamas, he rushes into the newsroom and on to the set to share his epiphany, and in the film, actor peter finch starts right in with his revelations: i don't have to tell you things are bad, he yells. everybody knows things are bad. it's a depression. everybody's out of work. or scared of losing their job ...\n\nbut here, the play differs from the film. actor bryan cranston — as beale — rushes into the tv studio, then spends seemingly endless silent minutes grasping for words. cranston says it's like the experience of waking up from a vivid dream, and we think 'oh, this is indelible!' and you start to try to recall it, and it dissipates, like fog. and so he collapses from that. and out of that despair and public humiliation comes the speech. cranston actually wells up with tears when he finally speaks.\n\nin both the screen and stage versions, beale's rants touch a nerve with his television audience and his ratings spike. the network executives seize the opportunity to build an entertainment program around his newscast: the anchor becomes a celebrity, and infotainment is born. keep in mind, screenwriter paddy chayefsky predicted this more than 40 years ago, and it won him an oscar.\n\nin his dressing room before a recent matinee, cranston said chayefsky's prescience was frightening. one of the speeches, if you recall, was 'only three percent of you people read books. only 15 percent read newspapers. the numbers were likely never that bad — but according to the most recent study, roughly half of all americans still prefer to watch the news on tv, with the internet not far behind. remember howard beale also says, 'don't look to us for the truth, because we just tell you what you want to hear,' cranston says.\n\ndirector van hove says that in the stage adaptation of network, the medium has become the message. as the action cuts between characters, the dialogue is recorded by actors with cameras, and broadcast live across huge screens that wrap around the set. one scene is even shot outside the theater, and follows a conversation between two actors on 44th street as they walk into the building and onto the stage.\n\nvan hove says he wanted to make the audience feel the intensity of being in the middle of a live tv show. if you have been in a live tv show, it's always a pressure cooker, he says. there's a countdown, and it's 7 o'clock, it has to start. you cannot wait. you cannot say 'stop, i'm not ready. let's do it again.' no, there's no doing it again. you do it once and it's over. and that thrill i wanted to give. and at the same time, another thing became for me important, that there would be cameras everywhere. it's as if the world became a television studio.\n\nthe play began at london's national theater in 2017. cranston says its message resonates on both sides of the atlantic. the idea of anger driving policy. of fear and demagoguery as a real motivation for change, whether you view it as good or bad, i.e. brexit, or donald trump becoming president. there's tremendous upheaval going on.\n\nhe says that over the course of network's trans-atlantic run, he's learned the value of expressing anger. you think that, 'what is that going to solve?' but in truth it does. it releases the pressure valve. somewhat. on some people just a little. on others maybe a lot. there's intrinsic value to that. to the human condition.
republican debate: which donald trump will take the stage tonight?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption geoff robbins/afp/getty images geoff robbins/afp/getty images\n\nthe remaining four republican candidates debate once again tonight, this time in miami. donald trump, ted cruz, marco rubio and john kasich will be on the stage together for the last time before next tuesday's big primary night, when voters in ohio and florida — rubio and kasich's home states — go to the polls. tuesday is a make or break night for the two of them and tonight's debate is the last chance they have to change the dynamic in a race that has not been going their way.\n\nhere are four things to watch — one for each candidate.\n\n1. how will trump behave?\n\nlately, the front-runner has been trying to appear more presidential, holding news conferences instead of rallies after his primary wins to project more gravitas. in the last debate, he announced that he was flexible and would change his positions if necessary in order to break the gridlock in washington. but that was just minutes before — and after — he talked about the size of his hands and a certain part of his anatomy. so we're not sure which trump will show up tonight — the one who calls his opponents stupid, fat, losers, or the one who promised on tuesday night: i can be more presidential than anybody other than the great abe lincoln. he was very presidential, right?\n\n2. does cruz punch up or down?\n\ncruz is in the no. 2 spot — only about 100 delegates behind donald trump. he has the strongest case to make that if the nominee is not going to be trump, it should be him. some establishment republicans in the #nevertrump movement are coming around to the idea that as much as they dislike cruz, he might be their only choice. lindsey graham, no fan of cruz's, says it may be time to rally around the texas senator. still, cruz has a total of zero endorsements from his fellow senators.\n\ntonight, does cruz use his formidable debating skills to try again to cut trump down to size, or does he attack rubio and kasich, whose continued presence in the race prevent him from consolidating the anti-trump vote?\n\n3. rubio on the ropes\n\nnow that jeb bush has left the race, rubio has become trump's preferred punching bag. rubio tried undermining trump with insults, but that didn't work. trump needled him about this on tuesday night, helpfully pointing out that, hostility works for some people. it doesn't work for everybody, ok? \n\nrubio has the most to lose next week. if he doesn't win his home state of florida, he will not only give up any shred of viability as a candidate, he could also hurt his political career going forward. unlike cruz and kasich, who have day jobs they can keep, rubio gave up his senate seat to run for president and is not running for re-election in the fall.\n\n4. kasich needs to win something\n\nkasich has an even worse record in this primary than rubio, who won in minnesota and puerto rico. kasich hasn't won anywhere. tuesday was a disappointment for kasich. he came in third in michigan, which is a rust belt state like his own ohio. kasich once had hopes of winning there or placing a strong second.\n\ntrump is beating him in the polls in ohio and kasich has said that if he doesn't win his home state he's done. so, tonight, what does kasich do to claw his way back into contention? does he continue his mr. nice guy strategy, showing voters that he's a reasonable, not very partisan, not very angry candidate who is as fed up with the antics of his opponents as they are? or does he actually try to take on trump?\n\ngranted, that hasn't worked for anyone else but there's not much time left.
wrestle like a girl: how colleges are pushing the ncaa to recognize women's wrestling\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption clay masters/iowa public radio clay masters/iowa public radio\n\nwrestling is a big deal in iowa. if you walk into any bar in the hawkeye state during its high school wrestling tournament, chances are the event is blaring on every tv in sight.\n\nlike many states, iowa doesn't offer separate sex divisions in high school wrestling, meaning that boys and girls must wrestle each other. despite the local popularity of the sport, there's not much of an infrastructure for its female athletes — only two girls have ever qualified to participate in iowa's state high school tournament since it started almost a century ago. many athletes, coaches and fans of female wrestling want the status quo to change, including charlotte bailey.\n\nthe 47-year-old coach has been coordinating the state's only standalone wrestling tournament for girls since 2012. bailey wants to see more girls involved in the sport, and says that parents can often be reluctant to have their daughters wrestling boys. she also thinks that girls have a better chance at long-term wrestling success — like making it to the women's national championships — if they're able to compete against each other at a young age instead of having to compete against boys. some [girls] will never know how good they would have been had they been wrestling their female peers, bailey said.\n\nthese barriers didn't stop 17-year-old felicity taylor, a senior at south winneshiek high school, from getting involved in the sport. after she was cut from the cheerleading team freshman year, taylor tried out for wrestling instead. now, she's the first girl in iowa high school wrestling history to win more than 100 career victories.\n\nachieving that record meant taylor had to compete against more than a few boys who have a problem wrestling girls. some of them don't like it, said taylor. they'll bump away from me, which frustrates me. you just gotta overcome that, and just deal with it, and know that they're bumping away for you for a reason ... they're scared.\n\ntaylor wants to continue her wrestling career at the collegiate level after she graduates from high school, but there are just a handful of collegiate women's wrestling programs in the u.s. — and at that level, women aren't allowed to wrestle men, despite the fact that many female high school wrestlers never had leagues of their own.\n\nwaldorf university in forest city is the only college in iowa with a dedicated women's wrestling team. it's one of 38 colleges that are part of the women's collegiate wrestling association, a league separate from the national collegiate athletic association, which doesn't recognize women's wrestling. tyreece gilder, 32, is the team's head coach. gilder says if the ncaa recognized women's wrestling, there would be an immediate boost in opportunities for women wrestlers seeking to compete at the collegiate level.\n\ngetting that recognition is a goal of the colorado-based group called wrestle like a girl. sally roberts, a two-time world bronze medal winner and three-time u.s. national champion wrestler, founded the organization to provide resources for women seeking to wrestle in college. roberts, a 37-year-old former marine, says the sport changed the course of her life from a young age. it's a sport that teaches girls life skills and how to own their space, own their bodies, own their voices, she said.\n\nthat's part of the formal pitch her group, and organizations like usa wrestling and the u.s. olympic committee, have been making to the ncaa to open its doors to female wrestling. there are a host of ncaa membership benefits that male college wrestlers can receive that their female peers don't have access to, including health insurance, scholarships, grants and internship opportunities. the wcwa provides its members health information and recognizes athletes who achieve certain gpas, but doesn't have the same financial assistance as the ncaa.\n\nseventeen ncaa colleges are ready to start women's wrestling teams if the ncaa will sanction them — including the university of iowa, which has won 23 men's ncaa championships and produced world and olympic medalists.\n\ngirls seeking success in wrestling say they want the same benefits and opportunities as their male peers already have — and by providing them to college athletes, many more girls in high school, like felicity taylor, might be inspired to get involved in the sport.\n\nwhy would you cut off half the population to such a great sport? said coach gilder. the sport offers so many benefits that it doesn't make sense to keep that half of the population out of it.\n\nnpr's emily sullivan produced this story for digital.
'expect change': robert lighthizer is trump's hardball-playing china trade negotiator\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption kevin lamarque/reuters kevin lamarque/reuters\n\nwhen u.s. trade representative robert lighthizer was growing up in ashtabula, ohio, in the 1950s, it was a thriving port town on lake erie where everyone who wanted one found a job. ships brought in iron ore destined for the steel mills of pennsylvania, and left with coal from the mines of appalachia.\n\nbut as steel and coal have declined, the ashtabula of lighthizer's childhood has disappeared, taking a lot of jobs with it.\n\nas a doctor's son, lighthizer grew up in relative comfort compared to a lot of other kids in ashtabula and he would leave town to go to college.\n\nbut those who know him say his experience in a blue-collar town, and its long decline since then, helped shape his views on trade.\n\nhe grew up in a working-class town and he knows how people have suffered by losing jobs, and i suspect that that's part of why he went into that part of the legal profession, says leo gerard, president of the united steelworkers.\n\nnow lighthizer is leading president trump's negotiations with china for what is shaping up to be the final round of trade talks that could change the destinies of the world's two largest economies.\n\nlighthizer has spent his long career defending american manufacturers against foreign competitors and warning that trade pacts such as nafta would cost the u.s. jobs.\n\nnow, as lead negotiator in the china trade talks, the 71-year-old lighthizer has an opportunity to do something about it.\n\nexpect change, expect new approaches, and expect action, he told a center for strategic and international studies audience in 2017.\n\na longtime washington attorney with a deep knowledge of trade law, lighthizer has a modest, unassuming manner that couldn't be much different from that of his boss, president trump.\n\nbut if he lacks trump's pugnacious style, lighthizer shares most of his hardball views on trade, a fact pointed out by the president last october, when he unveiled the revised version of nafta known as the united states-mexico-canada agreement.\n\nbob lighthizer is great. i've heard it for years. i said, if i ever do this, i want to get lighthizer to represent us, 'cause he felt the way i did, trump said.\n\nas far back as 1997, lighthizer was warning that china is not a true market economy and didn't play by the rules. if china was allowed into the world trade organization, he wrote, virtually no manufacturing job in this country will be safe.\n\nlike trump, he has argued that tariffs and quotas are a time-tested way of protecting american jobs when foreign countries engage in unfair trading practices.\n\nfor most of its 157-year history, the republican party has been the party of building domestic industry by using trade policy to promote u.s. exports and fend off unfairly traded imports. american conservatives have had that view for even longer, lighthizer wrote in 2011.\n\nuntil trump's election, these views placed lighthizer far outside the mainstream in washington, where one administration after another has promoted the economic benefits of trade.\n\nthe view in washington has been that opening up trade is good for the united states and good for the other countries involved. lighthizer is a professed economic nationalist. he's very much about what's in it for the united states, says edward alden, senior fellow at the council on foreign relations.\n\nlighthizer's role as a heretic in the church of free trade has earned him plenty of fans in the labor movement and among left-wing critics of trade, such as lori wallach, director and founder of public citizen's global trade watch.\n\nshe first crossed paths with lighthizer in the 1990s, during the original debate over nafta, which both opposed as a job-killer that would drive down u.s. wages.\n\nwe both were the odd fellows out, he from the right, me from the left, wallach recalls.\n\nback then, listening to each other, i suspect we both had the same reaction, which was: 'that's kind of scary! that right-wing, reagan-administration republican trade guy, is saying things that i 70-percent agree with!' and i have a feeling he thought, 'wait a minute! that ralph nader, public citizen, tree-hugging consumer group lady is saying things that i 70-percent agree with!' \n\nbut even those who don't share lighthizer's views on trade express a grudging respect for him.\n\nhe's bright, he's experienced, he's confident. he certainly understands these issues backwards and forwards, says former u.s. trade representative mickey kantor, who negotiated nafta under the clinton administration and says he disagrees with many of lighthizer's views.\n\nas an attorney in washington, lighthizer worked for the steel industry, handling dumping cases against foreign competitors.\n\nhe also served briefly in the reagan administration, working on a successful effort to force japan to limit its exports to the u.s.\n\ni think the japan experience told him the only way you make progress is through threats that you're prepared to carry out to restrict access to the world's largest market, which is the united states, says alden of the council on foreign relations.\n\nthe trump administration is now trying to apply the same strategy to china, betting that it can pressure beijing to address longstanding complaints about practices such as intellectual property theft.\n\nlighthizer has his work cut out for him, alden notes. after all, china has a long history of resisting pressure to reform its economy.\n\nthe problem is that what lighthizer is asking the chinese to do is quite radical, to significantly reduce the role of the chinese state and hence the communist party in directing chinese economic development. and it's not at all clear that the chinese leadership is prepared to do that, alden says.\n\nhe also worries that trump, in his eagerness to reach a deal with beijing, could impede the negotiations lighthizer is heading.\n\ntrump pretty much left the details of last year's nafta talks up to lighthizer. the president has taken a more direct role in the negotiations with beijing.\n\n[trump] continues to tweet about how much progress is being made, that a good deal is likely, that a big deal is likely. he's got this great friendship with president xi. he's personally going to bring home the deal, alden says.\n\nrecently, trump has hinted he may extend the march 1 deadline for completing the talks, which can only reduce lighthizer's leverage over beijing, alden says.\n\nlighthizer has a last, best chance to change a global trading system that has cost towns like ashtabula jobs. the risk now is that the man who appointed him could undercut his efforts.
with the economy crashing, brazilians turn on a once-popular president\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption anadolu agency/getty images anadolu agency/getty images\n\nthree years ago, npr visited the port of suape outside the northern brazilian city of recife when it was an example of brazil's booming economy. brazil's state oil company, petrobras, has a large refinery that was working full tilt.\n\ntoday the scene is very different. that big petrobras refinery still operates but it's had big layoffs. it's partially shuttered, weeds are growing on the side of the pavement. it's emblematic of what's happened here and in many parts of brazil.\n\nlast year, this northeastern state of pernanbuco lost 89,500 jobs, the most in the country. it's been a devastating turnaround for this historically poor region.\n\njorge leonel do nascimento, a stocky man with callused hands, is one of the men who suddenly found himself unemployed. he worked at suape during the boom years and says he thought they would never end. he bought a car. joined the expanding middle-class.\n\ni felt like i had achieved something, he said. in 2011, it was good for everyone. people were buying properties, electrical devices for their homes. there was hope.\n\nasked who he credited for the good times, he said he voted for president dilma rousseff in the last two elections, and before that, for her predecessor luiz inacio lula da silva, known as lula.\n\nnascimento says the worker's party, which goes by the acronym pt, was the only one that tried to change things in the poorer, blacker regions of the country. the party started a program giving money and food to poor families in the drought-stricken north that literally saved some from starvation.\n\nbefore, we were abandoned by the other parties, he said. when the pt came to the presidency, we became secure.\n\na dramatic turnaround\n\nor so he thought. when he was fired last year, he believed he'd find something else quickly. but it's been over a year and he's been doing odd jobs to make ends meet. brazil's economy is in the worst recession in generations. all the social programs started by the pt are being scaled back.\n\na few miles down the road from suape, you can see the impact.\n\nat an appliance store, new refrigerators and televisions are on sale, along with most anything else you might want.\n\nbut adriana gomez, the general manager, says no one is buying. the economic crisis has devastated commerce here. and that has had an enormous political effect.\n\nthis region helped rousseff win re-election in 2014. according to the polling company datafolha, her approval rating in the northeast was 68 percent back in 2013. this past february it plunged to 16 percent.\n\nsome people argue the massive corruption scandal involving the state oil company petrobras is the reason people want rousseff out. she hasn't been directly implicated in the scheme that saw billions bilked for kickbacks and bribes, but her party and many of its members, including former president lula has been.\n\nbut thiago de aragao, a political analyst with arko consulting, says the political turmoil and the effort to impeach rousseff is being driven by the miserable state of the economy.\n\nthe economy contracted 3.8 percent last year. prices are going up by 10 percent a month. people are being fired. it's hard to survive politically while this economic disaster is playing out.\n\nwe have a society in which corruption is highly acceptable by the society as long as the economy flows in a positive manner, he said. he points to another huge corruption revelation that took place in former president lula's first term, where it was discovered that his government was paying politicians for their votes. aragao says people largely ignored the scandal because the economy was expanding.\n\nunemployed port worker jorge leonel do nascimento says he's now given up on politics.\n\ni feel like i was fooled. by lula and dilma, he said.\n\nthat car he bought in the boom years? he's selling it now in order to survive.
for health care workers, the pandemic is fueling renewed interest in unions\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption hans pennink hans pennink\n\nin september, after six months of exhausting work battling the pandemic, nurses at mission hospital in asheville, n.c., voted to unionize. the vote passed with 70%, a high margin of victory in a historically anti-union state, according to academic experts who study labor movements.\n\nthe nurses had originally filed paperwork to hold this vote in march but were forced to delay it when the pandemic began heating up. and the issues that had driven them toward unionizing were only heightened by the crisis. it raised new, urgent problems too, including struggles to get enough ppe, and inconsistent testing and notification of exposures to covid-positive patients.\n\nthey're far from alone in their complaints. for months now, front-line health workers across the country have faced a perpetual lack of personal protective equipment, or ppe, and inconsistent safety measures. studies show they're more likely to be infected by the coronavirus than the general population, and hundreds have died, according to reporting by khn and the guardian.\n\nmany workers say employers and government systems that are meant to protect them have failed.\n\nresearch shows that health facilities with unions have better patient outcomes and are more likely to have inspections that can find and correct workplace hazards. one study found new york nursing homes with unionized workers had lower covid-19 mortality rates, as well as better access to ppe and stronger infection control measures, than nonunion facilities.\n\nrecognizing that, some workers — like the nurses at mission hospital — are forming new unions or thinking about organizing for the first time. others, who already belong to a union, are taking more active leadership roles, voting to strike, launching public information campaigns and filing lawsuits against employers.\n\nthe urgency and desperation we've heard from workers is at a pitch i haven't experienced before in 20 years of this work, said cass gualvez, organizing director for service employees international union-united healthcare workers west in california. we've talked to workers who said, 'i was dead set against a union five years ago, but covid has changed that.' \n\ntoggle caption marisa powell\n\nlabor experts say it's too soon to know if the outrage over working conditions will translate into an increase in union membership, but early indications suggest a small uptick. of the approximately 1,500 petitions for union representation posted on the national labor relations board website in 2020, 16% appear related to the health care field, up from 14% the previous year.\n\nin colorado, seiu local 105 health care organizing director stephanie felix-sowy said her team is fielding dozens of calls a month from nonunion workers interested in joining. not only are nurses and respiratory therapists reaching out, but dietary workers and cleaning staff are as well, including several from rural parts of the state where union representation has traditionally been low.\n\nthe pandemic didn't create most of the root problems they're concerned about, she said. but it amplified them and the need to address them.\n\nin response to union actions, many hospitals across the country have said worker safety is already their top priority, and unions are taking advantage of a difficult situation to divide staff and management, rather than working together.\n\ninside mission hospital\n\nthe nurses at mission hospital say administrators have minimized and disregarded their concerns, often leaving them out of important planning and decision-making in the hospital's covid-19 response.\n\nearly in the pandemic, staffers struggled to find masks and other protective equipment, said nurses interviewed for this story. the hospital discouraged them from wearing masks one day and required masks 10 days later. the staff wasn't consistently tested for covid-19 and often not even notified when exposed to covid-positive patients. according to the nurses and a review of safety complaints made to federal regulators, the concerns persisted for months. and some nurses said the situation fueled doubts about whether hospital executives were prioritizing staff and patients, or the bottom line.\n\na nurse for 30 years, amy waters had always been aware of a mostly unspoken but widespread sentiment that talking about unions could endanger her job. but after hca healthcare took over mission health in 2019, she saw nurses and support staff members being cut and she worried about the effect on patient care. joining national nurses united could help, she thought. during the pandemic, her fears only worsened. at times, nurses cared for seven patients at once, despite research indicating four is a reasonable number.\n\nin a statement, mission health said it has adequate staffing and is aggressively recruiting nurses. we have the beds, staffing, ppe supplies and equipment we need at this time and we are well-equipped to handle any potential surge, spokesperson nancy lindell wrote. the hospital has required universal masking since march and requires staff members who test positive to stay home, she added.\n\nalthough the nurses didn't vote to unionize until september, waters said, they began acting collectively from the early days of the pandemic. they drafted a petition and sent a letter to administrators together. when the hospital agreed to provide advanced training on how to use ppe to protect against covid transmission, it was a small but significant victory, waters said.\n\nseeing that change brought a fair number of nurses who had still been undecided about the union to feel like, 'yeah, if we work together, we can make change,' she said.\n\nold concerns heightened\n\neven as union membership in most industries has declined in recent years, health workers unions have remained relatively stable: around 7% of health care and social services workers are in unions experts say it's partly because of the focus on patient care issues, like safe staffing ratios, which resonate widely and have only grown during the pandemic.\n\nat st. mary medical center outside philadelphia, short staffing led nurses to strike in november. donna halpern, a nurse on the cardiovascular and critical care unit, said staffing had been a point of negotiation with the hospital since the nurses joined the pennsylvania association of staff nurses and allied professionals in 2019. but with another surge of covid cases approaching, the nurses decided not to wait any longer to take action, she said.\n\na month later, officials with trinity health mid-atlantic, which owns the hospital, announced a tentative labor agreement with the union. the contract gives nurses a voice in discussions on staffing while preserving the hospital's right and authority to make all staffing decisions, the hospital said in a statement.\n\nin colorado, where state inspection reports show understaffing led to a patient death at a suburban denver hospital, seiu local 105 has launched a media campaign about unsafe practices by the hospital's parent company, healthone. the union doesn't represent healthone employees, but union leaders said they felt compelled to act after repeatedly hearing concerns.\n\nin a statement, healthone said staffing levels are appropriate across its hospitals and it is continuing to recruit and hire staff members.\n\ncovid-19 is also raising entirely new issues for workers to organize around. at the forefront is the lack of ppe, which was noted in one-third of the health worker deaths catalogued by khn and the guardian.\n\nnurses at albany medical center in new york picketed on dec. 1 with signs demanding ppe and spoke about having to reuse n95 masks up to 20 times.\n\nthe hospital told khn it follows federal guidelines for reprocessing masks, but intensive care nurse jennifer bejo said it feels unsafe.\n\nat multicare indigo urgent care clinics in washington state, staff members were provided only surgical masks and face shields for months, even when performing covid tests and seeing covid patients, said dr. brian fox, who works at the clinics and is a member of the union of american physicians and dentists. the company agreed to provide n95 masks after staffers went on a two-day strike in november.\n\nmulticare said it found another vendor for n95s in early december and is in the process of distributing them.\n\nppe has also become a rallying point for nonunion workers. at a november event handing out ppe in el paso, texas, more than 60 workers showed up in the first hour, said seiu texas president elsa caballero. many were not union members, she said, but by the end of the day, dozens had signed membership cards to join.\n\nsmall successes\n\norganized labor is not a panacea, union officials admit. their members have faced ppe shortages and high infection rates throughout the pandemic, too. but collective action can help workers push for and achieve change, they said.\n\nnational nurses united and the national union of healthcare workers said they've each seen an influx in calls from nonmembers, but whether that results in more union elections is yet to be seen.\n\ndavid zonderman, an expert in labor history at north carolina state university, said safety concerns like factory fires and mine collapses have often galvanized collective action in the past, as workers felt their lives were endangered. but labor laws can make it difficult to organize, he said, and many efforts to unionize are unsuccessful.\n\nhealth care employers, in particular, are known to launch aggressive and well-funded anti-union campaigns, said rebecca givan, a labor studies expert at rutgers university. still, workers might be more motivated by what they witnessed during the pandemic, she said.\n\nan experience like treating patients in this pandemic will change a health care worker forever, givan said, and will have an impact on their willingness to speak out, to go on strike and to unionize if needed.\n\nkhn (kaiser health news) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues. it is an editorially

can trump turn pennsylvania's disaffected democrats into believers by november?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mel evans/ap mel evans/ap\n\nwalk around a scranton/wilkes-barre railriders game talking to donald trump supporters, and you'll hear a whole bunch of different reasons people in northeastern pennsylvania are supporting him.\n\nsome trump backers say they're worried about isis. others say the economy is their top concern. but every person eventually returns to the same central quality he is most passionate about in the likely republican nominee: the fact that he's not a typical politician.\n\nwhat a breath of fresh air, said mike zuby, who wore a pennsylvania for trump t-shirt to a recent game between the triple-a railriders and pawtucket red sox. to be able to wake up and at least know that someone's out there — the average and ordinary-type guy. he's not just a billionaire; he's speaking with total unpolitical correctness. he's speaking exactly what we want to be saying to this big monster called washington.\n\npeople feel that washington will never control him.\n\nrepublican rep. lou barletta believes that outsider quality is what propelled trump to a dominating win in northeastern pennsylvania last month. he represents the scranton region in the house and was one of the first congressmen to endorse trump. in luzerne county, home of wilkes-barre, trump won more than 77 percent of the vote. people feel that washington will never control him. and that's what they want, barletta said.\n\nthe trump campaign believes the road to the white house runs through places like scranton. it's banking on reshaping the electoral map and carrying traditionally democratic industrial states like pennsylvania by riding a wave of working-class votes.\n\ncan trump change pennsylvanians' party loyalty?\n\nbarletta thinks trump can be the first republican to win pennsylvania since 1988, pointing to the fact that more than 60,000 democrats switched their party registration to the gop before this year's state primary. that's for donald trump, he said. they weren't doing that to vote for ted cruz or john kasich.\n\nbut winning pennsylvania in november will be a very steep climb for trump. the state has about 1 million more registered democrats than republicans. and while many of them stay home in other years, pennsylvania democrats typically show up en masse when there's a presidential race on the ballot.\n\nat the end of the day, i just don't think there's enough angry old white people in pennsylvania to make up for the fact of what trump is doing on the other side to motivate the democratic base, said christopher nicholas, a longtime pennsylvania republican strategist who ran several campaigns for former sen. arlen specter. i hope i'm wrong.\n\nin a statewide election in pennsylvania, you have to worry about how many votes you come out of philadelphia and pittsburgh down, he said. because at a certain point there's not enough votes in the rest of the state, in the other 65 counties, to make up for that. the math just doesn't work anymore.\n\npresident obama carried philadelphia by about 492,000 votes in 2012, and ended up winning the state by about 309,000. in 2004, john kerry topped president george w. bush by 412,000 votes in philadelphia. the wide margin offset bush votes elsewhere, and kerry ended up winning the state by about 144,000.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mel evans/ap mel evans/ap\n\nplay for blue-collar democrats\n\nformer gov. ed rendell, a democrat with close ties to hillary clinton, is confident that fears about a donald trump presidency will turn out urban democrats. you know, there's an old saying in politics that hate is a more powerful emotion than love, he said, or fear is a more powerful emotion than love. i think donald trump will produce the turnout.\n\nat the end of the day, i just don't think there's enough angry old white people in pennsylvania.\n\nstill, rendell isn't dismissing trump's play for blue-collar democrats in western and central pennsylvania. there's no question that they're part of the angry slice of america, he said. many of them have lost their jobs because of manufacturing problems. not just trade-related, but technology, related, etc. so i think he will be successful in taking some of those into his column.\n\nbut rendell thinks that trump's outside-the-box antics will also turn off moderate republican voters — particularly republican women — in the populous suburban counties surrounding philadelphia. i think he will wind up, my guess is, losing more of those type of republicans than he gains in blue-collar democrats, rendell said.\n\nindeed, pennsylvania's most high-profile moderate republican, former gov. tom ridge, announced tuesday that he won't vote for trump in november.\n\nif trump is banking on winning pennsylvania with a coalition of disaffected democrats and republicans who haven't been motivated to vote in previous elections, he'll need to track them down. but trump recently dismissed the high-tech voter outreach efforts that have become a key part of modern presidential campaigns as overrated.\n\nthat's part of what makes me skeptical about trump. he hasn't seemed particularly interested in building a big ground game, said sarah niebler, a political scientist at dickinson college in carlisle, pa. and i think that's what it would take in these rural counties. it's a lot of ground to cover — just physical voters — to find those voters, to register those voters, and to mobilize them to turn out in november.\n\nniebler thinks trump would need to pull the political equivalent of a royal flush to win the keystone state. he would need to find new republican voters that aren't currently registered, attract democratic voters to vote for him, he'd have to win pretty much all the independents, or he'd have to win republicans by a much wider margin than clinton wins democrats, she said.\n\nbut picking up pennsylvania is trump's most feasible route to the white house. this path is dependent on trump being able to use his populist, protectionist and anti-globalization

carmakers question the future of the automobile, the driver and the industry\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption sonari glinton/npr sonari glinton/npr\n\none of the biggest questions around self-driving cars is about safety. in the blink of an eye would the vehicle, say, endanger the occupant to save another driver or pedestrian? there are any number of answers for a variety of scenarios. mercedes-benz, the world's oldest carmaker, says as its vehicles get smarter, it will program its self-driving models to make the lives of the occupants the priority.\n\nmichael taylor of car and driver, reporting from the paris auto show, points out that who lives and who dies in a driverless car accident is something carmakers have avoided talking about until now.\n\nall of mercedes-benz's future level 4 and level 5 autonomous cars will prioritize saving the people they carry, according to christoph von hugo, the automaker's manager of driver assistance systems and active safety. if you know you can save at least one person, at least save that one. save the one in the car, hugo said in an interview at the paris auto show. if all you know for sure is that one death can be prevented, then that's your first priority.\n\nregulators and carmakers in the u.s. have put a focus on safety. the national highway traffic safety administration is spearheading a government effort to get american traffic fatalities to zero. nhtsa and the department of transportation have said the federal government will have a role in regulating the code that operates self-driving cars.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption sonari glinton/npr sonari glinton/npr\n\nmeanwhile, bmw has been touring the world celebrating it's 100th anniversary and what it calls its next 100 years. essentially it's a show that makes the case for bmw's existence in the future. the company showcases a vehicle that points to the future for each division.\n\nwe're not only good at making things, we're also good at creating emotions, says ludwig willisch, bmw's north american ceo. there's no reason to believe that people don't want emotions in the future.\n\nwillisch acknowledges that the future he describes is far beyond the scope of a traditional automaker today. we have to make sure that everybody understands, including our shareholders, our stakeholders, that there is a business proposition even in 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 years out, he tells npr.\n\nwillisch says creating an emotional connection for consumers is what his brand does. for a car company to succeed, it has to capture the feeling and emotion of being on the road. the emotion won't change, says willisch. it still will be about using a bmw and having fun ... whatever that will be in 100 years, but this is our business model. and i'm sure it will prevail.
encore: 'la la land' invokes nostalgia for 1930s hollywood\n\nnpr's audie cornish talks to director damien chazelle about his latest film, la la land, which is a modern version of 1930s hollywood musicals. this story originally aired on dec. 9, 2016 on all things considered.\n\naudie cornish, host:\n\nat last night's golden globes, damien chazelle and his movie la la land made it big. the film won a total of seven awards, including best actor and actress in a musical or comedy. chazelle won for best director and best screenplay.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\ndamien chazelle: i wanted to thank a few people just in particular - my producers fred berger, jordan horowitz and marc platt for not blanching at, i think, what must have seemed like an utterly insane proposition that i made to you guys for six years, for fighting to get this made, to get this in front of screens.\n\ncornish: it's perhaps fitting that chazelle had to fight to get this movie made. after all, la la land is ultimately about struggle, packaged in a neon-bright musical.\n\n(soundbite of song, another day of sun)\n\nunidentified choir: (singing) when they let you down, you'll get up off the ground as morning rolls around and it's another day of sun.\n\ncornish: emma stone and ryan gosling play the two lovers at the heart of the film, each balancing their showbiz dreams with reality. gosling's sebastian, a traditional jazz pianist, has to join a band with more pop sensibilities to make ends meet. and emma stone's mia is an aspiring actress who still hasn't found her big break after six years and countless auditions.\n\n(soundbite of film, la la land)\n\nemma stone: (as mia) because maybe i'm not good enough.\n\nryan gosling: (as sebastian) yes, you are.\n\nstone: (as mia) no. no, maybe i'm not.\n\ngosling: (as sebastian) yes, you are.\n\nstone: (as mia) maybe i'm not.\n\ngosling: (as sebastian) you are.\n\nstone: (as mia) maybe i'm not.\n\ngosling: (as sebastian) you are.\n\nstone: (as mia) maybe i'm one of those people that has always wanted to do it but it's like a pipe dream for me, you know? and then you - you said it. you change your dreams and then you grow up.\n\ncornish: i spoke with damien chazelle back in december. i asked him whether he'd ever had that moment himself and thought he should change his dreams and grow up.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nchazelle: it's a line that, you know, floated through my mind a lot when i was, you know, first moving to la. it's funny how those first, i'd say, five years or so in los angeles where, you know, i remember being very excited the first time i got any kind of amount of money at all to do, like, a writing-for-hire rewrite job on, like, a script. you know, just the idea of having any kind of entryway into making movies was very exciting to me.\n\nbut it sort of felt the entire time like that's as far as i was going to get. and what i was really doing was spending most of my time writing scripts of movies that i dreamed of one day making. you know, i wanted in this movie hopefully to say something about that state of mind, you know, of being in a city like la, the sort of dream factory city, living in your head a lot, living in your dreams a lot and having to reconcile those dreams with the sometimes not-so-pleasant realities of, you know, the life you're actually living.\n\ncornish: it's interesting to hear you say that 'cause there's a key moment in the film where the couple has an argument. and she essentially asked her boyfriend, do you like the music you're playing? are you really, you know, are you doing what you really wanted to do? and it sounds like you had that moment.\n\nchazelle: oh, yeah. and i've wanted to make movies since i can remember. i've never wanted to do anything else. so my whole life has kind of been defined, for me, by this desire and this dream. and so, you know, as a kid, i had kind of ideas of what sort of movies i would make. and, you know, as a kid, kind of anything seems possible, you know, since it's all kind of far off.\n\nso you just sort of enjoy the dream. and then it becomes somewhat a little more difficult to handle when you have to start compromising, when you have to start doing things that adults do, when you have to start paying the bills, when you have to start dealing with people's responses to your art. when you're an adult, it's hard to kind of sustain that.\n\nyeah, that was something i think especially with ryan's character in the movie that was personal to me, for sure.\n\ncornish: before he moved to los angeles, damien chazelle played in competitive jazz bands in high school. as a screenwriter, he never let go of his love of jazz.\n\n(soundbite of justin hurwitz song, herman's habit)\n\ncornish: la la land has the verve of a jazz age musical, but it also questions any one person trying to be the gatekeeper of the tradition. jazz is dying, ryan gosling's sebastian declares at one point. and it's up to him to save it. not so fast, says john legend. he plays a successful bandleader in the film who asked, how are you going to save jazz if no one's listening?\n\n(soundbite of film, la la land)\n\njohn legend: (as keith) jazz is dying because of people like you. you're playing to 90-year-olds at the lighthouse. where are the kids? where are the young people? you're so obsessed with kenny clarke and thelonious monk. these guys were revolutionaries. how are you going to be a revolutionary if you're such a traditionalist? you're holding onto the past, but jazz is about the future.\n\ncornish: damien chazelle, which person have you been in that conversation?\n\nchazelle: (laughter) more often than not, i feel like i'm ryan. you know, i'm sebastian sitting there somewhat uncomfortably, taking it all in, listening to john. and yet understanding that in a certain very fundamental way, john is right. i sort of jokingly think of that scene as, like, it's like, you know, the two angels on my shoulder (laughter) kind of arguing about what it means to, you know, not just be a jazz musician.\n\nthat's what they're talking about specifically there, but the, you know, just being an artist. at what point does preservation of what you love about, you know, older art forms become encasing something in amber? and at what point does trying to modernize something start to corrupt it?\n\ncornish: it's fascinating 'cause this does feel like a jazz musical. (laughter) like, it definitely has that sensibility even though it is so modern la in its look.\n\nchazelle: i mean, again, the thing with jazz is that jazz is and in some ways always will remain a modern music. that's why, you know, there's a moment in the movie where ryan's character, i think, makes an argument earlier that jazz is dying, which i don't entirely agree with, actually. i don't think jazz is dying in any way.\n\nbut i think ryan is talking about a specific kind of jazz, a specific, again, somewhat in his mind encased in amber type of jazz that was played in the jazz clubs or on the big band stages in the '30s, '40s, '50s, maybe into the '60s.\n\n(soundbite of justin hurwitz song, city of stars)\n\nchazelle: and that's a sort of preference or viewpoint of a lot of, you know, of a whole sector of people. and then john legend's character comes from a completely other side of the equation.\n\n(soundbite of song, start a fire)\n\nlegend: (singing) oh, i just know i feel so good tonight.\n\nchazelle: i guess i, you know, i hoped with this movie, both with the jazz within it but also just with the entire approach to the movie, that it would have a little bit of old and new in it. that it would sort of at the end of the day almost make the case for what john's character is saying, not - maybe not literally but just that idea that sometimes it's ok to adapt to modernity a little bit. i think in some way...\n\ncornish: (laughter).\n\nchazelle: ...that's what the characters learn a bit, that it's - you have to preserve what you believe in. you can't compromise too much. but sometimes it's not compromise. sometimes it's actually, you know, finding a way to push something forward, whether it's a musical or a - or an idea of jazz you might have.\n\ncornish: well, damien chazelle, thank you so much for talking with us about this film. it was really fun.\n\nchazelle: thank you.\n\ncornish: damien chazelle, i spoke with him about la la land back in december. and at last night's golden globes, the movie won seven awards, including best director and best screenplay.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
high spirited 'patti cake$' dresses its cinderella story in dirty jersey drag\n\na hard-working aspiring rapper rises above her dead-end existence with the help of some supportive friends and her own irrepressible talent. critic justin change says patti cake$ is irresistible.\n\ndavid bianculli, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. the film patti cake$ premiered earlier this year at the sundance film festival, where it became an audience hit and was acquired for distribution by fox searchlight pictures. it's the first feature written and directed by geremy jasper. film critic justin chang has this review.\n\njustin chang, byline: the title of the warmly exuberant new musical comedy patti cake$ is one of the many aliases of patricia dombrowski, a hard-luck new jersey bartender and aspiring rapper played by the splendid australian newcomer danielle macdonald. patti's best friend, jheri, played by siddharth dhananjay, calls her killa p. around the neighborhood she's known as dumbo, a cruel riff on dombrowski. one especially nasty type, mocking her large frame, calls her white precious in reference to the 2009 drama starring gabourey sidibe as a girl who suffered terrible abuse at the hands of her mother.\n\npatti's mom, barb, isn't anywhere near as cruel or monstrous, just drunk and irresponsible. most evenings she storms into the karaoke bar where her daughter works, downs several shots and sings a lovely quavering solo, only to end the night with her head over a toilet. played in a blistering sweet-and-sour performance by the new york cabaret legend bridget everett, barb once longed to be a singer. but she disdains patti's dreams of stardom, claiming that rap isn't really music anyway.\n\npatti herself may not be much of a musician, but there's no doubting she's a natural born poet. whether she's improvising some lines in a parking lot with jheri or defeating a local bully in an outdoor hip-hop battle, she proves herself a terrific wordsmith, a master at synthesizing tough-talking slang, pop cultural references and no shortage of expletives into an exhilarating stream of rhyming verse.\n\nfew of her lyrics can be repeated on the air, though we can play an excerpt from a scene in which patti drops by the pharmacy where jheri works and the two of them take advantage of the store's pa system, not for the first time.\n\n(soundbite of film, patti cake$)\n\nsiddharth dhananjay: (as jheri) lord and ladies of the royal court, bow down. the queen is in the building. introducing ms. patricia dombrowski, aka patti cake$, aka white trish, aka juicy luciano, aka marilyn mansion, aka jane dough, aka killa p.\n\ndanielle macdonald: (as patricia dombrowski) and introducing the ladies' twist, the voice that gets you [expletive]. it's going to be an indian summer, y'all. mr. jheri curls, aka young stamos, aka deepak shakur, aka the dorag davinci, aka rawdog zillionaire, aka the (unintelligible). boys and girls, i give you my soul mate, my homie-o (ph), it's jheromeo.\n\nunidentified actress: (as character) this isn't showtime at the apollo, ok? you have customers here. play make-believe on your lunch break.\n\ndhananjay: (as jheri) sorry, my bad.\n\nunidentified actress: (as character) last warning, harish (ph).\n\nchang: patti and jheri's jam sessions are the beginning of something potentially epic. and the juices really get flowing once they meet a mysterious goth loner with the memorable name of basterd the antichrist, played by mamoudou athie. basterd is a punk rocker, but his rage-fueled performances hide a gentle, tender soul, and he reluctantly agrees to lay down some beats for an album. also getting in on the action is patti's wheelchair-bound nana, played by cathy moriarty of raging bull fame, whose raspy line delivery becomes a pretty killer hook. the band is called pbnj, an acronym of everyone's first initials that also happens to sum up the appeal of patti cake$. it's sweet and messy and a little square around the edges, but it's also pretty irresistible.\n\nthe movie was written and directed by geremy jasper, a new jersey musician making his feature film debut. he also worked with composer jeremy binnick (ph) on the film's score and wrote an album's worth of songs for the soundtrack, ranging from the impromptu raps that patti spits out every morning to the fiery love song that barb once performed years ago under the stage name barb wire. patti cake$ is a canny mix of slickness and grit, a cinderella story in dirty jersey drag.\n\nit's about an honest, hardworking girl who rises above her dead-end existence with the help of some supportive friends, a bit of romance and, above all, her own irrepressible, overflowing talent. there's hardly a single star-is-born, let's-put-on-a-show cliche that the movie leaves untouched. but the music is so high-spirited and the actors throw themselves into their parts with such gusto that you always feel those cliches are being wholeheartedly embraced rather than exploited.\n\nin telling a story about a fictional white rapper, patti cake$ is likely to generate questions and accusations of cultural appropriation in a movie industry that, the occasional straight outta compton aside, doesn't often give black artists their proper due. the fact that macdonald had never rapped before taking on the role of patti may well be wielded as a criticism rather than hailed as evidence of the actress' astonishing talent.\n\nthe movie is self-aware enough to acknowledge the issue in one key scene in which patti gets dismissed by a black rap star as a culture vulture. but jasper never makes undue claims for his heroine or tries to pump her up into someone she isn't. when patti steps up to the mic and lets loose with her sensational gift, the voice we hear is hers and hers alone.\n\nbianculli: justin chang is a film critic at the los angeles times. on monday's show, how a young winston churchill earned distinction and tested his mettle in war.\n\ncandice millard: he wanted to be in the most difficult, most dangerous battles he could find. and he wanted to be noticed. he wanted to stand out.\n\nbianculli: we speak with candice millard about her new book, hero of the empire: the boer war, a daring escape and the making of winston churchill. hope you can join us.\n\n(soundbite of john beasley's i mean you)\n\nbianculli: fresh air's executive producer is danny miller. our senior producer today is roberta shorrock. our technical director and engineer is audrey bentham. our associate producer for online media is molly seavy-nesper. therese madden directed today's show. for terry gross, i'm david bianculli.\n\n(soundbite of john beasley's i mean you)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
how to make your estate plan amid the coronavirus pandemic\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nthe current crisis may have caused more americans to contemplate mortality. this has reportedly prompted a large number of americans to write or rewrite their wills with many using online will makers and services. i'm joined now by mildred gomez, an estate planning attorney in miami. attorney gomez, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nmildred gomez: oh, it's my pleasure. thank you for having me.\n\nsimon: are you getting different kinds of questions from your clients and cold calls these days?\n\ngomez: yes. what we are seeing a lot of is people who had already started this process very anxious to wrap it up. you know, not just in their estate planning documents, what we, you know, typically think of as, you know, a will or revocable trust, clients are also increasingly more concerned about their powers of attorneys, their health care surrogates, their living wills, the documents that would - you know, what we call life documents because they're effective while you're alive.\n\nsimon: what should people know when it comes to writing a will?\n\ngomez: i think it's really important when people are writing a will to consider the fact that wills are governed by state law. to give you an example, each state kind of has their own execution requirements. some states require two witnesses and a notary, other states perhaps only one witness. some states currently allow for online execution of these documents while other states don't.\n\nsimon: can people really write a will online using one of those boilerplates?\n\ngomez: what i would say to that - if that is what's - the need that somebody has either because of, you know, right now movement restrictions or it being cost prohibitive, that you make sure that you're working with a reputable provider that has done their homework, that has done their due diligence and that you feel understands your state-specific issues.\n\nsimon: ms. gomez, remind us again why wills can be important to people because i think there are a lot of people that just assume, well, you know, if i get sick suddenly and then pass away, you know, my children get everything, and it's not much, so why do i need a will?\n\ngomez: every state has what we call their own intestacy statutes. and those are the statutes that set forth how assets will pass when you pass away. some states, you know, give a certain percentage to the spouse. sometimes it depends on whether the children are minors or they're not minors. families aren't - we're not all the same, right? some families, you have kids from different marriages or from different unions. some couples have been together for a very long time but aren't legally married. it is very possible that without a will your assets will pass how you would have wanted them to anyway. but, again, it's important to look and make sure.\n\nso i think it's an exercise in just making sure your affairs are in order. it's kind of like when you do your spring cleaning in your home and you make sure that, you know, you have all the things you need, everything's where it's supposed to be, everything, you know, is how you imagine it so that if, god forbid, something happens to you, your loved ones can pick up from where you left off and do it in the most seamless way possible and, more than anything, because what you leave behind when something happens to you are your loved ones.\n\nsimon: somebody listening to us now might feel, well, geez, i never thought of that before. i think i need a will. my memory is when the last time our family redid a will - and i don't think we had anything that complicated - it took several appointments with an attorney and months of time.\n\ngomez: you know, i always tell clients this is going to take as long as you need it to take. and what i mean by that is the choices that you have to make and the people you have to appoint in the documents and the questions you have to answer. ok. and i have seen many clients become paralyzed by those questions and those choices because they want to make sure that they're making the perfect choice. and i do always tell clients there do not be paralyzed by perfect because there is no perfect document because what you write today may be perfect today, but circumstances change. so setup the best documents you can for today.\n\nif this situation has shown us anything or taught us anything, it's that none of us know what tomorrow is going to bring. but we know what today holds, so prepare your documents so that you're comfortable with them today and you can sleep tonight. if circumstances change in the future, you can always update these documents. as long as you have capacity to do so, you just have to make those choices.\n\nsimon: mildred gomez is an estate planning attorney in miami. thanks so much for being with us.\n\ngomez: i loved it. thank you so much. i appreciate it.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
how large employer health plans could be affected by obamacare overhaul\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption hero images/getty images hero images/getty images\n\nif you think that you wouldn't be touched by a republican overhaul of obamacare because you get health insurance through your job at a big company, think again.\n\nseveral of the law's provisions apply to plans offered by large employers, too (with some exceptions for plans that were in place before the law passed in march 2010).\n\nit's not yet clear how president-elect donald trump and congressional republicans plan to revamp the federal health law, known as the affordable care act or obamacare. they have not agreed on a plan, and they do not have enough votes in the senate to fully repeal the current statute. so they are planning to use a budgeting rule to disassemble part of the law, which will limit what they can change. but they also may seek revisions in important regulations and guidance that have determined how the law is implemented.\n\nnonetheless, as tensions grow in washington over the future of the health law, it is important to understand some of its effects on large-group plans.\n\nno copays for preventive services\n\nthe health insurance offered by big companies is typically pretty comprehensive, the better to attract and keep good employees. but obamacare broadened some coverage requirements. under the law, insurers and employers have to cover many preventive services without charging people anything for them. the services that are required with no out-of-pocket payments include dozens of screenings and tests, including mammograms and colonoscopies that are recommended by the u.s. preventive services task force; routine immunizations endorsed by the federal centers for disease control and prevention's advisory committee on immunization practices; and a range of services that are recommended specifically for children and for women by the federal health resources and services administration.\n\nthe change that affects the most people on an ongoing basis is likely the requirement that plans cover without cost sharing all methods of contraception approved by the food and drug administration. (there are limited exceptions for religious employers.)\n\nin terms of sustained costs, birth control is probably the biggest, said caroline pearson, a senior vice president at avalere health.\n\nno annual or lifetime limits on coverage\n\neven the most generous plans often had lifetime maximum coverage limits of a few million dollars before the health law passed, and some plans also imposed annual coverage limits. the health law eliminated those dollar coverage limits.\n\nannual cap on out-of-pocket payments for covered services\n\nthe health law set limits on how much people can be required to pay in deductibles, copayments or coinsurance every year for covered care they receive from providers in their network. in 2017, the limit is $7,150 for individuals and $14,300 for families.\n\nmany employers often had an out-of-pocket limit anyway, but this guarantees protection for people with high needs, said joann volk, a research professor at georgetown university's center on health insurance reforms, who has written on this issue.\n\nadult kids' coverage expanded\n\nthe law allowed workers to keep their children on their plans until they reach age 26, even if they're married, financially independent and live in another state. republicans have said they may keep this popular provision in place if they dismantle the law.\n\nguaranteed external appeal rights\n\nconsumers who disagree with a health plan's decision to deny benefits or payment for services can appeal the decision to an independent review panel.\n\nthe provision applies to all new health plans including those offered by self-funded companies that pay their workers' claims directly and who were previously exempt from appeals requirements.\n\nno waiting periods to join a plan\n\nemployers used to be able to make new employees wait indefinitely before they were eligible for coverage under the company plan. no more. now the waiting time for coverage can be no more than 90 days.\n\nno waiting periods for coverage of pre-existing conditions\n\nprior to the aca, employers could delay covering workers' chronic and other health conditions for up to a year after they became eligible for a plan. under the aca, that's no longer allowed. as a practical matter, though, coverage of pre-existing conditions was rarely an issue in large-group plans, say some health insurance analysts.\n\nrepeal could reopen the door to that prohibited practice, however.\n\nstandardized plan descriptions\n\nthe law requires all plans to provide a summary of benefits and coverage in a standard format that allows consumers to understand their coverage and make apples-to-apples plan comparisons.\n\nbasic coverage standards for large-group plans\n\nthe health law isn't as prescriptive with large-group plans about the specific benefits that have to be offered. they aren't required to cover the 10 essential health benefits that individual and small-group plans have to include, for example. but the law does require that big companies offer plans that meet a minimum-value standard, paying at least 60 percent of the cost of covered services, on average. those that don't could face a fine.\n\ninitially, the online calculator that the federal department of health and human services provided to help large employers gauge compliance with the minimum value standard gave the green light to plans that didn't cover hospitalization services or more than a few doctor visits a year. now plans must provide at least that coverage to meet federal standards.\n\nthe result: large employers generally no longer offer so-called mini-med policies with very skimpy benefits.\n\nif the health law is repealed, that could change. in some industries with lower-wage workers and smaller profit margins, they might begin to offer them again, and employees might demand it to help make the premiums more affordable, said steve wojcik, vice president of public policy at the national business group on health, a membership organization representing large employers.\n\nalthough the law strengthened coverage for people in large-group plans in several ways, consumer advocates have complained about shortcomings. it aimed to ensure that coverage is affordable by requiring that individuals be responsible for paying no more than 9.69 percent of their household income for individual employer coverage, for example.\n\nif their insurance costs more than that, workers can shop for coverage on the marketplaces set up by the health law and be eligible for premium tax credits — if their income is less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level (about $47,000). but the standard does not take into consideration any additional costs for family coverage.\n\nconsumer advocates also point to the wellness regulations as a problematic area of the law. the health law increased the financial incentives that employers can offer workers for participating in workplace wellness programs to 30 percent of the cost of individual coverage, up from 20 percent.\n\nsuch incentives can effectively coerce people into participating and sharing private medical information, critics charge, and unfairly penalize sick people.\n\nit potentially allows [plans] to discriminate against people with medical conditions, which the aca is supposed to eliminate, said linda blumberg,

how will members of congress respond to the green new deal?\n\nhow will democrats and republicans in congress react to the signature proposal from the freshman congresswoman from new york, alexandria ocasio-cortez?\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\nmore than 50 lawmakers are co-sponsoring the green new deal resolution, which we have published first at npr.org. npr political editor domenico montanaro has been reading, and he's on the line. good morning, domenico.\n\ndomenico montanaro, byline: hey there, steve.\n\ninskeep: what do you see?\n\nmontanaro: well, you know, the - this green new deal is obviously something that democrats want to be able to try to push at least some on the left because it does frame a blueprint of something that's big and bold and broad - to be able to try to break through this sort of gridlock of what to do about climate change. they know that there's something big that has to happen, but nothing has been able to be agreed to.\n\ninskeep: although this doesn't actually do any of those things. it just sets a framework for what ought to be done.\n\nmontanaro: right. there aren't a whole lot of specifics of how to get there, and it's certainly not something that democratic leadership is going to want to try to put on the floor to try to put moderates in a potentially precarious position because, remember, democrats did win the house on the backs of moderates because of a lot of those suburban districts that were held by republicans previously.\n\ninskeep: when you're talking about moderates, help me understand what you're talking about here, domenico. you're saying that - i don't know - texas democrats, who gained some ground in the last election, might be a little worried about signing on to the idea of phasing out fossil fuels. that sort of thing?\n\nmontanaro: well, and that this costs trillions and trillions of dollars. i mean, the fact is that people want to know how much their energy bill is going to be each month. and that's, frankly, as you know, the biggest thing that you can think about. it's - well, how it affects your paycheck and your pocketbook. and if you have extra money on hand, that's one thing.\n\nbut figuring out how to actually pay for something like this - and as you talked to congresswoman ocasio-cortez, she didn't have a lot of ideas on how this would actually be paid for aside from taxes and deficit spending. and deficit spending - obviously something that democrats, like you pointed out, have been critical of republicans on in some of their tax cuts.\n\ninskeep: very briefly, what struck your ear, more broadly, as you listened to this lawmaker talking about rediscovering the power of public imagination, as she put it?\n\nmontanaro: she's going to have to figure out a political strategy because real change - for example, when president obama was in office, when lbj was in office to enact the great society measures or obamacare - came from having numbers and assembling coalitions. and that's something she's going to have to learn how to do.\n\ninskeep: domenico, thanks very much for the insight. really appreciate it.\n\nmontanaro: you're welcome.\n\ninskeep: that's npr's domenico montanaro. and he speaks on this day, when some democrats will release a green new deal resolution.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
california lawmakers prepare for trump, hire ex-attorney general eric holder\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption j. scott applewhite/ap j. scott applewhite/ap\n\ndemocratic leaders of the california legislature signaled their intention wednesday to fight any challenges to state policies by the incoming administration of donald trump by hiring as outside legal counsel former attorney general eric holder.\n\nthe announcement came in a joint statement issued by california senate president pro tem kevin de leon and assembly speaker anthony rendon.\n\nwith the upcoming change in administrations, we expect that there will be extraordinary challenges for california in the uncertain times ahead, said the lawmakers.\n\nholder will assist gov. jerry brown, yet-to-be-confirmed attorney general javier becerra and the legislature to protect california's economy and our sensible policies on climate change, health care, civil rights and immigration. this is a critical moment in the history of our nation. we have an obligation to defend the people who elected us and the policies and diversity that make california an example of what truly makes our nation great.\n\nthe move comes amid escalating rhetoric from california leaders, all democrats, since the election in which trump lost the state by more than 4 million votes.\n\nlast month rendon called the trump administration a major existential threat. days later, brown delivered a full-throated warning that california has no intention of reversing its climate change policies.\n\nwe've got the scientists, we've got the lawyers, and we're ready to fight, brown told a group of scientists in san francisco. we're ready to defend. california is no stranger to this fight.\n\nholder was attorney general in the obama administration from 2009 to 2015. he's currently a partner in the law firm covington & burling. according to the associated press, the firm will be paid $25,000 a month for three months starting in february. the deal will be renegotiated afterward.\n\nbut it's not going over well with republican lawmakers.\n\nthe state's incoming attorney general has spent decades in washington working on federal policies, said assemblyman chad mayes, r-yucca valley, in a statement quoted by the sacramento bee. it's not clear why legislative democrats needed to hire a d.c. insider to litigate the exact same issues.\n\nin a statement offered by de leon's office, holder said he was honored to help the legislature as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact california's residents and policy priorities. i am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the legislature.
'this was a scam': in recorded call, trump pushed official to overturn georgia vote\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tasos katopodis/getty images tasos katopodis/getty images\n\nupdated at 9:15 p.m. et\n\nan angry president trump pushed georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, a fellow republican, to overturn the state's presidential election result and appeared to at least partly blame raffensperger for what could be lower turnout in tuesday's runoff elections, which will decide control of the u.s. senate, according to a recording of a phone call obtained by georgia public broadcasting.\n\nthe people of georgia know that this was a scam, and because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote [in the runoffs], trump said in the remarkable saturday call. a lot of republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president.\n\nhe added: you would be respected if this thing could be straightened out before the election. trump lost the state by nearly 12,000 votes to president-elect joe biden.\n\nmore than 3 million georgians have already voted in the two jan. 5 runoffs, which pit incumbent republican sen. david perdue against democrat jon ossoff and incumbent gop sen. kelly loeffler against democrat raphael warnock.\n\nahead of tuesday, advance turnout has lagged in heavily republican parts of the state. trump suggested raffensperger was responsible for the drop in gop enthusiasm, while the secretary of state has said the white house and state lawmakers spreading misinformation is to blame.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jessica mcgowan/getty images jessica mcgowan/getty images\n\non sunday morning, trump railed against raffensperger on social media, retweeting baseless claims of election fraud and stating that georgia's top election official was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions about alleged election problems in the state.\n\nbut the audio recording of the hourlong call details that raffensperger and representatives of the secretary of state's office continued to patiently knock down some of the more inflammatory claims made by trump and other top republicans who allege hundreds of thousands of votes were illegally counted.\n\nwell, mr. president, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong, raffensperger said at one point. we have to stand by our numbers. we believe our numbers are right.\n\ngeorgia officials correct trump's claim on out-of-state voters listen · 1:13 1:13\n\nmark meadows, trump's chief of staff, told raffensperger he was hopeful that in a spirit of cooperation and compromise there would be some way to find a path forward to overturn georgia's certified election results, which were confirmed by both a full hand audit and a machine recount.\n\nwe don't agree that you have one, raffensperger said.\n\nan attorney for the secretary of state's office told the president on the call that state investigators, law enforcement and the courts looked into claims of illegal votes and found no evidence of widespread fraud that would overturn trump's narrow loss.\n\nbut the president was undeterred.\n\nall i want to do is this: i just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state, trump stated at one point. flipping the state is a great testament to our country. it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake. a lot of people think it wasn't a mistake, it was much more criminal than that. but it's a big problem in georgia, and it's not a problem that's going away.\n\ntrump: 'i just want to find 11,780 votes' listen · 1:44 1:44\n\non sunday evening, a member of the state election board called for an investigation into whether any part of the call constituted criminal behavior. david worley, a senior democrat on the board, wrote a letter to raffensperger asking him to launch an investigation of the call to determine whether violations of the provisions of the official code of georgia annotated which prohibit solicitation to commit election fraud have occurred. worley said the election board could then determine whether there's a possible crime to refer to georgia prosecutors.\n\nthe call, which was first reported by the washington post, reveals the extent to which the president knows minute details of claims of irregularities. trump was fixated on the latest rumors that counties shredded ballots from the november general election, spurred on by dubious claims made in georgia state legislative hearings.\n\nit doesn't pass the smell test, because we hear they're shredding thousands and thousands of ballots, trump complained. a state official replied that an investigation showed no ballots were shredded, only old office supplies and other paper.\n\ngeorgia officials dispute false claim of shredded ballots listen · 1:10 1:10\n\nraffensperger also told the president that social media was a problem, and trump interrupted to say that social media is big tech and was on raffensperger's side.\n\nyou know, i don't even know why you have a side, because you should want to have an accurate election — and you're a republican, trump said.\n\nthe white house has not responded to a request for comment. jason miller, a trump campaign adviser, wrote on twitter that raffensperger is a hack and that trump is spot-on in his criticisms of the terrible job raffensperger did.\n\nthe call came days ahead of congressional certification of biden's electoral victory. a number of republican members of congress have said they're going to object to the results, an effort that is poised to fail but that has the support of vice president pence.\n\nraffensperger was not the only target of trump's ire. the president said that republican gov. brian kemp, who has also repeatedly refused to interfere with the election results, was working with the secretary of state to treat georgians badly.\n\nlike a schmuck, i endorsed him and he got elected, but i will tell you, he is a disaster, trump said of kemp. i can't imagine he's ever getting elected again, i'll tell you that much.\n\ntrump attacks georgia governor over election loss listen · 1:34 1:34\n\nin recent weeks, trump has openly called for former u.s. rep. doug collins of georgia to mount a primary challenge against kemp.\n\nat the end of the call, there was a renewed push to get raffensperger to undo georgia's results before tuesday's senate runoffs, with the president and meadows asking the state to meet and turn over information that they purport could prove evidence of fraud. the secretary of state's attorney declined and pointed to numerous public explanations that debunk those claims.\n\nstill, trump was confident the outcome would change in his favor, despite all evidence pointing to the contrary.\n\neveryone's going to look very good if the truth comes out, trump said. and the real truth is i won by 400,000 votes at least. that's the real truth.\n\non monday night, the president will hold a rally for perdue and loeffler in dalton, ga. he indicated on the call that he will continue to air his unproven grievances there — a closing message that could hurt turnout in what are likely to be close races.\n\nthe people of georgia are angry, and these numbers are going to be repeated on monday night, along with others that we're going to have by that time, which are much more substantial, trump claimed.
breakdown of talks in myanmar prompts high-profile negotiator's resignation\n\nformer new mexico gov. bill richardson will no longer serve on the board tasked with implementing changes in myanmar's restive rakhine state.\n\nthe announcement comes as richardson was in myanmar, also known as burma, this week as a member of the advisory board on rakhine state. he was meeting with government officials about two reuters journalists who face up to 14 years in prison for allegedly violating the country's colonial-era officials secrets acts.\n\nin initial meetings with members of the advisory board and daw aun san suu kyi, it has become clear that i cannot in good conscience serve in this role, said richardson.\n\nthe advisory board on rakhine state was set up to implement recommendations regarding the rohingya, myanmar's brutally persecuted minority group, that were made by an advisory commission in 2017 — a commission led by former un secretary-general kofi annon.\n\non monday, richardson met with myanmar's de-facto leader aung san suu kyi to discuss both the detained journalists as well as the plan to repatriate hundreds of thousands of rohingya muslim refugees who had fled the country last year following a military crackdown.\n\nby wednesday, richardson had cut his trip short and announced his resignation.\n\ni was extremely upset at state counselor daw aung san suu kyi's reaction to my request that she address the situation of the two reuters journalists both swiftly and fairly, richardson said in a statement, using an honorific for suu kyi.\n\nrichardson describes suu kyi as being furious with his suggestion that the journalists' case be handed swiftly as a way to protect freedom of the press, and a scheduled meeting with the minister of home affairs was abruptly canceled. in the statement he also notes being taken aback by the vigor with which the media, the united nations, human rights groups, and in general the international community were disparaged in meeting with suu kyi and the advisory board.\n\nwhile it is important to recognize that the military still wield significant power and that they are primarily to blame for the recent exodus of refugees in the wake of arsa [arakan rohingya salvation army] attacks, the absence of daw suu's moral leadership on this critical issue is of great concern, says richardson.\n\nrichardson also says it appears the board is likely to become a cheerleading squad for government policy rather than genuine change needed to assure peace and stability in rakhine state.\n\nsince august, nearly 700,000 rohingya fled across the border into bangladesh from their homes in rakhine state. this latest exodus of the muslim minority group followed a brutal military campaign launched in response to an attack by a rohingya militant group on myanmar police. a plan hammered out between bangladesh and myanmar to repatriate the rohingya who've fled since august was supposed to start this week, but has been delayed indefinitely.
hurdles remain as the final countdown begins for the 2020 census\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrew harnik/ap andrew harnik/ap\n\nupdated jan. 18 at 6:12 p.m. et\n\nthe last stretch before the start of the 2020 census is upon us.\n\nthe once-a-decade, national head count is scheduled to kick off next january. census workers start in the village of toksook bay and other parts of rural alaska when the ground there is frozen enough for door-to-door visits. then, beginning in march 2020, the u.s. government's most expansive peacetime operation rolls out to households in the rest of the country.\n\nthe data collected will be used for a major reset in political power and federal funding through 2030. each state's share of representatives in congress, as well as votes in the electoral college, will be determined for the next decade by the new population counts. those counts are also used to distribute more than $880 billion a year in federal funds for medicare, schools and other public services, according to the latest estimate by the george washington institute of public policy.\n\nbut before the government can carry out its constitutional mandate to count every person living in the country, it has plenty of hurdles to clear in 2019. here are five of the most pressing questions surrounding the upcoming census.\n\n1. will there be enough money for the census?\n\nthe census bureau is closed because of the government shutdown, but work for the 2020 census is continuing for now thanks to carryover funding from the 2018 omnibus spending bill president trump signed in march.\n\nthe bureau estimates that funding can last at least through march or into april with no change to the schedule, cost, or scale of the 2020 head count, according to a statement from the bureau's public information office.\n\nin case the shutdown lasts longer — as trump has threatened — the census bureau has started looking into ways to extend the length of the funds without notable programmatic slowdowns, the agency's statement says.\n\nnext year's head count is expected to be the most expensive in u.s. history. the census bureau estimates it will cost a total of $15.6 billion. spending for the census is already ramping up as the bureau begins opening temporary local offices around the country this month and prepares to launch a national advertising campaign in january 2020.\n\nlast year, congress significantly boosted funding for the agency, reversing years of lawmakers not matching the funding levels agency officials said they would need. past funding uncertainty has forced the bureau to cancel some field tests for the census, including ones designed to work out the logistics of counting rural areas and collecting spanish-language responses.\n\nnow, census advocates are watching to see if the census gets caught in a prolonged funding stalemate with the partial federal government shutdown – a scenario that could impact the hiring of census workers, advertising plans and it systems preparations for the first u.s. census to allow all households to respond online.\n\n2. what will happen to plans to add a citizenship question?\n\nthe trump administration is fighting seven lawsuits over a hotly contested question it added to the 2020 census last year – is this person a citizen of the united states?\n\nwhile the administration insists the justice department wants responses to the question to help protect the voting rights of racial and language minorities, more than two dozen states and cities, plus other critics, worry the question will discourage households with noncitizens, including unauthorized immigrants, from participating in the census.\n\nin the two lead lawsuits in new york, a federal judge has ordered the trump administration to stop its plan to add the question.\n\nthe legal battle is expected to make its way to the supreme court this year. whether the question stays or goes has to be finalized by june, the census bureau says, so that printing the paper questionnaires can be completed without disrupting the tight deadlines leading up to 2020.\n\nas the issue winds its way through the courts, some democrats in congress are exploring other ways to stop the administration's plans. one possibility is including language in a spending bill that would defund the question.\n\nwhether through the appropriations process, the courts, or elsewhere, we must act to make sure an untested citizenship question is not on the 2020 census, says democratic rep. josé serrano of new york — who now chairs the house appropriations subcommittee that funds the census — in a written statement.\n\nanother front to watch is the democrat-controlled house committee on oversight and reform. its newly-named chair, rep. elijah cummings of maryland, says he plans to investigate why commerce secretary wilbur ross, who oversees the census, approved adding the question.\n\nsecretary ross told congress it was all the justice department's idea when evidence indicates he orchestrated the whole thing, cummings says in a written statement. we will get to the bottom of this issue.\n\ntestimony by ross at a congressional hearing, as well as any internal documents lawmakers uncover, could be used against the trump administration in the citizenship question lawsuits.\n\nwe'll be watching closely and listening intently to any subsequent representations that ross makes to the public, says kristen clarke, president and executive director of the national lawyers' committee for civil rights under law, which is representing plaintiffs in one of the california-based lawsuits.\n\nso far, ross has avoided having to sit for questioning under oath by the plaintiffs' attorneys. the supreme court was planning to weigh in on whether ross can be deposed for the lawsuits, but the justices cancelled oral arguments after the ruling by the federal judge in new york neutralized the issue.\n\nif the citizenship question does stay on the 2020 census forms, the responses collected could dramatically reshape the political maps of some states and local communities. according to a federal register notice submitted by the commerce department in december, the census bureau is planning to ask state and local officials in charge of redistricting whether they want citizenship data from the 2020 census. that data, if it becomes available, could be used to redraw voting districts based on the number of u.s. citizens rather than on all residents regardless of citizenship.\n\n3. is the online u.s. census prepared for cybersecurity threats?\n\nto cut down on costs and keep up with the digital age we're living in, the census bureau is preparing to allow all households to submit their 2020 census responses through the internet. the new convenience, however, has raised questions about whether the census bureau is prepared for the potential risk to people's privacy.\n\nbecause the 2020 census involves collecting personal information from over a hundred million households across the country, it will be important that the bureau addresses system security weaknesses in a timely manner and ensures that risks are at an acceptable level before systems are deployed, investigators at the government accountability office wrote in a recent report.\n\nlast june, the census bureau identified close to 3,100 security weaknesses in the it systems for the 2020 census, according to the report.\n\nthe bureau is preparing for potential problem scenarios, including denial-of-service attacks that crash the online questionnaire, fake websites impersonating the census bureau, and hacking of phones, laptops and other electronic devices used by the bureau's employees. officials, however, say they're not planning to go into the details with the public.\n\nwe have not shared our plans for cybersecurity with the public intentionally to not give the opposing team, adversaries wanting to discredit the federal government, an advantage, the census bureau's chief information officer, kevin smith, wrote in a blog post in august.\n\n4. can the census bureau hire enough census workers?\n\nfor the last census in 2010, the u.s. government hired about 635,000 temporary workers to collect responses in person from households that did not complete or mail back a census form. help will be wanted again in 2020, but the low unemployment rate is putting pressure on the census bureau's recruiting efforts.\n\nusing iphones to enter and submit people's information online is expected to help census workers be more productive in the field. still, the bureau is planning to launch an advertising campaign targeting not only unemployed workers but also those who are already working and have evenings and weekends free.\n\nif you're paying any attention to the news, teachers are complaining about needing to make more money, albert fontenot, the census bureau's head of the 2020 census, said during a public meeting in october. teachers love to do the census. it's a great opportunity for them to partake in democracy and be able to tell their students about what they do.\n\n5. will the census undercount communities of color and other hard-to-count populations?\n\nthe census bureau is charged with counting every person living in the u.s. every 10 years. but some populations have been more difficult to tally up accurately than others.\n\nin 2010, the bureau over-counted white people who did not identify as hispanic, while net undercounting close to 2.1 percent of black residents and 1.5 percent of latino residents — or more than 1.5 million people in total — according to estimates from a census bureau study.\n\nthe bureau is trying to overcome this challenge of reaching hard-to-count groups, in part, by increasing the number of languages that responses can be submitted in and starting to hire workers to coordinate outreach efforts with local organizations earlier than it did for the 2010 census.\n\nstill, the naacp is leading a lawsuit alleging that the census bureau's deficient preparations for 2020 risk a massive undercount of communities of color, according to its complaint. the trump administration has asked a federal judge in maryland to dismiss the case.\n\ncritics of the citizenship question are concerned that asking about u.s. citizenship status will jeopardize the accuracy of the information collected, especially data about many hard-to-count populations.\n\nbeginning in june, the bureau is planning to conduct the first-ever field test of a 2020 census form with the citizenship question. results, officials say, will inform decisions on whether to hire more census workers and adapt the 2020 census marketing campaign due to any negative response to the question.\n\nsome census advocates are worried that a citizenship question would deter community groups from helping to promote the census.\n\nthe @uscensusbureau should be praying for these [citizenship question] lawsuits to succeed. they cannot expect that the 'trusted messengers' like @naleo will do their job for them! wrote arturo vargas, the ceo of the national association of latino elected and appointed officials, in a tweet in september.\n\nlast november, an email released as part of the citizenship question lawsuits alarmed some community groups preparing to drum up public interest in the census.\n\nfederal law prohibits the release of an individual's census responses until 72 years after the data are collected. but concerns about confidentiality surfaced after the internal email revealed a justice department discussion about the possibility of renewed debate over whether the patriot act, passed after the sept. 11 terrorist attacks, could force individuals' confidential census responses to be released earlier.
10 years after housing crisis: a realtor, a renter, starting over, staying put\n\ntoggle caption caitlin o'hara for npr\n\nten years ago, a slow-moving disaster shook the entire country: a financial meltdown that did not leave a single state untouched.\n\nthe main catalyst was a housing bubble.\n\nthroughout the early 2000s, housing prices in some parts of the country rose, and rose, and rose. homes with prices that for decades had steadily grown with inflation were suddenly worth 50 percent or 100 percent more.\n\nthe rapidly rising prices fueled extraordinary behavior. home sales nearly doubled from 2000 to 2005. in some metro areas, prices were rising so fast that an investor could buy a house, sit on it for a couple months, and sell it for a profit.\n\nfor many homeowners, rising values made it attractive to refinance their mortgages and use their home equity to pay for other things — investment properties, remodels, cars.\n\nlenders let people pay more than they could afford for homes and devised extraordinary methods of doing so: loans described as ninja (no income, no job, no assets), liar (no-verification stated income loans) and exploding (loans where the monthly payments would explode after a two-year promotional rate). subprime lending soared.\n\nthen, the bubble popped.\n\nin 2007, home prices started to tumble. homeowners began to default, leading to record foreclosures. lenders and banks were left holding bad debt.\n\nmajor financial institutions began to fail, one by one: in january 2008, mortgage lender countrywide was sold to bank of america; bear stearns was bailed out in march and sold to jpmorgan chase; in september, lehman brothers collapsed and washington mutual became the largest bank failure in u.s. history. in october, congress passed a $700 billion bailout bill.\n\nofficially, the recession lasted only until june 2009. but wages tumbled and unemployment soared well past then. by february 2010, the u.s. economy had lost 8.8 million jobs from the peak in late 2007.\n\nphoenix felt the housing collapse worse than almost anywhere else. on average, homes in the metro area lost 56 percent of their value — the third worst in the country.\n\nthe meltdown in prices left hundreds of thousands of homeowners underwater on their mortgages, owing more than their houses were worth. some chose to stay in their homes. some walked away by choice. many were forced to leave. foreclosures swept across the city by the tens of thousands.\n\nten years later, america has rebounded from the great recession and the housing crash. the stock market has recovered. unemployment is lower than it was during the housing bubble.\n\nin phoenix, the scars remain.\n\nthe realtor\n\nloading...\n\ni've seen a lot over 27 years, sean hahn says. at 50, he has spent more than half his life working as a realtor in phoenix, since the early 1990s. there has been a lot to see in phoenix real estate in that time. during the housing bubble, local housing prices doubled in just three years. we'd put a house on the market, and by noon we'd have 12 offers, hahn says.\n\nthen came the crash.\n\nclients hahn had helped buy a house a year or two before began to call about exit strategies. he learned how to negotiate short sales, helping homeowners come to an agreement with their bank to sell the house for less than they still owed. hahn is upbeat, naturally optimistic. the change haunted him.\n\ni had a stomachache all the time when i was working through that process, he says. they'd invested so much time and money in making it a home, and now they have to leave it. i still have nightmares to this day that i'm going through that.\n\nduring the bust, hahn would go out driving with investors, looking up foreclosed homes and evaluating their condition. sometimes the departing owners would clean the place before leaving. more often, they did not. hahn saw properties that had been stripped of cabinetry, doors, air conditioners, copper pipes, even the lightbulbs. the worst were the houses that had been intentionally defaced by their desperate, angry former owners.\n\nout of them all, hahn says there is one abandoned house he remembers most.\n\nin 2012, he and an investor were driving around town inspecting foreclosed homes.\n\none house on their list, a small ranch about 20 miles north of downtown, reeked so strongly of urine that they could smell it from the driveway. the investor told hahn, let's go; this looks horrible.\n\nbut hahn wanted to take a look: it was the first house he'd ever bought for himself. he and his wife purchased the house in the late '80s for $55,000 and moved out a few years later. now, it was next to ruined.\n\nit was so sad. it was just, like, destruction and damage where people just let go. they just lived in filth. they destroyed the house, he says. my wife and i had so much pride in that little home.\n\nthe former homeowner\n\nloading...\n\nin october 1999, adriana rodriguez and her then-husband bought a comfortable house in a decent part of phoenix for themselves and their two young daughters. she did administrative work in a dental office; he was a forklift operator for warehouses.\n\nin 2005, they refinanced their mortgage to make some upgrades to the house. but, she acknowledges now, we didn't understand the loan quite completely. after a few years, their interest rate jumped, and their mortgage payments skyrocketed.\n\nabout 80 percent of all subprime mortgages written during the peak of the housing bubble were what was known as exploding adjustable-rate mortgages. lenders offered two or three years at an introductory teaser rate. then, interest rates would jump as much as 4 percentage points, and the borrower's monthly payments would skyrocket. rodriguez says she believes they were taken advantage of.\n\nmultiple analyses of home loans initiated during the housing boom have found that black and latino borrowers were more likely to receive high-risk loans than whites with similar incomes and credit scores. and once they had the subprime loans, blacks and hispanics were often charged higher interest rates than were white subprime borrowers with similar credit scores, according to a study by the center for responsible lending, a nonprofit research group.\n\nexperts disagree on how much blame for the crisis should be placed on subprime lenders. only about 5 percent of housing mortgage applications approved in 2006 were subprime. the racial disparities in lending practices helped drive foreclosure rates higher for borrowers of color. and mortgage discrimination persists today.\n\nas the rodriguezes' mortgage payments ballooned, the economy collapsed. her husband lost his job in 2008. they began to struggle to hold together their marriage. in the end, they divorced, leaving adriana rodriguez to pay for the house on her own. she sold her car to help with home payments, but she was only delaying the inevitable. in 2010, she defaulted on the payments, and she and her daughters moved out within a year. they've rented ever since.\n\nnow, at 42 years old, rodriguez says the thought of buying a new house is daunting.\n\ni just don't even want to go there, she says. i have friends who have recovered from it and have purchased homes. but i don't know where to start. it's just hard. you don't ever want to go through that again.\n\nthe boomerang buyers\n\nloading...\n\nin 2006, kristin and justin hege bought the house they thought would be their forever home. at the time, she was 29 and he was 27. it felt perfect: the right size, the right location. they brought one of their sons home from the hospital to that house.\n\ni grew up in a small town in ohio, kristin says. the 'forever home' thing was a legit thing. you stayed in your house until your kids went away to school.\n\nexpecting to stay in the house for 15 years or more, they decided to do a complete remodel in 2007. they refinanced their original mortgage to pull out some equity to make the renovations. afterward, at the height of the bubble, their house was valued at more than $400,000.\n\nwhen home prices began to fall, their initial reaction was to stick it out. they could have kept paying their mortgage. the heges own their own businesses; they were very sensitive to the damage a foreclosure or a short sale could do to their credit. and they thought it felt wrong to walk away from a commitment they'd signed on to.\n\nwe could have each had two more jobs apiece and made it work and done it, kristin says. it was very hard for us and who we are as people to walk away.\n\nbut as home prices kept falling, the financial reality became impossible to ignore.\n\neventually the heges sold their house in a short sale for $149,000 — about half of what they still owed to the bank. (in a typical short sale, the bank agrees to accept less than what is owed and release the remainder of the debt. in many cases, lenders prefer short sales over foreclosures.)\n\nevents like short sales can stay on a credit report for seven years. because of that, many americans who missed payments, sold short or went into foreclosure during the recession are now returning to the housing market with healthy credit. they are called boomerang buyers.\n\nafter seven years of renting, the heges bought again for the first time last year.\n\nanyone can make a mistake. we made a mistake. we made a dumb choice, justin says. we are much more fiscally responsible now. seven years is a long time to learn.\n\nthe locksmith\n\nloading...\n\nin 2007, fred decker was tired of his job managing a starbucks. he was 32. he quit and became a locksmith.\n\nsoon, decker was spending his days changing the locks on vacant homes, as many as eight a day. eventually, he says, he changed the locks on two-thirds of the homes in his own neighborhood.\n\nthe first step was to check whether anyone was there. he would peer in the windows, put his ear to the door. a beeping smoke detector was a dead giveaway — the batteries had gone dead, but no one was around to change them. if the house was vacant, he would pick the lock on the front door and go in.\n\nforeclosures came in all conditions. some were impeccably cleaned; some were trashed. most were in between, with leftover clothes or furniture here and there, cotton swabs on the floor or beer bottles on the table.\n\nin one house, he remembers, right by the front door was an end table with halloween candy in it. it was august.\n\nit just looked like they vanished, he says. the house was completely furnished. there were pictures on the walls, bills on the counter. the most unsettling thing was the clothes still being in the dressers, in the closets. they were just gone.\n\ndecker is a homeowner himself. he and his wife bought their house in 2006. at the time, they thought they were getting a deal. they bought from a friend who needed to sell in a hurry and ended up buying the house for about $30,000 less than its appraised value.\n\nin reality, there could not have been a worse time to buy a house in phoenix. as they bought the house, prices began stalling; soon after, they began to crater. the deckers were underwater by 2007. at the bottom of the trough, their home was worth half of what they had bought it for.\n\nhe and his wife chose to stay. he says their mortgage was a contract they had made with society, that it would be irresponsible, even immoral, to walk away.\n\nbut every time his job took him into a foreclosed home, he was faced with his own decision to stay.\n\ni felt like a sucker. like, here i am, paying my bills, and everyone else — i don't know, he says. are they in a situation where they lost their jobs and they just had no choice? or are they like some people that i know who just decided, 'well, this is a bad situation. i don't want to be underwater for 10 years; i'm just going to walk'?\n\ndecker and his wife are still living in the same house. they hope to be above water next year.
in iran's religious heartland, an enduring distrust of the u.s.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption atta kenare/afp/getty images atta kenare/afp/getty images\n\niranians vote on friday for parliament. the results could signal whether they are ready to engage more robustly with the west, following a deal with world powers aimed at preventing the country from developing nuclear weapons.\n\nhardliners have effectively controlled the country's political system since iran's revolution. but hassan rouhani, the current president, is considered a moderate and has worked to improve relations with the west. the election will be a crucial test of his agenda.\n\ntoggle caption peter kenyon/npr\n\nin qom, the religious center south of tehran, very few people believe more engagement is a good idea.\n\na funeral procession moves through an intricately tiled arch at a holy shrine as a cold morning rain comes down. here, honoring the dead, especially martyrs killed by iran's enemies, is as natural as breathing. students of all ages interested in the study of shiite islam come to qom from all over the world.\n\nas you may have guessed, qom is also a very politically conservative place. at a modest religious school named for a martyred ayatollah, depictions of the u.s. and israeli flags are painted on the entrance floor so students can walk on them. the noon call to prayer is not recorded and blasted out over a loudspeaker, a common practice these days. instead, a slender young man fills the courtyard with his unamplified voice, as students shuffle past.\n\none of the worshipers is 20-year-old ali hajizadeh. he says the nuclear deal is enough engagement with the west for now.\n\nof course we had the nuclear agreement, he says. 'the whole world witnessed that we extended our hand in friendship. but as the supreme leader has said, we cannot solve problems with countries we don't trust.\n\nthat view is echoed by ayatollah ismail pourvahab, the polite, reserved director of the school, whose beard is showing some gray.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption peter kenyon/npr peter kenyon/npr\n\ngod only knows what we gave up, he says. we had 19,000 centrifuges. we reduced them to 6,000. fordow nuclear facility was our eyes, it was our reputation. enriched uranium, up to 20 percent, and we needed [it] in medical facilities — and we gave it up. despite all these good gestures, we see that every single day, the congress of the united states of america, they are constantly speaking of imposing other sanctions.\n\npourvahab seems to know an awful lot about the nuclear accord, but then again, fordow, the underground nuclear site now being converted for research, is just 20 miles away. pourvahab sounds a bit like secretary of state john kerry when he says the deal boils down to major cuts in iran's nuclear program in return for limited sanctions relief.\n\nthe person pourvahab does not sound like — at all — is his own country's foreign minister, mohammad javad-zarif, who has called the deal a win-win solution for diplomacy and mutual respect.\n\npourvahab lists a host of reasons why not to engage with the u.s., going back to washington's support for the shah's dictatorship and continuing up to today.\n\nwho is causing trouble in bahrain, yemen, afghanistan? he says. saudi airplanes are constantly bombing yemen. where are these bombs, missiles coming from? all of these come with the support of the u.s. so long as there is no change in this behavior, there is no hope that things will change.\n\nthis argument ignores iran's own support for listed terrorist groups such as hezbollah and hamas. it's also not a majority view, iranians say. but a visit to qom does give a westerner a glimpse of the forces that will be lining up against iran's moderate and reformist politicians in friday's vote.
taut, moving 'black girl' helped put african cinema on the map\n\nfifty years after its debut, a restored version of senegalese director ousmane sembène's first film is now available. john powers says black girl feels as timely today as it did half a century ago.\n\ndave davies, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. the writer and director ousmane sembene, who died in 2007, is the most famous and acclaimed black african filmmaker. his first film, black girl, which came out in 1966, was instantly hailed as a cultural breakthrough. a new, restored version of the film is now out on dvd, blu-ray and itunes streaming. our critic at large john powers says black girl isn't merely a landmark but a movie that still packs a wallop.\n\njohn powers, byline: we can all name movies that take place in africa, from the many adventures of tarzan to oscar-winning hits like out of africa. but these are not movies that actually come out of africa. they were made by outsiders looking in. in fact, i'd wager that most westerners have never seen an african story filmed from the inside. there's no better way to correct this than black girl, the taut, moving 1966 film that's widely regarded as the first ever fiction feature by a black african director. it was written and directed by ousmane sembene, a brilliant senegalese auteur who wasn't merely the godfather of african cinema but probably the greatest artist it has yet produced.\n\nnow out on dvd, blu-ray and itunes streaming in a gorgeous new restauration from criterion, sembene's debut feels as timely today as it did half a century ago. black girl centers on diouana, a young illiterate senegalese woman, played by the lovely mbissine therese diop, who has worked for a french colonial couple in the capital city of dakar. she's thrilled when they ask her to move with them to the riviera. filled with fantasies of her new life, she dons high heels and her best dress. she's going to be french. diouana soon discovers the chasm separating her dreams and reality. not only do her bosses live in a high-rise apartment instead of the villa they'd enjoyed in africa, but the france she now inhabits is the space in which she cooks and cleans, an imprisoning kitchen, bath and living room that offer teasing glimpses out the window of the sea.\n\nwhen diouana is not being publicly shown off like an exotic pet, her mistress privately treats her like a slave. she rebels, but what can she do? she can't even read, let alone answer, the letters from her mother back in senegal. her employers do that for her. of course, there's nothing more familiar than masters treating their servants badly. but what made black girl groundbreaking in its day, and still gives it an incandescent power, is that these are black africans telling their own story and telling it with a searing passion. although sembene is clearly making a political point about the west's dehumanizing treatment of poor africans, he never lets his heroine become an abstraction. we feel her pain, humiliation and anger at having her humanity invalidated.\n\none reason that sembene could pull this off was that, by the time he made black girl, he was a man in his 40s who knew life. this was no film school brat but the son of a poor muslim fisherman who'd fought with the free french forces during world war ii, stowed away to do manual labor in france, returned to senegal in time for independence in 1960, became a largely self-taught writer - his 1960 novel, god's bits of wood, is tremendous - and then became a filmmaker because so many of his countrymen couldn't read. to reach them, he needed to make movies, and that's just what he did. over the next decade, sembene would go on to make richer and more complex works than black girl.\n\nyou should be sure to see his 2004 feminist masterwork moolaade. but this first one remained the foundation stone. it put an entire continent on the movie map and showed other would-be african filmmakers what was possible. it opened up the world, and it did this with an artistry startling in a new director. beautifully shot by christian lacoste, this movie about black people and white people becomes a symphony in blacks and whites, from the black-and-white tile floors to the black patterns on diouana's white dresses to the newspaper article about her that appears near the end. the whole story is encapsulated in the african mask that diouana gives to her mistress on her first day of work. each time we see it, its emotional charge has changed until the mask has gone from being a gesture of appreciation to a symbol of angry rebellion.\n\nin the process, black girl radically changes our perspective. as westerners, we begin the movie thinking we're watching africans, but we realize that africans like sembene have been watching us, too, and know us far better than we know them.\n\ndavies: john powers is film and tv critic for vogue and vogue.com.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ndavies: on monday's show, advertisers and marketers already track our shopping behavior online, but businesses are now tracking our behavior elsewhere, through apps on our phones.\n\njoseph turow: they track how you're walking through the store, where you are and can even change the price on goods.\n\ndavies: we'll talk with joseph turow about his new book, the aisles have eyes. hope you can join us. fresh air's executive producer is danny miller. our technical director and engineer is audrey bentham additional engineering support from joyce lieberman and julian herzfeld. our associate producer for online media is molly seavy-nesper. roberta shorrock directs the show. terry gross returns monday. i'm dave davies.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

housing secretary ben carson clarifies comment that poverty is a 'state of mind'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption chris carlson/ap chris carlson/ap\n\nhousing and urban development secretary ben carson is standing by his controversial comment that poverty is a state of mind, but he says that how a person thinks is only one component that contributes to being poor.\n\nwhat i said is that it is a factor. a part of poverty can be the state of mind, he told npr in an interview. people tend to approach things differently, based on their frame of mind.\n\nhis agency, he says, wants to find ways to make sure that people understand that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you, is you.\n\ncarson, who grew up in poverty, said in a sirius xm radio interview last month that poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind. the comment drew widespread criticism from anti-poverty advocates who say it implies that poor americans are at fault for their poverty and that they're better off without government aid.\n\ncarson is scheduled to appear before a house appropriations subcommittee thursday to defend president trump's 2018 budget request for his agency.\n\ncarson will likely face tough questions about his comments on poverty as well as the administration's proposal to cut more than $6 billion — or 13 percent — from hud's budget. among the programs targeted: public housing, housing vouchers, community development block grants, and other aid for low-income americans.\n\nthe administration argues that much of this spending is ineffective and inefficient and that the money would be better spent elsewhere. and carson tells npr his agency's approach is aimed at breaking cycles of poverty long term. housing advocates say the cuts would be devastating for millions of americans who can't afford a place to live without assistance.\n\ncarson sat down with npr's pam fessler at his hud office last week to talk about some of these issues. here are some highlights:\n\ninterview highlights\n\nyou made these comments about poverty largely being a state of mind. can you explain how much you think a state of mind accounts for somebody being poor?\n\nyou know americans are industrious people. that's how america got to be a great place. we're not a little feeble people who have to be spoon-fed.\n\nwhat i said is that it is a factor. a part of poverty can be the state of mind. poor in spirit. and people tend to approach things differently, based on their frame of mind.\n\na good example would be, if you were a minor league baseball player, and you were brought up to the majors and you look up on the mound and you say, nolan ryan! oh no, he's a legend. he's got a 100 mile per hour fastball. i'll probably not even see the ball. you're probably not going to get a hit. if you come up and say, nolan ryan. he's an old man. i'm going to knock the cover off the ball, you are probably going to have a much better chance.\n\nso one of the things i think government can do very well is to help create the right kinds of mindset, frame of mind, by providing ladders of opportunity so that people can really see what's going on around them. a lot of times if you go to a disadvantaged neighborhood, you ask the kids, what do you want to do when you grow up? you get about five different answers. but there's a thousand. we need to show people the other 995 and how you get there. and those are the kinds of things that create that can-do attitude that is so important, and that for such a long time was a part of the american mindset. and there are those now who want people to think that somebody else is in control of you and that you're a victim. we want to find ways to make sure that people understand that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you, is you.\n\ni want to make sure i'm clear. you're saying it's only one component of people being poor, or the main component?\n\nof course [state of mind is] just a component [but] it is an important component, how a person thinks. and i know there was a recent article that says, no, the state of mind is caused by poverty. i totally disagree with that. i think you can have a lot of people who are in poverty who are not adversely affected by that at all, who have a winning attitude and who will do whatever they need to do to be successful. and i would encourage people to go to the horatio alger society website, and read those hundreds of biographies there of americans who rose through incredible odds and severe poverty to become leaders in our society\n\nso what are you going to do at hud to give people what you say is the right state of mind to get out of poverty?\n\na number of things, but one of the interesting concepts we're working on are centers that will be put into neighborhoods, repurposing some of the old buildings, and exposing people to what those many opportunities are, exposing people to some basic skills that people used to get, for instance in high school, creating mentorship programs.\n\nthere are a lot of people out there who would be delighted to take people under their wings but they don't have a good mechanism for doing that. (and) to provide day care for so many of the young ladies who end up getting pregnant and then their education stops. provide them a mechanism so that they can go back and get their ged, get their associate's degree, their bachelor's degree, their master's degree, take care of themselves and teach their children to take care of themselves, so that you break the cycles. the systems that we have been using for decades don't seem to be breaking the cycles. they seem to be adding to them, so we have to start thinking a little bit differently about these things.\n\nbut these centers aren't included in the president's budget. so how are they going to come about? is this something hud is going to do?\n\nyeah, these are things that we're working on. we're working on concepts, on how do we break these cycles, not how do we continue them. so many people just are focused on, but if we change this, then it won't go on like it always has, but maybe we don't want it to go on like it always has. we have three to four times as many people in need of affordable housing as we can provide. the more we can move out the more others we can help. success is not how many people we can put into public housing, it's how many we can get out of it.\n\nthe president's budget, though, calls for tremendous cuts in the hud budget. you told the national low income housing coalition that nobody would be thrown out on the street under your watch. but many analysts look at those numbers and say that people will be thrown out on the street under this budget. are they wrong?\n\ni think [analysts are] wrong, absolutely. we're paying very close attention to the vulnerable population and making that a very important part of how things are executed. bear in mind, there are a lot efficiencies that will save us a lot of money. and there's also a new model that we're really concentrating on. the old model was the federal government rides in on the white horse and plops down millions of dollars and says, build this place for all these people. and then goes on to the next project. the new model is the federal government seeds the project, and oversees and facilitates, along with the housing authorities, ... bringing in those private partners, bringing in the nonprofits, bringing in the faith community.\n\nand there's a lot more money there than there ever could be in the federal government. and you also get those people vested in the project, so now their income stream is dependent upon that project being successful. and having that done at the local level is going to be so much better.\n\nso you don't think anybody's going to be thrown out on the street?\n\ni don't think anybody's going to be thrown out on the streets. we're paying very careful attention to that.\n\nlos angeles county [has] reported that its homeless population went up 23 percent last year, which is an amazing number. but this budget calls for cuts in homeless assistance. do you think we're going to be seeing increases in homelessness in lots of other places?\n\ni don't think so. of course, the other part of that story is a number of places, like bergen county [n.j.], have reported there's no homelessness there. it's been eradicated. we're going to continue to make that a high priority, fully recognizing that it actually costs more to leave people homeless. that person sleeping under the bridge who's going to wind up in the emergency room, sometimes getting admitted for a week in the hospital? that week hospital stay costs more than it costs to put them in a place for a year. but putting them in a place is not enough. that's only part 1. part 2, we have to diagnose why they're in that condition. and part 3 is we have to treat it.\n\nthere are a number of things in the president's budget to encourage home ownership, but we have many millions of people in this country who aren't even close to that point. what's in the budget to help them?\n\nfor one thing, people are closer to it than you might think, but it's a matter of making sure they're educated properly. a lot of times people maybe bite off more than they can chew. and that's one of the reasons, for instance, that we are now looking at being able to guarantee mortgages on individual condominium units. because that can frequently be the first step. you buy that kind of home, you build up equity, you save, and then you move to the next step. in 2008, there were so many people who deceived individuals and simply said you've got an ever expanding price here. it's going to be your piggy bank for the rest of your life. and you can always count on that. and look what the results of that were. so we're working to make sure that the education of the people is such that they understand how you go about building that equity, and how you go about making your first, second, third steps to acquiring a home. because, quite frankly, in america ... the primary source of wealth is home ownership.\n\nhow are you going to educate people?\n\nwe have multiple places around the country, more than 1,200, of individuals who are trained ... and we're working with them. we're also looking at some uses of social media and the internet to help keep people well-informed on how to do things. giving them little quizzes that they can take, and things of that nature. it's really just a matter of making sure people are well-informed. you know americans are industrious people. that's how america got to be a great place. we're not a little feeble people who have to be spoon-fed. but we do have to recognize where we are right now and utilize what we have in order to help facilitate the use of the tremendous intellect and energies that exist within our society.\n\nbut there are some people who you would say are poor, who might want to try but they can't get out for other reasons besides their state of mind?\n\nof course, there are people of all types. but our duty in government and in hud is to provide the avenues, the mechanisms, to allow anyone who can get out to get out, and i think that's going to be most people.\n\nthis transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

atlanta, defeated gop sen. kelly loeffler after a bitter campaign. warnock becomes the first black democrat elected to the senate from a southern state.\n\nthe senate will now be split 50-50 between the two parties, giving vice president-elect kamala harris the tiebreaking vote.\n\nloading...\n\nossoff had a narrow lead wednesday morning when he declared victory.\n\nit is with humility that i thank the people of georgia for electing me to serve you in the united states senate, he said.\n\nperdue has not conceded.\n\nimpact on biden agenda\n\ncontrol of the senate significantly changes what president-elect joe biden could do, but most importantly, his party will now be able to set the legislative agenda. democrats failed to make the kind of gains in senate races in november that many had forecast, with gop incumbents staving off strong challenges in several states. but with narrow control, they will wield the gavels for senate committees, call hearings and decide which items get top priority.\n\nsen. chuck schumer of new york is expected to replace gop sen. mitch mcconnell as majority leader and will determine which bills come to the floor for votes.\n\nthe ambitious proposals addressing climate change and health care and other domestic priorities touted by biden and harris will be difficult, if impossible, to advance with more moderate democrats — especially those facing competitive 2022 midterm reelection campaigns — reluctant to sign onto partisan proposals. the much smaller-than-anticipated house democratic majority compounds the challenge for the party.\n\ninstead, biden will need to consider which domestic priorities can get bipartisan support since senate rules now require anything to get 60 votes to advance. the president-elect has already indicated that additional coronavirus relief will be his first priority, but he has also said he plans to unveil an infrastructure plan that could get support from republicans.\n\nin a statement wednesday, biden said that georgia's voters delivered a resounding message yesterday: they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now. on covid-19, on economic relief, on climate, on racial justice, on voting rights and so much more. they want us to move, but move together.\n\nthe president-elect also spoke to democrats' potential total control of washington.\n\nit looks like we will emerge from yesterday's election with democratic leadership in the house and the senate, and of course i'm pleased that we will be able to work with speaker [nancy] pelosi and a majority leader schumer, biden said. but i'm also just as determined today as i was yesterday to try to work with people in both parties — at the federal, state and local levels — to get big things done for our nation.\n\ndemocratic control will ease passage for biden's cabinet nominees. it's unclear with the short time between setting up committees and negotiating staff arrangements in the narrowly split chamber what that will mean for how quickly confirmation hearings and floor votes could happen with just two weeks before the inauguration.\n\nreturn of the bipartisan gangs\n\nafter months of stalemate over the size and scope of a coronavirus relief package in the closing weeks of the last congress, a group of centrists from both parties, led by democratic sen. joe manchin of west virginia and republican sen. susan collins of maine, unveiled a $900 billion compromise plan that became the basis for the legislation that ultimately was approved by the house and senate and signed by president trump.\n\nmanchin has said he hopes that model can translate into efforts in 2021.\n\nother republican moderates such as sen. mitt romney of utah and sen. lisa murkowski of alaska who helped on the covid-19 aid package could also serve as powerful players if they decide to work across the aisle.\n\nprogressives push for senate rule changes\n\nliberal democrats have pressed to get rid of the legislative filibuster so that they can pass major health care or environmental bills with a simple majority.\n\nbiden has sidestepped questions about whether he supports doing away with keeping the 60-vote threshold, but several top senate democrats have signaled they back changing a rule that many of them once insisted was essential to the institution. there will be intense pressure on biden and democratic leaders to show they can pass some bills with gop support, but if senate republicans stay largely unified to thwart the new administration's agenda, calls to eliminate the filibuster will increase.\n\nmanchin has publicly said he will oppose any effort to change the rules, and he will have outsize influence in the closely divided chamber.
trump administration urges states to open covid-19 vaccination to everyone over 65\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption joe raedle/getty images joe raedle/getty images\n\nupdated 2:20 p.m. et\n\nthe trump administration is making several big changes to its covid-19 vaccine distribution strategy, officials announced tuesday, in a bid to jump-start the rollout and get more americans vaccinated quickly.\n\nthe first change is to call on states to expand immediately the pool of people eligible to receive vaccines to those 65 and older, and those with underlying health conditions that make them more susceptible to covid-19.\n\nwe're telling states today that they should open vaccinations to all of their most vulnerable people. that is the most effective way to save lives now, health and human services secretary alex azar said at a press briefing tuesday.\n\nthe call is accompanied by a change in how vaccine doses are allocated to states. currently, doses are given to states based on their total adult populations. starting in two weeks, vaccines will be distributed to states based on the number of over 65-year-olds who live there — and by the pace of vaccine administration reported by states.\n\n[this new allocation system] gives states a strong incentive to ensure doses are going to work, protecting people rather than sitting on shelves or in freezers, azar said at the press briefing, we need doses going to where they'll be administered quickly and where they'll protect the most vulnerable.\n\nthe administration is also urging states to expand vaccination to more venues, such as convention center mega-sites, pharmacies and community health centers.\n\nin addition, senior officials announced they would stop holding second doses of the vaccines in reserve and instead ship more doses to states right away.\n\nbecause we now have a consistent pace of production, we can now ship all of the doses that had been held in physical reserve, azar said. we're now making the full reserve of doses we have available for order, [and] we are 100% committed to ensuring a second dose is available for every american who receives the first dose.\n\nthe change in releasing more of the previously reserved doses of vaccine preempts a policy change the biden team announced last week. officials from the biden team declined to comment on tuesday's policy announcements.\n\ni think it is appropriate to expand the groups, bring more people into the eligible pools, said robert wachter, chair of the university of san francisco, california department of medicine. when you hear people throwing out vaccine because they couldn't find anybody to give it to ... it's just a tragedy.\n\nwachter said, in tandem with opening up vaccine eligibility, details about scheduling to match supply with demand need to be worked out.\n\nbut other public health experts raised concerns that this rapid expansion and change in allocation method could throw more uncertainty into the mix for states.\n\nspecifically, the expansion of eligibility to the vast, undefined population of people with underlying conditions could be problematic, said claire hannan, executive director of the association of immunization managers. this is not making things easier to get vaccine into arms. this is unquestionably making things harder, and will cause considerable confusion among the public.\n\nthe trump administration's call to expand vaccine eligibility also deviates from previous centers for disease control and prevention guidance, which had recommended that front-line, essential workers and those over 75 be next in line, after health care workers and long-term care residents. essential workers include groups such as grocery, agricultural and transportation workers who are at high risk of exposure.\n\nwhile the decision for who is eligible to get a vaccine is up to states, recommendations from the federal government are influential.\n\nwe are all wanting to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, said grace lee, a pediatrician at stanford and a member of the cdc's vaccine advisory committee. but we [need to] focus on both people at the highest risk of infection and the people at highest risk of severe disease in order to stop this pandemic.\n\nthe move to expand eligibility to over 65-year-olds by trump administration officials seems well-intentioned, but it is incredibly confusing to the public and disruptive to those trying to implement these programs to keep switching up eligibility every few days, noted dr. kelly moore, deputy director of the nonprofit advocacy group the immunization action coalition and a former immunization manager in tennessee.\n\nhitching state allocations to the pace of vaccinations could make it much harder for states to schedule vaccine clinics, critics said.\n\nstates have had issues all along, with not knowing how much [vaccine] they're going to get, hannan said. saying that we're going to base the allocation on how much data is getting [reported] in the right place in the right hour — and that could change week to week. it's impossible to plan.\n\nin the press conference, trump administration officials presented these changes as a way to speed up distribution. however, they described the vaccine distribution process to date as flawless on their part and blamed the hitches in vaccine rollout on states.\n\nsome states' heavy-handed micromanagement of this process has stood in the way of vaccines reaching a broader swath of the vulnerable population more quickly, azar said.\n\nstates and the federal government have traded accusations over who's responsible for the slow pace of vaccinations. democratic governors and lawmakers have both urged the trump administration in recent days to make changes to the distribution to improve the speed of the process.\n\nthe country is currently a labyrinth of different stages of rollout and different policies, said jen kates, director of global health and hiv policy at the kaiser family foundation, which released an analysis on the subject this week.\n\nthere are already cases where states have moved and said we are vaccinating 65 [and older], and they just do not have a vaccine to do it or they don't have vaccinators to do it, she said. so there is a risk here if the systems that will get vaccines to actual arms are not in place or not sufficient that we're going to have a lot of people eligible and not able to get vaccine.\n\nthe danger, she added, is making people who are willing to get vaccinated so frustrated they give up.
nfl's conduct policy in spotlight again over kicker's admitted spousal abuse\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tom canavan/ap tom canavan/ap\n\nthe nfl's new york giants are heading to london for a game against the los angeles rams this sunday, without their all-pro kicker josh brown.\n\nthe decision to leave brown behind comes after new information emerged in a year-and-a-half-old domestic violence case. and suddenly, there are new questions about whether the league adheres to its supposedly tougher policy against domestic violence.\n\nin may 2015, brown was arrested for assaulting his then-wife molly at their home in washington state. brown wasn't charged.\n\nthe league conducted its own investigation to determine whether brown had violated the nfl's personal conduct policy. that policy allows for discipline to be imposed even when criminal charges are not presented.\n\nthe policy was toughened after the ray rice scandal in 2014. nfl commissioner roger goodell wrote the following in a letter to team owners in august of that year:\n\neffective immediately, violations of the personal conduct policy regarding assault, battery, domestic violence or sexual assault that involve physical force, will be subject to a suspension without pay of six games for a first offense, with consideration given to mitigating factors as well as a longer suspension when circumstances warrant.\n\nin august of this year, the league announced in a statement that mr. brown had violated the personal conduct policy. and then suspended him.\n\nfor one game.\n\ni have physically abused my wife.\n\nbrown served his suspension, and since then, he's been one of this season's best kickers, making 11 of 12 field goals and all nine of the giants' points after touchdowns.\n\nbut now brown's season is in limbo, as new revelations are prompting questions about the giants' and the nfl's handling of the case.\n\nwednesday night, law enforcement officials in washington state released documents that included an admission by brown that he had abused his wife.\n\none document was titled, josh brown – contract for change. it was dated march 28, 2013, more than two years before his assault arrest; it was drafted as part of marriage counseling he was then undergoing.\n\nbrown wrote:\n\ni have physically, verbally and emotionally abused my wife molly. i have controlled her by making her feel less human than me, and manipulated her with money. i have constantly made her feel as if she is not good enough for me to hide my own insecurities and self hate.\n\nbrown's admission prompted this statement from the nfl on thursday: in light of the release of these documents we will thoroughly review the additional information and determine next steps in the context of the nfl personal conduct policy.\n\norigins of the tougher nfl policy\n\nthe nfl's actions with brown are reminiscent of how it handled rice's notorious case two years ago, when the league responded to the first reports of rice's elevator assault on his then-fiancee with a two-game suspension.\n\nlater, explosive security camera video emerged of the baltimore ravens running back knocking out his fiancee with a hard cross to her jaw and dragging her unconscious from the elevator. rice was released by his team, then banned indefinitely from the nfl before being reinstated. no team has signed him since.\n\nthe crisis led goodell to issue tougher league rules concerning domestic violence, including the six-game suspension penalty.\n\nwhich raises the question why brown was suspended for only one game.\n\nwho knew what, when?\n\nthe brown case raises the same questions that surrounded the rice scandal: about what the nfl — and the player's team — knew about the player's conduct.\n\nthe nfl didn't respond to npr's request for an interview on thursday. but in a statement, the league said this:\n\nnfl investigators made repeated attempts — both orally and in writing — to obtain any and all evidence and relevant information in this case from the king county [washington] sheriff's office. each of those requests was denied and the sheriff's office declined to provide any of the requested information, which ultimately limited our ability to fully investigate this matter. we concluded our own investigation, more than a year after the initial incident, based on the facts and evidence available to us at the time and after making exhaustive attempts to obtain information in a timely fashion. it is unfortunate that we did not have the benefit or knowledge of these materials [the documents released wednesday] at the time.\n\na spokesperson for the king county sheriff's office, sgt. cindi west, says someone requested documents in may 2015, shortly after brown's arrest, but didn't initially identify himself as an investigator for the nfl. west said in any event the information was withheld because the investigation into brown was open and active.\n\nthe nfl acknowledges it learned in the course of its investigation that molly brown made allegations of other instances of abuse by her then-husband.\n\nand west says the nfl did receive a number of documents in august of this year, which included the transcript of a lengthy interview brown's wife gave investigators shortly after the incident, in which she alleged at least 20 instances of abuse over several years.\n\nbut the nfl says molly brown declined to speak with league investigators, and thus they had insufficient information to corroborate her allegations.\n\nhowever, on thursday, new york giants co-owner john mara told radio station wfan new york that brown certainly admitted to us that he abused his wife in the past.\n\nand mara said he knew of an incident at the january 2016 pro bowl in hawaii — the nfl's all-star game — when the nfl reportedly had to help molly brown and her three children find a different place to stay after she felt threatened by her husband at the player's hotel.\n\nthe giants re-signed brown to a two-year, $4 million contract this spring. according to usa today, mara said the team never spoke to molly brown before re-signing josh.\n\nthe giants released a statement thursday saying:\n\nin light of the news reports regarding the documents released by the state of washington yesterday, we think it makes sense to review this newly disclosed information and to revisit this issue following our trip to london. the giants do not condone or excuse any form of domestic violence. josh has acknowledged that he has issues in his life and has been working on these issues through therapy and counseling for a long period of time. we remain supportive of josh and his efforts.\n\nwest of the king county sheriff's office said thursday that charges were never brought against brown because his wife is uncomfortable testifying. west says that's not uncommon in domestic violence cases.\n\nwhat i'm comfortable saying on her behalf, says west, is that her children are her priority. she knows this case is going to get a lot of public attention, and she wants to keep her children's lives as normal as possible. that's one of the reasons she decided not to testify.\n\nbut left unanswered is whether the case of josh brown serves as an indictment of a league that appeared to learn its lesson two years ago, but in fact didn't.
a little-known climate fund is suddenly in the spotlight\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption anton petrus/getty images anton petrus/getty images\n\nthe green climate fund has been thrust into the spotlight of late.\n\npresident trump singled it out for scorn in his rose garden remarks last week announcing his decision to pull the u.s. from the paris climate agreement. along with that move, trump noted, he is ending further u.s. contributions to the so-called green climate fund — nice name.\n\nadvocates for the environment have countered with op-eds in defense of the fund. even comedian john oliver jumped into the fray. in his sunday night hbo show, oliver offered a point-by-point rebuttal of numerous incorrect statements that trump made about the fund, including the erroneous claim that the gcf, which is funded through voluntary contributions, would likely obligate the united states to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars.\n\nyet it seems a fair guess that most people remain hazy on what the green climate fund actually is — not the least because the gcf is so green in the other sense of that word: it's only just getting off the ground.\n\nso herewith we present seven facts you might not know about gcf and its mission:\n\n1) the gcf was created to exclusively serve low- and middle-income countries.\n\nspecifically, its mandate is to help developing countries reduce their emissions — so as to prevent further climate change — and adapt to the effects of climate change already occurring as a result of worldwide emissions. this includes supporting projects to build sea walls on the island nation of tuvalu, create an early warning network to alert farmers in malawi to floods and other disasters, launch energy companies that will provide rural people in east africa with solar power, and encourage investment in renewal energy companies in argentina.\n\n2) the gcf is pretty new. but it's older than the paris agreement.\n\nfive years older, to be precise. the gcf was formally created at the 2010 united nations climate change conference in cancun, mexico. that said, setting up an international organization of the gcf's scope and size takes time. so it wasn't until 2013 that the gcf was in a position to hold its first round of fundraising.\n\nforty-three countries pledged a total of $10.3 billion to get the ball rolling for the first several years — though no exact time period was specified for how long that money is supposed to last. so far, the gcf has committed $2.2 billion to 43 projects.\n\n3) a lot of the money for the green climate fund is supposed to come from rich countries ...\n\nthe gcf was created as a vehicle to carry out one of the major commitments made by developed countries at the 2010 cancun meeting: by 2020, they promised to mobilize $100 billion every year for climate change efforts in developing countries.\n\n4) ... but mostly this is about bringing in private funding.\n\nmobilize — that's the key word here, says leonardo martinez-diaz, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy and environment at the u.s. treasury in the obama administration. the term was specifically chosen to underscore the understanding that only a portion of the $100 billion per year would come directly from rich country governments. the plan is to motivate mostly private sources of capital — for example, for-profit corporations — to invest in efforts that help poor countries deal with climate change.\n\nthe gcf is designed to do this in a range of ways, says martinez-diaz, who is now global director of the sustainable finance center at the world resources institute, an environmental think tank. for example, if a private company is leery of investing in climate projects because of political and financial risks, the gcf will offer it loans, loan guarantees, or other forms of insurance.\n\n5) the gcf has what one green researcher calls a special sauce that similar organizations lack.\n\nmartinez-diaz notes that the gcf was never meant to be the only channel for mobilizing the $100 billion per year that rich countries promised would flow annually to poor countries by 2020. not even as an intermediary or pass-through, he says. it was meant to be one of several financing mechanisms. other examples include multilateral development banks like the world bank.\n\nbut the gcf has a lot more flexibility in how it can spend its money, notes jessica brown of the climate policy initiative, a research center that advises policymakers on green strategies. the world bank, for example, mainly gives out loans, which, by definition, must be paid back by recipient countries. the bank can only give outright grants to a small subset of extremely poor nations. and it can't generally be a direct co-investor in a for-profit enterprise. the gcf faces no such constraints.\n\nin contrast to development banks and rich country governments, the gcf also has a governing structure that gives developed countries a say over which projects get approved. the gcf was set up within the umbrella of the united nations system expressly for this purpose. and its governing board is equally divided between representatives of developed and developing countries — winning valuable buy-in from the recipient countries, says brown, a former international climate finance negotiator at the u.s. state department.\n\nthese two features are the special sauce that gcf can offer, says brown.\n\n6) trump's decision to end further u.s. funding deals the organization a blow — but doesn't necessarily kneecap it.\n\nof the $10.3 billion that donor countries pledged to the gcf during that initial fundraising round back in 2013, the u.s. promised $3 billion. under president barack obama, the u.s. has already handed over $1 billion in two installments of $500 million. the last one was disbursed in january, just before obama left office. (the money is paid out of a general state department fund over which the president has broad discretion).\n\ntrump's decision not to provide the remaining $2 billion effectively cuts the gcf's total expected funding by about 20 percent — hardly peanuts. and various analysts say the loss of u.s. engagement in the day-to-day running of the fund could have less tangible but no less impactful downsides because the u.s. government has particular expertise when it comes to keeping multinational organizations accountable and effective.\n\nbut while trump claimed in his speech that he had terminated the gcf, melanie nakagawa, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy transformation at the u.s. department of state under obama, notes that the $1 billion that the u.s. did provide is already in the system. the check is in and it is already having an impact.\n\nthe gcf estimates that the 43 projects for which it has started to disburse funds will impact a total of 128 million people. and it still has more than $6 billion left to disburse. during the initial fundraising round in 2013, the gcf agreed not to start its next round until it had allocated 60 percent of the money it had raised in the first. though no timeline was set, many people expected this would take four to five years.\n\nnow that the gcf will have less money, that date will presumably come sooner — some say as soon as 2018, notes brown, though she thinks it will be longer than that.\n\nand nakagawa says it's entirely possible that by the time the gcf is in need of its next cash infusion, it could find better favor from the u.s. four years from now, another administration could decide to put the money in, she says.\n\n7) the world is still a long way from mobilizing $100 billion in annual spending on climate change challenges in developing countries.\n\nback when world leaders agreed to the $100 billion goal, it wasn't actually clear how much the developed world was currently spending. the only really good data we have is starting in 2014, says martinez-diaz. that's from a 2015 analysis by the organization for economic co-operation and development and climate policy initiative. and it's not very promising: it finds that the public and private sectors combined spent about $62 billion.
pence backs republican lawmakers' plan to object to electoral college results\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption susan walsh/ap susan walsh/ap\n\nupdated at 10:03 p.m. et\n\na group of republicans has announced plans to reject presidential electors from states they consider disputed if congress doesn't create a commission to investigate their claims of fraud. the effort, fueled by baseless allegations of voter fraud, drew support from vice president pence by saturday night.\n\nthe lawmakers are the latest republicans to challenge the jan. 6 vote to certify president-elect joe biden's electoral college victory. the move will not alter biden's path to assuming the presidency but will draw out a normally routine process.\n\nsens. ted cruz of texas, ron johnson of wisconsin, james lankford of oklahoma, steve daines of montana, john kennedy of louisiana, marsha blackburn of tennessee and mike braun of indiana issued a joint statement saturday claiming unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.\n\nthey were joined by sens.-elect cynthia lummis of wyoming, roger marshall of kansas, bill hagerty of tennessee and tommy tuberville of alabama.\n\nthe statement calls for the creation of an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states.\n\naccordingly, we intend to vote on january 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed, the statement goes on to say.\n\nthe statement does not mention which states the republicans consider disputed. nor does it provide any evidence to back up their concerns.\n\nlater saturday, pence's chief of staff, marc short, said in a statement that pence shares the concerns of millions of americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election.\n\nthe vice president welcomes the efforts of members of the house and senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the congress and the american people on january 6th, the statement reads.\n\npresident trump and his legal team have targeted several states, including wisconsin and pennsylvania, in their attempts to overturn the election. but their legal efforts all failed because they couldn't provide clear evidence of fraud or misconduct in the 2020 election.\n\nthe lawmakers' statement comes days after sen. josh hawley of missouri promised to vote against certifying the electors' votes over concerns about the integrity of this election.\n\nin the house, republican reps. mo brooks from alabama, jody hice of georgia and joe wilson of south carolina are among several who have also promised to challenge the electoral college results. brooks has said that more than 30 members of congress plan to challenge the results.\n\nnone of the lawmakers has provided evidence to back up their concerns.\n\ncongressional rules allow for any member of the house joined by a senator to contest the electoral college vote. the challenge will prompt a floor debate and vote in each chamber.\n\nbut even with saturday's announcement, most senate republicans, including leader mitch mcconnell, oppose intervening in the election results, viewing it as an effort likely to fail because of democratic control of the house.\n\nrepublican sen. lisa murkowski of alaska also affirmed she would vote to certify the electoral college results, in a statement on saturday.\n\nthe courts and state legislatures have all honored their duty to hear legal allegations and have found nothing to warrant overturning the results, murkowski said.\n\nand on saturday evening, sen. mitt romney of utah harshly condemned the effort of fellow republicans, calling it an egregious ploy that dangerously threatens our democratic republic.\n\nthe objecting senators' statement cites the 1876 election between republican rutherford b. hayes and democrat samuel tilden as a precedent. in that election, results from several states remained in dispute, with congress ultimately creating an electoral commission to settle the matter. the commission ended up giving the victory to hayes by one vote.\n\nwe should follow that precedent, saturday's joint statement said. once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.
southern poverty law center records rise in u.s. hate groups\n\na new report from the southern poverty law center says the number of hate groups in the u.s. increased for a second year in a row with a growing number of right wing extremists operating in cyberspace. the most dramatic change in the organization's annual count was an expanding number of anti-muslim hate groups.\n\nrobert siegel, host:\n\nthe number of anti-muslim hate groups nearly tripled last year. that's just one of the dramatic statistics in a new report by the southern poverty law center. npr's cheryl corley has more on the growth of hate groups in the u.s.\n\ncheryl corley, byline: this annual count from the southern poverty law center includes groups like the ku klux klan, neo-nazis and other white nationalists, along with anti-government patriot groups and anti-lgbt groups. the splc's mark potok says their numbers have consistently been on the rise since about 2000.\n\nmark potok: the radical right out there is booming.\n\ncorley: the overall increase shows a 3 percent rise in the number of hate groups.\n\npotok: from 892 groups in 2015 to 917 last year.\n\ncorley: and part of that growth is due to what potok calls the trump phenomenon.\n\npotok: so in many ways, trump has co-opted these groups, co-opted their issues in terms of land use, in terms of guns, in terms of opposition to immigration, in terms of seeing muslims as a threat.\n\ncorley: the count for anti-muslim hate groups went up by nearly 200 percent, from 34 groups in 2015 to 101 in 2016. ibrahim hooper is with the council of american-islamic relations (ph).\n\nibrahim hooper: unfortunately, what we've seen over particularly the past year and during the presidential campaign was the mainstreaming of islamophobia.\n\ncorley: which hooper says has led to the burning of mosques and other incidents. the splc report also shows less dramatic increases for neo-confederate groups in the south and for black separatists, and declines in the number of patriot or anti-government groups and the ku klux klan. even so, the report says at 917, the number of hate groups in the country is still very high. potok says they are less tied to a region, but instead to population centers.\n\npotok: so in very, very low population states like north dakota you might have one group. in a very high population state like california, we've got 79.\n\ncorley: he says more and more, people on the radical right don't connect directly with hate groups but instead lurk on the internet until they decide action is needed. a good example, he said, is mass murderer dylann roof, who killed nine african-americans in a south carolina church in 2015 and apparently did not have direct contact with hate groups or white supremacists. cheryl corley, npr news, chicago.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
passing the torch, california gov. jerry brown tells newsom, 'don't screw it up'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption rich pedroncelli/ap rich pedroncelli/ap\n\ndepending on how you interpreted gavin newsom's campaign slogan courage for a change, he either has more courage than jerry brown — his campaign says that's not what they meant — or that newsom has the courage needed to bring about big changes.\n\nfor a man who often struggled to win brown's praise or even his attention, it's an attempt to promise fresh ideas and perhaps a willingness to embrace issues the outgoing governor left for others, such as single-payer health care.\n\neither way, newsom could be challenged by a possible economic downturn and a newly emboldened california legislature with massive majorities in both houses.\n\nif you're looking for timidity, i'm not your person, newsom said before the election. if you're looking for someone to be bold and courageous, lean into issues, change the order of things, i'm committing myself to that cause as the next governor.\n\nnewsom takes office monday, bringing to the state capital a very different style and set of priorities. journalists often referred to gov. jerry brown as the adult in the room when he huddled with legislators to close their differences. it was not a label legislators much cared for.\n\ni would resent it, too, if i was the legislature, brown told kqed, insisting he never said that. the governor said he expected legislators would push back against the next governor in ways they did not with him.\n\nwhen he became governor in 2011, brown said legislators were willing to embrace a cooperative approach partially because the economy was bad. he added that he appreciated how lawmakers worked with him to solve problems and to compromise when necessary.\n\nas things get easier, then people get more restive, and i think there is a desire for the legislature to assert [itself], brown said. gavin will have his challenges, but he's older now than i was when i left the first time, he said, referring to the end of his second term in 1983. brown said newsom's age and experience will serve him well.\n\nover the years, newsom has shown a tendency to get out in front of issues.\n\nin february 2004, he had been mayor of san francisco for about a month when he made a bold — some would say reckless — decision to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. for weeks on end, hundreds of couples from all over the state and nation lined up to get married.\n\nthe california supreme court soon put a stop to the weddings, but four years later, it ruled 4-3 that preventing same-sex couples from marrying violated the state constitution. it helped pave the way for a u.s. supreme court decision 10 years later legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nto his growing number of supporters, it also signaled newsom's willingness to push the envelope.\n\ni think he's a risk taker, and i think he's a true intellectual believer in the notion that you can fail fast as long as you're moving forward, says joyce newstat, newsom's policy director in the early part of his mayoralty.\n\na risk taker\n\nnewsom's penchant for taking risks may have its roots in his childhood. he was not a particularly good student and was eventually diagnosed with dyslexia. figuring out how to compensate for that learning disability was a gift, he says.\n\nyou know, nothing was rote, nothing was linear. i had to work around things, work differently, see the world differently, newsom told kqed. it allowed me to think outside the box. i've always been willing to take risks because you have to because you're never going to thrive in the more traditional sense.\n\nwhether it was outside the box thinking, political courage or just trying to keep his name in the headlines while he was lieutenant governor, newsom helped lay the groundwork for a statewide ballot measure legalizing the recreational use of marijuana.\n\ni think gavin newsom has demonstrated a really deep understanding of where the zeitgeist is going, says technology forecaster and stanford university professor, paul saffo. he sees newsom as fitting in well with the attitude of innovators in silicon valley.\n\nsaffo says newsom seems to share what he calls their disrespect for authority. the entrepreneurs' creed is that it's always easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission.\n\nthat tendency in newsom was not always appreciated. after his first marriage fell apart, he had an affair with a top aide's wife. some felt he often seemed bored being mayor; spending too much time thinking about his political future including a run for governor a decade ago.\n\ni'm relieved that he didn't become governor earlier, paul saffo says, adding that newsom's eight years watching political master jerry brown will give him a better sense of when to lead and when to follow. i suspect going into this governorship he's gonna understand that timing better than ever.\n\npassing the torch\n\nat age 51, gavin newsom is 30 years younger than the outgoing gov. jerry brown and totally different in style and temperament.\n\nthis transition is really a passing of the torch, not just of one governor to another but from one generation to another, says former california gov. gray davis. it's great that they have different styles. it's almost by necessity you have to govern for the times.\n\nnewsom is taking over a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world, and he has ambitions to match. california has the nation's highest rate of childhood poverty, which newsom wants to address. he also wants to reform the health care system and provide government-subsidized child care.\n\nbut he can't do it alone. he'll need help from people like democratic assembly speaker anthony rendon.\n\nrendon and newsom haven't always seen eye to eye. asked about newsom's ambitious agenda, rendon says that compared to brown — who focused on climate change, fiscal stability and criminal justice reform — the new governor has a wider range of policy interests.\n\nwhich i guess makes a lot of sense at the beginning of an administration, rendon says.\n\nrendon declined to compare newsom to brown, saying only that they're both exceptionally thoughtful leaders.\n\nas brown prepares to exit, he's leaving the state flush with cash, including a rainy day fund of $14 billion. brown's parting piece of advice for newsom? don't screw it up.
npr news exclusive with rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez on her green new deal\n\nthursday, february 7, 2019; washington, d.c. – in an exclusive interview with npr morning edition co-host steve inskeep, rep alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny-14) unveiled her green new deal resolution.\n\nexcerpts of the interview are available below and can be cited with attribution to npr.\n\naudio clips and a transcript of the full conversation are available upon request, please email mediarelations@npr.org.\n\non the green new deal:\n\neven the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us to our country, to the world. and so while carbon taxes are nice while things like cap and trade are nice, it's not what's going to save the planet. it could be part of a larger solution but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. and so that's really what we're trying to accomplish.\n\nshe continued:\n\nwe're talking about mobilizing an economy which means creating jobs...we're gonna have a lot of wind energy. we're going to have a lot of solar panels. and i think the goal is to really mobilize as much around renewables as possible.\n\nthis is really about providing justice for communities and just transitions for communities. so really the heart of the green new deal is about social justice and it's about allowing and fighting for things like fully-funded pensions for coal miners in west virginia, fighting for clean water in flint, and fighting for the ability of indigenous peoples to take a leadership role in in where we're moving as a country.\n\non turning her fame into political power:\n\ni'm learning. i think that really what i hope we're able to do as a party and as a nation is rediscover the power of public imagination. i think that this is a very special moment and frankly that is something that that i think the president did do. in that he was able to take his profile and say here's this hugely impossible thing that seems ridiculous but i'm going to seriously push for it. and for him that's his wall. and obviously i'm diametrically opposed to it but i think that the reason he's so attached to this thing despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the american people want, is that it's the only vision he has. he has no other picture of america except an america with a huge wall on the southern border. and i think that what we have a responsibility to do is show what is another america looks like.\n\non nancy pelosi's leadership as speaker of the house:\n\ni think she's doing great....one thing that i think has even increased my respect for her is the fact that when you are the speaker of the house and when you are the leader of the party there is a necessity, no matter what your political opinions are, where you have your own personal political ideology - what you cast your votes on, how you represent your individual district - and then there's this kind of you know herding cats of trying to bring people together, some of whom don't believe in my opinion and women's rights and others who are the staunchest progressives in the party. and when your job is to get all of those people to do the same thing it's extremely difficult to do. and i think that she's done a really good job so far.\n\ncontact\n\nnpr media relations\n\nemail: mediarelations (at) npr.org
a web comedy series is 'walking the line between hipsters and hijabis'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption conrad caton conrad caton\n\ngrowing up, comics nadia manzoor and radhika vaz never dreamed that they would one day co-star in a sketch-comedy series about two women in brooklyn.\n\nbeing onstage was something that i could've never imagined, manzoor, who grew up in a pakistani-muslim community in london, tells fresh air's terry gross. the only time i thought i was going to be onstage was as a bride; that's how pakistani women were on stages.\n\nbut now, in the web series shugs & fats, manzoor and vaz (who grew up in india) play immigrant roommates whom they describe as walking the line between hipsters and hijabis. manzoor is shugufta shugs, a 20-year-old enthusiastic millennial, while vaz is her distant relative fatima, also known as fats.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nadia p. manzoor nadia p. manzoor\n\n[fats] is in her mid-40s, vaz says. she's got these very conservative views about marriage and that's what she keeps trying to put on shugs all the time.\n\nthough vaz is not muslim and manzoor is no longer a practicing muslim, their characters in the show are muslims who wear hijabs. manzoor says the hijabs are a visual reminder of the challenges the characters face as they try to reconcile their cultural and religious beliefs with speed dating, catcalls and other aspects of life in brooklyn.\n\nthe fact that they wear [hijabs is] sort of a metaphor for traditional conservatism, manzoor says. shugs and fats are two women who are also interested in the secular world and interested in things that are down in brooklyn.\n\ninterview highlights\n\non why their characters wear hijabs in the series\n\nshugs and fats go speed dating youtube\n\nradhika vaz: with me, i'm not muslim and i've obviously never worn a hijab in my real life. back in, i would say, 2004, 2005, i was in new york and auditioning for all kinds of little independent plays and film and things like that, and i would repeatedly get called in — this is post 9/11 obviously — ... for the mother of the young man who may or may not be recruited to become a terrorist. ...\n\nat the time i was in a sketch-writing class and i was so upset by these auditions i was going out on that i wrote a character and i called her the terrorist's wife. and my thing was that all women really are, at the end of the day, so similar regardless of what they wear, and a lot of the time we think that because a woman is dressed in hijab she's going to be a certain way, and she's going to react to certain things a particular way, we put all of this on people. my character was the opposite. i wanted to flip that whole thing.\n\non a sketch where shugs gets her period\n\nvaz: that really comes from experience that i've had firsthand in india, because in the hindu culture, if a woman has her period she doesn't go into any kind of place of worship, she doesn't go into the kitchen. ... to this day and even in cities, the fact is a lot of this stuff is still very much taken into consideration, so it was something we both wanted to do.\n\ni think the idea of a woman having her period, a lot of people know it's such a normal thing, but it's made into such a big thing, we have to keep it so secret and all of that. so fats is obviously coming very much from that point of view, and the moment shugs comes out complaining about having, i got my period and my stomach hurts, fats just quarantines her. so we've taken it to an absurd level of, you have your period, you got to be quarantined. so we have do not cross police tape and the episode has hazmat suits and ... it's like she's disposing of a bomb, basically.\n\non how conservatism affected manzoor's self-esteem growing up\n\nnadia manzoor: i think it made me much more self-conscious of my body, frankly. walking down the street i was always very aware of the male gaze or people looking at me, and always trying to cover that. as a result, i think it really affected my confidence. i think it put me in situations where i made bad choices, kind of not trusting men in a way that made me more susceptible and vulnerable to situations that didn't turn out so well.\n\ni had an eating disorder when i was about 24, extremely skinny, and always kind of saw the forefront of my existence being through how other people evaluated my body. i think that's typical of women in general, of how beauty is supposed to be the no. 1 standard of how we're measured. because i think that was just reinforced in my home context and in my cultural context. ...\n\nwhen i was 6 or 7 my dad would take my french fries and say, [nadia], you are getting too fat, and he would give them to my brother, you know? there was always this emphasis of having to sacrifice and giving it to the man. that was just so clear-cut in my family.\n\non how nadia was treated compared to her twin brother\n\nmanzoor: my brother's academic pursuits were really encouraged and he knew all of the capitals of the world and he was in every single sports team. ... the lessons that i was getting was on not getting fat and my academic pursuits, they just weren't really encouraged. it was like, if you're good at something, it's fine, but it wasn't something that was considered that she's going to be a leader. my brother was going to be the leader and take over the world, and i just had to remain beautiful.\n\nyeah, it did piss me off, and i think i internalized a lot of that because i didn't have the articulation and the confidence, frankly, to kind of rebel with my parents against that, but i think in my own way i did, because i continue to follow the things that inspired and attracted me, and i didn't fall down the path of just blindly getting married when i was 20.\n\non the conflict between being herself and pleasing her family\n\nmanzoor: because of how i grew up, i was a total pathological liar. i lied to my family all the time about my friends and the fact that i was in a relationship, and there are lots of things that i hid to my western friends about things i was embarrassed about, about my culture. ...\n\nthere were these really extreme ideologies that i was trying to reconcile with, and there didn't seem to be a balance that i was able to adopt. ... there weren't role models that had adopted this east/west ideologies into one, and i was constantly being told that the western world was a sinful world ... but obviously i was a westerner.\n\nso i had so much conflict within myself and something that i wasn't able to balance. it definitely led me to being very conflicted and it was only when my mother passed away and i left my family and i came to america that i was able to unpack all of these conflicts and all of this confusion about who i was and begin to find my own path and my own sense of where my morality came from. but that took a really long time.\n\non white wedding veils and the importance of virginity\n\nvaz: i always say a love marriage is when you marry the first man who you had sex with, and an arranged marriage is when you marry the first person your parents want you to have sex with. but first-time sex is a major part of the deal. i never liked that, because there is something oppressive about it.\n\nmanzoor: there is. it's this expectation that a woman is supposed to be pure, untouched, so that she's worthy of a man. that being why a woman is worthy, to me, it just diminishes us as human beings. so whether it's being covered in a veil or whether it's wearing a white dress because you're saying my virginity is the most important thing about me, that's oppressive, just inherently.\n\non vaz's returning to india to do stand-up\n\nmanzoor: what she's doing in india is really ... revolutionary. it has not happened before. ... being an indian woman on a stage talking about her vagina in a comedic way and bringing attention to real important issues is completely revolutionary, so it just has the power to spark change in such a powerful way.
it's a beautiful 50th birthday for 'mister rogers' neighborhood'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption gene j. puskar/ap gene j. puskar/ap\n\nfifty years ago monday, when fred rogers showed up on national public television as the host of what then was a brand new children's show called mister rogers' neighborhood, tv was a lot different. pbs wasn't even a network then — not by that name, anyway — and aside from cbs, nbc and abc, there were only a few independent local channels to watch, if that.\n\nfred rogers: the fresh air interview terry gross and fred rogers listen\n\nbut 50 years ago, young kids were pretty much the same. i interviewed fred rogers a few times over the years, and one time i asked him about the secret of his success — why his slow, deliberate manner of relating to children, and why seeming to look at them and talk to them directly through the tv lens, connected so strongly with young viewers. this is what he told me:\n\nevery one of us longs to be in touch with honesty. ... i think we're really attracted to people who will share some of their real self with us.\n\nrogers shared his real self with us from that very first day of mister rogers' neighborhood, on feb. 19, 1968, when he went national on public tv, removed his jacket and dress shoes, slipped on a sweater and sneakers and talked gently about tying shoelaces.\n\nmister rogers' neighborhood was all about encouragement and support. it loved to educate kids a little, inspire them a lot and, when necessary, calm them down a bit about what may be unspoken fears.\n\nmister rogers' neighborhood was all about encouragement and support. it loved to educate kids a little, inspire them a lot and, when necessary, calm them down a bit about what may be unspoken fears.\n\nthat first week of mister rogers was about change — even in the neighborhood of make believe, where a puppet ruler named king friday xiii was upset that his subjects were moving their homes around his kingdom. in this week-long story, king friday becomes so upset that he orders a big wall to be built around the castle to keep everyone out. but eventually, the ruler decides he had nothing to fear and takes down the wall.\n\nthat was a reassuring story then, and fred rogers had hundreds of others. he could calm little kids by telling them they were too big to slip down the bathtub drain, but he also tackled more serious subjects.\n\nin the summer of 1968, he took to prime time and had one of his most beloved hand puppet characters, daniel striped tiger, asking for a definition of the word assassination. robert f. kennedy had just been shot and killed — and rogers thought even very little children would pick up on how upset the grown-ups around them were, and deserved to be talked to and reassured a little.\n\nyoutube\n\nand at a time when, once again, politicians are talking about defunding public television, it should be noted that rogers went to washington to testify before congress in 1969 about why public tv was so important to young viewers — and to beg for $20 million in public funding.\n\nrogers appeared before gruff committee chair sen. john pastore. he described his show, sang a song and recited some poetry — and when he finished, the senator told him he'd earned the $20 million.\n\nfifty years later, the work and legacy of fred rogers has not been forgotten. the fred rogers center, where i currently serve on the advisory board, aims to seek out and support new approaches to education and entertainment in the rogers spirit.\n\nthe tv company that bears his name continues to produce programs, including the animated daniel tiger's neighborhood. you can still get boxed dvd sets of some of the mister rogers shows and specials, which ran on pbs until 2001, two years before his death.\n\nand in this golden anniversary year of mister rogers' neighborhood, there are many other plans afoot. monday in his hometown, latrobe, pa., st. vincent college is scheduled to host a screening of the very first neighborhood episode. the pbs kids network plans to pair other vintage episodes of mister rogers' neighborhood with their cartoon daniel tiger equivalents. pbs will also present a retrospective special salute in march, and a new documentary, morgan neville's won't you be my neighbor?, is scheduled to be released in theaters nationwide in june.\n\nthere's a new biography due in september, the u.s. postal service is issuing a fred rogers stamp and it's just been announced that there's a movie in the works, with tom hanks set to play rogers. that's kind of perfect: one of the most-loved children's hosts in tv history played by one of the most-loved actors in movie history.\n\nit's a lot of fuss, especially for a man who didn't like to draw attention to himself. but rogers deserves it. and today, our children's children still deserve — and need — fred rogers.\n\nclick the audio link above to hear terry gross' 1984 interview with rogers.
infectious diseases expert: no evidence new coronavirus variant is any deadlier\n\nmichel martin, host:\n\nas officials try to improve vaccine distribution, a new strain of coronavirus has shown up in at least two states this week. scientists say that while the variant does not appear to be more dangerous, it does seem to be more contagious. and, of course, all this is happening as hospitals across the country operate at or near capacity and brace for what might be another post-holiday surge.\n\nwe wanted to know more about how this virus is mutating and how we should think about it, so we've called matt mccarthy. he is a physician, an authority on infectious disease and professor of medicine at cornell university. and he's the author of superbugs: the race to stop an epidemic.\n\ndr. mccarthy, it's nice to have you back with us on the program. thanks for joining us.\n\nmatt mccarthy: thanks for having me.\n\nmartin: before we jump into the specifics of this new strain, i just would like a refresher on how a virus mutates. i mean, how exactly does this happen? and how do we know that this virus has mutated?\n\nmccarthy: right. so coronavirus is an rna virus, and these types of viruses are prone to mutate because every time they replicate, there's a chance for a new introduction of something new into its genetic code. and we were expecting it to mutate. you know, this is not a surprise. it's just like influenza or measles or some other virus. these things all mutate, usually with what we call selective pressure.\n\nso if there is some reason for it to mutate, it will, such as the introduction of new drugs or vaccines or convalescent plasma. anything that attacks the virus will cause it to change.\n\nmartin: well, i was going to ask you about that. i mean, how should we think about the fact that there are - at least a couple of states have reported cases of this new strain? and so far as we know - because we know that people have had a hard time with contact tracing - but so far as we know, the individuals weren't traveling, didn't have contact with folks who were in places where we knew this new strain had developed. i mean, how should we think about that?\n\nis that concerning? or is this something that - to be expected in a pandemic of this size, where there's - this many people are infected?\n\nmccarthy: yeah, we've known about this variant since the summer, and we've been keeping track of it. and what caught our attention is that it started to become the dominant strain in certain parts of the united kingdom. and the expectation is that if it was in the united kingdom back in the summer, and people were flying to the united states, as they have been for a while, that it was certainly going to be here.\n\nnow, what we know about it is that based on modeling, it looks to be more transmissible, and it looks to cause a bit of a higher viral load, meaning that when you cough this variant, you may be expelling more of the virus, which could be the way that it's more transmissible. now, there's no evidence it's more deadly, or that it's resistant to our vaccines, or that it's resistant to our treatments. but the fact that it could spread more quickly and that this is a potentially deadly virus is cause for concern. the fact that it could go through a community more quickly is enough to get all of us to pay very close attention to it.\n\nmartin: you were on this program to talk about your book on so-called superbugs. these are drug-resistant bacteria that are - you know, they're dangerous, difficult to treat. and in that interview, you talked about the relationship between the government and pharmaceutical companies, and you said there should be more cooperation in drug development so that medical professionals can better handle outbreaks.\n\nnow, that was in 2019. has this whole experience that we've all been living through changed your view on the relationship between big pharma and the government at all? is anything working the way you think it should be?\n\nmccarthy: yeah. so the short answer is that operation warp speed has been a tremendous success. and the reason it was successful is that the federal government removed risk from these companies from taking on a very risky project, which was a vaccine for a new virus, and taking on such an important problem - you know, the greatest pandemic of our lives.\n\nnow, what we need to do after this pandemic is behind us is we need to put renewed attention on the antibiotic crisis, the fact that these pharmaceutical companies don't want to make new antibiotics because it's very expensive, and it's very risky. we can use operation warp speed as a model to attack superbugs and to attack the fact that there are going to be drug-resistant pathogens that are going to be attacking us for the remainder of our lives and for generations to come.\n\noperation warp speed is a great example of how these companies can do a very difficult thing if we incentivize it and we remove the risk, and we give them the right publicity, frankly, to make this worth their while.\n\nmartin: and before we let you go, what should just people listening to our conversation be thinking about right now? i mean, you're based in new york, which has experienced this covid-19 surge this past spring. i mean, you were really on the front lines in more ways than one - right? - in seeing this whole thing unfold.\n\nbut, you know, a lot has changed since then, for better and for worse. i mean, on the one hand, the virus has spread all over the country. on the other hand, you know, more treatment options and a vaccine. so you've got this on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand situation. how do you encourage our listeners, just all of us as people, to think about the moment that we are in?\n\nmccarthy: for the people who are listening, you know, it's not going away anytime soon. we've got to stick to the things that we know that work - the social distancing and doing what we can to not put ourselves in harm's way.\n\nmartin: we just heard from dr. matt mccarthy, associate professor of medicine at cornell university and the author of superbugs: the race to stop an epidemic.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

kim jong un calls u.s. north korea's 'biggest enemy,' vows to advance nuclear arsenal\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption api/gamma-rapho via getty images api/gamma-rapho via getty images\n\nnorth korean leader kim jong un staked out a hardline position just days ahead of president-elect joe biden taking office, calling the united states his country's biggest enemy, and vowing to advance his country's nuclear arsenal.\n\nour external political activities must focus on controlling and subjugating the united states, our archenemy and the biggest stumbling block to the development of our revolution, kim said, according to the official korean central news agency (kcna).\n\nno matter who takes power in the united states, its true nature and its policy toward our country will never change, he added.\n\nkim made the remarks friday at the ruling workers party 8th congress in pyongyang. analysts have been parsing reports of the congress for signs of new policies, and this is the first indication of kim's position towards a new u.s. administration.\n\npresident-elect joe biden has promised principled diplomacy with north korea, implying a break with president donald trump's high-stakes summits with kim jong un. he has also indicated he will work more closely with u.s. allies south korea and japan.\n\nat the congress, kim called for the improvement of the country's nuclear arsenal to include solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles that can be launched from land and sea, and accurately hit targets at a range of up to 9,320 miles, putting the u.s. mainland in reach.\n\nhe also ordered the development of miniaturized nuclear weapons, tactical nukes, military surveillance satellites and hypersonic aircraft.\n\nkim reaffirmed that north korea would not use its nuclear arsenal in a preemptive strike.\n\nfollowing the collapse of his second summit with trump in vietnam in february 2019, kim appeared to give up hope of reaching a denuclearization deal with the u.s., and resolved to continue building up nuclear and conventional weapons while diplomacy remained stalemated.\n\nlast year, kim pledged to unveil a new strategic weapon, and in october, north korea revealed what appeared to be a new and upgraded intercontinental ballistic missile, bigger than one already thought to be capable of hitting the continental u.s.\n\nwhile kim has said he no longer feels bound by his self-imposed moratorium on testing strategic weapons, including nuclear devices and intercontinental ballistic missiles, pyongyang has not tested either since the last intercontinental ballistic missile launch in 2017. the tests triggered stringent u.n. sanctions.\n\nnorth korea did continue last year, though, to test shorter range ballistic missiles capable of hitting targets in south korea, including bases where the u.s. has some 28,500 troops. president trump appeared unperturbed by the tests, as they were not capable of hitting the u.s. mainland.\n\nkim began the party conference this week, the last since 2016, by bluntly admitting that his last five-year economic plan had ended in failure, due to both external factors — such as international sanctions and the coronavirus — but also due to internal reasons, such as government mismanagement of the economy.\n\nthe kcna report said the congress blamed officials for botching implementation of the party's economic plans and failing to actively introduce reality-friendly and people-friendly methods in the ruling party's work.\n\nthe report also touted kim's summitry with trump as a diplomatic achievement.\n\nover the past five years, it claimed, the ruling party's work effected a dramatic change in the balance of power between pyongyang and washington, demonstrating the dignity and prestige of our state.

russian parliament allows putin 2 more terms as president\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alexei nikolsky/ap alexei nikolsky/ap\n\nupdated at 6:25 a.m. et wednesday\n\nrussia's lower house of parliament on wednesday approved a constitutional amendment to allow president vladimir putin — already the country's longest-serving leader since josef stalin — to extend his rule until 2036.\n\nlawmakers in the state duma voted 383 to 0 in favor of the amendment, with 43 abstentions. putin said on tuesday that russia's constitutional court would have to rule on whether the move would contradict russian law. putin's critics have said approval by the court is all-but certain.\n\nthe constitutional amendment proposed by lawmaker and former cosmonaut valentina tereshkova — who gained fame in 1963 as the first woman in space — resets the current term limits, which limit russian presidents to two consecutive six-year terms. russians are scheduled to vote on the proposed amendment on april 22 in a nationwide constitutional referendum.\n\nputin spoke to lawmakers at the state duma on tuesday about what such a change would mean for the future of presidential power in russia.\n\nit's important, he said, for a president to ensure the country's evolutionary development. now, he said, is not the time to move too quickly to change how russian state power operates: we have had enough revolutions.\n\ni have no doubt that the day will come when the supreme, presidential power in russia will not be so personified, if i may say so, that it will not be connected to a certain individual, putin added. but this is exactly how it was in our previous history, and we must take this into account.\n\nputin told lawmakers on tuesday that he did not endorse completely eliminating presidential term limits, one element of the proposal by tereshkova. but he strongly backed the idea of resetting the number of terms for which he could run.\n\nin his appeal to parliament, putin also pointed to other countries that have no restrictions on presidential terms. even in the united states, he said, the two-term limit has only been in place since the 22nd amendment was ratified in 1951.\n\nthe great depression, economic uncertainty, unemployment and world war ii all called for persistent leadership in the u.s., putin said, referring to president franklin roosevelt's four terms. as russia is also undergoing upheaval and difficulty, stability may be more important and must be given priority, he said, especially when a country still has many problems.\n\nrussia watchers, who have long assumed putin would seek to retain power after his current term expires in 2024, were not surprised.\n\nthe russian system has been existing under this perpetual question mark of 'what is putin going to do?'  fiona hill, president trump's former top russia adviser, told npr's mary louise kelly.\n\nmany observers thought putin might take on a different role that would let him maintain influence – like iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei or kazakhstan's first president, nursultan nazarbayev, who now chairs the country's security council and holds the title leader of the nation. there was talk of having putin lead the country's state council, which would be strengthened, with the presidency becoming more of a symbolic position.\n\nultimately, the kremlin decided to simply change the presidential term limits so that putin could maintain control, loyola university chicago professor michael khodarkovsky told npr.\n\nthe kremlin is searching for ways to keep putin in power, khodarkovsky said. putin and his inner circle seem to have decided that the way to do it is to eliminate term limits and allow putin to run again. it would be inconceivable for putin to lose.\n\nthe 67-year-old putin has ruled russia for more than 20 years, serving as both president and prime minister. his current presidential term is set to expire in 2024; should he run again, putin would be 83 when the next term limit runs out in 2036. my own feeling, said khodarkovsky, is that putin wants to beat stalin, who ruled for almost 30 years.\n\nputin will stay in power and in his present position for life, said dmitri trenin, director of the carnegie moscow center. as for the future of russian democracy, we will need to wait till after putin passes from the stage.\n\nputin has become the wild card in his own system, hill said. if he goes, it seems destabilizing. and this seems like an effort to kind of put off the inevitable. he surely won't live forever.
health officials warn americans to plan for the spread of coronavirus in u.s.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mark lennihan/ap mark lennihan/ap\n\nupdated at 8:25 p.m. et\n\nfederal health officials issued a blunt message tuesday: americans need to start preparing now for the possibility that more aggressive, disruptive measures might be needed to stop the spread of the new coronavirus in the u.s.\n\nthe strongly worded warning came in response to outbreaks of the virus outside china, including in iran, japan, south korea and italy, which officials say have raised the likelihood of outbreaks occurring stateside.\n\nit's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but more really a question of when it will happen — and how many people in this country will have severe illness, dr. nancy messonnier of the centers for disease control and prevention told reporters during a briefing.\n\nwhile aggressive measures such as travel restrictions and the first federal quarantine in a half century have probably slowed the arrival of the coronavirus in the u.s., messonnier said even more intrusive steps will likely be needed.\n\nwe are asking the american public to work with us to prepare with the expectation that this could be bad, messonnier said.\n\ni had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning. and i told my children that while i didn't think that they were at risk right now, we, as a family, need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives, she said.\n\nthose measures could include school closings, workplace shutdowns and canceling large gatherings and public events, she warned.\n\ni understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe, but these are things that people need to start thinking about now, messonnier said.\n\nso americans need to do things like start making plans to care for their children should schools and day care centers close, she said. they should talk to their employers about how they could work from home. and they should find out whether there might be a way to get medical care remotely, such as through telemedicine, messonnier said.\n\nshe stressed that the current risk remains low. almost all the cases that have occurred in the united states have been among travelers who have been infected overseas. in addition, there's always the chance that the coronavirus could begin to subside as spring and summer arrive.\n\ninfectious disease experts say that 80% of infections are mild, no more severe than the common cold.\n\nso far, there have been 14 confirmed cases of the coronavirus illness covid-19 in the u.s. and 40 other cases among people from the diamond princess cruise who were repatriated to the u.s., according to the cdc. there also are three cases among people who were repatriated from hubei province in china, where the respiratory virus emerged months ago.\n\nhand-washing with soap and water continues to be a top recommendation to protect against the virus, since the abrasiveness of soap helps remove infectious particles from the hands. experts say that commonly worn surgical masks aren't very effective protection. a heavy-duty mask called an n95 respirator is considerably better protection, but it is uncomfortable to wear and can make breathing more difficult.\n\nthe cdc has advised against nonessential travel to china and south korea, countries that have seen the highest numbers of cases.\n\nbut because there are so many unknowns, state and local officials and average americans need to be prepared, messonnier said.\n\ni continue to hope that in the end, we'll look back and feel like we were overprepared. but that is a better place to be in than being underprepared, she said.\n\nu.s. health and human services secretary alex azar said in a media briefing tuesday that the immediate risk to the general american public remains low, but that could change quickly.\n\nhe pointed to the recent community transmission of the disease in countries outside asia, which he called deeply concerning.\n\non monday, the white house requested $1.25 billion in new funding from congress and authorization to move other money to get an expected $2.5 billion for emergency preparedness and response. azar said the money will go toward virus surveillance, state and local preparedness, the development of therapeutic treatments and vaccines, and the building of a stockpile of personal protective equipment such as masks.\n\ncdc principal deputy director dr. anne schuchat said that the precautions in the u.s. have been working, as evidenced by the low number of cases in the country so far.\n\nthis is the time to prepare for the event of community transmission in the u.s., she said. for most patients who develop covid-19, schuchat explained, appropriate care would mean home isolation, using health care facilities only as needed for the elderly and for those with severe cases or other medical conditions.\n\ncurrent global circumstances suggest it's likely that this virus will cause a pandemic, she said, in which case specific local strategies would be implemented to slow the spread.\n\nschuchat said authorities have long been preparing for such threats. she pointed to strategies such as hand-washing, social distancing and staying home when you're sick – the same recommendations from bad flu seasons or the h1n1 pandemic in 2009.\n\nthere is literally a playbook for the use of these tools – one that the states and local public health have exercised, she said.\n\nboth azar and schuchat used the phrase radical transparency to describe their approach to the outbreak, and promised frequent media briefings.\n\nwe have said from day one we can't hermetically seal off the united states. we've always said we expect to see more cases, azar said.\n\npeople shouldn't panic when they see new cases. they should know their government predicted we would have them, and we have plans in place, he added.\n\nin a statement late tuesday, the white house said it had met with health officials from more than 30 states and territories to thank them for their leadership in responding to coronavirus.\n\nthe discussion focused on the importance of the public health partnership at various levels of government and underscored the importance [of] community preparedness, white house spokesman hogan gidley said.
new zealanders begin voting on whether to swap out their flag\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption fiona goodall/getty images news fiona goodall/getty images news\n\nfor decades, the people of new zealand have argued over their flag.\n\nit's too similar to australia's flag, and it's embarrassing when they're confused; it would be expensive to change it. it's too colonial; it's a part of kiwi history. it doesn't honor any of the maori heritage of new zealand; generations of new zealanders fought and died for that symbol.\n\nin early 2014, new zealand prime minister john key proposed a democratic solution to the debate: a series of referendums.\n\nresidents of new zealand proposed 10,292 alternative flag designs as of mid-2015. a panel then narrowed it down to a handful of choices, and the nation picked its favorite.\n\nnow, in three weeks of voting that began thursday, the people of new zealand will decide whether they want to adopt the winning alternative — or stick with the flag they've flown for more than a century.\n\non one half of the ballot is the current flag: the u.k.'s union jack paired with a representation of the southern cross. the layout of the flag is nearly identical to the australian flag, a key point in the debate.\n\nnew zealand government\n\non the other half, there's a new design by kyle lockwood, featuring new zealand's silver fern, a black corner and the same southern cross the flag has now. both the fern symbol and the color black are widely associated with new zealand, thanks to the all blacks rugby team.\n\nnew zealand government\n\nvoting will continue until march 24.\n\nopinion polls suggest the original flag will triumph, according to sky news.\n\nthat's sad news for one native new zealander — josh parsons, a professor at oxford who gave letter grades to all the world's flags more than 15 years ago and inspired hate mail from an astonishing number of enthusiastic flag fans.\n\ni'm no expert on flags, just an opinionated guy with a dubious sense of humour, parsons wrote last year, when he announced his support for the red peak flag design. (you can see it in the slideshow below.) now that the red peak has been knocked out of the running, he tells npr that he's behind the silver fern.\n\nthe original new zealand flag got a c (55/100) in parsons' original rankings, losing points for colonial nonsense.\n\nthe new flag? parsons says it's an a-, with points deducted for looking like a corporate logo.\n\ncurious about what other flags were considered? these four flags made it to the short list, but were knocked out in the first referendum:\n\nthe long list included many more options:\n\nand of course, the more than 10,000 submissions included a wide variety of designs, including bold geographic patterns and hand-drawn proposals.\n\ntoggle caption new zealand government\n\ntoggle caption new zealand government\n\nseveral off-the-wall options really resonated with the internet.\n\nhere at the two-way, our favorite was fire the lazar!

'the consent decree will make us better,' federal oversight of chicago police begins\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption paul beaty/ap paul beaty/ap\n\nfor many in latino and black neighborhoods, trust in the chicago police department simply doesn't exist. years of policies detailed in a blistering department of justice report explains why.\n\nmany hope the formal events on friday, mar. 1, will help restore, or in some cases establish, a sense of trust in communities that have long felt neglected or abused.\n\nchicago police are now under federal oversight as the department officially begins its overhaul. a federal judge and independent monitor, named today, will oversee the changes to make sure they comply with agreed-to guidelines.\n\npolice superintendent eddie johnson said he welcomes the changes.\n\nwe say bring it on and let's get down to business.\n\nwe've known about this consent decree for the last 2 years, so we're prepared mentally to have to deal with it, johnson said. matter of fact, the consent decree will make us better. we say bring it on and let's get down to business.\n\nnearly four years ago, the city was embroiled in controversy over a police video. that video, withheld from the public for more than a year, was released and shows a white police officer fatally shooting 17-year-old laquan mcdonald, who is black. mcdonald, a knife in his hand, appeared to be walking away from police.\n\nthe 2014 shooting and handling of the case became a rallying cry for activists. it also led to the trial and conviction of jason van dyke, the officer who shot mcdonald.\n\nbetween the shooting and the department of justice report, the department knew change would come. the withering doj report — issued in january of 2017 — called the chicago police department's use of force excessive and racially discriminatory. soon afterward, chicago police issued a new use-of-force policy emphasizing the sanctity of life, and started holding training sessions for officers.\n\nunder the consent decree, there are many more changes in store. for example, the department must produce a monthly report about use of force incidents; it bans police from using tasers on people who are simply running away. the agreement also expands mental health services for police, including a initiative for suicide prevention — a big concern recently after a rash of police suicides.\n\non a day when we marked a 44 percent decrease in homicides and a 24 percent reduction in shootings, today's data and today's agreement capture the new direction of the chicago police department, mayor rahm emanuel said in a statement. this agreement, which is the result of the changes we sought and agreed to, will ensure a better city, a better cpd, and safer streets.\n\nfederal oversight in st. louis, seattle\n\nchicago is among 14 other law enforcement agencies in the country under federal oversight. among them, the police department in ferguson, mo. a fatal police shooting there sparked nationwide protests and helped spur the black lives matter movement.\n\nactivist felicia pulliam says progress in st. louis under the consent decree is mixed.\n\nyou know, i'm going to have to say, that i've seen some incidents of improvement, pulliam said. there's a lot of resistance to a new practice of policing, a new way of policing the community from some police officers.\n\nit's a different story for seattle, says mayor jenny durkan. after six and a half years of oversight, a federal judge said, in january, that seattle's police department was in compliance.\n\nwe still have a disproportionate amount of force being used against people of color that we feel we need to look at more carefully, but there has been a sea and cultural change, durkan said.\n\nrichard o'neil, with seattle's police union, remains critical of the decree and says it has damaged morale.\n\nwell, it was very frustrating from the beginning, he said. the incentive to get out and be a proactive officer i think has been damaged and, something the city can't deny anymore, that we have [taken] a real hit in recruiting, retaining officers.\n\nthere are very specific ways that police in chicago abuse their power.\n\nrecruitment is a problem nationwide, even in departments without decrees. but the feelings of mistrust is something chicago will have to deal with. chicago officials and community activists say they've studied the consent decrees in other cities.\n\nsheila bedi is an attorney with the macarthur justice center. she represented activists and community groups in a successful fight to allow them to have a direct say in overseeing the court ordered reforms. she says that's different from other consent decrees: there are very specific ways that police in chicago abuse their power, bedi said, and it was critical that this consent decree couldn't just be imported from seattle, for example. that it really addressed the particular harm that chicago communities face.\n\n\n\nthe federal judge overseeing chicago's police reform plan, robert dow jr., says it's an important step in the city's ongoing effort to repair the damaged relationship between police and residents. dow appointed a team of monitors on friay who will ensure the department meets certain benchmarks.\n\nhe says the overall effort is no magic wand, but it is a beginning.

companies in the last few years, prices of phone plans have definitely fallen, along with plans being offered without contracts.\n\nwhen we talk about phone companies most of us automatically think of the big four here in the u.s.: at&t, sprint, t-mobile, and verizon. but they're not the only choices when it comes to who you get your service from and the popularity of alternative carriers (mvnos) is on the rise.\n\nthere are a lot of good deals with mvnos that fit all kinds of needs, whether you need unlimited data plan or just a little for a spare phone. but they allow you to get many of the same perks as the big four, often at a lower price and without a contract.\n\ncompare the mvnos cell phone plans listed below with any mainstream, big four plans and you'll see that these offer much

sanders offers biden a path to win over his movement\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mary altaffer/ap mary altaffer/ap\n\nbernie sanders is staying in the race for president, but he made it obvious on wednesday that he sees joe biden's clear path to the nomination.\n\nwhile our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability, sanders said. the recent underdog added that he disagrees that biden is the stronger candidate to take on president trump, but that is what millions of democrats and independents today believe.\n\nto date, the former vice president has won 15 states, while the vermont senator has won or led the popular vote in eight. biden currently has a delegate lead of around 150, with a favorable map of states ahead.\n\nsanders has acknowledged that the movement he promised to deliver him the nomination is not showing up in big enough numbers. but he's warning democrats not to write off the strongest parts of his coalition — young voters and latinos, particularly emphasizing the former on wednesday: we are winning the generational debate.\n\ntoday, i say to the democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country, sanders said. and you must speak to the issues of concern to them.\n\nsanders promised to show up at the debate on sunday in arizona to face biden one-on-one, and basically offered him a cheat sheet: let me be very frank as to the questions that i will be asking joe.\n\nsanders listed off issues central to his campaign, which he says are very important to younger progressives: health care costs, climate change, income inequality, student debt, racial disparities in criminal justice, immigration and housing affordability.\n\nso why tip biden off to how you're going to challenge him on sunday? maybe bernie sanders wants joe biden to succeed.\n\nsanders continues to say that he likes biden and that defeating trump is the most important thing this year. sanders has pledged unequivocally to support his opponent if he himself loses the nomination, something he has done more vigorously and more often than he did in 2016. despite disparaging the party, and though some of his supporters often get into vitriolic arguments, particularly online, sanders is clear that he does not want to hand the election to republicans.\n\ngiven the strong numbers biden put up with african american voters and white, non-college men in michigan — much stronger than hillary clinton four years ago — he would perhaps not need sanders' movement to overcome the small margins trump won by in the midwest.\n\nbut biden opened the door in his own speech on tuesday night.\n\ni want to thank bernie sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. we share a common goal, biden said. and together, we'll defeat donald trump. he then reiterated, we'll defeat him together.\n\nand on wednesday, it seemed as though sanders was at least in part responding to that call, essentially laying down for biden a challenge and a road map to secure his support and extend a winning coalition to the left.\n\nsome of what sanders dared biden on wasn't too challenging. he asked biden, are you really going to veto a 'medicare for all' bill, if it is passed in congress?\n\nthe qualifier is an easy out for biden. if sanders' single-payer, medicare for all system passed congress, that would mean the political winds had shifted dramatically — that at least some republicans and moderate democrats who opposed that plan came on board, because their constituents were also on board. that's an unlikely reality in 2021 if biden were the new president.\n\nbut on the other issues, sanders is asking biden to show at the debate on sunday that he simply gets the message. and it was telling that sanders was offering this detailed warning to the democratic establishment for the future, beyond 2020.\n\nthe vermont senator — who remains a registered independent, and who is often accused of wanting to burn the democratic party down — was instead offering advice. sanders seemed to indicate that as he sees the presidential nomination slipping away, he wants the party to thrive by addressing the issues he cares about the most.\n\nsanders is not conceding. he'll be at the next debate and in the next contests. his allies say a good debate and a biden gaffe could turn the tide, and biden doesn't yet have even half the delegates he needs to secure the democratic nomination.\n\nbut given the big losses this week, the question for sanders had been: what is he going to do? now he may have put the ball back in biden's court: if he's running away with the nomination, what is the front-runner going to do if he wants to bring sanders along and unify the party more quickly?

et\n\ndetermined to not let the momentum die, protesters once again converged on hundreds of cities — at home and abroad — for the second annual women's march, seeking not only to unite in a call for social change but also to channel their fury into voter action.\n\nnationwide, demonstrations from new york to washington, d.c., to oklahoma city to los angeles were planned on the first anniversary of president trump's inauguration and throughout the weekend. overseas, protesters rallied or were planning to do so in france, germany, greece, iraq, nigeria and ghana.\n\nnpr's leila fadel reports that organizers are trying to avoid potential pitfalls from last year, when hundreds of thousands of people descended on washington, d.c., in one of the largest demonstrations in u.s. history.\n\none of the big criticisms was the march in d.c. was mostly white, liberal women, leila says. this year, organizers say they are reaching out to local partners after a year of grass-roots work to try to access a cross section of america, from minorities to the disenfranchised to women in low-income communities.\n\none thing that hasn't changed, organizers say, is the anger that was on display last year.\n\npeople were pretty damn mad last year, and they're pretty damn mad this year, tamika mallory, co-president of the women's march board, told the associated press.\n\ntrump acknowledged the marches saturday afternoon but said they should be in celebration of the accomplishments of his presidency.\n\nbeautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all women to march. get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months, he tweeted. lowest female unemployment in 18

county, n.y. told npr's windsor johnston at the rally in washington, d.c. i want a role model in office.\n\nmany marchers on saturday broke out their pink pussyhats from last year. it was a reference to trump's lewd remarks that emerged shortly before the presidential election when he bragged about grabbing women's genitals in a 2005 access hollywood recording.\n\nthis year, the marches come in the midst of the #metoo movement, a worldwide reckoning on sexual assault and harassment.\n\nin rome, several hundred women gathered downtown and listened to asia argento. the italian actress, one of producer harvey weinstein's first accusers, said the hollywood producer engaged in transgressions ranging from harassment to rape.\n\ni'd like to see how many of you today acknowledge that you have put up with abuse, by raising your hands. and not just sexual. abuse of power. because we are women, because we don't have power, argento said, reports the new york times. numerous people in the crowd raised their hands.\n\nin washington, d.c., marcher debbie droke expressed her amazement that these issues continue to pervade.\n\ni'm old, droke, 63, of vienna, va., told npr. i was doing this in the '70s. i was walking with gloria steinem. and i never thought in a million years that i'd have to be doing this again to bring focus to women's rights.\n\nin new york city, bridie bugeja, from northport, n.y., told npr's hansi lo wang that she put her concerns about sexual harassment onto a sign in the form of a poem, inspired by the dr. seuss stories she read to her kids.\n\ni don't like you in my shirt\n\ni don't like you up my skirt\n\ni don't like you near my rump\n\nreplace republicans and donald trump\n\nrallies are slated to continue in several cities on sunday, including in las vegas, where the event power to the polls launches a national voter registration tour.\n\nmeanwhile, hillary clinton encouraged women to bring the same might on display at the marches to the voting booth. in 2017, the women's march was a beacon of hope and defiance, she tweeted on saturday. in 2018, it is a testament to the power and resilience of women everywhere. let's show that same power in the voting booth this year. # powertothepolls.\n\nin choosing the location for the marquee event, organizers were looking not only to honor the site of the deadliest mass shooting in modern american history, but also to strategically highlight nevada, a key battleground state in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nnpr's emma bowman contributed to this story.

house briefing whether campaigns should cancel big events, anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said the answer depended on the prevalence of the coronavirus in the community.\n\nif you're talking about a campaign rally tomorrow, in a place where there is no community spread, i think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment, fauci said. if you want to talk about large gatherings in a place where you have community spread, i think that's a judgment call. and if someone decides they want to cancel it, i wouldn't publicly criticize them.\n\nohio reported its first confirmed coronavirus cases a day before sanders and biden cancelled their campaign events.\n\non monday, rep. jackie speier, d-calif., said all presidential campaigns should call off large events until the coronavirus threat subsides and lead by example!\n\neven before the election night rallies were cancelled, the major presidential campaigns were changing some practices in response to the coronavirus.\n\nat a biden event in michigan, npr observed that campaign staff were squirting hand sanitizer on the hands of everyone entering the rally.\n\nbiden told nbc news on monday that he was changing his behavior. if you notice in here, we did a fist bump, we didn't shake hands, he said.\n\npresident trump said the virus wasn't changing any of his campaign plans.\n\nwe'll hold tremendous rallies, trump said over the weekend. i'm not concerned at all about the risk of coronavirus being transmitted at the events, he added.\n\nbut until now, trump has held election eve rallies to grab attention away from democrats in the days immediately before a primary. this week, his campaign didn't schedule a rally before tuesday's elections.\n\ntrump's campaign also doesn't have a rally scheduled before next week's primaries when four big states cast ballots, including three — arizona, florida and ohio — that are central to his reelection.\n\nover the weekend, trump campaign spokesman tim murtaugh said, we do more than just rallies. and we announce new events when they are ready to be announced.\n\nthe democratic national committee says it does not currently plan to cancel next weekend's presidential debate between sanders and biden.\n\nwe are in touch with local officials and will follow their guidance, dnc spokeswoman xochitl hinojosa told the arizona republic. there are no plans to cancel the debate.\n\npolling places\n\nin michigan, which votes tuesday, the secretary of state's office is emphasizing to voters that there are no known cases of the disease in the state and is sharing health recommendations with local officials who run the state's 5,000 precincts.\n\nwe're really just working with them to make sure that they have the cdc recommendations, that they know that they can maintain hygiene in their polling places while also still encouraging people to vote and without spreading fear before it's due, said jake rollow, the office's communications director.\n\nhis office told local precincts to regularly clean voting machines, pencils and other high-touch surfaces with alcohol and disinfectant wipes to ensure the risk of virus transmission is low while also reassuring voters. the state is also encouraging voters to increase social distances while standing in line and casting ballots.\n\nlast week, arizona secretary of state katie hobbs recommended that voters request absentee ballots for next week's primary there.\n\nin washington state, which votes tuesday, officials recommend that anyone casting an absentee ballot seal their envelopes using a wet sponge rather than licking the envelopes. other states have offered similar guidance about absentee ballots.\n\none concern for election officials is that poll workers will either get sick or won't show up for fear of possible exposure. during last week's super tuesday elections, some election workers didn't show up in travis county, texas, citing fears of the outbreak. those no-shows led to some disruptions and delays in opening polling sites.\n\nmichigan said election workers should give at least three days' notice if they can't serve but also told local officials that unexpected cancellations by poll workers were likely.\n\nohio secretary of state frank larose announced tuesday that he's directed the state's 88 counties to relocate any voting sites that had been planned to be in senior living facilities for the state's primary march 17. the decision affects more than 125 locations, and officials say they're trying to identify new sites quickly so they can inform poll workers and voters of the change as soon as possible.\n\nlarose also encouraged the state's voters to cast their ballots early or by mail. he said county election offices will have curbside drop-off points available so voters can return their absentee ballots without getting out of their cars.\n\nthe state is also encouraging more residents to serve as poll workers because of concerns that some might not to show up. larose said state agencies will be sending e-mails to their employees suggesting that they consider taking the day off to serve. he insisted that it was still safe to work at the polls, where disinfectants will be used and other precautions will be taken.\n\nbut larose urged any poll workers having second thoughts to let their local election offices know as soon as possible. the reality is that we expect that some may choose not to work on election day, he said.\n\nnpr's scott detrow, tamara keith and monika evstatieva

'steamrolled us in every direction': the year grief hit from all sides\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption charlie litchfield for npr charlie litchfield for npr\n\na lot of us went into 2020 with the best intentions: to be more present, to read more, to stay healthy.\n\nthe universe, however, had other plans.\n\nwe won't tick through all that went wrong in 2020. but needless to say, the coronavirus single-handedly shaped pretty much everything — from the way we go about our daily routines and see loved ones to how we celebrate milestones and grieve losses.\n\nlike any other year, there was plenty to celebrate in 2020. people graduated from high school and college, got married and had babies. we all found ways to mark those special moments — weddings and baby showers over zoom, drive-by graduation parties and distanced pot luck thanksgivings. neighborhoods even found a way to do socially distanced trick-or-treating.\n\nthere's also been collective sorrow. more than 1.8 million people have died of covid-19 worldwide — 342,000 in the u.s. alone. and people have been losing jobs, with the weekly unemployment claims staying at high levels and nearly 20 million ongoing claims for various forms of assistance.\n\nhealth navigating losses: going through grief separate from the pandemic navigating losses: going through grief separate from the pandemic listen · 6:58

my second grader lying in bed at night weeping that he doesn't get to go to school, doesn't get to make a friend, that he's lonely. it's all of these things that feel so personal, but those are the things that make this global. those are the things that connect us.\n\nshe says the loneliness of grief is universal, but this year is especially hard for people: [it's] compounded by their inability to have somebody sit on the couch and hold their hand.\n\nmcinerny started her podcast, which deals with grief and how to cope, after she endured her own unimaginable losses: she had a miscarriage and lost her father and husband to cancer all within several weeks in 2014. she says she hasn't set her hopes too high for 2021, and that's alright, because 2020 taught her a very important lesson. it has taught me the joy of being ok. a good day is not a 10. a good day is a 5. a 10 is exceptional, she says.\n\nhere, how four people have been grieving their own unique losses amid the collective grief

he says, such as making him more mindful of others' grief. mclemore's own parents were diagnosed with covid19 in the spring and have since recovered.\n\nso how does he separate his grief from that which the broader society is going through?\n\nin some ways i think it's been a little easier to adapt to being here just because no one seems to be on even keel right now. i feel like we're all kind

now.\n\nas for 2021, he's cautiously optimistic things will improve. he plans to continue to do creative things, like listening to and contributing to nick cave's youtube channel. he's been connecting with cave's thematic focus on grief, which the australian musician has been experiencing after the loss of his teenage son in 2015.\n\nmaybe things will kind of start to, i guess, thaw, so to speak,

how to see if home prices are rising or falling where you live\n\nharvard joint center for housing studies\n\ninteractive map: see how real home prices have changed since 2000, according to an analysis by the harvard joint center for housing studies.\n\nhome prices have finally clawed their way back to the peak of the housing bubble. that's on average nationally. the story is very different when you zoom in on different counties or cities in particular.\n\nit's also a different picture if you adjust for inflation. a new tabulation of home price data by harvard university's joint center for housing studies lets you do just that. you can zoom in on an interactive map to see what prices are doing in various parts of the country.\n\nsan francisco, nashville and pittsburgh are among the 15 percent of housing markets around the country where prices have actually risen above their prior peaks in the mid-2000s after adjusting for inflation. less fortunate are cleveland, phoenix and much of florida, where prices are still at least 26 percent below where they were before the bubble burst.\n\nbusiness why isn't the housing market booming the way experts expected? why isn't the housing market booming the way experts expected? listen · 3:58 3:58\n\nin terms of how the overall housing market has been doing lately, it's recovering but not yet recovered, says william wheaton, a housing economist at mit.\n\nthere's a lot of discussion right now about how sales should be more robust and they're not, given where we are in this stage of the economic recovery, he says. americans are buying the same number of homes they were 18 years ago. and wheaton says the population has grown since, so sales should be stronger.\n\nloading...\n\nthere are many factors at play, he says. young people are taking longer to settle down, get married and buy their first house. but also, a large part of the activity in the housing market is what we think of as 'churn,' ... people who are buying one house and selling another, he says. churn is down quite a lot.\n\nhousing economists say part of that is likely due to the fact that prices are just now on average returning to their pre-crash peaks (in nominal, or non-inflation-adjusted, terms). that means that in many parts of the country people don't have any or much equity in their house if they bought during the bubble or used up their equity with a home equity loan back then.\n\nwheaton says this is a big part of why he doesn't consider the market as recovered yet. he says not enough homeowners are sitting on top of little nest eggs of equity and can say, 'oh, you know, now we can go buy the house down the street we always wanted.' \n\non a brighter note, at least some of the decline in people buying and selling houses might be due to something else. americans are moving around the country a lot less than they used to. in fact, 25 years ago, americans were more than twice as likely to pick up and move from one state to another.\n\nit's a huge difference in how people are moving around the country today than they did a generation ago, says greg kaplan, an economist at the university of chicago.\n\nkaplan has done research that suggests a central reason for this change is that people don't have to move as often to find a good job that matches their skills.\n\nit used to be the case that if computer science was your thing and you wanted to be a software engineer, the best place for you to reap a return on those skills was to go to silicon valley, he says. now, that's probably still true today; it's just less true than it used to be.\n\nso, kaplan says, if you want to live in kansas city or phoenix, maybe to stay close to friends and family, there's a more diverse range of job opportunities in more parts of the country. kaplan calls this the decline in geographic specificity of occupations. that's a mouthful but, he says, it basically means you can do everything everywhere. or maybe not everything, but at least today people have more options.\n\nthere's another factor at work in the market right now: realtors say a tight supply of homes is a problem in a lot of places. that's also related to the low churn rate that wheaton talks about — fewer people selling their houses to buy other houses.\n\nput all this together, and probably the biggest reason the housing market isn't back to normal is that we still haven't quite gotten over the hangover from the worst housing crash since the great depression.
coronavirus: italy imposes quarantine on 16 million; u.s. sees 1st east coast deaths\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption miguel medina/afp via getty images miguel medina/afp via getty

control the coronavirus outbreak there.\n\nthe measure affects the entire lombardy region, along with its capital, milan, as well as the city of venice. the area includes about a quarter of italy's population.\n\nthe italian civil protection department reported a total of 5,883 covid-19 cases as of saturday evening, with 233 deaths from the illness.\n\nitaly's action followed another day of increasing cases of the coronavirus in the united states.\n\nto this point, the west coast has borne the brunt of coronavirus in the u.s., with the bulk of confirmed cases so far reported in california and washington state. but that's likely to change soon, with reports of cases now in florida, new york and the washington, d.c., area.\n\non friday, health authorities in florida said two covid-19 patients in the state had died in what are believed to be the first deaths linked to the disease on the east coast. one of the patients lived in the district of rep. matt gaetz, who drew criticism from colleagues last week for making light of the coronavirus when he wore a massive gas mask to a house floor vote on measures to combat the epidemic.\n\nour prayers are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time, the republican congressman tweeted late friday, adding: i'm confident our community will continue to remain vigilant in combating this disease and pray there will be no further contractions of the virus in northwest florida.\n\nthe state has confirmed more than a dozen cases so far — the largest cluster on the east coast outside of new york, which has reported several dozen cases of its own. new york gov. andrew cuomo declared a state of emergency saturday, after officials learned of new cases in new york city and westchester county.\n\nwe are aggressively testing, following up leads, because we want to find as many people who test positive so we can get them out of circulation, cuomo said at a media briefing midday saturday.\n\nenlarge

with no history of international travel, mayor muriel bowser said saturday evening. the city also said it was looking into the case of one person who spent time in d.c. and tested positive later in maryland. that came roughly an hour after the defense department confirmed that a u.s. marine at fort belvoir, just outside washington in northern virginia, tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from overseas.\n\noff the coast of california, thousands of passengers were confined to the grand princess cruise ship near san francisco after 21 people aboard tested positive for the virus. on saturday, vice president pence said the government was tracking an additional cruise ship that may have shared crew members with the grand princess or the diamond princess, another ship that faced quarantine in japan in february after passengers tested positive.\n\nall told, the number of confirmed cases in the u.s. is well over 300 — 19 of whom have died, mostly in washington state. at least 14 people who died were associated with one nursing home near seattle, according to the public health department of seattle and king county. health authorities in washington say they have confirmed 102 cases of the coronavirus in the state.\n\nas of late saturday afternoon, the total tally of confirmed cases worldwide stood at more than 105,000, some 3,500 of whom have died from the disease.\n\nthe vast majority of those cases have been reported in hubei province in mainland china, the outbreak's epicenter, but the number of new cases there has been declining lately — while the virus has taken root in south korea, iran and italy and has reached dozens of countries.\n\nback in the u.s., schools and companies have announced a spate of measures to mitigate spread of the virus. stanford university in california, as well as the university of washington and seattle university, which boast tens of thousands of students among them, said friday that they are canceling in-person classes through the end of their respective quarters later this month.\n\nand amtrak, on the east coast, said that because it is experiencing some reduced demand, it plans to halt its nonstop acela train service between new york and washington, d.c., beginning tuesday and continuing through late may.\n\ntexas has reported just a half-dozen confirmed cases, none of which has been found in austin — but that fact did not dissuade the city's mayor, steve adler, from preemptively canceling south by southwest, the city's signature music, film and technology event.\n\nwe have no reported cases in austin, but certainly the longer we can stay that way, the better off we are. it's inevitable that it's coming here as to all other cities, but delay is better, adler told npr's weekend edition on saturday.\n\nthe event drew more than 400,000 visitors to the city last year. adler acknowledged that its cancellation this year, just a week before its scheduled opening, is very tough and truly heartbreaking for the performers and vendors who had been depending on the business that the event customarily brings.\n\nwe're going to have to mitigate that as best we can as a community, be as resilient as we can, he said. we just ultimately didn't have a choice, because the focus needed to be on doing what was necessary to best keep the city safe.\n\neyes are also trained on another signature event expected later this month: march madness. so far, the ncaa has made no major changes to the massively popular (and lucrative) men's basketball tournament, which begins in earnest march 19.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption terrance williams/ap terrance williams/ap\n\ni don't think anything is off the table at this point, espn's michele steele told npr on saturday. the ncaa says they're just monitoring the situation and that there's too much that they don't know. so their health advisory board just is not recommending them to cancel games or fan participation. so it's just wait and see at this point.\n\nin a memo to teams friday, the nba reportedly warned that they should prepare to play games without fans in the stands — a proposal that some players, including lebron james, are resisting.\n\nnah, that's impossible, james told reporters friday. i ain't playing. if i ain't got the fans in the crowd, that's what i play for. i play for my teammates. i play for the fans. that's what it's all about. if i show up to an arena and there ain't no fans in there? i ain't playing. so, they could do what they want to do.\n\nmore than 2 million test kits to be shipped by monday\n\nthat's the headline from the media briefing held saturday by federal health authorities. stephen hahn, commissioner of the food and drug administration, said he believes officials will have the capacity to ship out 2.1 million test kits by monday.\n\nthat translates into [the fact that] approximately 850,000 patients could be tested, hahn explained to reporters, adding that the actual capacity will depend on local health care providers.\n\nthe announcement came as several outlets have reported on federal officials' tardiness and troubles in rolling out test kits to local doctors and public health experts.\n\nduring the same briefing, health and human services secretary alex azar attempted to delicately correct president trump, who told reporters friday at the centers for disease control and prevention that anybody who wants a test gets a test.\n\nhe's using a shorthand, azar said, explaining that what the president meant to say is that you may not get a test unless a doctor or a public health official prescribes a test.\n\nhotel used for quarantined patients collapses in china\n\na five-story hotel in the city of quanzhou collapsed on saturday evening, trapping at least 70 people amid the rubble, according to the people's daily, an official newspaper of the chinese communist party. the paper reports that about 40 people have been rescued so far from the building, which had been used as a quarantine location for people suspected of having covid-19.\n\nit remains unclear what caused the building to fall.\n\nthe vatican cancels in-person sunday gathering\n\npeople who wished to see pope francis lead prayers at st. peter's square, a weekly event that regularly draws tens of thousands of worshippers, had to content themselves with viewing him remotely on sunday.\n\nthe holy see press office announced saturday that the pontiff would lead the prayer from the library of the apostolic palace — rather than from his usual window overlooking the square — and would livestream the proceedings online rather than encourage visitors to gather at the vatican. officials say they will be carrying out his general audience on wednesday in a similar fashion.\n\nthese decisions are necessary in order to avoid the risk of the spread of covid-19, said the holy see, noting that the move was done at the request of italian authorities.\n\nthe vatican recently announced its first confirmed patient, while italy has seen the biggest coronavirus outbreak outside asia, with more than 5,800 total confirmed cases reported as of saturday — a leap of more than 1,000 since the day before. nearly 50 of those patients died in a span of about 24 hours earlier this week, according to local authorities.\n\nperhaps the most prominent of the newly confirmed patients is nicola zingaretti, the leader of italy's democratic party, which is part of the country's governing coalition. zingaretti revealed his diagnosis in a video posted saturday to facebook.\n\n''i am well, he explained, according to an associated press translation, so it was decided i will be isolated at home.''\n\na member of the u.s. navy is also among the patients recently

the universe according to albert einstein: relativity\n\nenlarge this image bettmann/bettmann archive bettmann/bettmann archive\n\nalbert einstein would have been 139 years old wednesday. happy birthday!\n\neinstein's science, and general views on humanity, have profoundly changed the way we see ourselves and the world we live in. he was not faultless, as no human is. he was an absent father and unfaithful husband. he lived in very different times, and — right or wrong from our current standards — we must analyze facts within their cultural context. einstein epitomizes the intellectual freedom and courageous creativity that, combined with an unbeatable work ethic, defines true genius.\n\nto shake the foundations of knowledge one needs at least two things: to believe deeply in his ideas and to have the courage to go against the established order. in the sciences, to be successful in shaking the foundations of knowledge so as to promote change, one also needs to be right.\n\nwhen einstein came into the science scene at the turn of the 20th century, physics was in crisis. the physics developed from galileo up to 1899 had three pillars: mechanics, electromagnetism and thermodynamics, the study of heat. and the three pillars were on shaky ground, as physicists couldn't use them to explain a series of phenomena that had been recently discovered in the lab and in the skies. new ideas were badly needed, but not much was coming forth. it was the perfect moment for a trailblazer.\n\nfirst, there was trouble with light and its propagation. after a debate that lasted for centuries, people were convinced that light was a wave. (the other option, defended by issac newton, was that light was made of little bulletlike particles.) that being the case, and as with any other wave, light had to propagate in a material medium. water waves, for example, travel in water; sound waves in air. light? well, for us to see light from distant stars, the medium had to be transparent. it also had to be very light so as not to slow down the orbits of planets. finally, it had to be very rigid, so as to allow for the propagation of very fast waves: it was well-known by then that light traveled at about 186,000 miles per second in empty space.\n\nwhat kind of medium could this be? stumped, the greatest physicists of the 19th century came up with a wild idea: imagine that all of space is filled with an imponderable medium called the ether. what it was, no one knew. its sole purpose was to allow light to propagate. with hindsight, we could call it magical stuff. even as attempts to find it failed, physicists would not let go. the alternative, having light propagating in empty space, sounded even crazier.\n\nenter einstein. in 1905, he proposes his special theory of relativity, whereby he singlehandedly destroyed the notions of absolute space and time, and the need for an ether. according to the theory, now one of the greatest success stories in the history of thought, the notions of space as a rigid stage at which things just happen and of time as a steadily flowing river, are just an illusion caused by our myopic view of reality. and it's all light's fault.\n\nspace would only be a rigid stage and time would only be a steady river if light could travel from point a to point b instantaneously. (that is if light traveled with an infinite speed.) but it doesn't. our illusion is corrected once we incorporate the fact that light has a finite speed of propagation, even if it's so ridiculously high. (in fact, it is its enormous value that makes our illusions so persistent and convincing.) once the correction is factored into our studies of motion, everything changes. an observer at rest that measures the length of a moving bus will obtain a different result from the passengers in the bus. to her, the moving bus will be shorter. if she also saw a clock attached to the bus, she would notice that the seconds pass slower for it than for the watch on her wrist. amazed, she would conclude that moving objects shorten in the direction of their motion and that moving clocks tick slower.\n\nthe effects, called length contraction and time dilation, become more pronounced as the speed of the moving object approaches the speed of light. remarkably, einstein also showed, in a second paper he wrote that same year, that no object with mass could ever reach the speed of light. mass itself grows with speed and becomes infinitely large at the speed of light. only light itself, or another entity with no mass, could travel at light speed. and by the way, all this is perfectly consistent with light traveling in empty space. no ether. light is like nothing else in the cosmos.\n\nin 1915, einstein expanded his theory to include motions with variable speeds (i.e., with acceleration). his theory of general relativity, arguably one of the towering achievements of the human intellect, imprinted the plasticity of space and time into the fabric of the universe itself. now, the presence of any material object (or merely energy) could bend space and alter the flow of time. space and time became literally pliable. for example, a light ray from a distant star would be deviated from a straight line as it passed by the sun. (it does as it passes by you, too, but the bending is so small as to be literally immeasurable.) in 1919, two expeditions were sent to test einstein's prediction of this phenomenon. their data, despite bad weather and measurement issues, were conclusive: einstein was right.\n\nlater on, einstein's prediction for the flow of time was also confirmed: time slows down in strong gravity. a clock on the top of the empire state building ticks faster than one on the ground. but the effect is tiny: if you were to spend your lifetime on top of the empire state building you would lose 104 millionths of a second. even more fun: in a 79-year lifetime, the cells in your brain age faster than those in your feet by about 45 billionths of a second.\n\neinstein was the first to apply his ideas of space and time plasticity to the universe as a whole. in 1919, he devised a model for the entire universe: a static, spherical, perfectly symmetric cosmos, with matter homogeneously distributed everywhere, reflecting a mix of platonic perfection and of ockham's razor. that first model, even if wrong, became the inspiration for all the work on modern cosmology that followed it, including the now widely-accepted big bang model, whereby the universe emerged from an event 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding and cooling ever since. black holes, gravitational waves, all of this follows from einstein's general theory. oh yes, and so does the accuracy of your gps, which needs elements from both the special and the general theories.\n\nremarkably, all this relativity stuff was only one of einstein's playgrounds. the other, his muse and demon, was quantum theory. next week, i'll take it up from here, and explain why einstein got his nobel prize for his ideas on the nature of light (being both a wave and a particle) and not for relativity. and why he was haunted by the quantum ghost to the end of his life.\n\nnote: as this article was being edited, we learned of stephen hawking's passing. an uncanny coincidence, he was fond of telling that he was born on the 300th anniversary of galileo's death; and now, he passes away on the 139th anniversary of einstein's birth.\n\nstephen hawking was one of those rare life heroes who shone above all of us as a beacon. not just as a brilliant physicist whose contributions to our understanding of the universe and of black holes will remain forever in the annals of science, but also as a life-loving, amazingly resilient person. he had the generosity of heart to share his knowledge and inspire millions of readers around the globe. his love for life must be celebrated and remembered by all of us, scientists or not.\n\nmarcelo gleiser is a theoretical physicist and writer — and a professor of natural philosophy, physics and astronomy at dartmouth college. he is the director of the institute for cross-disciplinary engagement at dartmouth, co-founder of 13.7 and an active promoter of science to the general public. his latest book is the simple beauty of the unexpected: a natural philosopher's quest for trout and the meaning of everything. you can keep up with marcelo on facebook and twitter: @mgleiser
'shape of water' actor explains makeup, body language and bathroom breaks\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of fox searchlight/twentieth century fox courtesy of fox searchlight/twentieth century fox\n\nin more than three decades of work, doug jones has carved out a niche in the acting world by playing strange and otherworldly creatures. he was a demonic superhero in hellboy and a monster with an appetite for children in pan's labyrinth.\n\nbut there was one storyline that proved elusive: jones says, i never saw romantic leading male [stories] coming with any creature roles.\n\nthat's changed with his latest film. in guillermo del toro's oscar-nominated the shape of water, jones plays an amphibious fish man who strikes up an unlikely romance with a mute woman.\n\ni find the heart and soul of a character before i find his elbows and his hands.\n\nthough jones was initially skeptical about his character's storyline, he says, if anyone could pull off a fish man from the amazon being a love interest to the beautiful sally hawkins, it would be guillermo del toro.\n\nfor his part, jones says he approaches his creature roles as he would any human character: i find the heart and soul of a character before i find his elbows and his hands. i want to find out what motivates those elbows and hands.\n\ninterview highlights\n\non what guillermo del toro envisioned for the fish man\n\nhe wanted to see no trace of human. he wanted to really see an ecosystem that came from another place, another world, another species. he wanted to see a heroic stance that would warrant why i was worshiped as a god in the amazon. so that comes with a certain regalness, a certain royalty kind of posturing.\n\nso i had to incorporate all of that into this. and he said, and while you're at it, sprinkle in some matador! so i'm like, oh, ok. i understood exactly what he meant immediately, though. matadors, if you ever see a bull-fighting toreador, how graceful they are and how confident they are and how they lead with the hips and the pelvis. it's sexy and graceful all at the same time, and very athletic and very fearless. ... that's kind of what i did.\n\non performing visual dialogue as the fish man\n\nwhen you think about dialogue and people communicating, so much of our communication is visual: how you hold your hands, how you're postured, what your body language is, expressions on your face, the tilt of the head. that can change all the words you say. so when that's all you have to work with — along with [hawkins' character] using american sign language — that kind of upped the stakes on what we had to give visually. ...\n\nand i could not use my human instincts to respond. so if someone's talking to me, i had to think: ok, so when you talk to the family dog, 'you're such a good boy, fluffy,' the dog does not say, 'yes, daddy, i am a good boy,' and give you a thumbs up. they tilt their head. they raise their ears. they wag their tail. they ruff at you. so they have their own ecosystem to respond with. so i had to find my own ecosystem with this fish man character, and that's kind of what helped me, was to think of the family dog.\n\non the challenge of acting in a creature suit\n\nany creature suit that i've worn over the last 31 years hampers your eyesight, your hearing. you basically become a nursing home patient; you need help getting around. the irony of that is usually you're playing a being that has superhuman strength, [but] you need help walking to the set.\n\nso this was no different. my vision was very impaired and my hearing — my ears were covered with latex foam rubber. and the gills were right next to my ears as well, and they were mechanically operated. so i would hear [mechanical noises] in my ears as a scene is progressing, so you kind of have to blot that out.\n\non how long it takes to get in and out of his creature suits\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption willy sanjuan/invision/ap willy sanjuan/invision/ap\n\na head-to-toe transformation often you're looking at, yes, five hours is about right. the fawn from pan's labyrinth, that was a five-hour makeup transformation. the pale man from pan's labyrinth, with my eyeballs in my hands — i did play that character as well — that was a six-hour transformation.\n\nshape of water was much kinder and gentler — that was only three hours. but that's three hours on set when the makeup artists are applying the pieces to the actor. what happens beforehand is a huge share of the work. that would be all the sculpting, the molding, the running of pieces, the painting of those pieces ahead of time, so that the makeup artist on set can then blend the colors together with all the pieces that are now glued onto you.\n\nso once you're done with that makeup process, you still are looking at a 10- to 12-hour shoot day, and then you're looking at a tear-down period. ... the shape of water, the amphibian man, was a quick one because it went on in only three hours, it was less glued down makeup and more suit, therefore it came off faster. so we got that off in about 40 minutes.\n\non taking bathroom breaks when wearing a creature suit\n\nit depends on the creature. every one of them is different. if there's zippers and things that can be pulled down, you're good to go. if it is a rubber suit from head to toe that is a creature that is not wearing clothing — like the amphibian man from the shape of water -- now you're looking at hiding a front flap [so] that i can go no. 1. ...\n\nbut that behind of mine, that backside of the fish man — which was very sexy — that sexy backside came at a cost. there was no back flap. so i had to take care of all that business ahead of time and make sure that i can make it through an 18-hour day without having to use that back. ... we were filming this with me at 56 years old — i'm 57 now — and i'm thinking, hmm, how many more of these do i want to do?\n\nheidi saman and mooj zadie produced and edited this interview for broadcast. bridget bentz, seth kelley and nicole cohen adapted it for the web.
cdc recommends against gatherings of 50 or more; states close bars and restaurants\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption brad lee/afp via getty images brad lee/afp via getty images\n\nupdated at 1:55 a.m. et monday\n\nin an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the centers for disease control and prevention is now advising against gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks.\n\nin a guidance announcement issued on sunday, the agency said it was warning against large events and mass gatherings that include conferences, festivals, parades, concerts, sporting events, weddings, and other types of assemblies.\n\nthe agency called on organizers, whether they are individuals or organizations, to cancel or postpone such events. however, it said the guidance did not apply to the daily operations of organizations such as schools, institutes of higher learning or businesses.\n\nthis recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus, according to the guidance announcement. this recommendation is not intended to supersede the advice of local public health officials.\n\nillinois to shut down bars, restaurants\n\nthe cdc guidance came as states and cities across the country acted on sunday to limit large gatherings to help halt the spread of an outbreak that has infected at least 3,499 people in the u.s. and resulted in 63 deaths, according to tracking by johns hopkins university.\n\nillinois gov. j.b. pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to close through march 30 beginning on monday.\n\nthe time for persuasion and public appeals is over, pritzker said at a press conference on sunday as st. patrick's day revelers in chicago were already hitting bars in large groups. this is not a joke. no one is immune to this.\n\nthere are 93 confirmed coronavirus cases in the state, according to the illinois department of public health.\n\npritzker said drive-throughs will be allowed to stay open and added that he's working with establishments to keep kitchens open so that food can still be delivered to homes.\n\nthe order affects roughly 25,000 businesses across the state, sending home hundreds of thousands of workers, the local cbs chicago reports.\n\nthe illinois restaurant association backed the governor's decision, declaring safety its priority.\n\nwe are currently working with other stakeholders to explore all possible avenues of economic and regulatory relief for our industry in the days and weeks ahead, the group said in a statement.\n\ncalifornia orders seniors to stay home and bars to close\n\ncalifornia gov. gavin newsom on sunday requested that all senior citizens and those with chronic conditions isolate themselves at home. additionally, he called for the closure of all bars, wineries, nightclubs and breweries, as the country's most populous state recorded 335 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and six deaths.\n\nrestaurants are being asked to cut their occupancy in half in order to promote social distancing, newsom said. the governor is also asking restaurants to prioritize takeout options for individuals who are isolating themselves.\n\nthe most important thing is to focus on the vulnerable and prioritize their safety, newsom said. we are guided by science, not the framework of hysteria.\n\nlos angeles mayor eric garcetti on sunday night ordered the city's restaurants, bars, gyms and entertainment venues closed at midnight local time at least through march. the emergency decree exempted takeout and delivery.\n\nnew york city shuts schools, bars, restaurants\n\nstarting monday, the country's largest public school system will shut its doors to more than 1.1 million students, new york city mayor bill de blasio announced at a news conference on sunday evening.\n\nthe citywide closure will be in place until at least april 20.\n\non twitter, a somber de blasio expressed concern for students and families who would be affected by the change and addressed the steps he was taking to mitigate any challenges that arise.\n\nwe know hundreds of thousands of kids depend on our schools for their meals, he said. we'll have grab and go breakfast and lunch available at all school buildings starting tomorrow.\n\nthe mayor also announced that he would be asking all bars and restaurants in the city to close starting at 9 a.m. on tuesday and instead limit their business to takeout and delivery.\n\ntomorrow, i will sign an executive order limiting restaurants, bars and cafes to food take-out and delivery. nightclubs, movie theaters, small theater houses and concert venues must all close, de blasio said in a statement.\n\nas of sunday, the state had 729 cases of the virus, according to the new york department of health.\n\nwashington state doubles down on cdc guidance\n\nwashington state, a coronavirus hot spot that saw the country's first death, took its most drastic steps yet to limit the spread of the virus in public spaces.\n\ngov. jay inslee said on sunday night that he would order the temporary closure of restaurants, bars, entertainment and recreation venues. delivery and takeout will not be shut down, he said.\n\nthese are very difficult decisions, but hours count here and very strong measures are necessary to slow the spread of the disease. i know there will be significant economic impacts to all our communities and we are looking at steps to help address those challenges, inslee said.\n\nthe governor is also banning gatherings of at least 50, in a mandate of the cdc's new guidance.\n\nthere are at least 42 deaths statewide with 769 positive cases confirmed.
why you should still wear a mask and avoid crowds after getting the covid-19 vaccine\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mario tama/getty images mario tama/getty images\n\nit may seem counterintuitive, but health officials say that even after you get vaccinated against covid-19, you still need to practice the usual pandemic precautions, at least for a while. that means steering clear of crowds, continuing to wear a good mask in public, maintaining 6 feet or more of distance from people outside your household and frequently washing your hands. we talked to infectious disease specialists to get a better understanding of why.\n\nwhy do i have to continue with precautions after i've been vaccinated?\n\nin the short run, it will take some time for the vaccine's effectiveness to build up. (effectiveness is defined as not getting sick with covid-19. if 100 vaccinated people are exposed to a virus and 50 of them subsequently develop symptoms, that vaccine is 50% effective.)\n\nwith the pfizer-biontech vaccine, a study published in the new england journal of medicine in december found that protection doesn't start until 12 days after the first shot and that it reaches 52% effectiveness a few weeks later. a week after the second vaccination, the effectiveness rate hits 95%. in its application for authorization, moderna reported a protection rate of 51% two weeks after the first immunization and 94% two weeks after the second dose.\n\nthat's not 100%, notes dr. paul offit, an infectious disease specialist and director of the vaccine education center at children's hospital of philadelphia, as well as a member of the food and drug administration's vaccine advisory board. that means one out of every 20 people who get this vaccine could still get moderate to severe infection.\n\nso, reason no. 1 to continue with precautions is to protect yourself.\n\ncan i spread the virus to others even if i'm fully vaccinated?\n\nthis is an important question, but scientists studying the shots' effectiveness don't have an answer yet. and for public health experts, that lack of knowledge means you should act like the answer is yes.\n\nhere's why: before approving the moderna and pfizer vaccines, the fda asked the vaccine manufacturers only whether their products protect people from covid-19 symptoms. they didn't ask if the vaccines stop people who've been vaccinated from nevertheless spreading the virus to others. the emergency authorizations by the fda that have allowed distribution of the two new vaccines cite only their ability to keep you — the person vaccinated — from becoming severely sick with covid-19.\n\nin the words of the centers for disease control and prevention, experts need to understand more about the protection that covid-19 vaccines provide before deciding to change recommendations on steps everyone should take to slow the spread of the virus that causes covid-19.\n\nthe data to answer the question of whether vaccinated people can still spread the virus are just now being collected.\n\nhow can you spread a virus if you've been vaccinated?\n\nall the covid-19 vaccines and vaccine candidates under consideration for use in the u.s. rely on bits of genetic material or virus protein — not anything that could grow into an active sars-cov-2 virus, the virus that causes the disease covid-19.\n\nthe concern instead with the covid-19 vaccine is about whether you might still have an asymptomatic infection despite immunization — without symptoms, but able to shed virus.\n\nhere's how that might work: let's say you've been vaccinated and you encounter sars-cov-2. you're much less likely to develop symptoms — that's clear. but your immune system may not fight off the virus completely — it might allow some viruses to survive and reproduce and get expelled from your nose or mouth in a breath, cough or sneeze. remember: no one can be sure yet if this actually happens or if it happens often enough that you'd be emitting enough active virus to sicken someone else.\n\nwhy didn't the fda demand information on infectivity before authorizing the first two vaccines?\n\nin a word, time. dr. larry corey is a virologist at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle and helps lead the covid-19 prevention network, a federally funded consortium of vaccine experts who've been testing vaccines. we wanted to get an answer quickly, corey says, and to do so required as simple an experimental protocol as possible. you can't hang a lot of bells and whistles on a trial, he says.\n\neven though the pre-authorization studies of the pfizer and moderna vaccines were as streamlined as possible, they still required quite a lot of work. each of the 75,000 volunteers had to come into a clinic; get a test for the coronavirus; get either a vaccine or a placebo shot (without knowing which they'd received); return for a second shot; and come back to the clinic for testing anytime in the interim if they showed any symptoms of having caught the virus.\n\nadding in even more coronavirus tests along the way to see if the vaccinated volunteers had picked up or were transmitting the virus would have delayed the initial results considerably, corey says. and in the midst of the pandemic, speed was of the essence.\n\nso how will we get an answer to whether vaccinated people can infect others?\n\nresearchers are checking now on the folks vaccinated in the pfizer and moderna trials for antibodies showing that they've been infected. it's not a perfect measure, corey notes, because the antibody tests aren't always accurate and antibodies can be transient. moderna officials have hinted that their vaccine prevents some shedding, but they haven't been specific on how much. some people who volunteered for the vaccine studies will be checked for evidence of the virus itself.\n\nif someone is found to be shedding the virus, then researchers will check to see if that virus is capable of reproducing itself and, if it is, whether there's enough to infect other people. that raises another unknown: it's not yet clear what an infectious dose would be.\n\nnailing down the answers to all these questions is a laborious process. and no one is saying yet how soon the results of these sorts of studies of the pfizer or moderna vaccines will be available.\n\nthere are other ways to get at the answer. the covid-19 prevention network has proposed an experimental study that would involve vaccinating more than 20,000 college students with moderna's vaccine, checking them multiple times per week for virus shedding and doing contact tracing when infections occurred. the trial, which would cost several hundred million dollars, has so far been turned down by federal funders.\n\nthere are other candidate covid-19 vaccines in the pipeline, and tests will need to be done on them as well. volunteers in an experimental trial of the astrazeneca vaccine tested themselves for the virus. the results so far, posted dec. 8 in the lancet, suggest that the candidate vaccine may partly, but not totally, protect against viral shedding. in a commentary posted the same day in the lancet, researchers from johns hopkins university said that the observation provides some hope that the vaccine stops some asymptomatic shedding but that the evidence gathered so far is too slight to be considered conclusive.\n\nmaybe one of the vaccines that are in the pipeline would be a better idea?\n\nif your turn for vaccination comes, there's no reason to wait. while vaccines currently being tested are different in design from the pfizer and moderna products, scientists say there's no biological reason to think those vaccines will be more or less protective against shedding.\n\nnow that i'm vaccinated, can i take my mask off in a crowded room if everyone else has also been vaccinated?\n\nyou might think you're home free in that case, but not yet. remember that the pfizer and moderna vaccines are not 100% effective, and many in the research community still advise caution. once most people are protected and there's less virus circulating in the air — and less circulating in the community — the advice and restrictions on this may ease up a bit. one vision of the new normal, whether that's later in 2021 or even 2022, is an eventual relaxation of the recommendations, with occasional renewals when the virus flares up in a community.\n\nwhat about the new variant from the u.k.? will that make a difference in terms of spreading the virus after vaccination?\n\nthe newly identified variant, b.1.1.7, hasn't been around long enough to say for certain that the new vaccines are effective against it, but scientists aren't too worried about that — lab studies suggest the vaccines will be protective against this strain.\n\nhowever, infectious disease specialists are concerned that any strain that is more contagious — which b.1.1.7 clearly is — might quickly increase the number of covid-19 cases in the world.\n\nit appears that the people infected with this new variant, at least in the u.k., have an increased amount of virus, says dr. david heymann of the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine. the hypothesis is they could spread it more easily from their nasal passages. whether there is actually an increased risk of transmitting the virus is currently being studied.\n\nif the new variant increases the risk of shedding or just provides more chances for it to happen, increased masking and distancing, crowd avoidance and hand-washing will help stop the spread.\n\nso what's the bottom line?\n\nwith cases and deaths surging throughout the u.s., the people who are treating covid-19 patients really want you to continue to wear a mask, keep your distance and wash your hands, even if you've been vaccinated, until the research on shedding has yielded some answers. dr. carlos del rio of emory university says he knows taking precautions can be taxing, but he urges us all to hang on and keep it up.\n\nit's not like you'll need to wear a mask for the rest of your life, he says. you need to wear your mask until we have the data, and we're

latest from the congressional meeting to certify electoral college votes\n\ncongress reconvened to finish the tally of the electoral college votes after pro-trump extremists were cleared from the u.s. capitol grounds, following their violent insurrection on wednesday.\n\nailsa chang, host:\n\nwell, at this hour, both the house and senate are back at work under intense security hours after pro-trump extremists stormed the capitol building. house speaker nancy pelosi addressed what happened as house debate on the electoral college votes resumed a short time ago.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nnancy pelosi: the house will be in order. the chair will address the chamber. today a shameful assault was made on our democracy. it cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of joe biden and kamala harris.\n\nchang: president trump urged his supporters to head to the capitol today. and even after violence broke out, he stood by them. npr congressional correspondent susan davis joins us now.\n\nhi, sue.\n\nsusan davis, byline: hey, ailsa.\n\nchang: so what has the mood been like as lawmakers have resumed business tonight?\n\ndavis: you know, if you had not paid attention to the television today and just tuned in tonight, it is resumed debate. the house and senate are back in session, republicans and democrats going back-and-forth over the electoral college results. we still expect there to be some objections. i would say overall, the mood has been fairly somber. members have recognized how serious today was, the threat that it posed - and a lot of calls for unity to assert the election as they were set out to do today. and overwhelmingly, lawmakers wanted to come in back to session tonight. there was no disagreement. members wanted to come in. they wanted the country to see them doing their jobs, to see them on the floor of the house and senate and to get this done.\n\nchang: to show that they could not be deterred - well, where do things stand right now in the process of counting the electoral college votes?\n\ndavis: you know, there's still - have a long way to go. they're only on arizona. they still have 48 more states in the electoral count certification process. it goes alphabetical by state. there was an initial objection raised to the arizona count. they're still in the debate time for that. it's a maximum of two hours. this was an objection raised by paul gosar of arizona that was seconded in the senate by ted cruz of texas. they have to exhaust this debate, and then both chambers have to vote on it. it will be rejected, and then they go back into joint session and will continue their way through the alphabetical list of states in order. the question is, will there be any other objections? there has been some news tonight. several senators who were initially going to object to the electoral college results have withdrawn their objections.\n\nchang: yeah.\n\ndavis: notably, georgia senator kelly loeffler, who lost her own reelection campaign yesterday, was going to object to the georgia results. and she declared on the floor that she could no longer in good conscience do that. but we still know that at least roger marshall of kansas and josh hawley of missouri do intend to continue with their objection, so we know we will have at least one more objection likely for the state of pennsylvania.\n\nchang: but is it your sense that there has been a substantial change of heart or change in attitude among republicans who were planning on objecting to the electoral college votes?\n\ndavis: there has certainly been a number of republicans - a handful of republicans, not an overwhelming number - who have come out and said that the events of the day changed their mind. cathy mcmorris rodgers, a republican from the state of washington, a former member of leadership, was one of those republicans. also, senators steve daines of montana, james lankford of oklahoma put out a joint statement saying that they would no longer consider themselves objectors in the senate. there is also increasingly some tension within the party. there has been republican senators on the floor tonight really critical of their colleagues who have objected to the processing. it undermines democracy. it undermines the system. mitt romney of utah, obviously a former presidential candidate himself, gave a really impassioned speech on the senate floor just now, saying that if you want to give americans confidence in their election, the most important thing you can do is tell them the truth - in his words - and the truth being that joe biden won this election. so a lot of recriminations, i think, still to come within the republican party for over how lawmakers sort of supported and tried to legitimize many of the president's false allegations here.\n\nchang: now, sue, real quick, i mean, you have spent so many years in that building, i mean, almost every day the last several years. was it striking to you how easily these rioters got into the building?\n\ndavis: oh, i think it has stunned everyone. and zoe lofgren is a top democrat on the house administration committee - has put out a statement saying the house and senate and leadership are going to go into a review to see how this happened and try to make sure that it can never happen again.\n\nchang: that is npr's susan davis.\n\nthank you so much, sue.\n\ndavis: you're welcome.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
saturday sports: baseball cheating scandal\n\ncameras, a trash cans, code — maybe even buzzers. the ingredients of a cheating scheme by the houston astros, who won the world series in 2017, and narrowly lost it last year.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nand now it's time for sports.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nsimon: cameras, a trash cans code, maybe even buzzers - the ingredients of a cheating scheme by the houston astros, who won the world series in 2017 and narrowly lost it last year. lots of allegations tumbling out as we speak, including about other teams. npr's tom goldman joins us. tom, thanks so much for being with us.\n\ntom goldman, byline: my pleasure, scott.\n\nsimon: tom, this could be the most serious scandal in baseball since the 1919 black sox through the world series, couldn't it?\n\ngoldman: i think it could. the houston astros broke baseball rules by using technology at houston home games - technology in the form of video cameras, video replay - to steal the signs opposing catchers were giving to pitchers. now, the team that won the 2018 world series, the boston red sox, is being investigated for similar rule-breaking. there's suspicion there could be more teams, as well. so just the scope could be much greater than 1919.\n\nand, scott, you know, then there's this. the rule-breaking involved here threatens a fundamental relationship in major league baseball between the pitcher and the batter. normally, the pitcher knows what he's going to throw; the batter doesn't. the batter has milliseconds to figure out or to guess the speed, the angle, the spin of the ball. and, you know, that's one of the reasons ted williams famously said hitting a pitched ball is the hardest thing to do in sports. and if you successfully steal a sign from the catcher, you know what pitch is coming. now the batter has the advantage, and that relationship is turned upside down. and the outcome of games can change because of that. it's very telling that several pitchers tweeted this week they'd rather face a player on steroids than a player who knew what pitch was coming.\n\n(soundbite of tapping on trash can)\n\nsimon: can you hear that, tom?\n\ngoldman: (laughter) come in.\n\n(soundbite of tapping on trash can)\n\nsimon: i'm signaling my next question by banging on a trash can.\n\ngoldman: ok, i know what's coming (laughter).\n\nsimon: manager and general manager of the astros have been let go, manager of the red sox and mets who were on that astros team. should the teams have their championships taken away?\n\ngoldman: you know, there's a case to be made for that. but the other side of the argument holds more sway when it comes to professional team sports. that argument is the championship happened. nothing will change that, even if it's deemed fraudulent. mostly in the pros, they punish forward. future draft picks, fines, suspensions. so perhaps an asterisk, but i don't see world series being taken away.\n\nsimon: in the steroids scandal, the player's union tried to protect the accused players. the player's union - now, remember that when the houston astros and perhaps more teams cheated, they harmed the performance and the records of opposing players.\n\ngoldman: well, that's a really good point, you know? there's been a lot of talk about the la dodgers, who lost to houston in the world series in that 2017 season. you remember what happened to yu darvish, the...\n\nsimon: he was humiliated.\n\ngoldman: he was humiliated, yeah.\n\nsimon: and it turns out they knew what was coming from him.\n\ngoldman: yeah. and he was famously lit up by houston batters in that series in games in houston, where the astros used the sign-stealing scheme. now, he's openly wondering, you know, the astros told him after that series that he was tipping his pitches, you know, kind of giving away with little tics or whatever. but now he's wondering, well, was it their sign-stealing? and what this does to a pitcher's reputation - i mean, it took yu darvish - who you know now is with the chicago cubs. it took him until the latter half of last season to really recover and become an effective pitcher again.\n\nsimon: major league baseball would like to say the scandal is done. it's not, is it?\n\ngoldman: well, it's not, you know? there still is the investigation going on about the boston red sox, which could lead to punishment from the league. and, of course, scott, at the end of this crazy week, it got even crazier. rumors started flying that last year's astros, who were not implicated in the major league baseball investigation - rumors were that players on the 2019 team wore electronic devices that signaled to them what pitches were coming.\n\nnow, if you remember - jose altuve hitting that dramatic series-winning homerun versus the yankees last year in the playoffs. and as he headed for home plate, he grabbed his jersey, told his teammates not to rip it off. that's the popular celebration with game-winning hits. and the suspicion now is that he did that because if his shirt had been ripped off, it would've exposed one of these electronic wearables. now, altuve denies wearing anything illegal. major league baseball says there's no evidence of it. but, obviously, it's sent this story into the stratosphere. and people are wondering who's cheating, who's innocent.\n\nsimon: yeah. pitchers and catchers report for spring training in 24 days. i count. fans going to wonder if what they're seeing is honest?\n\ngoldman: yeah, i think they already are wondering that. and, you know, the big worry by major league baseball is that large numbers of fans won't trust the product on the field if they perceive widespread cheating. it's not baseball season right now, as you point out, so it's hard to survey large numbers. but as you said, spring training starts in about a month. we'll get a first sense then how deep the suspicion runs.\n\nsimon: npr's tom goldman, thanks so much.\n\ngoldman: you're welcome, scott.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
robert mercer is a force to be reckoned with in finance and conservative politics\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption the washington post/getty images the washington post/getty images\n\nwhen robert mercer accepted a lifetime achievement award from a technology group in 2014, the renaissance technologies co-ceo summed up his career modestly.\n\nwhat i am is simply a computer programmer, he told the crowd.\n\nin fact, both professionally and politically, mercer is much more than that.\n\nat 70, mercer is an american success story, having helped turn renaissance into one of the most profitable hedge funds in the world, and by all accounts becoming very rich in the process.\n\nalong the way, he and his daughter rebekah have become a force to be reckoned with in conservative politics, contributing lavishly to right-wing causes in the united states and even europe.\n\naccording to the center for responsive politics, in 2016 mercer gave some $25 million to conservative groups and candidates, including president trump. last year, he was also one of the 10 biggest political donors in the country, alongside better-known figures such as george soros, sheldon adelson and mike bloomberg.\n\neven though he is very private, he has very deep pockets and he cuts a wide swath in conservative politics, sheila krumholz, the center's executive director, told npr.\n\nin fact, mercer is typical of a new kind of mega-donor in politics these days, she says.\n\nin years past, big donors gave soft money to the parties, and maybe they got perks. they got donor rewards. they got a seat at the head table or got invited to briefings, breakfasts, etc. but here's someone who's very private and yet wants to use his money in very strategic, specific ways that he controls, she says.\n\npolitics inside the wealthy family that has been funding steve bannon's plan for years inside the wealthy family that has been funding steve bannon's plan for years listen · 37:21 37:21\n\nmercer is a major donor to well-known conservative groups such as the club for growth, the heritage foundation, the media research center and the cato institute.\n\nrebekah mercer, the second of robert and diana mercer's three daughters, has arguably become even more powerful, with direct ties to trump senior strategist steve bannon. she ran the pro-trump super pac make america number 1 and served on the trump transition team.\n\nwith very few exceptions, neither mercer talks to the press or speaks publicly and if they have specific policy goals, those are shrouded in mystery. npr contacted a spokesman for the mercers but did not receive a reply.\n\nthose who know mercer say he has long held strong views on government spending, the environment and civil rights.\n\nthey were very, very conservative. libertarian. if i wanted to use a prejudicial word i would probably say they were reactionary, says nick patterson, who helped hire mercer at renaissance in 1993 and is now a senior computational biologist at the broad institute.\n\npatterson says he got along with mercer and people at renaissance tended to avoid discussing politics. but mercer wasn't afraid to say what he thought.\n\nhe was an extreme skeptic about climate change, patterson told npr in an interview. the second thing i remember is, he really, really hated bill and hillary clinton. and he was quite vocal about that. mercer described bill clinton as a rapist and even a murderer, patterson says.\n\nraised in new mexico, mercer early on developed a love of computers, getting a job at the weapons lab at kirtland air force base.\n\nperhaps the most important thing i learned is that i really loved everything about computers. i loved the solitude of the computer lab late at night. i loved the air-conditioned smell of the place. i loved the sound of the discs whirring and the printers clacking, he said in his 2014 speech, before the association for computational linguistics.\n\nmercer was asked to work on a computer program that calculated the electromagnetic fields generated by nuclear fusion explosions. the program the lab used was very unpleasant and he set about rewriting it in a way that made it run 100 times faster.\n\nand then a strange thing happened, he told the audience. instead of running the old computations in one-one hundredth of the time, the powers-that-be at the lab ran programs that were 100 times bigger.\n\ni took this as an indication that one of the most important goals of government-financed research is not so much to get answers as it is to consume the computer budget, which has left me ever since with a jaundiced view of government-financed research.\n\nmercer received a ph.d.in computer science at the university of illinois, and then went to work at ibm research, where he did early work in artificial intelligence and voice recognition.\n\nfor much of his career, mercer, his wife and three daughters lived an unremarkable existence in the new york suburbs. but in 1993, he and his ibm colleague peter brown joined the hedge fund renaissance, in east setauket, long island.\n\nit was the dawn of the quants, when wall street was beginning to appreciate the power of computers to turbocharge trading. mercer and brown set to work designing complex mathematical models that made trading dramatically faster and their work eventually paid off.\n\ntheir primary work was to look very, very hard at equity trading. after some effort, some several years of effort, they were able to produce a system that was hugely profitable, patterson says.\n\nin fact, renaissance became one of the most successful hedge fund companies in the world. its medallion fund, which is mainly a tax-free employee retirement fund, racked up annual gains of more than 70 percent between 1994 and 2014, according to bloomberg.\n\nbrown and mercer eventually were named to head renaissance.\n\nunlike the firm's founder, james simons, mercer isn't named on the lists of the wealthiest americans compiled by forbes magazine and bloomberg, and it's not clear how much money he actually has. but by all appearances, he is very wealthy indeed, living in a long island mansion known as owl's nest and owning a series of yachts.\n\nand mercer's wealth has allowed him to make his voice heard politically. while some of the beneficiaries of his largesse, such as the heritage foundation, are well within the conservative mainstream, others are decidedly unorthodox.\n\nbloomberg reported last year that the mercers attended and funded a conference run by an arizona physician who suggested that elements of the government were behind the san bernardino massacre.\n\nmercer is preoccupied with the country's monetary and banking systems, which he sees as hopelessly compromised by government meddling, bloomberg wrote, quoting people who know him. he was the main financial backer of the jackson hole summit, a conference that took place [in august 2015] to advocate for the gold standard, two of these people said.\n\nmercer's influence hasn't been confined to the united states: he was a key supporter of leave.eu, which spearheaded last summer's successful brexit campaign.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption patrick mcmullan via getty images patrick mcmullan via getty images\n\nmercer and his daughter have also been enthusiastic backers of the conservative website breitbart news, where they formed ties with key figures in the trump white house such as bannon and kellyanne conway. they own part of the data mining company cambridge analytica, which played a role in trump's victory last year.\n\nthat has given both mercers a strong foothold in the trump white house, and last year politico called rebekah mercer the most powerful woman in gop politics.\n\nmercer's political activities have also exposed him to a level of public scrutiny he is said to dislike.\n\nat least one anti-mercer demonstration has taken place outside the renaissance office. and earlier this month, mercer was dragged into the spotlight when he was sued by renaissance partner david magerman, who claims he was fired for publicly criticizing his co-ceo's political views in a wall street journal article.\n\namong other things, mercer said the united states went in the wrong direction after the 1964 civil rights act, and also insisted the only remaining racists in the united states were african-americans, according to magerman. mercer has not yet responded to the suit.\n\nmercer has contributed heavily to political groups that support republican candidates, such as the freedom partners action fund. he backed texas senator ted cruz in last year's gop primary race; after cruz's defeat, he switched his support to trump.\n\nbut in a profile of mercer in the new yorker, writer jane mayer quoted former democratic operative pat caddell saying mercer despises the republican establishment.\n\nhe thinks that the leaders are corrupt crooks, and they they've ruined the country, caddell said.\n\nthat skepticism about the establishment somehow makes mercer a natural fit for the era of trump, who won office by thumbing his nose at the elite of both parties.\n\nand mercer has made clear he's not afraid to strike out in an independent direction if gop leaders pursues goals he disagrees with.

you put the money in...\n\nrocca: i like that.\n\njobrani: ...and (imitating chicken)...\n\nrocca: yeah, yeah.\n\nroxanne roberts: yeah, but the problem with that is that if the eggs drop they're going to break.\n\njobrani: well, no, you'd have a little slide. it comes down...\n\nrocca: right.\n\njobrani: and you go hey, i got my egg.\n\nrocca: it looks fun that way.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: sarah, here is your next limerick.\n\nkurtis: i can't make it when church is in session. so i love that this bus shows discretion. once i get in, i can tell all my sins. and the bus driver takes my...\n\nricketts: confession.\n\nsagal: yes, your confession, very good.\n\n(soundbite of bell, applause)\n\nsagal: look out sinners because if you do not go to confession, confession will come to you. the catholic church in northern england has launched a mobile confession unit called the mercy bus...\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: ...which is just like the famous magic bus of the 1960s except for everything.\n\n(laughter)\n\nrocca: ok, and so you don't get onto the bus to do it.\n\nsagal: yes, you do. you get onto the bus.\n\nrocca: ok.\n\nsagal: and there's a priest; there's a little confession booth. it's right there for you. people line up presumably and go on.\n\njobrani: but the priest isn't the driver.\n\nsagal: no, i do not believe that the priest is driving the bus.\n\njobrani: why don't they just have you call it in?

the call-in: physician-assisted dying\n\nit's been a year since california passed its right-to-die law. jonel aleccia of kaiser health news discusses the change and lisa crawford talks about her family's experience.\n\na martinez, host:\n\nand this is the call-in. today we're talking about aid in dying. that's when doctors are legally able to prescribe life-ending drugs to terminally ill patients. it's legal now in six states and the district of columbia. and similar laws are being considered by several others. we asked you to call in and share your experiences with this difficult issue.\n\njasmine solomon: hi, npr. my name is jasmine solomon (ph).\n\nbrian neat: hi. this is brian neat (ph).\n\nunidentified man #1: i live in riverside, calif.\n\nunidentified woman #1: grand junction, colo.\n\nunidentified woman #2: i'm calling about physician-assisted suicide.\n\nunidentified woman #3: i've been involved in end-of-life care for 42 years.\n\nunidentified man #2: i helped my mom kill herself after a short and intense struggle with pancreatic cancer.\n\nunidentified woman #4: i am seriously considering moving to a state that allows physician-assisted suicide.\n\nunidentified woman #2: thank you for the opportunity to share my comment.\n\nunidentified man #1: thank you.\n\nunidentified man #2: thank you. bye.\n\nmartinez: jonel aleccia is a senior correspondent at kaiser health news. her focus is on end-of-life issues. and she said that we don't have exact numbers on how many people have chosen to take advantage of these laws. but...\n\njonel aleccia: it looks like, you know, more than a thousand people a year obtain the prescriptions. and maybe a little more than half of them actually use it.\n\nmartinez: now, can you remind listeners exactly what the process is? who qualifies? what happens? what's the oversight?\n\naleccia: sure. patients who are eligible for aid in dying are people who are terminally ill, typically have six months or less to live, who are mentally competent and can administer and ingest the lethal medications themselves. two doctors typically have to verify that they meet the qualifications.\n\nmartinez: does this process vary from state to state?\n\naleccia: you know it varies some in the states that have opted for it. california, for instance, has a 15-day waiting period between - the people have to have to say they want this verbally twice. and there's - has to be a 15-day waiting period between the first time and the second time. but many of the states have modeled their aid-in-dying laws on oregon's original law, which, took effect in 1997.\n\nmartinez: is it still taboo, you think? i mean, is this something people feel comfortable or confident to ask about?\n\naleccia: you know, critics of aid in dying say that they would like it to continue to be taboo because they believe it's kind of the first step toward societal euthanasia, if you will. more and more, though - more and more states are considering this. there is potential legislation in as many as two dozen states seeking to do this. so i think, from what i've heard from experts, the issues surrounding it are becoming less taboo. but, still, talking about end of life and death is still pretty uncomfortable in our society.\n\nmartinez: jonel aleccia is senior correspondent at kaiser health news. jonel, thanks.\n\naleccia: thank you so much.\n\nlisa crawford: my brother's name was ron crutcher (ph).\n\nmartinez: that's lisa crawford. she's one of the people who called us. she's a social worker in roseburg, ore.\n\ncrawford: he was, i think, somebody that you probably would have liked because everybody always did.\n\nmartinez: ron chose to die with the aid of his doctors in 2015. he was hiv positive and contracted the disease called pml. it's common in people with compromised immune systems. it attacks the white matter of the brain. for ron, it was a fatal diagnosis.\n\ncrawford: he went from a very vivacious, adventurous, outgoing person to being bedridden and unable to speak or communicate. one of the things that pml does is that it's a progressive disease. so it begins slowly and can very rapidly take somebody from full function to pretty much just being a shell of a person. and that's where ron was headed. and he coped with it for quite a while. but when it got to the point where he was losing coordination, and he could no longer text messages or write messages, he was almost completely incapable of speech. and it was extremely frustrating for him. he couldn't communicate at all with anybody.\n\nmartinez: what was the breaking point? when did he decide, ok, i want to end my life?\n\ncrawford: well, one of the upsides about talking about physician-assisted suicide - it was always on the table. we live in oregon. it's a law here. and it's legal for people to exercise that right. and so long before he had deteriorated, he had made a decision that when he could no longer take care of himself - that that was his line. and so when he reached that point, we were all aware of it. and it happened much sooner than anybody was ready for. but we were at least aware and knew it was coming.\n\nmartinez: as his sister, i would imagine that maybe that your reaction might be different than maybe his mom or his dad. what was your reaction like? what was - what were other family members' reactions like?\n\ncrawford: i'm a social worker, so i tend to be very much an advocate for people. for me, physician-assisted suicide is something that i have long supported. and that's only been more deeply affirmed through my brother's death with physician-assisted suicide. i know that my mom struggled with it a lot more than i did. but as a whole, our family was maybe uniquely supportive of this.\n\nmartinez: what was your mom's biggest struggle with this?\n\ncrawford: i think her biggest struggle was getting to a point where she felt like he would not have any regrets. you know, you read articles about new research coming out for hiv. or, you know, you come across something and think, you know, what if we were just six months away from a potential cure? the reality is that ron didn't have six more months. he was suffering, and he was miserable, and he was lonely. and everything that made him who he was was being taken away from him. but as a mother, to sit there and walk that path with your child, that's a hard road. and she struggled with that.\n\nmartinez: lisa, if you can, if it's ok, can you tell me about the day he died?\n\ncrawford: it was actually one of the most powerful moments that i have ever experienced in my life. and i know that i'm not alone in that. my brother was a very, very outgoing man. and he had tons of friends and wonderful friendships. and the day that he died, he was - he and his partner lived in a house right on the river in portland.\n\nand, of course, to my brother's style, he had to have his king bed drug all the way downstairs and set up so that he could look out his living room window and look at the river and watch the boats pass and have a nice scenery during the day. and that's where he decided that he wanted to die, as well. and so the day that it happened was december 14, 2015.\n\nand we truly celebrated his life the night before. we made all of his favorite foods and had great wine and conversation and lots of tears and a lot more laughter and more tears. and the following morning on the day he actually died was much of the same. we surrounded his bed. my mom crawled into bed, laid next to him. and my sister and my stepdad and i all kind of piled around - and the friends back around us. and we had stories that everybody shared and favorite memories of him and really surrounded him in the love and support.\n\nand the most difficult part out of the day was just simply the logistics of him drinking the medication. it's a pretty nasty-tasting concoction. and at this point, he was having trouble swallowing. so he had some difficulty getting it down. and that was a little scary for him because, obviously, you're dealing with a medication that's lethal. and you want to make sure that the dosing is right. and he had choked on some and kind of coughed some up. and so, you know, at that point it's a little scary about - has he taken enough? you know, is it going to work out ok? and it was fine. but that was really the only hiccup in the entire process.\n\neventually, he faded off to sleep. and his breathing slowed down and eventually got a little ragged. and he had a couple moments where he took some really jerky, deep breaths. and he died. his heart stopped, and he passed away. but he did so with so much love around him. and i think that's really one of the key differences with a traditional death by a terminal illness, as opposed to choosing physician-assisted suicide - is that the person is in an uncontrollable environment. but yet this gives them some control. and we all die. we all have to die. and if you go out surrounded by friends and laughter and love and tears, i think that's not a bad way to go. i mean, there's certainly much worse ways to die.\n\nmartinez: lisa crawford is a social worker in roseburg, ore. lisa, thank you very much for sharing your story.\n\ncrawford: thank you so much. i've enjoyed sharing ron with you.\n\nmartinez: and next week on the call-in, we're returning to the summer of 1967. fifty years ago, riots devastated newark and detroit, and the aftermath continues to this day. what do you remember from that time? we want to hear your stories? call in at 202-216-9217. be sure to include your full name, contact info and where you're from. that number again - 202-216-9217. and we may use your story on the air.\n\n(soundbite of corduroi's my dear)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
scientific theory and the multiverse madness\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption serge brunier/eso serge brunier/eso\n\nsabine hossenfelder is a research fellow at the frankfurt institute for advanced studies in germany. her research focuses on general relativity and quantum gravity. she is author of the blog backreaction and her first book, lost in math, is set to appear in june. you can find her on twitter at @skdh.\n\nnewton's law of gravity — remember that? the force between two massive bodies decreases with the inverse square of the distance and so on?\n\nto use it, you need a constant, newton's constant, also called the gravitational constant, usually denoted g. you can determine g to reasonable accuracy with a few simple measurements.\n\nonce you have fixed the gravitational constant, you can apply newton's law to all kinds of different situations: falling apples, orbiting planets, launching rockets, etc. all with only one constant!\n\nthis ability to explain many superficially different processes is what makes natural laws so powerful. newton's contemporaries were suitably impressed.\n\nafter newton came up with his equation, he could have reasoned: since i don't know this constant's value but have to measure it, the constant could have any value. so, there must be a universe for each different value. i conclude that we live in one of infinitely many universes – one for each value of the gravitational constant. i will call this collection of universes the multiverse.\n\nbut he didn't. newton was famously minimalistic with his assumptions and even refused to speculate whether there were deeper reasons for his law of gravity, arguing this was unnecessary. hypotheses non fingo, he wrote, i feign no hypotheses.\n\nbut that was then.\n\ntoday, the idea that we live in a multiverse has become popular in the foundations of physics. the multiverse collects all universes in which the constants of nature — newton's constant and about two dozen more — can take on any value. each combination of constants is realized in infinitely many universes.\n\nand not only the constants can change from one universe to another, the locations of particles relative to each other can also be different. since there are infinitely many universes in which to arrange the particles, some of these universes will be very similar to our own, just that eventually some initially tiny deviation will lead to an alternative history. thus, somewhere in the multiverse our lives play out in any which way you can imagine. in this case, in some other universe, newton could have, indeed, invented the multiverse.\n\n\n\nbut before you pack your bags and search for a universe more to your liking, let me add there's no way to cross over into another universe or even interact with one. this only works in science fiction. indeed, to my taste, the multiverse itself is already too close to fiction.\n\nmany theoretical physicists have argued the conclusion that we live in a multiverse is based on sound scientific reasoning. but that isn't so — and i will tell you why.\n\n\n\nthe purpose of science is to explain observations. in theoretical physics, we use mathematics for that. our theories need a set of assumptions plus a way to identify math objects with observables. but none of the assumptions should be unnecessary, a criterion known as ockham's razor (named after the 13th century theologian and philosopher william of ockham). ockham's razor is extremely important — as without it you could literally add invisible gods and angels to any scientific theory.\n\nfor centuries, progress in the foundations of physics has been characterized by simplification. complex processes — such as the multitude of chemical reactions — turned out to arise from stunningly simple underlying equations. and simplicity carried us a long way. according to physicists' best theories today, everything in our universe emerges from merely 25 elementary particles and four types of forces.\n\nso, yes, simplicity — often in the form of unification — has been extremely successful. for this reason, many physicists want to further simplify the existing theories. but you can always simplify a theory by removing an assumption. like the assumption that the gravitational constant has a some value that you inferred from observation (up to some precision). or similar assumptions about, say, the values of the masses of elementary particles, or the cosmological constant, or the strength of the four forces. these are assumptions some theoreticians are now throwing out.\n\nif ockham could see what physicists are doing here, he'd pray for god to bring reason back to earth. you should remove unnecessary assumptions, alright. but certainly you shouldn't remove assumptions that you need to describe observations. if you do, you'll just get a useless theory, equations from which you can't calculate anything.\n\nthese useless theories which lack assumptions necessary to describe observations are what we now call a multiverse. and they're about as useful as ockham's prayers.\n\n\n\nsince you cannot calculate anything in the multiverse, the assumptions which physicists removed must then be replaced with something else. that something else is a probability distribution on the multiverse, which tells you not what we do observe, but what we are likely to observe. but it is simpler to assume a constant than an infinite number of universes with a probability distribution over them. therefore, ockham's razor should shave off the multiverse. it's superfluous. unfortunately, this argument carries little weight among many of today's theoretical physicists who value the multiverse because it excuses boundless speculation.\n\n\n\nthere are a few cases where the invention of an infinite number of new universes gives rise to observable consequences. everyone's favorite example is that our universe might, in the past, have collided with another universe, leaving correlated rings in the cosmic microwave background (see here). another idea suggests that if we live in a multiverse, certain types of black holes are more likely (see here). but if such predictions are not confirmed, then this merely means we do not live in a multiverse with these particular properties.\n\nlet me also add that these examples of predictive multiverses are ad hoc constructs invented for the very reason of convincing skeptics that some types of multiverses can have observable consequences. don't fall for it. just because a theory is falsifiable doesn't mean it's scientific. for a theory to be scientific its predictions must also have a reasonable chance to accurately describe reality. construing up one of an infinite number of multiverse variants has no reasonable chance.\n\ntheoreticians justify their multiverse research by claiming that it continues the noble quest for simplicity. but as we have seen, this argument is wrong because it neglects the need to introduce a probability distribution on the multiverse. the multiverse replaces a simple explanation with a more complicated one. such a move is only justified if the added complication explains additional data, but for the multiverse that isn't so.\n\nwhy then has the idea become popular? a cynic may argue it's because the multiverse offers infinitely many new opportunities for paper writing. but i don't want to feign hypotheses.\n\nlet me thus stick to the facts: to our best knowledge, assuming the existence of any universe besides our own is unnecessary to explain anything we have ever observed. in the best case, then, the multiverse is an interpretation.\n\nyou can believe that the seeming arbitrariness of the constants of nature is due to an infinite number of other universes. you can believe that, but you don't have to. science cannot confirm that the other universes exist, but it also cannot rule them out. just like science cannot rule out the gods and angels.
joint session of congress will tally states' november election votes\n\nlawmakers meet wednesday to formally count the electoral college votes. about a dozen senate republicans, and a large group of house gop lawmakers, will object, but that will not change the outcome.\n\nnoel king, host:\n\nit's a win in georgia for reverend raphael warnock, now senator-elect. he will be the first black senator from the state. he defeated republican kelly loeffler in one of two pivotal senate races happening in georgia. earlier this morning, he declared victory.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nraphael warnock: i am going to the senate to work for all of georgia no matter who you cast your vote for in this election.\n\nking: now, the second race between republican david perdue and democrat jon ossoff is too close to call at this point. if ossoff wins, democrats will control the senate. also happening today, the lawmakers currently in congress will certify joe biden's presidential win. even though there's no doubt about the results, some republicans plan to object, meaning they will go on the record voting to overturn a democratic election - whew. npr congressional correspondent kelsey snell is covering all of this. good morning, kelsey.\n\nkelsey snell, byline: good morning.\n\nking: so the races in georgia were both close. warnock pulled off a win. what do we learn from georgia?\n\nsnell: you know, the polling showed really close races heading into these runoff elections. and democrats work consistently on turnout, particularly on the early vote. you know, this race really depended on their voters showing up in huge numbers. and republicans going into this worried that president trump's messaging on election fraud and his fights with the georgia secretary of state and, you know, his talk on twitter would repress republican turnout. and like you said, balance of the power in the senate hangs on the remaining race between ossoff and perdue. if they wind up within a half a percent, that could possibly lead to a recount. that would mean the senate can't really get underway until georgia is finalized.\n\nking: what would a democrat-controlled senate mean for joe biden?\n\nsnell: you know, this last senate seat really does change everything if ossoff wins. there is a 50-50 senate. and vice president-elect kamala harris would break any tie. his win would mean democrats control which bills get a vote, which committees consider things, basically how the senate operates entirely. it's a significant power. but it also puts a lot of pressure on ideological divides within the democratic party. you know, moderate democrats have shown a willingness to work across the aisle. and a narrow split could favor them. but progressives have a long list of priorities if democrats were to recapture full control in washington.\n\nking: ok. so a lot is still up in the air in georgia but not with respect to the presidential election. joe biden did win. congress today will certify his victory. how does that process work?\n\nsnell: yeah. so the basics are that vice president mike pence will preside over these proceedings alongside house speaker nancy pelosi. republicans will have the chance to object to each state individually. and we expect that to start with arizona. texas senator ted cruz and a group of others will start their objections there. and i'm told they plan to focus on calls for an electoral commission, not setting aside the election result. we hear that there are about six states that could be at issue. though, it could be more, it could be less. and it could drag on all night because each objection opens them up to hours of debate. you know, congress is expected to vote to certify the states with little trouble in the end. and we understand that vice president pence intends, as we are told, to follow the law as he presides.\n\nking: and it's worth noting that republicans are split over this, with many of them saying to their colleagues, look; it's done.\n\nsnell: yeah. about two dozen senate republicans are expected to join all of the democrats in easily voting down these objections. republicans are split. and, partially, it's about deciding who they are as a party in a post-trump era. there are divisions about culture wars and policy fights and real deep concerns about extreme positions and conspiracy theories that have taken root in some elements of the party, including among some members of congress. you know, supporters of president trump have gathered in d.c. for days of protest. and much of the downtown core of the city is just shut down to traffic as a result. you know, the protests are based on trump's false claims of election fraud, mixed with conspiracy theories and other misinformation. it is a scene that is so tense that d.c. officials have called in the national guard to be on standby. so there's a lot of churn happening in washington right now.\n\nking: yeah, a lot, indeed. npr congressional correspondent kelsey snell.\n\nthanks, kelsey.\n\nsnell: thanks so much for having me.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
'playboy' snaps out of its never-nude phase\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption gavin bond/playboy via ap gavin bond/playboy via ap\n\none year after removing full-frontal nudity from its pages, playboy is returning to its roots. naked is normal, the magazine announces on the cover of its march/april 2017 issue. the cover also omits a long-used tagline: entertainment for men.\n\ncooper hefner, playboy's chief creative officer who's also the son of magazine founder hugh hefner, says that the evolution of the magazine is a reflection of how the brand can best connect with my generation and generations to come.\n\non the decision to remove the phrase entertainment for men from the cover, hefner said, playboy will always be a lifestyle brand focused on men's interests, but as gender roles continue to evolve in society, so will we.\n\nthe change could mean that playboy, in its return to printing photos of unclad people, will also have to return to cladding itself in plastic wrap on newsstands. it was able to shed that wrap last february.\n\nin an updated form of the playboy philosophy columns his father wrote, hefner emphasized the magazine's long-running attempts to promote a healthy conversation about sex while also encouraging dialogue on social, philosophical and religious opinions.\n\ncomments on that posting were largely enthusiastic.\n\nglad nudity is back, as it should be, one reads in part.\n\nanother states, i've been a decade long subscriber to playboy magazine and stopped when they ended the nudity and the articles went full hipster.\n\nthat commenter signed off with, make playboy great again!\n\nfirst launched in the 1950s, playboy surprised many when it announced in late 2015 that it planned to cut out nudity.\n\nat the time, the magazine, which had watched its circulation drop to around 800,000, said it was making an effort to grow up. it was also adjusting to a media landscape in which nudity is commonplace online — but is tightly restricted by most social media platforms, which have become vital outlets for many publishers, no matter their content.\n\nhere's how writer charlie warzel described it for npr when the change was announced:\n\nplayboy seems to sort of exist in this middle ground, this ill-defined place where, you know, you have a lot of the adult entertainment, which is very sort of hard core and caters to the fringes and is not mainstream at all. and then you have, you know, the other side of playboy's enterprise, which is this culture and lifestyle section. you know, it came up in the '50s as what the cultured, sophisticated, suave man might read — a real sort of esquire-like lifestyle publication. and then, you now, as it's evolved, it's kind of become a character of itself. so i think it's trying to get back to its roots as, you know, as a culture publication.
bloomberg promises $15 million to help make up for u.s. withdrawal from climate deal\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption christophe ena/ap christophe ena/ap\n\nmichael bloomberg is pledging to fill a funding gap created by president trump's decision to withdraw from the paris climate accord, offering up to $15 million to support the u.n. agency that helps countries implement the agreement.\n\namericans will honor and fulfill the paris agreement by leading from the bottom up — and there isn't anything washington can do to stop us, said bloomberg, the former new york city mayor who now serves as the u.n.'s special envoy on cities and climate change.\n\nmayors, governors, and business leaders from both political parties are signing [on to] a statement of support that we will submit to the u.n., bloomberg said, and together, we will reach the emission reduction goals the u.s. made in paris in 2015.\n\ndozens of cities have said they are committed to the paris climate accord, with at least 86 mayors signing a statement saying they will adopt and uphold the agreement's goals.\n\nunder the paris accord, the u.s. sent some $1 billion to the green climate fund that is guided by the u.n. framework convention on climate change — the body that coordinates international climate policy. the u.s. was supposed to provide an additional $2 billion, but trump has balked at that idea, and his proposed budget includes cuts to international climate programs.\n\nbloomberg's plan calls for his foundation to work with other groups, from governments to philanthropies, that want to support the u.n.'s climate change agency.\n\nwe are grateful to bloomberg philanthropies for this generous contribution, unfccc executive secretary patricia espinosa said in a news release about the funding pledge.\n\nwhile government funding remains vital, espinosa said, this kind of support is crucial for the work of the secretariat to assist nations in their efforts to implement their commitments under the paris climate change agreement.\n\nthe announcement follows trump's decision to pull out of the climate deal that nearly 200 nations agreed to in late 2015. as npr has reported, the only other countries not part of the agreement are syria, which is in the midst of a civil war, and nicaragua, which argued that the paris accord did not go far enough to curb global emissions.\n\nthe architects of the paris agreement included christiana figueres, who until recently led the unfccc.\n\nafter the u.s. withdrawal from the paris deal sparked pledges of money and solidarity, figueres said via twitter on friday, thank you trump. you have provoked an unparalleled wave of support for paris and determined resolve on climate action. deeply grateful.

it can require doing a quick lab test on the go.\n\nakvo (esperanto for 'water') is a nonprofit foundation that provides software and services for disadvantaged populations, with a focus on water management.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tom baas tom baas\n\nconducting a breakout session during world water week in stockholm last year, akvo's bjelkeman-pettersson demonstrated the mobile-phone-enabled water-quality tests that their lab in bengaluru uses. one kit contains a simple strip test, say for ph or phosphates. another consists of a collection jar and a reactant chemical that can test for fluoride — a big problem in india and bangladesh. there, too much fluoride in the drinking water has led to mass fluorosis, a condition that leads to calcification of ligaments.\n\nthis [fluoride] test on a mobile phone is of equivalent quality as an ion selector device used in the lab; the difference is this cheaper and portable, bjelkeman-pettersson says. the data is calibrated, interpreted and sent to the cloud with time stamps and gps markers. the test can be extended to check chlorine, bacteria levels in the water, and, soon, arsenic — another big problem in the indian subcontinent.\n\nsaikiran gaddam, an engineering student in hyderabad, was one of 11 akvo volunteers who spent 10 days last year in the field — in the rural nalgonda district about 60 miles from the city — testing 240 wells, streams, ponds and water filtration plants. armed with gloves and a small kit the size of four decks of cards, they did basic tests for five hours a day out in the hot sun. the akvo app on their mobile phones let them log, map, and upload data on contamination and chemical run off.\n\nwe came to know ground realities, gaddam says. we saw the pipeline connections, how water is getting polluted, we saw how the villagers live and what they have to face.\n\nthe drinking water options in this part of india are limited. local water sources may be toxic because of runoff from industries, for example. if water is delivered from a filtration plant, it could lack minerals.\n\nbut the local administration and police department of nalgonda were responsive: the water authorities promised to monitor the filtration plant and close off contaminated wells.\n\nwe fill a vacuum, says gaddam. with our help, citizens can hold the government accountable.\n\nhe admits there are limitations. citizen observatories are not labs, though their trainers work to put checks, balances and cross-references to keep the data as reliable as possible — and to keep the people safe.\n\nthere also are some concerns about putting the data in the cloud.\n\nwhen data is collected in india, it is not only about water and sanitation but also demographics, says das of water integrity network. the information can also be used to see if a lower caste doesn't have the same access to water and sanitation as high castes do.\n\nand many studies show that minority communities don't have access, says das of water integrity network.\n\nit's important for the data to get the right kind of attention, proponents say. ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires serving the unreached and underserved in remote and difficult areas, says allakulov. walking the last mile and extending safe drinking water to those at the base of the pyramid may be just the avenue that will benefit greatly from citizen-led water quality monitoring\n\nsankarnarayan with the climatix app remains hopeful. her mantra: what we can measure, we can manage.\n\nchhavi sachdev is a freelance reporter in india. you can reach her @chhavi. this story was reported partially through a grant from siwi at world water week, 2016.
our state of disunion: will delaying trump's big speech help end the shutdown too?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption win mcnamee/getty images win mcnamee/getty images\n\nupdated jan. 24 at 10 p.m. et\n\nit was nearly midnight wednesday when president trump sent the tweet saying he would wait to deliver his great state of the union speech until after the government is fully reopened.\n\nthat came as a relief to those who had taken seriously his threat to come to the capitol on jan. 29 as originally planned, with or without the blessing of house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif. no sooner had trump threatened to come ahead than pelosi made clear just how unwelcome he would be, until the partial government shutdown was over.\n\nsome had visions of trump and a squad of secret service agents barging their way in, no doubt to the cheers of republican members of congress.\n\n\n\nnone of that was ever likely to happen. but the vision of it was dark, indeed. the fact is that the speaker can withhold house consent to the joint congressional resolution by which the president is empowered to speak. so barging in would be a breach of more than protocol.\n\n\n\nhours later, in that late-night tweet, the president backed down. tensions eased. some read that as a sign the stalled negotiations over homeland security (read: the president's desire for $5 billion in funding to build a wall or barrier on the border with mexico) might be revived. by the end of thursday, the senate leaders of the two parties were talking to each other again.\n\nbut that was after test votes on the two parties' dueling proposals to reopen the government had failed on the senate floor earlier in the day. the democrats' plan attracted six republican votes but still fell eight votes shy of the three-fifths majority required to advance the bill. the gop alternative, based on the proposal trump offered over the weekend, fell 10 votes shy and had the support of a single democratic senator.\n\n\n\nby thursday evening, the white house was reported to be preparing language for a declaration of a national emergency, a tactic that had been mentioned before but that trump has so far chosen not to pursue.\n\nit's hard to find anything good to say about a government shutdown — especially the longest one in u.s. history. but at least we all know more now about something we all took for granted: the president's annual state of the union speech to congress in the capitol.\n\n\n\nfar more americans now know that the state of the union address, or sotu as some call it, does not need to be a speech, does not need to be delivered in person, does not need to be annual and does not need to happen in the capitol.\n\n\n\nthe only thing required by the constitution (article ii, section 3) is that the president shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\n\nthat's it. rather vague, as are many parts of the constitution, which was, after all, a series of compromises among negotiators who were suspicious of each other and suspicious of government in general.\n\nmuch of what we assume about this giving of information has been established by custom. president george washington decided a report each year made sense, and he also gave the first sotu to congress in person in 1790 in federal hall in new york city, the seat of the fledgling u.s. government at the time.\n\nwashington's in-person delivery was continued by his successor, john adams. but in 1801, the third u.s. president, thomas jefferson, decided the in-person speech was not for him. jefferson disliked the similarities between this address and the manner in which the king of england in those days addressed opening sessions of parliament to deliver his marching orders. (some say jefferson also disliked his own public speaking voice.)\n\nin any event, the custom of a written speech took hold and prevailed for more than a century. it was not until woodrow wilson arrived in 1913 that the notion of in-person delivery was revived.\n\nwilson was a progressive democrat and princeton professor who apparently liked the idea of getting up to lecture in front of congress. it was his improvement on the example of theodore roosevelt, who several years earlier had begun making the annual address a muscular agenda — rather than just a rundown on what was happening around the government.\n\nso, just maybe, a delay makes sense now with the government partially shut down. (we had one in 1986 after the space shuttle challenger blew up.)\n\nor, just maybe, having this annual shindig just the way we have always have had it does not make sense anymore.\n\nthere is a growing sense in america that old ways of doing things do not always make sense anymore. that applies to the way we go shopping or go to the movies or go to school, all of which we can do now without going anywhere.\n\nhide caption president franklin d. roosevelt adresses a joint session of congress as speaker sam rayburn, left, and vice president john n. garner, look on. with world war ii looming, roosevelt used his 1941 address to outline the four freedoms, freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. previous next ap\n\nhide caption president lyndon b. johnson delivers his state of the union address to a joint session of congress in 1964. speaking in the house of representatives, the chief executive said one of his aims was unconditional war on poverty in america. previous next ap\n\nhide caption president bill clinton gives his state of the union address in 1996 on capitol hill. previous next denis paquin/ap\n\nhide caption president george w. bush flanked by vice president dick cheney (left) and speaker of the house dennis hastert, delivers his second state of the union address in 2003 at the capitol building in washington d.c. president bush emphasized the importance of disarming saddam hussein, one year after he declared iraq to be part of an axis of evil. previous next martinez monsivais/getty images 1 of 4 i view slideshow\n\nso what about this thing, the sotu? is it something everyone really has to physically attend, or is there an adaptation available? could this annual monster meetup near the national mall just, well, go away?\n\nwould we miss the hour-plus of speechifying and unspontaneous ovations from one side of the aisle or the other? would we be the poorer without those hours of pregame and postgame punditry?\n\nto be sure, something would be lost if the one truly bipartisan, bicameral, multibranch and multi-everything confab of the year disappears from the nation's capital.\n\nbut, for roughly half of our history, this ritual did not require anyone to go anywhere.\n\nfor more than 100 years, it was understood that a president's annual report to congress would be a written document sent up to the capitol. that's how things were from the time of jefferson in the beginning of the 19th century until wilson's arrival early in the 20th century.\n\ndue to ill health, wilson went back to mailing it in for the last two years he was president. warren harding did two sotu addresses in person before dying in office. calvin coolidge gave his first in 1923 in person and allowed it to be broadcast on the radio. then coolidge went back to the written report, which herbert hoover also favored.\n\nbut starting with franklin roosevelt, the full value of the sotu was appreciated and expanded upon. fdr used it to proclaim his four freedoms, lbj to announce his war on poverty and richard nixon to say one year of watergate is enough.\n\nin the 1930s, the radio microphone became a fixture, followed by one for tv in 1947. and the presumption took hold that the president was addressing not only congress but an entire nation — listening and watching on an ever-expanding array of electronic devices.\n\nthe sotu itself has become a kind of electronic device and one of the most powerful a president has.\n\nover the years, there must have been times when capitol hill leaders wished they could lift that powerful device deftly from the hands of the president and put it on a shelf. but even those speakers of the house most at loggerheads with a president have felt they had to issue the routine invitation and sit there and take it. to do otherwise would have been unthinkable.\n\nuntil now.\n\nso what will happen next?\n\nthursday the president said basically it's up to pelosi. it's really her choice, trump said, i would have done it in a different place but i think that would be very disrespectful to the state of the union — to pick some other place. i could have done it. i could have gone to a big auditorium and gotten 25,000 people in one day.\n\nthe president added: but i think that would be very disrespectful to the state of the union. so what she said i thought was actually reasonable: we'll have the state of the union when the shutdown is over.\n\nasked when that might be, trump replied with that i can't tell you, that i can't tell you. but, we have a lot of alternatives — but we need border security.\n\nhouse republican leaders had speculated last week that another venue on the hill (like the gop-controlled senate chamber) might be found anytime the president of the united states wishes to speak. and surely that's true. and this week trump received multiple offers from gop governors who offered up their statehouses as alternative sites.\n\nbut does it make sense to do this speech at this time in any other place than the house floor? or — as trump seemed to concede this week in bowing to pelosi — does a change from the traditional venue sap too much of the tradition, glory and grandeur?\n\nand as long as we are asking questions, let us return to one posed a moment ago: does it make sense to gather all these people at once the way we do, largely to project a false sense of unity?\n\nperhaps the best answer is another question: would we be better off with no national show of unity at all?
planned parenthood president leana wen on trump administration title x changes\n\nnpr's lulu garcia-navarro talks with leana wen, a physician and the president of planned parenthood, about how a rule change from the trump administration on title x will affect her organization.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nplanned parenthood, long the target of social conservatives, could lose a significant portion of its funding under a new trump administration rule released on friday. the rule will cut federal funding from organizations that make referrals for abortions or provide the procedure. this is a win for anti-abortion activists who pressured lawmakers to defund organizations with ties to abortion.\n\nbut critics say it will hurt lower-income women who depend upon family planning centers that receive what are known as title x funds. leana wen is a physician and the president of planned parenthood, and she joins us now.\n\nwelcome to weekend edition.\n\nleana wen: thank you, lulu - good to be with you.\n\ngarcia-navarro: you call these changes to the title x program a gag rule. explain.\n\nwen: this is a gag rule because what president trump is doing is to put a gag on doctors like me to prevent us from providing our patients with full and accurate medical information. so if you are a woman who goes to a health center that receives public funding, you cannot be referred to abortion care, even if your life depends on it. this gag rule is unethical and unconscionable.\n\ni mean, imagine if the trump administration issued a rule that forbid doctors from telling our patients about their options for any other aspect of health care. it's a direct interference with the practice of medicine and with our ethical obligation to our patients. and this is why over 100 medical and public health organizations oppose the gag rule, including the american medical association, the american nurses association and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists.\n\ngarcia-navarro: i've read that you won't accept funds under the new rules.\n\nwen: planned parenthood will never force our doctors and nurses to compromise their ethics. we will never let politicians censor our health care providers and erode the trust that our patients have placed in us, which is to provide them with compassionate, judgment-free and comprehensive care. that's our promise to our patients.\n\ngarcia-navarro: but you could receive federal funds if you separated abortion services from family planning centers. the new rules say there needs to be clear physical and financial separation between government-funded services and abortion-related services.\n\nwen: this title x gag rule isn't about providing good medical care. it only does one thing, which is to restrict patients' access to reproductive health care. it has no basis in medicine or science. and the only effect is going to be preventing 4 million americans from receiving basic health care, including breast and cervical cancer screenings, affordable birth control and sti tests.\n\ngarcia-navarro: religiously affiliated groups are hoping to get the money instead. conservatives say this provides good alternatives to women.\n\nwen: we should talk about what is evidence-based, science-based methods for ensuring that all people have access to the health care that they need. title x is our nation's program for affordable birth control and health care. and this program is intended to ensure that people with low incomes who live in rural areas or who don't have health insurance still have access to cancer screenings and preventive care.\n\nand i think it's important to talk about the individuals who it will affect the most. it will disproportionately affect those who already face the greatest barriers to care. it's women of color and families of low income. and we need to talk about the discrimination involved here because if you are wealthy and you have private insurance, you can still get the best medical care.\n\ngarcia-navarro: but religious groups say they could provide those alternatives, that they feel like they too deserve these funds so that there isn't a monopoly on care.\n\nwen: look. i'm a doctor and a scientist. and i need to do what's best for my patients based on medicine and science. and what we have done for nearly 50 years through title x is to follow the best available medicine and science. title x is recognized to be one of the most successful public health programs in reducing sexually transmitted infections and reducing unintended pregnancies. this is what works.\n\ngarcia-navarro: leana wen is the president of planned parenthood. thank you very much.\n\nwen: thanks so much, lulu. and thank you for your time.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
first mention: computer scientists develop 'virtual reality'\n\nour first mention feature finds the phrase virtual reality on all things considered on aug. 8, 1989.\n\nari shapiro, host:\n\nvirtual reality headsets have finally hit the consumer market. we wondered when that phrase - virtual reality - first showed up on npr. it's the perfect candidate for our series...\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified men: first mention.\n\naudie cornish, host:\n\nthis is when we try to track down in our archives the first time a person or concept was heard on our air. now, the search for virtual reality took us to august 8, 1989. that's when our co-host robert siegel introduced a story this way.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nrobert siegel, byline: what science fiction writers have dreamt of for decades, scientists now say is possible, to simulate reality to create with the aid of a computer a lifelike world of the imagination, a place not bound by physical laws or reason. computer scientists call the concept virtual or artificial reality.\n\nshapiro: he was introducing a piece by wbur reporter david baron on a new virtual reality computer system and the man behind that technology.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ndavid baron, byline: one of the greatest proponents of virtual reality is 29-year-old jaron lanier. lanier holds no bachelor's degree or high school diploma, yet some call him a visionary.\n\ncornish: now four years earlier, according to baron, lanier had started vpl research, a california company that builds virtual reality systems. here's lanier describing it.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\njaron lanier: it's basically this new kind of reality. it feels as real as the physical world, but you can change it and you can make it anything you like.\n\nshapiro: the reporter david baron found it took more than just a computer to create this virtual world.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nbaron: making it appear real to people requires special equipment. most importantly a device lanier calls an eyephone.\n\nshapiro: that's an e-y-e - eyephone, oversized goggles with two miniature video monitors inside that produce 3-d images.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nlanier: what happens is as you move your head, the images that you see create this illusion that you're moving around inside an imaginary world that's really there, and the illusion is completely compelling.\n\ncornish: lanier's vr system also included a data glove. the glove allowed users to move objects in the virtual environment. but there were problems with what lanier said the system could do. baron tried it out and reported that the images were blurry and cartoonlike. he also found a noticeable delay between when he turned his head and when the image turned before his eyes. also people were advised to stop the experience after 45 minutes. david baron couldn't even take it that long.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nbaron: after about 15 minutes, i'm feeling disoriented and a tinge queasy. this condition sometimes called simulator sickness.\n\nshapiro: back in 1989, there was another big issue with virtual reality, the cost. the whole rig - headset, computer - it ran a whopping $250,000. jaron lanier's venture into the business of virtual reality did not take off. his company filed for bankruptcy the following year in 1990. but lanier has continued pushing the bounds of science and technology, and in 2010 time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
cbs names legendary producer susan zirinsky as head of news\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption charles sykes/invision/ap charles sykes/invision/ap\n\nthe legendary cbs news producer susan zirinsky will replace david rhodes as the president of cbs news in march, the network announced sunday evening.\n\nrhodes' decision to step down follows a tenure of great change and great turmoil, marked by shifts in personnel and formats, along with bumpy ratings and searing scandal.\n\nthe world we cover is changing, how we cover it is changing, and it's the right time for me to make a change too, rhodes wrote in a statement.\n\nzirinsky, most recently the senior executive producer of the true-crime-driven newsmagazine 48 hours, will be the first woman to head cbs news. she has held significant roles at almost every element throughout the news division. she was a producer of cbs evening news and has led the network's coverage of the white house.\n\naccording to the network, zirinsky has led several special reports, including coverage of the tiananmen square uprising in 1989. cbs was the only major television network to have a news crew broadcasting live from the chinese crackdown on the anti-government protests.\n\nzirinsky is also an admired documentary producer for cbs and its corporate cable sibling, showtime.\n\nrhodes led significant change over eight years as president, during which he sought to evoke the journalistic legacy of the storied network and embrace a no-drama ethos. rhodes emphasized hard news, launched the digital news service cbsn and helped reinvent cbs's morning news show cbs this morning, which won new viewers and critical acclaim.\n\nhe also named new hosts for the sunday morning shows, margaret brennan for face the nation and jane pauley for cbs sunday morning.\n\nother choices fared less well. the replacement of scott pelley with jeff glor as anchor of the cbs evening news caused some internal dissent. it was also accompanied by falling ratings.\n\nthen there were the scandals.\n\nrhodes fired star host charlie rose in the fall of 2017 after accusations of sexual harassment from multiple women. rose had been not just a contributor to 60 minutes but a fixture on the reinvented cbs this morning as well as his eponymous pbs program. the morning show tailed off in the ratings after his departure. (rose apologized for his past conduct but said he does not believe all of the allegations are true.)\n\nrhodes replaced rose on cbs this morning with the well-regarded john dickerson, then host of face the nation, but ratings have tapered off.\n\nin september 2018, rhodes' boss, then-cbs chairman leslie moonves, stepped down as he faced multiple accusations of sexual harassment and assault (which he denies). days later, rhodes fired then-60 minutes executive producer jeff fager, who had sent a threatening message to a cbs journalist reporting on accusations that he tolerated a hostile workplace for women. fager would ultimately face allegations of sexual harassment as well, which he also denied.\n\nmany staffers at 60 minutes angrily defended fager to network executives after his firing.\n\nzirinsky had been strongly considered by rhodes and acting cbs corp. ceo joe ianniello to run 60 minutes, by far the network's most prestigious and most profitable news program. instead, she will oversee the news division, and choosing 60 minutes' top executive will be among her first and most important decisions.\n\nzirinsky is known as a tough leader who inspires loyalty. she also inspired the lead character of the 1987 movie broadcast news, played by holly hunter. she was a consultant on the film.\n\nin real life, zirinsky is to become the network's first female news chief in march.\n\nrhodes will remain as a senior adviser to cbs and cbs news.
first-ever evictions database shows: 'we're in the middle of a housing crisis'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption john moore/getty images john moore/getty images\n\nfor many poor families in america, eviction is a real and ongoing threat. sociologist matthew desmond estimates that 2.3 million evictions were filed in the u.s. in 2016 — a rate of four every minute.\n\neviction isn't just a condition of poverty; it's a cause of poverty, desmond says. eviction is a direct cause of homelessness, but it also is a cause of residential instability, school instability [and] community instability.\n\ndesmond won a pulitzer prize in 2017 for his book, evicted: poverty and profit in the american city. his latest project is the eviction lab, a team of researchers and students at princeton university dedicated to amassing the nation's first-ever database of eviction. to date, the lab had collected 83 million records from 48 states and the district of columbia.\n\nwe're in the middle of a housing crisis, and that means more and more people are giving more and more of their income to rent and utilities, desmond says. our hope is that we can take this problem that's been in the dark and bring it into the light.\n\ninterview highlights\n\nevicted poverty and profit in the american city by matthew desmond paperback, 422 pages | purchase close overlay buy featured book your purchase helps support npr programming. how?\n\non why eviction rates are so high\n\nincomes have remained flat for many americans over the last two decades, but housing costs have soared. so between 1995 and today, median asking rents have increased by 70 percent, adjusting for inflation. so there's a shrinking gap between what families are bringing [in] and what they have to pay for basic shelter.\n\nand then we might ask ourselves: wait a minute, where's public housing here? where's housing vouchers? doesn't the government help? and the answer is, it does help, but only for a small percentage of families. only about 1 in 4 families who qualify for housing assistance get anything. so when we picture the typical low income american today, we shouldn't think of them living in public housing or getting any kind [of] housing assistance for the government, we should think of folks who are paying 60, 70, 80 percent of their income and living unassisted in the private rental market. that's our typical case today.\n\non the effects of eviction\n\neviction comes with a mark that goes on your record, and that can bar you from moving into a good house in a safe neighborhood, but could also prevent you from moving into public housing, because we often count that as a mark against your application. so we push families who get evicted into slum housing and dangerous neighborhoods.\n\nwe have studies that show that eviction is linked to job loss. ... it's such a consuming, stressful event, it causes you to make mistakes at work, lose your footing there, and then there's just the trauma of it — the effect that eviction has on your dignity and your mental health and your physical health. we have a study for example that shows that moms who get evicted experience high rates of depression two years later.\n\non how landlords go about evicting tenants\n\nit varies a lot from city to city. in some places you can evict someone for being a penny short and a day late and the process is very efficient and quick. in other cities it's a lot longer and laborious and it's much more work. we're only also talking about formal evictions, too. these are evictions that go through the court and there are 101 ways for landlords to get a family out. sometimes landlords pay a family to leave. sometimes they change their locks or take their door off, as i witnessed one time in milwaukee. so those evictions aren't even captured in these numbers that we have — which means the estimates that we have are stunning, but they're also too low.\n\non the benefits of stabilizing families and decreasing evictions\n\nthe more i think about this issue, the more i think that we've really had a failure of our imagination — and maybe it's linked to a failure of our compassion. ... when we ask, what can be done if a tenant doesn't pay rent? doesn't that tenant have to be evicted? a thousand things can be done. there's so much better ways of dealing with this issue than we currently do. ...\n\nstabilizing a home has all sorts of positive benefits for a family. the kid gets to finish school. the neighborhood doesn't lose a crucial neighbor. the family gets to root down and get to understand the value of a home and avoid homelessness. and for all of us, i think [we] have to recognize that we're paying the cost of eviction because whatever our issue is, whatever keeps us up at night, the lack of affordable housing sits at the root of that issue. ...\n\nstabilizing a home has all sorts of positive benefits for a family.\n\nwe know that neighborhoods that have more evictions have higher violent crime rates the following year. you can understand why — it rips apart the fabric of a community. we pay for that. the top 5 percent of hospital users consume 50 percent of the health care costs. guess who those people are? they're the homeless and unstably housed. and so i think we can spend smart or we can spend stupid, and so i think addressing the affordable housing crisis is a win for families, for landlords and for the taxpayer.\n\nroberta shorrock and seth kelley produced and edited the audio of this interview. bridget bentz and molly seavy-nesper adapted it for the web.
lynching memorial in alabama remembers the victims of unacknowledged terror\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption brynn anderson/ap brynn anderson/ap\n\nthe national memorial for peace and justice sits on six acres facing the alabama state capital. eight hundred steel blocks hang from the ceiling, bearing the names of 4,400 victims of one of the least-recognized racist atrocities in american history.\n\nthis is the first national memorial to the victims of lynching in the united states and it opens thursday in montgomery, ala.\n\nthe memorial is the vision of bryan stevenson, the founder of the equal justice initiative, a non-profit organization that documented the lynching of thousands of african-americans across the south from 1877 to 1950.\n\none of those victims was wes johnson, who was lynched in tumbleton, ala., in 1937 after being falsely accused of raping a white woman.\n\nfaye walker howell, the distant cousin of johnson who investigated his death for her film, tumbleton road, tells here & now's robin young the memorial is finally bringing to light the mass killings that are fading from the american consciousness.\n\nthe victims had been forgotten about, and so this memorial will bring it to the public attention, she says.it means that the world knows about wes in a good way because they can see that he's actually being recognized for a crime that he didn't commit.\n\neach dangling column is separated by county and lists of the name of each person who was killed there. another exhibit features bell jars filled with dirt from the site of each lynching and also bearing the names of those killed.\n\nstevenson, who was inspired by the holocaust memorial in berlin and the apartheid museum in johannesburg, says he wanted the memorial to capture just how brutal the targeted killing of black people was in jim crow south.\n\nthey lifted these bodies up as a statement to the entire african-american community, stevenson told npr. they wanted to lift up this violence this terror this tragedy for others to see.\n\nthe suspended columns are made of corten steel, which is a material that rusts over time, making them appear like the bloody corpses they are meant to represent. outside the main memorial pavilion, identical steel columns are placed with the goal of inspiring individuals to claim them for display in their respective counties.\n\nmichael murphy, the memorial architect, told here & now's meghna chakrabarti in 2016 that the idea of invoking healing informed the design of the memorial.\n\nwe thought not about just having a statue or a place to visit that would stay the same but one that would change over time, he says. and that very dna of having markers that could be removed from the site and placed in other counties throughout the country where these killings occurred, allowed us to create a memorial that was active — one that would engage the communities where these atrocities that occurred.\n\nstevenson echoed this view when he told cbs this morning in 2016 that he hopes this memorial will force americans to confront the painful legacy of lynching.\n\nwe have created a narrative of denial, stevenson said. we think if we own up to our mistakes, something bad is going to happen to us. we're going to get punished. and i'm not doing these projects because i want to punish america. i want us to be liberated from the chains that this history has created.
transcript: npr's full interview with trump lawyer rudy giuliani\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption saul martinez/getty images saul martinez/getty images\n\nin a wide-ranging interview tuesday in new york with morning edition's steve inskeep and npr justice correspondent ryan lucas, president trump's lawyer, rudy giuliani, talks about investigating joe biden, his work in ukraine and whether trump's actions regarding ukraine were appropriate.\n\nsteve inskeep: it's good to talk with you. i will tell you where we're recording here, obviously. a little bit of this may go out tonight, but the main part will be on tomorrow morning, which is the morning of the expected acquittal of the president.\n\nrudy giuliani: well, i mean, it's going to be quite a 48 hours, right? you've got the state of the union speech tonight, which is always interesting, a very interesting occasion. and then second, we have historic vote, right? how often does the senate — this will be the third time the senate has voted on impeachment, right?\n\npolitics biden probe should follow trump's expected senate acquittal, giuliani says biden probe should follow trump's expected senate acquittal, giuliani says listen · 8:50 8:50\n\nyeah, it's amazing.\n\nand they acquitted johnson, they acquitted clinton. yeah.\n\nwell, let's talk about what we anticipate will be an acquittal. what message should the country take –\n\nthe country should get the message that — two messages. well, i believe as his lawyer and his friend, the message they should get is, because i'm intimately aware of these, he did nothing wrong. the whole ukrainian thing is completely mispresented. and the democrats did do a good job of spinning it to he's trying to hurt joe biden. it has nothing to do with joe biden. believe it or not, it has do with me. i was sitting in my office on november-something, 28th or so, 2018. his name has now been revealed — a former assistant u.s. attorney of mine, former head of the criminal division and the president of a very, very distinguished investigatory firm — bart schwartz called me up and told me that he had a source, very reliable one, who was telling him very, very upsetting and very startling things. and because it came from this source, he took it more seriously. but he said he told me that there was ukrainian interference in the election –\n\nthe 2016 election?\n\nthe 2016 election. there was ukrainian interference in the election that will boggle the mind. he said it almost sounds like the democrats are projecting what they did in ukraine to russia and blaming him for it. but there was complete involvement of the ukrainian government from the president and all — and that joe biden played a material role in it. originally, it was alleged that he helped to launder funds illegally to hillary clinton. i found no evidence of that, i should tell you. but then it was said to me that he — i'm not sure if bart told me this or if he did it, maybe i didn't believe it. then i met with the source after a week of due diligence, of checking him out and spent a lot of time with the source and with bart. and the source told me, first of all, he said, i don't know this of my firsthand knowledge, very honest guy, i don't know it firsthand. but i go to ukraine a lot. i spent a lot of time there. he had a bit of an investigatory background, which i can't — he had a bit of investigatory background, let me just say that. and he said, i've been told by many ukrainians — and now it's so many i can't ignore it — a lot of things. some of it i don't think is true, some of it i think is exaggerated, some of it i think is true, he said. but there's definitely evidence, solid evidence of ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election with democrats, specifically with hillary clinton's campaign. and go back and read the 2017 politico article and say to yourself, why didn't i follow that?\n\noh, that had to do with the ukrainian involvement. let me just ask, though, mayor, about what the president eventually did.\n\nso this starts as an investigation to obtain evidence to help defend president trump against the false charges of collusion. and then it continues as an investigation to defend him against what immediately followed, impeachment. it has never, ever been a focus on joe biden. and it wasn't and i didn't go looking for it. he never went looking for it. it was given to me by ukrainians who had been trying to give it to the united states for a year and been turned away by the fbi and by the department of justice and by the embassy in ukraine.\n\ngranting what you've said, mayor, the president ultimately did make this phone call. and we spoke the other day on the program with lamar alexander, republican senator from tennessee, who's voting for acquittal. but says what the president did was inappropriate, that he did ask for biden to be investigated and hopefully he won't do that again. is lamar alexander right?\n\nno, lamar is wrong. and lamar is a good friend of mine and he's a fine man. except he doesn't know all the facts. he only knows half the facts. a lot of them distorted.\n\nmeaning it was ok for the president to ask joe biden be investigated?\n\nright. biden committed a very serious crime in ukraine. at least there is overwhelming evidence of it.\n\nyou're referring to biden's effort as vice president to have a prosecutor suspected of corruption –\n\noh, more than that. biden was, first of all, bribed by [burisma owner mykola] zlochevsky to do that. zlochevsky is the multi-billionaire, organized criminal who employed his son for five years and gave his son somewhere between $5 and $8 million. some of it in laundered payments. zlochevsky made a deal with biden so that biden would protect his company. and when —\n\ndo you mean hunter biden on the board of burisma?\n\nhe put hunter biden on the board to pay off the bribe. he made a deal with biden --\n\nwhen you say bribe, you mean hunter biden was –\n\nno, no, i'm talking about zlochevsky bribed vice president joseph biden —\n\nhanded him money?\n\npromised him money for hunter. he said to him through intermediaries: we will put hunter biden on the board. we need your protection. i need your protection because the government's going to come after me. that was the deal. direct and indirect. the deal was: should [petro] poroshenko come after burisma — that's the president of ukraine — and take it away from me or try to take it away from me, and should they try to seize my $5 billion that i stole, he didn't go into that kind of detail — the deal was to put hunter on the board, we're going to pay him a huge amount. devon archer, his partner. when i need you to protect me, then you've got to protect me. and it was done through intermediaries.\n\nwhy on earth would joe biden, who was busy being vice president at the time, involve himself with any of that?\n\ni have no idea why did it. i have no idea why he did it. or he may have not talked directly to zlochevsky. and that was zlochevsky's motive. and that's why the money came to him. the important thing is when push came to shove in february of 2016, which is a month that should be studied in great detail because it's the key month, the prosecutor who they said was dormant, corrupt, wasn't investing any case — arrested burisma. so to say the case was inactive is not only a lie, it's proven as a lie from the record. so [ukraine's top prosecutor, viktor] shokin issued a warrant of arrest for the company burisma that substantially interfered with his business. should zlochevsky come back to ukraine he'd be arrested immediately. and the business was effectively shut down. it is not a coincidence that in that month, joe biden called poroshenko four times. never called him four times before. and it's in that month that he got shokin fired. the deal was: protect my company, protect me, protect your son. when push comes to shove if you have to. the push came to shove in february of 2016. on february 2, 2016, the prosecutor — who was said to be doing nothing, the case was dormant, the charges have been debunked — the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant based on substantial facts that burisma had been laundering billions and billions of dollars. some of it to hunter biden. there is a record from latvia to ukraine that settles the whole matter. it says: we have evidence, substantial evidence, and one of the subjects of our investigation, hunter biden, for $14.8 million money laundering scheme that went from ukraine to latvia, latvia to cyprus, somehow belize was involved. and then it went into hunter biden's account. and the only way we got the records of hunter biden's account is because his partner, devon archer, the other guy being paid off, was convicted of insider trading.\n\ni will ask after this later — you're saying you have records of payments to hunter biden?\n\ni put them on the air.\n\nother than his normal payment as a member of the board.\n\n[laughter] it's a been out there for eight months and nobody looks at it. and if you go to rudolphgiulianics.com and go on my episode 3, you can see a copy of the official notice from the latvian government dated february 18, 2016 — no, i'm sorry, yeah 2016.\n\nthat's fine. we'll check it out.\n\nin fact, not only that, i'll show it to you before you leave.\n\nyeah, we'll have a look, absolutely.\n\nit's what i call — if i were prosecuting the case, it gets as close to a smoking gun as you can have. in other words, right in the period of time that joe gets the prosecutor fired, the prosecutor finds out that the son was involved in a $14.8 million money laundering scheme for which he's going to be investigated.\n\nif it was appropriate for the president to ask ukraine's president to investigate joe biden, should he resume that after his acquittal?\n\nis it appropriate for a president of the united states, any president — let's take president trump out because he's treated so unfairly –\n\nlamar alexander said this was an inappropriate thing to do. [crosstalk] you said lamar is wrong. so does that mean the president's actions --\n\nbut i understand why lamar was wrong, he doesn't understand the facts. nobody has --\n\ni'm asking you if the president should go back to that. should he do it again if it was inappropriate?\n\nbiden should be investigated, absolutely, 100%. [crosstalk] for the crime of multiple bribery.and the president of the united states should be involved in that? would you encourage him to go back?\n\nhe's the chief law enforcement officer of the united states. he certainly shouldn't back away from it.\n\nhave you been talking to him about that?\n\ni haven't talked to him about it, about this case in quite a while, but i would have no problem with him doing it. in fact, i'd have a problem with him not doing it. i think he would be saying that joe biden can get away with selling out the united states, making us a fool in the ukraine. do you know from the moment that it was found out that hunter biden had that job, every time joe biden went there, the people of ukraine laughed at him? joe biden would stand up in that stupid way in which he talks, he would say, oh, we should end the corruption in ukraine. people in ukraine would say, ok, let's start with you, joe. how about you get your kid off that no-show job? now, everybody knew it because in december — december 8th, 2015 — james risen, who now wishes he didn't write this, wrote an article for the new york times blasting the conflict, basically saying, how could joe biden, who's giving billions out to this country that's bankrupt, how could he put his son into a phony job with the most crooked guy in ukraine? and he said he was getting a reasonable amount of money. risen was misled, he didn't even know the amount of money that — he had no idea he was making a million dollars a year and his company was making $2 million. he had no idea. he had no idea that some of that money was laundered.\n\ndo you view the senate acquittal, assuming that goes ahead as expected, as a vindication?\n\nabsolutely. it's a total vindication. some of the senators know why they're doing it. some of the senators are doing it because the president is completely innocent. he did exactly the right thing, exactly what an american president should do. and that is if a former vice president, united states has corrupted the united states, has corrupted another country, he shouldn't get away with it just because he's a former vice president –\n\nsome of the senators are saying this is certainly is not impeachable, but he should not have done that.\n\nsome don't know all the facts. when they know all the facts, they are going to be even — is prouder a word? they're going to be even prouder of their vote.\n\nthere are obviously some loose ends here. there are federal court proceedings. lev parnas was in court just this week. what do you think about when you read news stories and parnas is described as an associate of yours?\n\nwell, first of all, i never have trouble with the truth. that's true, he was. i'll go further, he was a friend of mine. and i loved his family and probably him. i made a mistake. i made a mistake of judgment in lev. i didn't know — i was warned by some people, but i felt about him like he was telling me the truth. he was so enthusiastic about wanting to help. he was so enthusiastic about the president and about the good things the president is doing. he was so enthusiastic about this, that the only hope for ukraine to straighten itself out is if we get to the bottom of this. and his partner, igor fruman, i also love and care about, and igor, of course, is saying the total opposite, but nobody's paying attention to it over what lev parnas is saying. almost everything lev parnas has said, his partner, igor fruman has contradicted. because lev is making up, in many cases, stories that are so palpably untrue that he's hurting himself.\n\nis it accurate when parnas says, as he has, that he was not just a client of yours, he was working for you to gather information and was also working for the president?\n\nhe was not working for the president. i mean, i asked him for help, like on a friends basis. he was my client. that's how it began. he, igor and several other people at a company — and they were developing a fraud detection program [crosstalk] — fraud guarantee. yeah, actually, i always thought it was a bad name. and ultimately when they developed it, i recommended them changing the name. but i worked, i did work for them in helping to develop that company, largely because the underlying software they were using is one that i'm very familiar with for 10 years. and know probably as well as anybody knows it in the country. that started the relationship. then it came about that we both were very, all three of us were very enthusiastic republicans. we genuinely believe, whether people agree or not, the president is doing a miraculous job, haven't seen a president do this much since ronald reagan, and i think he's ahead of ronald reagan. but in any — and i'm delighted because i supported him when a lot of people didn't. and he's been a friend for 29 years. and think he's going to be one of the great presidents. and they were sympathetic with the idea that he was being treated very unfairly —\n\nand he says that when he talked to you, sometimes the president would be on the phone, that he would hear the president on the phone.\n\nhe never spoke to the president at all, but one time —\n\nhe would hear you talking to the president?\n\nhe would have heard me begin a conversation and then walk away.\n\nthat's exactly what's he describes.\n\nhere's what would happen. i would know it's the white house.  'the president would like to speak to you.' ok, thank you. and i'd go in that room in there.\n\nthat did not mean he was working directly for the president, is what you're saying?\n\nwell, he wasn't working directly for the president, he was working for me --\n\nyou were working in your capacity for the president –\n\nall right. so, you can — you can — i don't know what that means. you tell me what the conclusion is. i had to find people in ukraine. i couldn't use the fbi because the witnesses had been trying the fbi for a year, and right or wrong, the witnesses — that amount to about, now, 12 people — were convinced the fbi was corrupt because they were convinced that the fbi agent in the kiev embassy was corrupt. and they had tried to go to the fbi and you'll see on my interviews that one of them says he went to an fbi agent, he names a specific fbi agent, and the fbi agent basically said, you know, don't bother. nobody is interested in this. they attempted to go to the justice department and talk with a lawyer that laid out biden's criminality and the collusion, criminality. and they were turned away. again, the impression they got was all they were interested in was getting trump.\n\nso they came to me, right or wrong, i was their last resort. they came to me. they gave me all this evidence. i didn't go looking for it, i didn't know about it. and i needed someone in ukraine to help me find people. if i went to ukraine by myself, i mean –\n\nyou'd be lost, sure.\n\ni'm well known in ukraine. i'd have 500 reporters following me around. i couldn't do any investigation. so i sent them specifically to find prosecutor general viktor shokin, former prosecutor general viktor shokin, who i always have considered the chief witness, and to find the present prosecutor general then, the prosecutor yuriy lutsenko. and also two other witnesses, the assistant to shokin, a gentleman named konstantin kulik and the head of the special prosecutor's office, a man named nazar kholodnysky. very hard names to pronounce. but once you get used to it it's a little easier. and over a course of about a month, they found two of them for me. and they went to ukraine on their own. they found them. they called me up. i talked to either their relatives or friends on the phone. mr. prosecutor-general lutsenko would have no trouble coming here because he was a government official and he said he was coming to visit his son anyway in late january and he'd visit with me. and shokin wanted to come. shokin went to apply for a visa. he was turned down. i tried to help him with a visa. i was told, you can't get involved with a visa. then i was told by other sources from ukraine that it's well-known that ambassador marie yovanovitch has over the last year been turning down visas for anyone who has information about what happened during the 2016 collusion because her embassy was involved in it. that proved to be true. there are now five witnesses ready, willing and able to go under oath and testify to that. and they're still being denied visas by ambassador taylor, who you saw very piously on the stand testifying. he's denying visas to people who have material evidence of democrat corruption.\n\nhe's been removed, i think, for that position. there's someone else in charge of affairs in ukraine. but i want to get to the bottom line here.\n\nwell, he was also doing it.\n\nyou have framed your interest in former vice president biden as looking into to that 2016 and past corruption. however, you were on fox the other day and you said, quote, i started investigating biden two years ago when he was thinking about running for president.\n\nyeah.\n\naren't you saying there, on video, that this was about the 2020 election?\n\nno, just the opposite, i was pointing out that –\n\nbut he thinking about running for president.\n\nok. so you don't investigate somebody cause they're thinking about running for president?\n\ndid you say that? i said it's about 2020.\n\nno. you have turned around the total meaning of what i meant by that.\n\nplease explain, go ahead.\n\nwhat i meant — then i went on to explain that what that means is that i would not have thought of it and connected it to the presidency. he was only thinking about it. he wasn't running. i'm not going to feel prohibited from investigating someone who's thinking about running for president two years later. and i don't know if i went on to say what i usually say, which is i didn't think he'd run for the presidency because it looked to me like he couldn't cross a street without stumbling. i mean, the guy looks like he was over the hill. the guy was over the hill. and i said to myself, if he runs for president, he's an old fool. he's not capable of it. and i also said to myself, this i did not express, i said to myself, because i knew what donald trump's schedule did to hillary clinton. in fact, i predicted her collapse on september 11 of 2016. do you know that? i predicted it for a week. i said if she goes to that ceremony --\n\noh, you don't mean her electoral collapse. you mean her physical collapse because she had pneumonia.\n\ni mean when she fell down going into the car. i had an instinct it was gonna happen because i'd seen her at those events at other times, they're very grueling. you stand up for a long time and it tends to be humid. anybody could get a little — and i knew she was weak, and i said, i bet she's gonna collapse. and she did. biden will not be able to keep up with the pace that this man keeps. i mean, he's — i don't sleep much, and he doesn't sleep much, and man, he campaigns like a whirling dervish.\n\ncan you help me understand the connection between your investigations and the phone call that the president ultimately made. did he ask the president of ukraine for help with biden because of you? or was he directing you, the president of the united states?\n\nthe president — well, the president always makes the decisions based on the information that he gets. we had been talking about — when i first learned about it, i didn't tell the president right away because it was hearsay. and in fact, when i first heard about biden, i didn't believe it. my first expression was, i don't know if i said bull, but i said, can't be. i've known joe for a long time.\n\nthank you for cleaning that up.\n\ni know joe for a long time. i kind of like him. his niece worked for me for six years. i think he's kind of dopey. always have. but not a bad guy. he was a guy you could work with. i mean, i helped pass a crime bill, that he walked away from now, with him and with chuck schumer.\n\nin the '90s, yeah.\n\nand i have a letter from bill clinton saying i was one of the most instrumental in getting it passed. the other two people would have been chuck schumer and him. but then when i saw the council on foreign relations interview, and i saw what he said, i said, oh my god. he committed bribery and he's admitting it. and he's even worse because he doesn't mention that his son is involved. and he has to have known his son was involved. so now he's added, he offered a thing of value, $1 billion loan guarantee, to affect the official action of the president of the ukraine firing the prosecutor. there's only one other thing you need now. you need to prove corruption. the corrupt intent is to get his son off the hook if his son is under investigation.\n\nbut then my question is, are you the one who brought this to the president's attention?\n\nabsolutely. sure.\n\ndid he make that phone call because of you?\n\nby that time, he had acquired information about ukrainian corruption way beyond what i knew. so i would say that was a — i don't know. you'd have to ask to president the operation of his mind. all i can tell you is that by that time, he was much more educated on ukrainian corruption.\n\nand at that point, was he directing you? saying, rudy, i want you to go find more. i need more information.\n\nno. he wasn't directing me. i mean, i pretty much was acting on my own instincts, my investigatory instincts, which go back a few years. i mean, i was pretty good at it. i would investigate, and if it proved important enough, i'd come to him. if not, you know, i'd just have it in my files as something to be followed up later. but by the time you get to that telephone call, the president of the united states had been briefed by many, many sources on ukraine. and he had an overall view of ukraine that was superior to mine, because when i had arranged to go see president-elect zelenskiy, i spoke to some of the people who advised him — actually i looked at notes that were provided to me and they had a lot more information about ukraine than i did. and the reason i didn't go is because they had leaked my visit to the press. he was gonna have two people there who, if you look in our files, are very seriously corrupted people.\n\nthis is may of 2019?\n\nyeah. and it was our conclusion that they were trying to set me up. he was involved with one man — he was involved with one man who was the lawyer and one of the chief associates of someone who basically stole the biggest bank in ukraine. walked out with $7 billion. and the fear was that he was around zelenskiy to protect that guy. and then he had another man with him who worked closely with george soros, whose organization antac was substantially involved in obtaining a lot of the illegal information to hurt trump, manafort, trump junior in the campaign.\n\ndo you feel that you know ukraine well?\n\nbetter than most and not as well as some.\n\nhow many times have you been there?\n\nin my life?\n\nyeah.\n\nthe first time i went there was 2003.\n\nyou were involved in — your company was involved in security for a city –\n\ni was invited. actually, it was a speaking engagement for the washington speakers bureau. i was invited there to speak to all the former prime ministers of ukraine. it was a very, it was a gathering. and then i was invited to tour the country and to do meetings with local officials, to talk, to give them my experience in how to govern. it was more about local government, about mayors, about how to run cities, which usually i talk about more than president since i never obtained that office. but in this case, i got to speak to all the prime ministers. i became very friendly with a few people. became very friendly with viktor yushchenko, who was the first person who won after the revolution and was the hope of ukraine and a man who was almost killed by putin. he was poisoned and almost killed. tragedy. and i think, you know, you can't — i think had viktor been healthy, he would have turned the country around. and then i was — i became very friendly with vitali klitschko through john mccain. john was a good friend of his. a lot of the information i originally got about ukraine i got from john because john was a very big expert on ukraine. we hadn't run against each other yet, although we remained close friends even after i ran against him. john briefed me — i remember a particular dinner i had with john late on a friday afternoon. we spent two hours going over ukraine and it was a weekend and i said, john, what are you doing for the weekend? he said, i'm going to iraq. i said you really are a character--\n\ntypical weekend trip for john mccain.\n\n-- you're going to iraq for the weekend.\n\nthis is where i'm going with this. as you know very well, your critics have said mayor giuliani has been misled. he doesn't really know the country. he may not really know the backgrounds of the people who were giving him information, doesn't know his sources very well. how do you respond to that?\n\nprobably exaggerated that i don't know the country well. i think i know the country well. i've been there a lot. could i have been, could i be misled by sources? of course i could. anybody can. and then you've got to correct it. i mean, i try when i get a source i try to corroborate them. i don't just take a source at his word. so even this source that came to me and said that biden was bribed, that they were collecting dirty information on trump. that the black book was a close to a forgery, that it wasn't done really to prosecute manafort, it was really done to have a big event to try to knock trump out of the election. it was all orchestrated for that.\n\nthis is the black ledger — [crosstalk]\n\nblack ledger, which purports to be a group of bribes of which manafort is supposed to have signed for it. and then there was a big press conference held to try to blow it up. and the witnesses who i have say that this was an orchestrated effort to get him to drop out, to show how corrupt his campaign manager was. and they were quite certain they were gonna get him. one operative of the dnc told one of my witnesses the plan in may. it played itself out. and then mr. lutsenko, who did it, says this will destroy him. this will get him off the ticket. that was the whole purpose of that. and i think the best evidence of that is the fbi never used it in the manafort trial. so the fbi knows that it's a stinko document.\n\ndo you still have people looking for information for you?\n\ni won't answer that. i'll never tell you what i'm doing, investigating, but i –\n\nlet me frame it a different way –\n\nlet's put it this way –\n\nare you still investigating?\n\nam i still investigating? yes, i'm still investigating.\n\nare you still seeking more information?\n\ni get more information. a lot of it comes to me.\n\nare you doing that on the authority of the president?\n\nuh. he hasn't told me not to do it. he hasn't told me not to do it. and the fact is a lot of it has to do with the collusion. i've developed more — i've found out more things than i knew then. i mean i found — i've had a very, very long conversation with a person who's been investigating this case for five years. i've had a very intimate conversation with someone who is completely familiar with the prosecutorial file, has read it all, made notes of it — yeah, i've gathered more information all throughout this period. and sometimes i just get people to call me up and say, you want to talk to this person, you want to talk to that person? most of them i don't talk to. sometimes i hit — i get gold.\n\nthis is a key point then, i think, because it would be possible to say this acquittal vote ends the entire episode. this is over. we're done. you're saying no. on my side. i'm going on. i want to find more information about joe biden.\n\ni believe that it would be one of the great corrupt events in american history if this case is not investigated, about crime at the highest levels of two governments. where our government was a part of what we decry in ukraine. corruption. and we made millions from it. and i think it would be a real crime not to investigate the biden family that's been involved in corruption for over 20 years. the same situation that happened in ukraine, happened in iraq. the same situation that happened in ukraine and iraq happened in china. every place joe biden was point man, the biden family made millions. there's something very wrong with that. and there's something very wrong with someone getting away with it, because they can sell to a very biased press that this is being done to persecute them because they're running for president. if you have sold your office over two decades, just because you're running for president of the united states doesn't mean you shouldn't be treated like you and me. he did it in iraq. he did it in ukraine. he did it in china. in china he took his son with him. he failed in his mission for the united states to back china off from the islands that were being contested by japan. all over the newspaper that he was a failure. and the son was a great success. the son got china, have the bank of china become a partner with him and a $1.5 billion fund. and the partners were hunter biden, devon archer, chris heinz, the son of the secretary of state. the bank of china, the son of the vice president and the son of the secretary of state, when we are having contentious discussions with china, our partners with the government-owned bank of china — can you imagine if donald trump jr. was a partner with the bank of china, how angry he would be at me? and rather than putting me on the defensive, what you would say: it was pretty brilliant for you to discover that. well, i didn't discover that. peter schweizer discovered it. and i'm gonna tell you who the third partner is, which makes it even more incredible that the press covers this up. the third partner was whitey bulger's nephew. one of the major organized criminals in the united states. so the bidens don't just deal with organized criminals in russia like zlochevsky, who gave them $5 to $8 million and maybe more, they deal with organized criminals in the united states.\n\nif i might — it's been clear from some of your public statements that you've found it upsetting that people have portrayed you as a villain or a negative force or someone who has even harmed the president. i know you want to vindicate the president. do you also continue this because you would like to vindicate yourself?\n\nnope. i continue it because this is the way i've always been. i was told.\n\nyou've said you should be the hero of this.\n\ni should be. i'm the real whistleblower who doesn't want a mask over his face, doesn't want to hide, is not afraid to tell you who i am.\n\nis that what you're trying to prove by going on with this?\n\ni'm doing what i did when i investigated the teamsters and was told you'll never get the teamsters. in fact, they'll kill you before you get them. well, i got them, i got them. i did a rico case against them. i had the whole board removed. they had a monitor for 15 years. it's a different teamsters union today. i was threatened when that was done, 138 members of the senate wanted ronald reagan to fire me for doing it. members of the house, i'm sorry, wanted ronald reagan to fire me. the only person who defended me of the republican candidates for president in 1988 was george bush, for which i always admired him.\n\neven my republican colleagues wanted me fired for going after the teamsters union. can you imagine it? when i went after the mafia, god, i was only in office four weeks to put out a contract for $800,000 to kill me. didn't stop me from doing it. at the end of my time of u.s. attorney, another mafia figure put out a $400,000 contract to kill me. i've had four fatwas declared against me. i've had the farc in colombia threaten several times to cut my throat if i came there. and then i've had some recent threats because of this.\n\ni don't doubt any of that.\n\nso i do it because, and i know, look, it's self-serving as hell, but it's true. i have a great sense of justice.\n\nand i started this and i continue it — to defend him, to totally vindicate him — but also i am a citizen and i am a lawyer and i have a skill and what i see is major crime covered up by the media that's in love with joe biden. right in front of their faces in washington, d.c., joe biden has been carrying on a criminal enterprise that's so obvious that you have to be a fool not to see it. you can just take five newspaper articles and they follow all the same pattern. one of joe biden's relatives gets involved and makes millions of dollars and all of a sudden you find out that joe has a connection to it. either it's a bank. and joe biden is the only democrat who's fighting for making bankruptcy harder. all the democrats want to make it easier, but his son has no-show job for a big bank, so he's doing that. then he goes to iraq.\n\nit's not because he's delaware where all the banks are headquartered, i guess, or many banks\n\nyeah. but then don't have the son get the no show job. how about the conflict there? ok, well, you can say conflict to a point. when you get up, the six of these it becomes bribery. then you got they got the brother in iraq. he becomes point man for iraq in 2011. all of a sudden, within a few weeks, james biden out of nowhere is made a partner in a $1.5 billion housing program in iraq and comes out of that with millions of dollars. so he monetizes joe's office and pulls out millions of dollars. now we come to ukraine. they monetize his office in ukraine. look, whatever you think, you know zlochevsky didn't hire hunter biden because he's hunter biden. he hired him to get the vice president. now, the question is to do what? so it's a sale. it's a sale of the vice president's office. the thing of value that got them to $5-$8 million was the office of vice president. they sold it. this is now the third time i can show it. and then we go to china, and if you imagine the shrewd, tough chinese going into a $1.5 billion deal with a kid who has a serious drug problem. the one equity fund he ran it almost went bankrupt and somebody was accused of a ponzi scheme. can you imagine the bank of china putting money on that, or putting money into a fund that has on it the nephew of one of the most well-known organized criminals in america, whitey bulger's nephew? they did that because they wanted money in that fund, or did they do that to buy joe biden? and that's classically known as sale of office. now, when you do that as often as they do it, then your defenses like joe's defenses, i didn't know about my son's business. hey, joe, you traveled to china with him on air force 2. you were there for eight days. he was there for eight days. you failed. he won. you couldn't back off china like you fail all the time. and he comes back with an investment in a $1 billion to $1.5 billion fund. you mean you guys didn't talk about it or you didn't notice that over the years your brother james, who also was in a lot of screwed up businesses, all of a sudden became a millionaire? and you didn't notice that your son, hunter, although he's been in rehabilitation four or five times, has become a millionaire. you didn't notice that, joe? and after they say to you, i don't know my son's business, and your son's business is so stinky and so involved in following you around where you have offices to sell. at some point, joe, don't you have to ask him? and what about obama? this was put right in obama's face in 2015 by the new york times article. nobody's asked obama: when you found out that your vice president, who was given our billions in ukraine, had his son getting millions from a corrupt ukrainian, what did you do about it, mr. ethical? what did you do about it? did you talk to him? did you ask him? did you stop him? you know, obama, you could've stopped this.\n\ni want to ask one other question about—\n\ndemocrats are never asked this question. and you can't possibly say to me that if you change these names to president trump and donald trump jr., we wouldn't have had 100 new york times articles, 200 washington post articles, 100 reporters assigned to it and we'd have a special prosecutor by now.\n\ni don't know about the counterfactual, but we have reported on hunter biden. i want to ask a question about —\n\nto no avail in terms of the big newspapers really picking it up like they did trump. i mean, trump walks across the street wrong and we have an impeachable offense.\n\ni want to ask one other question along the lines of your sense of justice or vindication or whatever is right. i spoke some time ago with jeffrey harris, former federal prosecutor, who i believe was a close friend of yours for a long time.\n\nhe was. he was an associate of mine. he was my chief of staff when i was associate attorney general to ronald reagan.\n\nand he spoke very highly of you. he said that as a federal prosecutor, before you became u.s. attorney, if there were 100 people in the office, you were one of the very best in the courtroom. he is critical of you now says that if he had a chance to talk with you now, he'd ask why you're doing this. he would say, what's going to be the first paragraph of your obituary that you've taken an excellent career and made yourself a joke.\n\njeffrey is wrong. jeffrey, i haven't seen jeffrey in 20 years. jeffrey has no idea of the facts that i have. it's always a good idea to know the facts before you comment. he has no idea the witnesses i have. he has no idea that i have smoking guns like this absolutely unassailable money laundering transaction. he has no idea that i may even have tape recordings.\n\nwait a minute. you may even have tape recordings? you cannot leave that dangling. either you do or you don't, sir.\n\nwell, i haven't gotten them yet. they've been offered to me. i haven't seen them. they may turn out to be good, they may turn out to be not good.\n\ntape recordings of what?\n\ntape recordings of relevant conversations.\n\nok.\n\nagain, i have found out in this investigation, so i think i've been pretty objective about it. you never are completely when you're investigating, but i've turned down a lot of evidence. i've proven some things not to be true, or i believe not to be true. i don't think the idea that, you know, there was this whole idea that the ukrainians did the hacking, not the russians. i think i can pretty much disprove that.\n\nmeaning the russians did it, not the ukrainians.\n\nwell, other people can prove the russians did it. i can't prove that.\n\nbut the ukrainians didn't do it.\n\nbut i can i can show that, yes there are --\n\ni think what you're telling me is you're trying to be fair.\n\nyeah, i always try to be fair. if i went there and the witnesses said to me this is all bull, joe biden didn't know anything. he wasn't involved. he's only involved a little bit. the stuff about collusion, they're making it up. we don't have any evidence of it, i would have either not pursued it or i have pursued it and locked it up and tied it up and said, ok, we can't go that way. i've gone down about four avenues to try to defend the president that turned out not to be true. i don't think people understand this, and jeff may not understand this because jeff's always been more of a prosecutor: when you defend somebody in what is akin to a criminal action, it's not just a courtroom, where i think i'm great. the real key to it is investigating. it's my job to do a counter investigation. the best thing i can do is prove that my client's innocent. so if, let's take a bank robbery, i'm representing somebody for a bank robbery. he tells me he was in los angeles and can prove it. i'm going to go out to los angeles. i'm gonna find a people who can prove it. so that's a simple case. here, i'm in the middle of answering [special counsel robert] mueller's questions about collusions with russia.\n\nyou want to prove somebody else robbed the bank.\n\nand i know he didn't do it. and people come to me and they oversold it. they oversold it as almost as if the ukrainians are going to have done the collusion, substituted for the russian collusion. you can't. but they didn't oversell it in terms of, there was a substantial amount of illegal activity that involves hillary clinton, the democratic national committee, members of it, the ambassador, the embassy in collecting specifically dirt, described as dirt, from ukrainians. and the irony of that is they're investigating trump for dealing with russia to get dirt, which proved not to be so. and they did exactly that in ukraine, and now i think it's almost proven beyond a doubt that they did that. question is, how much of it did they do?\n\nwe've sort of been talking about your podcast all along since this is the subject of your podcast. but, and i've taken too much your time. but i want to ask direct--\n\nno, i-i-i appreciate the opportunity to explain it in more than soundbites.\n\nthank you.\n\ni understand something about this. the democrats have the advantage of very, very short little soundbites. it's been debunked. there's no evidence. giuliani is just doing this for political purposes. you can easily believe that if you wanted to. my explanation is much more complicated. it's a series of intertwined crimes, a series of intertwined crimes with very strange names you've got to follow. it takes a 5-to 10-minute presentation to even get up to speed on it. that's why i decided to do the podcast. i decided to do the podcast because when they are done, i can put them together in a package that'll be about two to three hours long and anybody can listen to them. and it's almost as if i presented an entire case to a jury. and i try to make it a little — i try to simplify it, but i'm doing it not just for now, i'm doing it for historical purposes.\n\nhow many episodes will there be then?\n\ni'm bad at predicting. i thought i could do one in one episode. i had to do it in two.\n\nthree of them are out.\n\nthree of them out, two are done. two more are done. so we have five. and i would say we're through the hardest part of the case, or what i would consider the hardest to explain. you usually do that first in a trial. we could conceivably do it in two more. i think three more is more like it.\n\nhas anyone financed the work that you've done over the last couple of years?\n\nno. my podcast, my podcast i have sponsors.\n\nok. i saw a cigar aficionado commercial.\n\nbut my podcast is gonna go away beyond – cigar aficionado, and i have a few others lined up as it expands.\n\nbut the actual work in ukraine?\n\nno, no one financed it. i did it myself. no one paid for my trips. no one paid for my lodging. by that, i mean, first of all, i didn't charge the president for a very special reason. i didn't want people to think that i was doing this for the huge amounts of money that lawyers make when they represent people. and i couldn't do it, he's a friend of mine. and number three, i felt from the very beginning he's being framed. some of the trips would be paid for, but they'd be paid for more in the context of i was going for two other clients to do something. i do have other businesses. so for example, when i went to spain to meet with [ukrainian official] mr. [andriy] yermak, i was going there for a different client and i took a day off.\n\nand did this other thing.\n\nand did that so that that trip would have been paid by a client. in some cases, trips are paid for by two or three. i'm giving a speech and they're paying for the trip. i'm giving advice to a client and i'm taking a day off to play golf. so commonly what i would do is split that in third, third and third. i'll pay a third. they pay a third. so. but if you're saying that i charge anybody for the trump investigation. no, there's a finance complaint against me claiming it was paid for by the republican national committee. haven't gotten a penny from republican national committee. not a penny.\n\nand you still haven't heard from federal prosecutors about any of that?\n\ni haven't heard a word about it.\n\nnobody's delivered a subpoena?\n\nnobody's delivered a subpoena.\n\nnobody has come by to ask you questions?\n\nno one has asked for my records. i have offered through my lawyers to sit down with them anytime they want. if they've got a specific situation that they want to ask me about, i'm more than happy to show them that i'm innocent. everything i've seen in the newspapers, i can prove definitively i didn't do.\n\ni have a hundred more questions. i've taken too much of your time. ryan, do you have anything you want to throw in before we let this man go?\n\nnpr justice correspondent ryan lucas: i do. i do have a couple. you say that people like shokin had their visas denied, other folks from ukraine had their visas denied, you say that the evidence is overwhelming that biden was engaged in corruption in ukraine. attorney general barr is someone who you know. you're friends with the president, you're the president's personal attorney. have you delivered the report that you said you were going to to the justice department. and if there is so much evidence, why hasn't the doj opened an investigation into biden's alleged corruption?\n\ni can't answer that. it would be privileged material. i can't tell you if i did or didn't do something with the justice department. justice department not be happy if i answer that question.\n\nto your knowledge, has the justice department opened an investigation into allegations of corruption into joe biden?\n\ni can't answer that. you have to ask them that.\n\nhave you delivered the report to the justice department? you spoke publicly —\n\ni did do that, i did do that, but i don't think i'm at liberty to answer that question right now. maybe i will be later.\n\nlet's see, i have one more.\n\nno, those are legitimate questions. i just i just can't answer them. i don't mean i can't answer them --\n\nso last question, i suppose, actually two more. john durham. you've been in touch with john durham at all? has he reached out to you?\n\ni have not been in touch with [u.s. attorney] john durham. and this is on purpose. i haven't spoken to bill barr about this investigation in any respect, ever. i decided that any conversation between bill and me would be – same thing with [former acting attorney general] matt whitaker-- any conversation like that would be completely misconstrued. no matter what we talked about, they would turn it around into some kind of an attempt by me to influence them or give them trouble they don't need. anything i have, i can just promise it's big. it's got a lot of people. and if i have to deliver information, i'm not saying i have, but if i have to deliver information, i'll find a way to do it so it comes in a lower level to be reviewed first and then they can decide, is this appropriate for the attorney general or the deputy attorney general. now that doesn't mean i haven't dealt with bill bar on other things, on other cases, totally unrelated to this. i am a lawyer and i do have other clients, although i have one that's much more prominent than any others. but i have not dealt with him in this case. we have never – we have never said a word about this case to each other because i'd like it to end that way. so that nobody can say that i tried to influence him. durham, durham i haven't spoken to about this case either, right. but not, i would talk to durham about the case if i had information in the area that he's investigating.\n\nare you concerned that lev parnas is going to flip?\n\nis going to what?\n\nflip.\n\nhe sounds like he has flipped.\n\nofficially, he has not. they said yesterday outside the courthouse –\n\nyou know, i'm not concerned at all. i'm not. i wasn't concerned from the very beginning if he flipped because he doesn't know anything. i know this sounds — you'll find out this is true. i'd do anything wrong. i did what a lawyer is supposed to do for his client. and i am a dogged, 24-hour-day investigator when i get on something. so i may have done it with more enthusiasm and with more intensity, but everything i did i can completely justify. all the allegations in the newspaper i laugh at. i'm not a foreign agent for any government. never have been. they try to take the work that i do, security work that i do for countries and try to change it into my being a foreign agent. and most of those countries are cities, not countries. they try to take my representation occasionally of a foreigner as i'm a foreign agent. there's an exception in fara [foreign agents registration act] for being a defense lawyer. i know the law. i follow it. i respect it. i love it. so i'm not worried about that. i'm not worried about it now at all because he's lied so often. he's made himself a useless witness. i mean, i don't know who's representing him, but you don't – and here's just a little lesson on representing criminal defendants that come from somebody who's been involved in this – i've been practicing law for 50 years. you do not try out for being a government witness by going on television. i've never heard of a government witness that the government took, and the way the government was induced to take him as a witness is he went on television. first of all, government prosecutors get very nervous when they see witnesses who go on television because they say even though they tell me they're going to keep it quiet, they're going to be the guys who leak on me. number two, he's gotten caught in two or three big lies. almost irrelevant big lies. this is important. irrelevant big lies. i'll give you the biggest one. he said that at the hanukkah party in 2018 the president took us all aside, took us into a room, and basically the president deputized him, told him my mission and deputized him. first of all, the president didn't even know about it then.\n\nnumber two, he did meet the president that time. it's only time i saw him meet the president. i introduced him to the president. it was on a greeting line. he and igor spoke to the president for less than 30 seconds. and then two other people that i was with, i brought up and they spoke to the president. throughout the entire hour at that hanukkah party, he was within my sight at all times, and them. we were all together as a group. every single one of them will testify that no such meeting took place. one of them is igor fruman, his partner, who will testify that no such meeting took place. that's one lie, provable. number two, he's also said that i was a partner in some kind of an oil deal i've never heard of. i wasn't. there is no documentary evidence. and igor fruman will testify that that's also a lie.\n\nand number three, he said that he put together devin nunez and prosecutor-general shokin in november 2018 in vienna. number one, i've interviewed shokin. he says he wasn't in vienna and he showed me his passport and he hasn't been in vienna for seven years. devin nunez has shown his passport. he was not in vienna. he was actually on that very day someplace else where he has a tape of it. so that's the third lie. by the time he gets up on the witness stand – before you even get involved in whatever else he did bad in the past, he's lied three times as part of his audition to becoming a witness. that's what michael cohen did. and that's why the southern district asked for three years in jail for him. so his lawyer, should be, i don't say disbarred, but his lawyer should be investigated. if i represent somebody and they tell me something, and there are witnesses, i find out are they going to contradict my guy? or are they going to support my guy? and if they're going to contradict my guy, i don't feature that on television as a way to get a prosecutor to want to make me a witness. so there's something crazy going on here. somebody is using him. and they destroying him.\n\nmayor giuliani, thanks for the time.\n\nyou're welcome.
after new york wins, trump and clinton look forward to knockout round\n\ntoggle caption spencer platt and jewel samad/getty images\n\na powerful wind swept across the 2016 presidential race tuesday night as the political pendulum came swinging back with a vengeance.\n\nrouted in wisconsin just two weeks ago, donald trump and hillary clinton stormed back to take the high-stakes primary in their home state of new york in convincing fashion. each won about three-fifths of the vote and widened their already imposing leads among pledged delegates.\n\nin so doing, both trump and clinton opened a pathway to winning their nominations outright before the conventions begin in july. in recent weeks, doubts had arisen as both front-runners seemed to lose altitude and as rivals promoted the prospect of open conventions in both cleveland and philadelphia.\n\nbut after new york, the pressure is back on the challengers, who will find fewer opportunities to narrow the gap in delegates with every passing week. the last best chance to stop either trump or clinton may well be next week, when pennsylvania, maryland, connecticut, rhode island and delaware hold the next-to-last round of multistate primaries. a total of 144 delegates will be available for republicans and 392 for democrats. there will not be a comparable package until the season's final day on june 7.\n\na sweep for either front-runner next week would make stopping trump or clinton not only daunting but mathematically infeasible. even the chances of a second ballot at either convention would go from forbidding to remote.\n\nso when the history of 2016 is finally written, the smashing results from new york may well be cast as the key inflection point. trump was declared the winner shortly after polls closed, tallying 60 percent of the statewide vote. when counting ended, trump was poised to claim all 14 at-large delegates and about 75 of the 81 delegates awarded by congressional district.\n\nfor her part, clinton did almost as well as trump in percentage terms with 58 percent, while she outpolled trump in the raw vote by nearly half a million. she did not dominate the delegate count quite as much as trump, but only because the democrats divide their delegates proportionally — both statewide and district by district. she took home an estimated 135 new delegates to sanders' 104. she already had 39 of the state's 44 superdelegates (who are free to change their minds).\n\nstill, the outcomes may have been equally discouraging for challengers in both parties. ted cruz and bernie sanders, winners in wisconsin and in a handful of caucus states that lent them momentum in the weeks since mid-march, stumbled badly in the empire state. both had hoped to at least limit the damage they would suffer on trump's and clinton's turf, while looking to friendlier venues ahead.\n\nbut instead, the front-runners ran roughshod across the landscape. cruz finished a weak third with scarcely 1 vote in 7, earning zero delegates. new york republicans preferred ohio governor john kasich, who got 1 vote in 4 statewide and gained perhaps three or more delegates (his first since he won his home state a month earlier).\n\nbruising as the loss was for cruz, it may have been just as bitter for sanders on the democratic side. clinton only increased her delegate lead by about 30 in the crucial category of pledged delegates. but the real pain for her rival was the opportunity cost. sanders' team had given it their all in new york, outspending clinton on tv and hoping visibly for an upset — or at least a narrow loss that could be spun as a moral victory.\n\ntrump, with his delegate lead growing again, can look to another stretch of promising ground next week. polls give him an edge in all five contests, with 144 delegates at stake. a sweep would greatly enhance his chances of reaching the majority of delegates needed for a first-ballot nomination (1,237).\n\nthere is an active stop trump movement, both in social media and in the higher circles of the gop establishment. senators seeking re-election in swing states have been advised to stay away from trump and even to skip the convention.\n\ncruz has been successful in certain states in placing sympathizers in delegate slots that are committed to trump on the first ballot. the individuals who occupy those slots would be expected to defect from trump on later ballots.\n\nbut all that will be moot if trump can get close enough to the magic number that a few pre-convention deals might well put him over the top. after a win like he scored in new york, such a last mile strategy looks increasingly plausible. at his victory rally at trump tower, trump left the stage to the strains of frank sinatra singing: if i can make it there, i'll make it anywhere, it's up to you new york, new york.\n\nfor her part, clinton was sounding equally sanguine just blocks away, telling a throng of her supporters that the race was in the homestretch and victory is in sight. she did not say it, but sanders now needs to win 60 percent of the delegates in every contest remaining — just to overtake clinton in pledged delegates. he has no discernible path to turning around her advantage in superdelegates.\n\nneither candidate's race is over, yet. weeks and months of pre-convention politicking remain. but after next week, it is possible that — for one or both of the front-runners — it will no longer be far from over.

flint pediatrician says charges against ex-governor help 'wounds finally close'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption paul sancya/ap paul sancya/ap\n\nthe flint, mich., water crisis resulted in charges wednesday against former michigan gov. rick snyder, who is now facing two counts of willful neglect of duty.\n\nthe misdemeanor charges carry a punishment of up to $1,000 and up to one year in prison. they come almost seven years after the city of flint began taking in water from the flint river in an attempt to save money. the water wasn't properly treated, and it corroded the city's aging pipes, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. more than 100,000 flint residents were exposed to unsafe levels of lead.\n\nduring an arraignment thursday, snyder pleaded not guilty to the charges. several additional officials are also facing charges over their alleged roles in the crisis, including the state's former health director and flint's former director of public works.\n\nthe charges drew mixed reactions from people who have been working to help the city deal with the crisis and its aftermath.\n\naccountability is great, but even with accountability, even if rick snyder was behind bars for a significant amount of time, that still doesn't compensate for the generations of irreversible damage that is and will continue to happen with residents, said latricea adams, who heads black millennials for flint, which advocates for the rights of flint residents still dealing with the effects of the water crisis.\n\nmona hanna-attisha, a pediatrician who was among the first to raise a red flag over the contamination, said in an interview with npr's morning edition that having some level of justice is like a salve. it helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.\n\nyears ago, hanna-attisha began noticing that her young patients in flint were showing twice the normal amount of lead in their blood following the change in the water supply. she called a press conference in september 2015 and warned residents, especially children, to stop drinking the water.\n\nmore than five years later, hanna-attisha is now the director of flint's pediatric public health initiative. she is also the author of what the eyes don't see, a book about her experiences in the crisis.\n\nbelow are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity:\n\ninterview highlights\n\ncan i ask you to take us back to that moment when you started to realize something was wrong. what was going through your mind?\n\nit was the summer of 2015. i was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. and she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that mona, the water isn't being treated properly in flint. and because of that, there's probably lead in the water. and that's the moment that my life changed. when i heard the word lead, it was a call to action. i respect the science of what lead does. i understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. and i also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. it's the last thing our kids in flint needed. that's the moment i stopped sleeping, i stopped eating, i lost about 30 pounds. and i began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.\n\nwhat do you make of these charges now?\n\nit's a bit of disbelief. it's been so long. and for so many people in flint, this justice delayed, really felt like justice denied — that there was never going to be this level of accountability. and as a physician in flint, i never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. there [were] these criminal cases and civil cases. and as i began to practice more in flint and interact with the families in flint, i began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never [closes], and it stays open and open and open. and it's been open for about seven years. and having some level of justice is like a salve. it helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.\n\nyou've written a book, and in it you talk about the villains in this crisis as being more than a single person, more than one individual. can you explain how you see that?\n\nso many people ask me, who do you want in jail or who should go to jail? and there's not one villain. there's not 10 villains. there [are] many villains. and this is what i say in my book:\n\nthere are lots of villains in this story. a disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. many people stopped caring about flint and flint's kids. many people looked the other way. people in power made tragic and terrible choices — then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. while charges have been brought against some of the individuals who were culpable, the real villains are harder to see. because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. the real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism.\n\nand these are the villains that we don't usually notice and don't want to, and these are the villains that poison flint with policy. and i hope one day we can go after these systemic villains and bring forth justice.\n\nwhat could that possibly look like now? even as you nod to the positive effect of these charges, where do you begin that larger level of healing and reconciliation to try to address some of those huge issues?\n\nthat has been my work since day 1. from the moment of recognizing this widespread lead contamination, this population-level trauma and this broken trust, our work has been in a very holistic way to mitigate the impact of the crisis and bring forth healing and recovery. you can think of what happened in flint as a case of science denial and our science helped speak truth to power. and we're leaning on that incredible science of child development and what kids and families need to bring forth healing and recovery. so what that looks like right now are these long-term interventions to support flint families — like child care, like medicaid expansion, like literacy support, like nutrition access, all of these critical ingredients to keep families healthy, including things like behavioral health services and trauma-informed care. because what flint was, by and large, was this population-level trauma. and people to this day are stressed and angry, and they feel guilt and they feel betrayed by the folks that were out there to protect them.\n\nwould the crisis have happened had flint been a white suburb instead of a predominantly black city?\n\nof course not. flint is this egregious example of environmental injustice. it never would have happened in a richer, whiter community. there's a long history of racism in flint, and it was also perpetuated during this crisis.\n\nas the director of the initiative to mitigate the impact, tell us where your focus is.\n\nmy focus is to make sure that the kids of flint have the brightest future possible, that we can not only recover but thrive after this crisis, and that we can share our best practices with so many other communities where children are suffering from the same sort of injustices.\n\ncatherine whelan produced the audio version of this story. avie schneider produced for the web.

1976: the last time republicans duked it out to the last, heated minute\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption hulton archive/getty images hulton archive/getty images\n\nyes, the race for the white house is about winning states, but really it's about winning delegates. in typical elections, the front-runner in a primary ends up being the person who snags the magic number of delegates to clinch the nomination so the convention ends up being pretty much a coronation ceremony.\n\nbut this year's republican race for the nomination is shaping up to be something different.\n\ndonald trump is winning. and many in the party don't like that one bit. they're criticizing him, especially as we watch violence break out at trump rallies. but at this point, they only have so many options to derail the trump campaign, and opponents in the gop are hoping his challengers, gov. john kasich and sens. ted cruz and marco rubio, can just keep chipping away at his delegate count.\n\nif they can, it'll make the republican convention a lot more interesting, if history tells us anything.\n\nthe last time it all came down to the convention was for the republicans in kansas city. in 1976, president gerald ford went up against his challenger, former california gov. ronald reagan.\n\nnot unlike today, tempers raged and traditional rules were broken in the last-minute, two-man race for the nomination.\n\nthis week on for the record: the 1976 republican national convention.\n\nann compton, then a young white house correspondent for abc news, remembers the '76 convention as a real battle.\n\nthe party didn't know quite what to do with an incumbent president who hadn't been elected but had been appointed president, and a popular california governor who had tried to run before and was amassing huge numbers of delegates, she says. the convention meant the climax to a party that had a kind of split personality.\n\nmeanwhile, stephen hess was editor in chief of ford's platform. he recalls the months leading up to the convention.\n\nif i remember correctly, the president, gerald ford, was winning, winning, winning from new hampshire on, and then suddenly he hit a block in north carolina and gov. reagan started to win, win, win. so suddenly they came into the convention almost tied, hess says.\n\nas ronald reagan's '76 campaign manager, john sears appreciated the outsiders label.\n\npeople talk about how upset people are with washington, but they were back then too, especially coming on the heels of the watergate, sears says. there's a great deal of anti-washington feeling.\n\nso by the time the convention rolled around, hess says, they came to kansas city ready to brawl.\n\nit was a fight for each and every delegate. gerald ford was the sitting president, which meant he could sweeten the deals.\n\ni recall being behind the scenes in a ford campaign kind of boiler room when the campaign delegate counters led by jim baker, later secretary of state, were befuddled by delegates who were asking for favors, says compton. one was a delegate from new york who wanted a federal judgeship for his brother — a serious request in return for his vote for gerald ford. he didn't get it.\n\nsince the president had greater influence than reagan, says sears, they took the only power move they thought they had.\n\nreagan announced his plan to select the liberal sen. richard schweiker of pennsylvania as his running mate beforehand.\n\nthat's where sears thinks the reagan camp's strategy backfired.\n\nthey must have thought this was a very clever way of attracting liberals or centrists in the party, sears says. instead, people like jesse helms of north carolina were furious. and so it worked against him and then they compounded their errors.\n\nafter announcing a running mate, which in and of itself was unusual to say the least, the reagan campaign then proposed a rule change requiring that ford name his vice president pick, too.\n\nand the republican fight to retain the presidency, which had become a fight over the nomination, now boiled down to a fight over a rule change — yet another fault line in the '76 gop.\n\ncompton, who had been reporting from the convention floor, also remembers the heated republican race to the finish.\n\nthere were moments of incredible frustration and, yes, even physical altercations on the floor of the convention, she says.\n\nbut one moment stood out from the rest.\n\ni happened to be standing right next to the new york delegation where vice president nelson rockefeller and his new york delegation, they were all supporting gerry ford, compton says. rockefeller was so angry [that] somebody yanked the new york delegation telephone off its stand, out of its moorings, trashed it right there on the convention floor in fury.\n\nthat telephone was nelson rockefeller's lifeline to the command headquarters, she says. this is how they coordinated. it was so crowded on the convention floor, you couldn't even walk over to another delegation so that shows just the extent to which tempers flared.\n\nthere were debates, handshakes and deals before a final vote that all came down to the state of mississippi.\n\nhad mississippi stayed with us instead of going as a block to ford on the procedural question that we raised, i think we might have been nominated, says reagan campaign manager john sears. but it was that close.\n\nford scraped by with enough votes to win the nomination.\n\nthen of course in his generosity — he was a generous and kind person — they invited ronald reagan to come up and address the convention, says compton.\n\nhess recalls it as a marvelous little speech, which pretty much declared him as the next republican candidate. and in that speech, praised the republican platform as a 'banner of bold, unmistakable colors with no pale pastel shades.' \n\nas compton recalls, the tone of the convention was a far cry from the tense moments leading up to the nomination.\n\nthe ford team was so relieved to have it resolved, to know that he would get his first and only chance to run a full campaign for president, that the idea of letting reagan unite the party was appealing, and if he was more poetic than the more prosaic gerald ford, so be it, compton says. the delegates sitting in their chairs on the floor loved it.\n\ngerald ford had won, and went on to lose to democrat jimmy carter. reagan may have lost the nomination, but went on to define the republican party for a generation.
what life is like for 3,700 cruise ship passengers stuck in coronavirus quarantine\n\ndozens of passengers on a cruise ship have tested positive for coronavirus. npr's lulu garcia-navarro talks with gay and philip courter, among the 3,700 quarantined on a ship in yokohama, japan.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nover 800 people have died in china from the coronavirus. that's more than the sars epidemic death toll 18 years ago. meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus on a ship near japan has risen. the diamond princess was supposed to have docked in taiwan today, but the cruise ship has become a floating quarantine for some 3,700 people aboard. since monday, it's been alternating between the port of yokohama, japan, and nearby open water. it's believed that a passenger carrying the coronavirus boarded the ship before disembarking in hong kong. more than 60 people on the diamond princess have now tested positive for the disease. about a dozen are american.\n\ngay and philip courter are among those aboard the ship. they're from florida, and we called them in their room yesterday.\n\ngay courter: hi, lulu. this is gay courter.\n\ngarcia-navarro: gay, these must indeed be anxious moments. how are you feeling?\n\ng courter: well, you know, at first, we just got to make the best of a bad situation. but the virus cases keep coming, and the numbers go up incrementally. yesterday, there were 46 new cases, virtually doubling. today, there are three or four. and now we're awaiting a helicopter and a boat run by the (inaudible) coast guard that is supposedly taking some samples from other ill (inaudible), i guess to test them for the virus. and all (inaudible) bringing medical supplies on board for people, the passengers who are all running out of their prescribed medications 'cause the trip is extended for two more weeks.\n\ngarcia-navarro: what are they telling you? how are they explaining what's happening?\n\ng courter: all communication comes right from the captain and nobody else, except some (inaudible). you know, one of the hardest things is you don't have any information except what you can see out your balcony.\n\ngarcia-navarro: well, what can you see out of your balcony?\n\ng courter: well, we're at sea, so we see the waves and the stars and the almost-full moon. we have a friend on the opposite side of the ship, and we'll call her and say, what do you see? you know, you look down the hall. in each direction, there are hall monitors or police or something. and we can't even stick our heads out the door.\n\ngarcia-navarro: i should say that in a very eerie twist of fate, you are an author, and you wrote a book about terrible happenings on a cruise ship. and you researched that book on the very cruise ship you're on now, right?\n\ng courter: i know. it's just so ironic. it's called the girl in the box, and it's about a murder (inaudible) with medical overtones on a cruise ship. i guess my darkest image is me going out on a (inaudible). so it's - as much as we have gotten a dark sense of humor here, the (inaudible) is that any one of us could come down with the virus. we're 75 and 77, so we're in a high-risk category by age. and i just learned that if one of us is offloaded for a hospital, the other has to stay on board.\n\ngarcia-navarro: oh.\n\ng courter: and i just can't imagine that.\n\ngarcia-navarro: your family and your friends must be very worried about you.\n\ng courter: the kids have formed an incredible team to get us off the ship, but the japanese authorities and the u.s. state department are (inaudible) no. nobody (inaudible) quarantine. so that's frustrating. but the kids are working on it as a team. and they're bright, and they're - they know media, and they know what to do. but it's not happening.\n\ngarcia-navarro: can i ask you to pass me over to philip so i can speak with him as well? thank you.\n\nphilip courter: hi, lulu. it's phil.\n\ngarcia-navarro: hi, phil. tell me a little bit about how you're feeling and your state of mind right now.\n\np courter: i think as gay said, we've been really very cheerful (inaudible) point where we realized that - you know, that we've read a lot. i think there is a real concern about the possibility the virus could be transmitted through the circulating air system. we're fortunate we have a balcony, and we've been keeping our door cracked open a bit and letting fresh air move through the room all the time. but we're just kind of, you know, hunkering down and taking our temperatures and trying to, you know, keep ourselves feeling healthy and safe. we're certainly eating well. i'll give them credit for that.\n\nas of today, by the way, they even opened up a kind of a psychological support hotline so that if people are feeling really, really (inaudible), there's a number they can call, which i think is awfully nice. i do give credit to the ship. they're really trying to do the best they can.\n\ngarcia-navarro: have you spoken to any u.s. government representatives? have you been able to sort of speak to embassies or consulates?\n\np courter: well, we've tried to reach out. our kids have tried to reach out. everybody is kind of throwing their hands up in the air. you know, this is a big problem, and nobody really knows what to do. but at the moment, we certainly haven't seen or heard about any actual action taking place to get people off the ship earlier or to change that kind of a setting. i mean, the news today from the state department was that the cdc says, this is best place for you all (inaudible). and so here we are.\n\ngarcia-navarro: when will the quarantine be over?\n\np courter: it's supposed to end on the 19. and we're presuming that that's what's going to happen even if some new cases do appear. some folks say, oh, no, if there are more cases, then you have to extend the quarantine period. well, we certainly hope that doesn't happen.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's almost two weeks. that's a long time. we wish you the best.\n\np courter: yes.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's philip and gay courter, quarantined aboard the diamond princess cruise ship near japan.\n\nthank you so much.\n\np courter: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump's criticism of judges out of line with past presidents\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption saul loeb/afp/getty images saul loeb/afp/getty images\n\namericans are used to the hurly burly of political and legal debate. but presidents historically have been careful about criticizing individual judges or their motives.\n\nhowever, president donald trump tweeted and railed against the judges who have ordered a temporary halt to his ban on people entering or returning to the u.s. from seven mostly muslim countries.\n\nthe president's rhetoric left many lawyers and historians on both the right and left aghast, or at least scratching their heads.\n\ntrump's fighting words\n\nin the space of one week, president trump has belittled all four judges who have ruled against him so far in the travel ban case. he referred to judge james robart, a george w. bush appointee who temporarily suspended the travel ban, as a so-called judge whose decision was ridiculous. in a three-part tweet, trump added, if something happens, blame him.\n\nwhen the case was heard by an appeals court panel, trump told a group of police chiefs that even a bad high school student could understand the ban was authorized by law.\n\ncourts seem to be so political and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right, he said. and that has to do with the security of our country.\n\nthe next night when the appeals court judges, including another republican appointee, ruled unanimously against him, trump responded combatively.\n\nit's a political decision and we're going to see them in court, trump said.\n\npresidents, for the most part, avoid public feuds with courts for a practical political reason.\n\ntrump's statements are extremely self-defeating, observes josh blackman, a constitutional law professor at south texas college of law houston.\n\nthe more he says the courts are biased or will rule against him because they're stupid, comments blackman, it subconsciously increases the chances that they will rule against him.\n\nthe history of presidential restraint\n\nthere is a more serious reason trump should avoid criticizing judges too, blackman says. under the u.s. system of three branches of government, the judicial branch — the courts — ultimately are the checks on the legislative and executive branches when they exceed or even abuse the limits of their power.\n\nunderstanding that, presidents going back to the founders have largely refrained from personal attacks on judges. president thomas jefferson, for instance, avoided publicly berating chief justice john marshall about decisions limiting the power of the executive and the legislature.\n\njefferson spoke privately about what he called marshall's 'twistifications' of the law, but he didn't do it publicly, says james simon, the author of four books about the court and the presidency.\n\njeff shesol, author of a book about president franklin roosevelt's infamous court packing plan, makes a similar observation about the new deal president. roosevelt tried and failed to increase the number of supreme court justices so he could appoint more who agreed with him.\n\nprivately, roosevelt was very bitter about his treatment at the hands of the supreme court, shesol explains. but even at the height of the court fight, he never allowed it to get personal in the way we have heard recently from trump.\n\nmodern presidents\n\nmodern presidents have followed a similar path. for instance, president george w. bush was hardly pleased when the supreme court repudiated the system the bush administration set in place for dealing with enemy combatants captured in afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\nafter the supreme court ruled that prisoners at guantanamo bay had the right to challenge their detentions in court, bush said tersely, we'll abide by the court's decision. that doesn't mean i have to agree with it.\n\npresident barack obama was widely criticized in 2010 for similar remarks about a campaign financing decision, mainly because he chose to comment at his state of the union address, which the justices attend. days later, chief justice john roberts said the state of the union had degenerated into a political pep rally.\n\nthe tradition is that while presidents are free to criticize court decisions, they should avoid personal attacks on judges. why? because judges have no actual power. they have no power of enforcement, no troops to carry out orders, no power of the purse.\n\nbalance of power: how much can the president change?\n\nwhich gets at the ultimate worry about trump.\n\nour system of laws depends on not just lowly citizens, but presidents as well, abiding by court rulings. throughout our history, the supreme court has been inserted into national crises, often preventing presidents from doing what they want to do. indeed, sometimes the supreme court's verdicts are not vindicated by history. and yet, presidents have complied with those rulings.\n\nless than a month into trump's presidency, many leading lawyers and scholars are worried. professor blackman fears that if trump's nominee for the supreme court neil gorsuch is confirmed and ends up ruling against the president, the next trump nominee would be a crony.\n\nothers wonder what would happen if the mercurial trump loses the travel ban case or another big one. would he be so sure of his cause that he would refuse to comply?\n\nthat would undoubtedly provoke a constitutional crisis. refusal to obey a supreme court order would normally be grounds for impeachment.\n\nbut author shesol worries that in our hyper-partisan environment, there's an open question whether the president's own party in congress would actually stand up and say, 'this is unacceptable. this is grounds for impeachment.' 
coronavirus deaths in washington state and california, where gov. declares emergency\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption rich pedroncelli/ap rich pedroncelli/ap\n\nupdated at 8:45 p.m. et\n\nthe u.s. death toll from covid-19 has risen to 11 people, after officials reported fatalities in california and washington state on wednesday. the most recent death is connected to a cruise ship that traveled from the u.s. to mexico.\n\nofficials in placer county, calif., announced that an elderly resident has become the first person to die from the illness in california. the patient, who was not identified, had underlying health conditions, according to the county.\n\nthe patient tested positive for the coronavirus illness on tuesday and was likely exposed during international travel from feb. 11-21 on a princess cruise ship that departed from san francisco to mexico, according to a statement published on placer county's website.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption justin sullivan/getty images justin sullivan/getty images\n\nroughly a week passed from the end of the cruise to when the patient was hospitalized, officials say. an ambulance took the patient to a hospital on feb. 27; in the interval, the person had minimal community exposure, the county says. the patient had been in isolation at kaiser permanente roseville.\n\ngov. gavin newsom extended his condolences to the patient's loved ones and said the state is working with federal agencies to trace people who might have had contact with the patient. later wednesday, newsom declared a state of emergency over coronavirus in california, which has more than 50 confirmed cases, according to health officials.\n\nplacer county spans a wide area, from the outskirts of sacramento to lake tahoe.\n\namong california's cases are 24 people who arrived in the u.s. on repatriation flights from outbreak locations in asia.\n\nthe other cases include seven people who were infected via person-to-person exposure and 12 travel-related cases.\n\napproximately 515 persons have been tested to date, the california department of public health says.\n\nto prevent the virus from spreading, health experts recommend washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer. face masks should be worn only by people who are either sick or are caring for someone who is, according to the world health organization.\n\nwashington state\n\nwashington state raised its own death toll from covid-19 to 10 people earlier wednesday. the state now has 39 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease, with 31 of them in seattle and king county. the other eight cases are in neighboring snohomish county.\n\nmany of the cases are linked to life care center of kirkland, wash., the long-term care facility northeast of seattle that is at the center of the outbreak in king county.\n\non wednesday afternoon, officials in seattle and king county issued recommendations for vulnerable residents to try to contain the spread of coronavirus in the area.\n\npeople at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others, they said in a statement.\n\nthat group includes people 60 and older; people with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes; those with weakened immune systems; and people who are pregnant.\n\nin addition, officials said companies should take steps to allow employees to work from home, if possible, and recommended that people avoid visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities and nursing homes.\n\nmore than 230 people in washington state are under supervision out of concern that they may have been exposed to the pathogen, the washington department of health says.\n\nlos angeles declares emergency\n\nhours before gov. newsom declared an emergency for the entire state, the city of los angeles declared a health emergency over the coronavirus, citing the need to address the possibility of community transmission of the disease that has caused more than 3,200 deaths globally.\n\nthe move comes after los angeles county confirmed six new cases of the coronavirus and seven overall, according to dr. barbara ferrer, director of the los angeles county department of public health.\n\ni have signed a declaration of local emergency for the city of los angeles, mayor eric garcetti announced via facebook. while there are only a few known active covid-19 cases in the region, the declaration helps us access state and federal funding to strengthen and support our efforts to prepare our region and keep our communities safe.\n\nlos angeles county mirrored the city's move, in a step that the chair of the county's board of supervisors, kathryn barger, said was a planned reaction to the virus.\n\nthis is not a response rooted in panic, barger said, adding that the emergency declaration would help agencies coordinate their response and contain the virus in a county where more than 10 million people live.\n\none person has been hospitalized while five others are being monitored at home, ferrer said. the county's first patient, a chinese national who was diagnosed in january, has recovered from the virus, she said.\n\nthree of the new cases were travelers who were traveling together in northern italy, ferrer said at a news conference. two others are relatives of a person who was infected with the coronavirus outside of the county, she said. the sixth case is a person who works in a field that exposes them to international travelers, ferrer added.\n\nlater wednesday, the los angeles times reported that a worker at the city's international airport who screened incoming flights from china and nearby countries had tested positive for the virus.\n\ncases rise in u.s.\n\nthere are at least 80 confirmed cases of covid-19 that originated in the u.s., the centers for disease control and prevention said earlier wednesday. that number doesn't include the 49 americans diagnosed with covid-19 who have been repatriated from outbreaks in wuhan, china, and aboard the diamond princess cruise ship.\n\nat least 13 states have reported coronavirus cases since late january.\n\nwhile international travel has been linked to 24 of the u.s. cases, the cause of transmission is still under investigation in 40 cases. person-to-person spread in the u.s. has caused infection in 16 cases, according to the cdc .\n\nthe cdc data reflects numbers that were reported by 4 p.m. et the previous day — meaning the actual number of cases in the u.s. might be higher than the most recent posting by the agency.\n\nstates are now testing and publicly reporting their cases, the cdc says. in the event of a discrepancy, state case counts are the most up to date.\n\nin addition to california and washington, other states reporting coronavirus cases include arizona, florida, georgia, illinois, massachusetts, new hampshire, new york, north carolina, oregon, rhode island, texas and wisconsin.\n\nalthough texas previously had cases from people returning from china or who had been aboard the diamond princess, officials on wednesday reported a newly detected infection in a person who had recently traveled aboard.\n\nhaving a covid-19 case in texas is a significant development in this outbreak, but it doesn't change the fact that the immediate risk to most texans is low, said dr. john hellerstedt, dshs commissioner. this travel-related case reinforces the fact that we should all be taking basic hygiene steps that are extremely effective in limiting limit the spread of covid-19 and all respiratory illnesses.
fearing climate change policy under trump, stem group works to get scientists elected\n\nscientists across the country are planning to go to washington — and take office. shaughnessy naughton is the founder of 314 action a non profit that helps scientists run for office.\n\nmichel martin, host:\n\nthere's been a lot of talk about how the election of donald trump has sparked a new energy and engagement in politics on both the right and the left. we're going to hear now the story of a mobilization of scientists concerned that the trump administration could upend years of work on climate change. some scientists are worried about president trump's environmental protection agency administrator who's criticized epa rules on climate change, clean air and water, and those concerns are prompting some scientists to move beyond just advocating for science to organizing and even running for office.\n\none such group is called 314 action which aims to prepare doctors, scientists, engineers and mathematicians to get more involved in politics. its founder is shaughnessy naughton, a business owner with a chemistry degree who ran for congress in pennsylvania, albeit unsuccessfully. i began our conversation by asking her how she came up with the name 314 action.\n\nshaughnessy naughton: three, one, four are the first three digits of pi which is used throughout the sciences, and part of why i founded this organization was one of my observations from when i ran for congress, i was really surprised at the lack of people with scientific or technical backgrounds. and i think we all benefit by having diversity of experience in government. and so i founded 314 action to unite the scientific community and to encourage them to go beyond the traditional role of advocacy and actually get involved in electoral politics.\n\nmartin: so i understand that you called 314 action an emily's list for scientists, and for people who don't know, emily's list is a group that's been around for - what? - a couple of decades now that raises money for promising democratic women candidates at all levels who favor abortion rights. are there similar baseline positions that must be adhered to for your group to support these candidates?\n\nnaughton: well, our number-one criteria is that you have a scientific or technical background. at this point, we are only supporting democratic candidates, and although we want to see more republicans take action on mitigating the effects of climate change, currently the difference in the two party platforms made us feel we had to pick a team.\n\nmartin: well, so i'm thinking about the fact that physicians are actually well-represented in the current administration and have been in congress for some time. i'm thinking about president trump's nominee for health secretary - tom price is a physician. former congressman ron paul was a physician. his son rand paul, the senator, was an ophthalmologist. all of them are conservatives, and i'm wondering why is that?\n\nnaughton: well, i think the nature of careers as, especially as independent practitioners for physicians, it does allow for greater flexibility and the ability to take time out of their career without being punished for it later. but what we are trying to do, although we include physicians in our umbrella group, we really want to bring people in from teaching, from research, from fields that are under-represented currently.\n\nmartin: shaughnessy naughton is a chemist, an entrepreneur, she's the founder of 314 action. that's a group that aims to encourage scientists people from the stem fields - science technology, engineering and math - to run for elective office. she was kind enough to join us from our member station whyy in philadelphia. shaughnessy naughton, thank you so much for speaking with us.\n\nnaughton: thank you, michel.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
no wall after all? the partial government shutdown is over, for now\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nour mara liasson is here to tell us more. good morning, mara.\n\nmara liasson, byline: good morning, lulu.\n\ngarcia-navarro: ok. so the shutdown is over for now. there's just about three weeks to come to an agreement. what happens next?\n\nliasson: what happens next is that house and senate negotiators from both parties start talking to each other. the president has said that at the end of three weeks, if he doesn't get money for a wall, he will either declare a national emergency - in other words, build the wall himself with unobligated pentagon funds - or shut down the government again. but no one i've talked to on either side of the aisle thinks that he will actually shut down the government again. some people do think that declaring an emergency is still his endgame. but many republicans are against that because they say it'll set a precedent. and a future democratic president could declare an emergency for gun safety or health care or climate change. and these republicans say that any kind of an emergency declaration would be tied up in court, and he would end up getting no wall after all.\n\ngarcia-navarro: this was such a bruising fight, mara. over the last month, as we talked about the possibility of declaring a national emergency, you said it was kind of like a life vest. he could use it to show his base he did everything that he could, and that would satisfy them. do you think, after all this, it still holds?\n\nliasson: i think some of the dynamic on that has changed a bit because he took a big hit with his base this week. he went into a macho standoff and lost to madam speaker. and some of his base is angry with him because they think he had no strategy. they think he wimped out. and don't forget this was a kind of two-step capitulation. first, he played brinksmanship (ph) on the state of the union address, then retreated on that. and nancy pelosi had a strategy. as she reportedly told a group of columnists this week, she says, you start with a feather. then you get to the sledgehammer. so her art of the deal was smarter and more strategic than the president's. his critics say his strategy was more whining than winning.\n\ngarcia-navarro: it's interesting to hear you say that because, elsewhere in the show, we spoke with a conservative talk show host who said that his base is, quote, very forgiving. so what gives?\n\nliasson: i think that's right. his hardcore base will never desert him. as he said, he could shoot someone on fifth avenue and not lose any votes. the big question is, how big is his hardcore base? we know from polling, including npr's polling, that his approval rating was starting to slip with white, working-class voters who are the core of his base. and we know that in every shutdown - shutdowns end because one side reaches their pain threshold first. in this case, it was the republicans and donald trump. maybe it was the long lines at the airport, that angry video statement from the fbi director or all those senate republicans who were starting to jump ship. but he had a weak hand and played it poorly. and his base is angry at him.\n\nwhat i've heard is not so much because he capitulated, not so much because they won't get the wall - because, after all, immigration restrictionists don't put the wall as their no. 1 priority. but they're angry because he seemed weak and feckless and in over his head. and what we learned this week, also, is democrats, at least for now, do not have an herbal tea party problem. in other words, pelosi was able to control her left flank a lot better than john boehner or paul ryan ever did with the freedom caucus. so far, the democrats are hanging together more than the white house thought they would.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and seeming tough while they do it - i like that, an herbal tea party problem. well, to add to the pain of the president's week, we would be remiss not to mention his longtime friend roger stone was indicted this week.\n\nliasson: that's right. his longtime friend roger stone, who is a self-described dirty trickster. i can't think of another president who's had a fixer and a dirty trickster in their orbit. but roger stone was invited - indicted. that increases the number of close associates to the president who have pled guilty or been indicted. stone says he won't plead. he won't cooperate. he won't turn on the president. maybe he's banking on a pardon. but what it seems like is that robert mueller is doing what most organized crime prosecutions do, working their way up the food chain, starting with small fry like papadopoulos and then going up the ladder to people who are closer to the president. so it was a bad day for the president. but on the other hand, his capitulation on the shutdown took some of the attention away from the robert - roger stone indictment. it was a bit of a distraction.\n\ngarcia-navarro: npr national political reporter mara liasson - thank you so much, mara.\n\nliasson: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
in milestone, scientists detect gravitational waves as black holes collide\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption s. ossokine , a. buonanno (mpi for gravitational physics)/w. benger (airborne hydro mapping gmbh) s. ossokine , a. buonanno (mpi for gravitational physics)/w. benger (airborne hydro mapping gmbh)\n\nfar from our galaxy, in the vast darkness of space, two massive black holes merged into a single, larger hole.\n\nand now researchers say they have detected rumblings from that cataclysmic collision as ripples in the very fabric of space-time itself. the discovery comes a century after albert einstein first predicted such ripples should exist.\n\nit's a really big event, says saul teukolsky, a theoretical astrophysicist at cornell university. this is probably the most exciting episode of my professional career.\n\neinstein predicted the existence of such ripples, known officially as gravitational waves, in 1916, as part of his general theory of relativity. general relativity re-imagines the gravitational pull between heavy objects like earth and the sun as a warping of space and time. when very heavy objects such as black holes are involved, the theory predicts that gravitational waves will emerge and ripple across the entire universe.\n\nthat's the idea. but in practice, seeing such gravitational waves has been nearly impossible. to make detectable waves, massive objects must be moving quickly. researchers predicted a collision between two black holes would do the trick. but nobody knew how often that might happen.\n\nnevertheless, scientists built two massive detectors to take a look. known collectively as the laser interferometer gravity-wave observatory (ligo), the detectors are located in washington state and louisiana. they are separated by thousands of miles in order to detect ripples coming in from deep space as they pass through earth.\n\neach detector looks like a big l, made up of two tunnels 2.5 miles long. it's designed so that if a gravitational wave passes by, it will stretch space along one direction of the tunnel and squish space along the direction of the other. the stretching and squishing changes the tunnels' lengths by a tiny amount, and that change can be detected by lasers.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption caltech/mit/ligo lab caltech/mit/ligo lab\n\nalthough ligo was completed in 1999, it took more than a decade for it to see anything. the detectors had to be made incredibly sensitive to pick up the tiny waves. but they were so touchy, they were set off by everything from minute shifts in earth's core to traffic entering the parking lot. and even after researchers got rid of all the terrestrial jiggles, ligo still wasn't quite good enough to see gravitational waves.\n\nall that changed after a major upgrade in 2014. better vibrational isolation and upgrades to lasers and mirrors dramatically boosted the instrument's power.\n\nand the black hole collision was seen almost as soon as the team began observing again in the fall of 2015. on sept. 14 at 5:51 a.m., the waves passed through both of the detectors.\n\naccording to a paper published in the journal physical review letters, the two black holes were each roughly 30 times the mass of the sun. they merged some 1.3 billion light years from earth. the waves were generated in the final moments before the black holes merged. the signal was brief but definitive.\n\nthe measurements are dramatic proof that gravitational waves exist. the signal in the detector matches well with what's predicted by einstein's original theory, according to teukolsky, who was briefed on the results. it matches predictions of the ripples produced by two large black holes, in the final moments before they merge, swirling together at an enormous speed.\n\nthis is, arguably, the most direct observation of black holes ever made. because black holes are (as their name implies) black, they can't be seen with ordinary telescopes. up until now, their existence has been inferred by looking at the stars and gas swirling around them. this gravitational signal comes directly from the holes, and it is virtually incontrovertible proof that the holes are out there. if black holes didn't really exist, you couldn't explain these waves, he says.\n\nother researchers believe that the gravitational waves could tell us even more about our cosmos. it's like looking at the universe with new eyes — the amount of information that's there is going to be amazing, says mina arvanitaki, a theorist at the perimeter institute of physics in waterloo, ontario. arvanitaki will use ligo's data to probe for undiscovered fundamental particles that might only exist in the warped space around black holes.\n\nteukolsky says the discovery shows just how extraordinary the natural world can be. the universe is stranger than any kind of fiction we could imagine, he says. i mean, it's preposterous.
albert brooks' 'lost in america' remains piercingly relevant 32 years later\n\nnewly released on dvd and blu-ray, the 1985 film follows a well-heeled la couple who decide to become free-spirited wanderers. critic john powers says lost in america is a comedy for the ages.\n\nterry gross, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. like woody allen before him, albert brooks gave up standup comedy to make his own films. our critic-at-large, john powers, considers brooks's 1985 film lost in america a masterpiece. it's just been released on dvd and blu-ray by criterion. lost in america is the story of a well-heeled la couple, played by brooks and julie haggerty, who decide to become free-spirited wanderers. john just watched it for the umpteenth time and says it's one of the greatest comedies of the last 40 years.\n\njohn powers, byline: a lot of comedians are funny. but only a handful have the genius to shape the comic terrain. one of them is albert brooks, who, in a cosmic bad joke, is probably best known to today's audiences as the voice of marlin in finding nemo. but back in the early '70s, in a famous esquire article and a series of legendary tonight show performances, brooks set about gleefully exploding the schticks and traditions of standup comedy.\n\nmaking comedy about comedy, he blazed the trail for such later masters of showbiz meta as steve martin, david letterman and bill murray. by the late '70s, brooks was making movies, starting with three groundbreaking comedies that explored the triumph of modern narcissism in all its cringe-worthy hilarity. the greatest of these is lost in america, just out in in a gorgeous, new package from the criterion collection that i highly recommend - but also widely streamable.\n\nmade at the very height of the reagan years, lost in america, co-written with monica johnson, feels as relevant to our selfie-mad times as it did in 1985. brooks stars as david howard, an la ad man who makes mad men's don draper looks like a figure of shakespearean grandeur. living a comfortably middle-class life with his wife linda, played by julie hagerty, the neurotic david is looking forward to a promotion so he can buy a new mercedes and get an even bigger house. when the promotion is denied, he quits his job in a huff and bullies linda into quitting hers. he insists they must sell off everything, hit the road and be free. here, linda responds to his idea of getting a mobile home.\n\n(soundbite of film, lost in america)\n\njulie hagerty: (as linda) well, what do you think a motor home costs?\n\nalbert brooks: (as david) guess who went motor home shopping? my friends - motor homes for sale. forty-five thousand - complete for a great one. thirty feet long, a bedroom, a bath, a kitchen, a microwave that browns, a little tv - beautiful, beautiful. better than our new house - it has wheels, too. ok. now, that leaves us $145,000 in cash. now, play devil's advocate. can't you live 20 years on $145,000 if you're living out of a motor home and just eating and painting and writing books? i mean, this is what we talked about when we were 19. remember we kept saying let's find ourselves? well, we didn't have a dollar, so we watched television instead. linda, this is just like easy rider, except now it's our turn. i mean, we can drop out, and we can still have our nest egg. i just think that's unheard of.\n\npowers: before we know it, the two are cruising east in their winnebago, doing their own cushy version of easy rider. but when they stopped to get remarried in las vegas, all that bursting neon unleashes unforeseen consequences, including a classic encounter between david and a casino boss played by the late garry marshall. from that point on, david and linda find themselves living in a reality far different to the one they imagined and far funnier in part because its stars are so perfectly matched.\n\nbrooks is one of the most majestic ranters and kvetchers is in movie history. and his verbal mania is only fueled by hagerty's googly-eyed daffiness. now, brooks's comic approach is unsentimental and often uncomfortable. david may be all too human. brooks clearly sees something of himself in the guy. but he's far from lovable. indeed, pointing the way to curb your enthusiasm, brooks's work creates the prototype of the annoyingly selfish hero who stews in anxiety, bad faith and a sense of always being right. when lost in america came out, it was instantly recognized as a trenchant satire of the emerging species known as yuppies, with their materialism, sense of entitlement and unidealistic belief that the world is their oyster.\n\nwhat was less clear then was that brooks was also the first filmmaker to capture the essence of bourgeois bohemianism, the attempt to embrace the cool lifestyle of the rebel while still having money and comfort. that fantasy is alive and kicking among today's urban strivers, who play vinyl, go glamping and drink artisanal coffee as they try to make their millions. while david and linda are actually uneasy riders, they don't know how to change their lives. the road they travel isn't easy riders dreamy america, either.\n\nat one point, they have a fight in front of the hoover dam. this is partly a visual gag about scale. their personal squabbling is dwarfed by the dam. but we also sense the gap between the grandeur of this depression-era triumph of the collective spirit and the debased landscape they travel in, with its mini-malls and der wienerschnitzel fast-food restaurants. if there's more to america than this, they can't see it, which isn't to say that they don't learn anything from being on the road.\n\non the contrary, they find out who they really are and how they really want to live. and this self-knowledge leads to a wickedly upbeat ending that includes the greatest gag ever about finding a parking space in manhattan. david and linda only stopped being lost in america when they find out that, given the choice, they'd rather be comfortable than free.\n\ngross: john powers is film and tv critic for vogue and vogue.com. tomorrow on fresh air...\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified singer: (singing) get on the kellogg's all-bran wagon.\n\ngross: ...we'll hear the story of the kellogg brothers, who invented cornflakes and other breakfast cereals and ran the battle creek sanitarium, which pioneered the concept of wellness. there's lots of surprises in the kellogg story relating to the seventh-day adventists, abstinence, eugenics, probiotics and exercise machines. my guest will be medical historian howard markel, author of the new book the kelloggs. i hope you'll join us.\n\n(soundbite of the brett gold new york jazz orchestra's lullaby for lily)\n\ngross: fresh air's executive producer is danny miller. our engineer today is adam staniszewski. our associate producer for online media is molly seavy-nesper. roberta shorrock directs the show. i'm terry gross.\n\n(soundbite of the brett gold new york jazz orchestra's lullaby for lily)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

and, if we hate boredom so much, why do we still take boring jobs? this week on hidden brain, we try to answer these questions and more – hopefully, without boring you.\n\nbored at work\n\nthe researcher peter ubel and his colleague, david comerford, were curious about why people elect to do boring work. ubel says, imagine applying to be one of those guards at the museum who stand around all day, telling visitors not to touch the paintings.\n\nat the time, it might sound like a wonderful job - i just stand there and do nothing, and they pay me for it, ubel says. but now, imagine standing there all day long while people are walking about the museum enjoying themselves. you're not even allowed to really talk to them much. i cannot imagine a more boring job.\n\nubel and comerford ran an experiment to try to understand this gap, between the kind of work we think we will enjoy, and what we actually feel satisfied doing. they asked business school students to choose between two jobs. either they could be paid $2.50 to sit in the back of the classroom and do nothing for five minutes, or they could elect to spend those five minutes sitting in the front of the class solving word puzzles.\n\nwe found that a large majority of the students said we'd have to pay them more than $2.50 to solve the word puzzles, ubel said. yet when we actually finished the five minutes and asked them how much they enjoyed those five minutes, the people solving the word puzzles enjoyed the five minutes significantly more. and yet very few of them said yeah, pay me $2 and i'd be happy to do word puzzles 'cause at least i'll be having fun.\n\npeter ubel calls this tendency effort aversion. and he thinks that this phenomenon is one reason people get stuck in boring jobs.\n\nbored in space\n\nbut it isn't just security guards and toll booth operators who get bored at work. even astronauts get bored.\n\nin fact, as max nesterak reports, this is one of the major obstacles in sending a human mission to mars – because getting to mars takes a very, very long time.\n\nkim binsted is a professor at the university of hawaii. she studies the psychological effects of long term spaceflight. binsted's job is to figure out how to keep the astronauts healthy on long missions. and she has found that boredom isn't just a psychological problem.\n\nthey don't eat enough, binsted says. they don't eat enough for a couple of reasons and boredom is one of them, the food isn't appealing. and that's okay for a short stay on the iss but it's really not okay for the 2.5 years of a mars mission. that malnutrition could seriously affect astronaut performance.\n\nso a few years ago nasa launched a new project. scientists built a 1200 square foot geodesic dome — a bubble — on the slope of a volcano in hawaii. the idea is to simulate a martian environment.\n\nthe agency started sending groups of six to stay inside the dome for months at a time. water is limited. when the volunteers want to see a website, they have to submit a request to retrieve the page — after 20 minutes. when they go outside, they have to put on spacesuits.\n\nkate green is a science journalist. she spent four months living in this tiny dome with five others. she wrote about her experience in aeon.\n\nshe says that before she went in, she considered herself a person who never got bored.\n\nwell, things wear on you over the course of four months. green says. and by things i mean a static environment. we were talking to the same five people every single day. our home was a white dome with puffy walls that did not change day to day.\n\none way nasa is trying to spice things up? by quite literally, giving the astronauts spices, and letting them do some of their own cooking.\n\nif you look at the same things every day, if you eat the same things every day, if you hear the same things every day, it can produce some negative psychological effects, binsted says. the creativity of making food and the way you can use the same set of ingredients in different meals—that those things were very psychologically important to the crew.\n\nbored on stopwatch science\n\ndan pink joins shankar for another round of stopwatch science and they try to keep it interesting with research on boredom.\n\ndo judges and juries dole out harsher punishments when they're bored? this study suggests they may, but only for people different from themselves. in exchange for a drink, researchers asked a group of irish people to consider one of two hypothetical cases: an irishman beats up an englishman or an englishman beats up an irishman. they made some of the participants bored (by making them trace spirals on a piece of paper) before asking them to play judge. they found the bored volunteers assigned longer jail sentences to the english villain and shorter sentences to the irish one.\n\nanother study by the same researchers, wijnand van tilburg and eric igo at the university of limerick, found boredom increases our feelings of nostalgia when we reflect on the past. they made participants bored (by copying passages about concrete mixtures) before asking them to think of a memory. the bored volunteers thought of memories that were more positive and nostalgic than their non-bored counterparts. in both of these studies, the researchers say they believe boredom causes us to search for meaning and that's why we have nostalgic memories and align more closely with our in-group.\n\nthis study was, ahem, shocking. we know boredom is uncomfortable, but how uncomfortable? timothy wilson and his colleagues at the university of virginia and harvard investigated. they left participants alone in a room for 15 minutes with nothing but their thoughts and a device that administers painful electric shocks. they found that a quarter of women and two-thirds of men chose to administer electric shocks (which they previously said they would pay to avoid) instead of just sitting still. one guy shocked himself 190 times.\n\nis doing something—anything—better than doing nothing? here's another case that confirms how much we don't like doing nothing. back in 80s, an airport in houston was getting a lot of complaints about how long it took their baggage to arrive at the pick-up carousel. the vice president conducted studies, brought in consultants, and even hired more baggage handlers so that the wait time never exceeded eight minutes (an industry standard). still, the complaints kept coming. then the airport tried something interesting. they moved the gate farther away from baggage pickup so that fliers were walking most of the eight minutes rather than standing beside the carousel. the complaints stopped.\n\nthe hidden brain podcast is hosted by shankar vedantam and produced by kara mcguirk-alison, maggie penman and max nesterak. to subscribe to our newsletter, click here. you can also follow us on twitter @hiddenbrain, @karamcguirk,@maggiepenman and @maxnesterak, and listen for hidden brain stories every week on your local public radio station.
alabama publisher who called for kkk to 'ride again' is replaced by black woman\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption stan honda/afp/getty images stan honda/afp/getty images\n\nthe publisher of a small local newspaper in alabama penned an editorial calling for the ku klux klan to ride again. after massive outcry, he's stepped down, and a black woman has taken the job.\n\nthe new publisher and editor of the democrat-reporter, elecia r. dexter, took the reins on thursday, after goodloe sutton doubled down on his incendiary comments.\n\nif we could get the klan to go up there and clean out d.c., we'd all been better off, sutton told the montgomery advertiser. we'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them.\n\nthe original editorial, published without an author named, claimed that democrats and republicans were plotting to raise taxes in alabama. it stated: seems like the klan would be welcome to raid the gated communities up there. sutton confirmed to the advertiser that he wrote the piece.\n\nin a statement, the newspaper said it has provided the community of west alabama with quality news for over 140 years and you may have full confidence that ms. dexter will continue in this tradition as well as moving the paper into a new direction. it noted that dexter's family has strong roots and a rich history in marengo county.\n\neverything has been a little surreal, and there's a lot going on, dexter said in an interview with the washington post. i'm grateful for this opportunity.\n\nshe told the post that she had been working at the paper for about six weeks as a front office clerk when the editorial was published. she said she felt disappointed and talked to sutton about it.\n\n[he] took a group that has a lot of negativity associated to it, especially for people like me, of color, dexter said, according to the post. there are different ways to communicate you wanted washington to be cleaned up without using that particular reference.\n\naccording to the democrat-reporter, dexter holds a bachelor's degree in speech communication from eastern illinois university and two masters degrees: one in human services from spertus institute of jewish studies and another in counseling from argosy university. over the past 10 years, she has been a strategic leader with expertise in human resources, operations and change management, the paper said.\n\ndexter told npr in an email that sutton remains the owner of the paper. alabama lawmakers celebrated the change in editorial leadership.\n\nhis dangerous views do not represent alabama or the small-town papers in alabama that do great work every day, sen. doug jones, a democrat, said in a tweet. the good people of linden deserve so much better than these racist rants and i am confident they will get it with new editor, elecia dexter.\n\nrep. terri sewell, d-ala., called sutton's stepping down the right thing to do. she called for sutton to apologize.\n\nas npr's sasha ingber has noted, the editorial did not appear on the paper's website. but photos of the print story were tweeted by auburn university students, leading to national attention on the democrat-reporter.\n\nsutton has received accolades for his paper's investigative work, as ingber reported: in the 1990s, ole goodloe exposed corruption in the marengo county sheriff's department, receiving numerous awards for his investigative reporting, including a hugh m. hefner first amendment award and the society of professional journalists' sunshine award.\n\nat the same time, as the associated press noted, sutton has a history of publishing racially and ethnically insensitive editorials.\n\nseveral organizations have stripped sutton of awards. auburn university had awarded him and his deceased wife jean sutton its distinguished alabama community journalist award in 2009 – now, an auburn official said that it has withdrawn sutton's award and only recognizes jean sutton.\n\nand as kyle gassiott of troy university public radio reported, the university of southern mississippi removed sutton from its hall of fame, and the alabama press association formally censured him.
judge merrick garland is biden's pick to be u.s. attorney general\n\nailsa chang, host:\n\nit is now dark in washington, d.c., where the city is under curfew until a.m. tomorrow. just hours ago, pro-trump insurrectionists stormed the capitol building after forcing their way past barricades and through capitol police and other security officers. npr national justice correspondent carrie johnson has been monitoring the situation, and she joins us now with the latest.\n\nhi, carrie.\n\ncarrie johnson, byline: hi, ailsa.\n\nchang: all right, so congress plans to return to business tonight, this business of counting electoral college votes. usually this is just a formality, but tonight, obviously, is so radically different. can you just tell us what is being done to strengthen security on capitol hill, and how is returning even possible given all that has happened today?\n\njohnson: well, the acting attorney general is coordinating with law enforcement partners to add additional federal support to the capitol police. jeffrey rosen put out a statement rather late in the day, saying the violence on our nation's capital is an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy. doj has deployed hundreds of federal agents from the fbi, atf and u.s. marshals to help. the national guard is sending more than a thousand troops, and virginia and maryland police are on hand as well. the evacuation of the capitol, we're told, is mostly complete. we're also told that the fbi located and disarmed multiple suspicious devices in or near the capitol.\n\nthere have been some concerns today, ailsa, about the performance of the u.s. capitol police. i have some new information on that. we know one woman was shot there and died. a law enforcement source tells me the alleged shooter was a senior u.s. capitol police officer. there were two shots. it's believed the woman was unarmed, and the d.c. police are actively investigating that now.\n\nchang: ok. wow. all right. well, there were hundreds of protesters, carrie, inside the capitol building, many of them, obviously, illegally inside the capitol building. they had breached through security areas. what is going to happen to them? i mean, because there are photos all over twitter - people in trump hats, protesters in the chamber. their faces were identifiable, people in lawmakers' offices. what do you think is to come in the coming days, weeks ahead for these people?\n\njohnson: you know, there's - yeah, there's been a little bit of outrage, ailsa. many of those people left the capitol and went about their day in the streets of washington. some of them were armed, and others had tear gas or mace on them. but some did stop to talk with reporters or post selfies. law enforcement will be scouring those videos and photos. lots of those people scattered, but the same law enforcement source tells me they expect to charge a handful of people by the morning tomorrow.\n\nchang: a handful. that doesn't sound like a whole lot, does it?\n\njohnson: not a whole lot. and, you know, there's certainly going to be a lot more work to do, and going to have to be an after-action report about what happened here on the law enforcement end of things.\n\nchang: ok. and can you tell us exactly whose job will it be to prosecute them?\n\njohnson: you know, d.c. is an odd system compared to other parts of the country. the u.s. attorney's office in d.c. will most likely take the lead there.\n\nchang: ok. of course, what would have been the big news out of your beat today, out of the department of justice, was that merrick garland was nominated to be the new attorney general under president-to-be joe biden. remind us why that in itself would have been the seismic news of the day.\n\njohnson: oh, my gosh. how many times have we talked over the last four years about the chaos and turmoil at the justice department, ailsa? that place has a morale problem and a public confidence problem. merrick garland, joe biden thinks, will help resolve some of those issues. garland is a former doj official - lots of experience in managing that building in the clinton years, also some experience with cases like the unabomber and the oklahoma city bombing. he's known as nonpartisan and a level head and a guy who does things for reasons based on the law and not politics or protecting the president. so that would, democrats believe, be a change from the current situation.\n\nchang: why do you think merrick garland in particular was chosen, particularly to step - to be in the job after someone like bill barr? what are the issues that are left to be resolved at the justice department after bill barr's departure?\n\njohnson: you know, one of the things that i've heard the biden transition and the decision-makers among the president-elect and the vice president-elect that really swayed them was this parallel. after watergate and the abuses of president nixon, the justice department brought in a very well-respected university of chicago president, ed levi, to run the place. they think merrick garland can be that kind of transformative figure to make sure that criminal cases are brought for the right reasons and to put the law above politics. that's the goal for merrick garland if he gets confirmed by the senate this year.\n\nchang: that is npr national justice correspondent carrie johnson.\n\nthank you, carrie.\n\njohnson: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
in fighting fbi, apple says free speech rights mean no forced coding\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption julie jacobson/ap julie jacobson/ap\n\nthe justice department wants apple to write special software to help it break into the iphone used by one the san bernardino terrorists.\n\nin its filing opposing a federal judge's order to help the government, apple says it would be a violation of its first amendment rights to free speech.\n\nit's pretty well established that speech comes in many forms, says eric goldman, a professor at santa clara university school of law. we can talk, we can write words, we can draw paintings, we can take photographs ...\n\ngoldman says back in the 1990s, courts began to confront the question of whether software code is a form of speech. goldman says the answer to that question came in a case called bernstein v. us department of justice.\n\ndaniel bernstein was a student at the university of california, berkeley, who created an encryption software called snuffle. bernstein wanted to put it on the internet, and the government tried to stop him using a law meant to stop the export of firearms and munitions.\n\ngoldman says the student argued that his code was a form of speech.\n\nit clearly had expressive intent about what message the software author was trying to send to the world, goldman says. it was trying to say, 'i believe that privacy is important, and i'm going to use this software in order to express that.' \n\nthe 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals agreed, and software has been treated as a form of speech ever since.\n\nbased on that, apple is arguing that the first amendment also prevents the government from telling it what to say — in this case, that it's ok to break through the security on its phones.\n\nandrew crocker, an attorney with the electronic frontier foundation, or eff — a digital civil rights group — says the government can't make you say what you don't believe. he looks to a supreme court case from new hampshire, wooley v. maynard.\n\nnew hampshire has a license plate that says 'live free or die,' and someone objected to that on religious grounds, says crocker. and the court said, 'no, in fact you don't have to have that on your license plate.' \n\nbut it's not that the government can't make you say anything you don't want to, says professor goldman: there are plenty of circumstances where the government mandates people to speak — for example, you have to put the nutrition label on your can of food if you want to sell that food into the economy.\n\nand just as there are safety issues involved in the sale of food, the government says there are safety issues in its case against apple. it's possible there is something on the iphone that tells of another pending plot against u.s. citizens.\n\neff attorney andrew crocker says congress could make rules that force apple to cooperate.\n\nif you had a law that required them to do this in the first place, we might argue about whether that law is logical, or a good idea, or in fact is constitutional for other reasons says crocker. but it would at least establish a baseline that apple had to comply with. and that's not the case here — they were totally free to design their software the way they did.\n\ncongress may change that: several congressional committees are looking into the issue, and apple's top lawyer is scheduled to testify before a house committee next week.

how first responders are dealing with coronavirus\n\nlocal ambulance and emergency medical service agencies were already on tight budgets before coronavirus. a local ambulance crew and the head of a national ems organization tell us their concerns.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nas the coronavirus shows up in more states, first responders say that they face a potential shortage of supplies, one that could lead to more people getting sick. brett sholtis has more from member station witf in harrisburg, penn. and note of caution here for those driving - the first part of this story includes the sound of an ambulance siren.\n\nbrett sholtis, byline: when the call comes in and the klaxon sounds at susquehanna township ems, paramedic julia hanson jumps into her emergency vehicle. hanson follows her team's ambulance across town with her lights and sirens on. she says this is a pretty typical call.\n\n(soundbite of ambulance siren)\n\njulia hanson: eighty-one-year-old female - very lethargic - not responding - she is a dnr, which is a do not resuscitate.\n\nsholtis: because of coronavirus, the county 911 center is now asking callers questions to determine if someone is showing symptoms of covid-19. that's not the case on this call to a nursing home. so hanson isn't planning to wear a face mask. but that may change as more cases pop up around the country.\n\nhanson: because geriatric patients are at high risk in general - but when they're at these facilities being that close with other people in, you know, not always cleanly conditions, it's a breeding ground.\n\nsholtis: without protective gear, like the n95 face masks that are now in short supply nationwide, hanson says she could carry a virus home to vulnerable family members like her nephew, who she says is prone to respiratory illness.\n\nhanson: i worry about him. i do. i'm not worried about me. but i'm worried about him. he's just a little kid.\n\nsholtis: susquehanna ems has enough n95 masks saved up to get them through a normal year. but if they run out, at least right now, manufacturers aren't able to provide more. and this ambulance company is not alone. leslee stein-spencer is a program adviser at the national association of state ems officials. she says emergency medical service agencies around the country aren't out of masks yet.\n\nleslee stein-spencer: but they will run short if they have to continue and contain this in the next couple weeks.\n\nsholtis: the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention has said medical professionals may consider using some old, expired n95 masks.\n\nstein-spencer: but on the flip side, niosh has come out and said that they don't recommend using any expired masks.\n\nsholtis: niosh is the national institute for occupational safety and health. and it's a division of the cdc. stein-spencer adds, when emergency workers get sick, it doesn't just affect them personally. it makes it harder to keep ambulance services running.\n\nstein-spencer: if it comes to that point, you would look at alternate staffing measures. and you would look at, you know, triaging. the sickest patients would come to hospital. the other ones would not get an ambulance.\n\nmatt baily: so we keep a lot of our isolation materials down here.\n\nsholtis: back at the susquehanna ems station, director matt baily says while mask shortages are new, agencies like his have long had a hard time getting other supplies. the federal government lists shortages of 12 drugs nationwide that are considered essential for emergency workers to do their jobs. with many drugs made overseas, baily expects to see supply-chain issues like what happened in 2017 with hurricane maria.\n\nbaily: so one of the reasons we had this saline shortage - because that hurricane went through puerto rico, and there was large facilities there that were producing this for the united states.\n\nsholtis: and bailey says money alone won't fix the problem. he says the best you can hope for is up-to-date information, healthy employees and enough supplies to last until the global health emergency is over. for npr news, i'm brett sholtis in harrisburg.\n\nsimon: and this story comes to us from npr's reporting partnership with witf and kaiser health news.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
npr's staff diversity numbers, 2017\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption npr npr\n\nit's time for our annual update on the racial, ethnic and gender diversity of the npr newsroom.\n\nthe overall racial and ethnic diversity of the news and information division remained virtually unchanged as of oct. 31, 2017, when compared with the year earlier. figures supplied by npr's human resources department showed the division of 377 people to be 75.10 percent non-hispanic white (as self-identified). that compared to 75.4 percent the year earlier, when there were 350 newsroom employees. i'll repeat what i said of the 2016 numbers, which showed only incremental change over the last five years: this was a disappointing showing.\n\nyear-to-year, there were some small changes in the makeup of the remaining 25 percent of the newsroom. the percentage of employees who reported they were latino or black rose slightly; asian employees as a percentage dropped slightly. the exact numbers can be found in the accompanying charts.\n\nas for gender, the newsroom was 56.2 percent female as of oct. 31, up one percentage point from a year earlier, and the highest number in five years.\n\ni wrote about the race and ethnicity numbers last april, and talked then to many employees about their deep concerns and frustrations over the lack of progress and what they saw as the causes and ramifications. that column also included an assessment of how npr's numbers compare with those of other newsrooms. i won't repeat that assessment here, but putting the company in the context of its peers is a valuable perspective, as is hearing from a wide range of newsroom employees.\n\nthe overall racial and ethnic diversity of the news and information division remained virtually unchanged.\n\nsome people in upper management made the point last april that significant changes had contributed to npr sounding more diverse on-air, despite a lack of change in overall numbers. two top newsroom executives made similar points to me in recent weeks, arguing that the raw numbers do not reflect some of progress made on the issue. i'll give them their say here.\n\nchristopher turpin, who assumed interim leadership of npr's newsroom in november (for the year in question he was the deputy leader), told me recently when we sat down to discuss priorities for the year ahead: i am very proud we've made some good high-level diverse hires, including at the deputy managing editor level and among those who lead the newsmagazines. he added: i think that we obviously have a huge amount of work to do, but i do think that within those numbers, even though those numbers have stayed fundamentally unchanged, there are some very positive signs. obviously we're all committed to doing better.\n\none area he called out in particular was the hiring of latinos. i think we have done a very bad job around latinos and diversity, he said, adding that he would like npr to finally make progress in that area in 2018. i think it's an area where our coverage really suffers from the lack of people who have insight into a community.\n\nkeith woods, npr's vice president for newsroom training and diversity, also told me he believes that the lack of change in the overall newsroom picture does not reflect progress that has been made. there is something to be said about the leadership of this organization at the moment, he said, with a senior leadership team that has shifted in the past couple of months from overwhelmingly white male to majority female and decidedly more diverse. going down to the next level of leadership, he added, there have been significant changes, as well (as turpin noted, in the deputy managing editor ranks and show leadership). i agree with that assessment (and hope those changes at the top trickle down more widely).\n\nstill, the newsroom expanded last year, by 27 positions. that seemed to me like an opportunity to help shift the overall numbers.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption npr npr\n\nwoods said npr filled 82 positions in 2017 as of dec. 21 (a slightly different time period than the year-to-year figures). those included promotions into new jobs, conversions from temporary posts to full time, and the hiring of 35 people new to the company. of those 82, 30 were people of color, he said, or 37 percent. more than 60 percent were women. of the 35 new hires specifically, he said, 46 percent were people of color (and 63 percent were women).\n\nthat the overall newsroom numbers didn't change significantly, woods said, underscores how difficult it is to make the percentages move even in a year when we've had that level of focus and success.\n\nhe said the challenge is retention. that challenge includes routine poaching attempts by other news organizations, some of which can pay more than npr.\n\nanother perennial problem he cited is the relative lack of diversity at local public radio stations, which are logical places for npr to look when recruiting. according to corporation for public broadcasting-supplied numbers, public radio stations reported that 20.6 percent of their full-time employees as of january 2017 were minority. for part-time employees, the figure was 24.6 percent. (it should be noted that those numbers include all employees at local stations, not just newsrooms.)\n\na new corporation for public broadcasting grant, several years in the making, is funding a project designed to drive diversity in news coverage, audiences and staff. woods initiated this effort, but it is not an npr program. five employees have been hired at four stations, for what woods called an opportunity at its best for stations to deepen their understanding and coverage of the topic and make diversity stick.\n\nstill, he said, i fight constantly the urge to celebrate incremental progress because it's incremental, but the challenges we face to expand range from the finding of grant money to holding onto people. all of that has the impact that it does on our ability to grow quickly.\n\ntoggle caption npr\n\na few other notes: woods pointed to existing projects at npr, including luis clemens' work helping former npr diversity interns get jobs across the public radio system; the nextgen program, partly funded by npr, that introduces young journalists of color to public radio; and the public media village recruiting effort at annual conferences for journalists of color.\n\nmore recently, he said, every regional training program for member stations now includes a diversity component, which has vastly expanded the number of stations taking part. npr itself in the past year has put in place a far better system for training journalists joining npr, including diversity training. news managers across npr are also receiving leadership training, which includes a diversity component. a newsroom mentoring program is being launched, although it is not specifically focused on diversity. mentoring, woods said, is important for everybody and particularly important for women and people of color.\n\nemployees i've talked to would agree with him there. some women of color in the newsroom recently started putting together their own mentoring program in their free time. as one unsatisfied employee told me, this should have been done by the company.\n\nas part of our recent conversation about the npr newsroom's priorities ahead, turpin talked about efforts in the newsroom to recover from the turmoil that followed the nov. 1 ouster of newsroom leader michael oreskes amid charges of sexual harassment. these efforts include a re-evaluation of npr's newsroom culture. for many in the newsroom, issues including harassment (of all kinds) and diversity are linked, and can't be looked at in isolation. these employees continue to look for significant changes in both areas, and i've heard some tentative appreciation of the steps taken so far to address broader cultural issues.\n\ndoes this column sound like a repeat of ones i've written in the past on the topic? yes. i believe it's important to bring continued transparency to the numbers, even if — especially if — they don't change. look for the annual update a year from now. perhaps this will be the year when the numbers finally move.\n\neditorial researcher annie johnson and intern holly pretsky contributed to this report.
'i cry at night': afghan mothers struggle to feed their children in the pandemic\n\ntoggle caption diaa hadid/npr\n\nan afghan woman stands over her granddaughter in a kabul hospital ward for malnourished children. parvana, just 18 months old, keeps vomiting, but she's too weak to move on her cot. so the vomit dribbles down her neck and pools into the hem of her worn velvet tracksuit.\n\nwe didn't have enough to feed her, says her grandmother, haji rizva, who pats away the mess with the fringe of her scarf. she came to the hospital on behalf of parvana's mother, who is at home and pregnant. sometimes we only have tea for two, three days. we don't even have bread. (the women are only referred to by their first names because of the discrimination they could face if identified.)\n\ntoggle caption diaa hadid/npr\n\nhaji rizva says her sons can't find work. to get to the hospital, she had to borrow $8 for the taxi — a huge sum for her. the medical treatment is free, but haji rizva didn't know that. so she left parvana's baby brother at home with the family. she says the boy is too weak from the hunger to move but she didn't think she could afford to treat them both.\n\nabout goats and soda goats and soda is npr's global health and development blog. we tell

about our team and coverage.\n\na december report from the united nations finds that nearly half of all children younger than 5 in afghanistan, a total of some 3.1 million, are facing acute malnutrition. that's a 16% jump since june 2020.\n\nof those children, nearly a million are believed to suffer from severe acute malnutrition — effectively, starvation — and need food urgently to survive.\n\ncovid has actually accelerated a very difficult situation to begin with, says melanie galvin, the chief of nutrition in afghanistan for unicef. we've seen an escalation over the past year, even in the past few months, in estimated children in need, she says.\n\nwe have a huge number of children that are wasted. you can call it starvation. it's synonymous with starvation, she says.\n\nthe line is thin between hunger and starvation, and afghanistan's weak economy, dealt a blow by the pandemic closures, threatens to push more families over the edge, like shaista's. she requested npr only use her first name, like other afghan women in this story. last month, in her tiny home in a crowded muddy lane on the outskirts of kabul, she boiled a pot of water on the wood-burning stove to make them think that supper is coming.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption diaa hadid/npr diaa hadid/npr\n\njust wait for your father, she tells the children when they ask for food. then they fall asleep, she says. i cry at night, thinking of how i can't feed them, she says, as her brood crowds around her in their one-room home. her oldest, 15, sits protectively by the door, and her youngest, a 3-year-old girl, sits on her lap.\n\nshe estimated her age at around 35, and said of a hard life, this year was the hardest. her husband was injured in an accident. her son began selling firewood to support the family. but he hasn't sold much, because the pandemic hit and kabul shut down for weeks in the spring.\n\ntoggle caption diaa hadid/npr\n\ncorona made everything worse, says shaista. the economy hasn't recovered, and her son still doesn't sell much wood.\n\nmany other families are suffering. in a poor kabul neighborhood, women with their babies line the stairs of a building — unmarked for safety reasons — where care international runs a free medical clinic. nooria, 25, waits with her 9-month-old daughter nargis, who has a cough she can't shake.\n\nnooria used to be a teacher, but after the pandemic began, she says her employers couldn't pay her, so she quit. i didn't even have biscuits and tea to feed my daughter, she says. her husband's work as a rickshaw driver dried up, and it hasn't really picked up since the lockdown ended.\n\nher family eats when there's money for food. that includes her two children — she's also got a young son. they eat when we eat, she says. whatever we have has to be enough.\n\nnooria says the nurses here counseled her before, a few months ago when they told her nargis was malnourished.they say you have to feed her nutritious food. but if there's no money how can we feed her?\n\nthe counseling is important, health workers say, because hunger in afghanistan is more than a lack of money to buy food. in traditional households, men eat first, leaving women and children with the remains. that mindset particularly hurts pregnant and lactating women, who need more calories. the counselors advise women about the importance of breastfeeding and when to wean their children, and male health workers raise awareness with men about ensuring the women and children in their families eat well.\n\ntoggle caption diaa hadid/npr\n\none midwife at the clinic, who could not be named for security reasons following care international rules, said she saw about 35 babies every day with their mothers. of those babies, she estimates that about six to 10 were malnourished.\n\nmany of the most severe cases of malnourished babies are referred to the indira gandhi children's hospital in central kabul, where, on a recent december day, women clad in burkas clutched swaddled babies as they waited to see a doctor.\n\ninside, grandmother haji rizva was here with her granddaughter parvana. so was zareena, 30, who watched over her fifth child, 1-year-old fariba, who cried every time her mother put her down.\n\nzareena says for months, she was giving her daughter water mixed with non-dairy creamer. she says she thought it was cheap milk powder: she's illiterate and so is everybody around her. she also spooned her daughter the remains of vegetable stews and sometimes gave her bread and tea.\n\nher husband used to earn small change by hauling groceries for customers out of crowded bazaars, but the work dried up. now, her oldest boy sells old plastic bags: other families buy them to burn for fuel. he's lucky to make $2 a day. some days he brings home 50 cents.\n\nscenes like this jar with the sheer amounts that the u.s. spent in afghanistan — some $2 trillion, according to brown university's costs of war project, which investigates how much the u.s. spent on the post-9/11 wars in iraq and afghanistan. much of that spending was military-related, but congress also appropriated nearly $138 billion since 2002 for afghanistan's reconstruction. about a third of that was drained out by waste, fraud and abuse, according to the u.s. office of the special inspector general for afghanistan reconstruction, which audits and investigates that spending. and yet that still leaves billions. so why are afghans starving?\n\nit's a million dollar question, isn't it, says heather barr, co-director of the women's rights division at human rights watch, who has done research in afghanistan for the group. she says for years, international aid spending in afghanistan was chaotic and largely focused on short-term goals. it wasn't meant to solve complicated problems like malnutrition, which isn't just about providing food aid. it must be addressed by other development efforts ranging from improved access to water to educating women about proper nutrition.\n\ndiplomats meant to oversee programs often stayed no longer than a year. and as violence escalated, even good programs were thrown into disarray.\n\nthe cumulative effect of all that is pretty disastrous. we have a country which has still got some of the worst development indicators in the world after an extraordinary amount of money being spent, but a lot of that money wasn't really spent on programs that could have led to real recovery, says barr.\n\nand now, the united states and the broader international community are giving less even as the crisis escalates. this year, a pledging conference for afghanistan promised $12 billion to $13 billion dollars to the government over the next four years, 20% less than what the international community pledged in 2017, according to the afghanistan analysts network.\n\nso of those nearly one million children who are starving, galvin of unicef says the group hopes to help a third through food aid and medical treatments with the funding it has.\n\nthe international community is largely done with afghanistan, barr says. so is america, she says. there's just no realistic expectation that the u.s. is going to remain interested in afghanistan, ready to continue bankrolling afghanistan's deeply financially dependent government.\n\nand already, kids like parvana, who are lucky enough to be treated, face an uncertain future. her grandmother haji rizva says when they go back home, parvana will eat what they eat. but the cruel reality is that often, that's nothing at all.

why some georgia voters split their ballots between democrats and republicans\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption michael m. santiago/getty images michael m. santiago/getty images\n\ntwo democrats in georgia won the state's u.s. senate runoffs this week — a stunning upset after nearly two decades of republican control that also handed democrats a narrow majority in the senate.\n\nbut even though both parties ran their candidates as one ticket, nearly 20,000 georgians so far appear to have split their tickets in the two races, between democratic candidate raphael warnock and republican sen. david perdue.\n\nit didn't seem like there was a lot of daylight in terms of policy in terms of their stances on [president] trump, in terms of what they do for georgia between david perdue and kelly loeffler, said bernard fraga, a political scientist at emory university. so the fact that a relatively small number of republican voters were willing to vote for david perdue but not kelly loeffler is an interesting phenomenon.\n\nnathan muller is one of these georgians who saw daylight between the candidates where campaign strategists designed there to be none.\n\nthe software engineer from smyrna, ga., was raised republican and believes in conservative principles but has voted split ticket in the past. in this runoff, maintaining divided government in washington was a priority.\n\ni was not comfortable with democrats having 100% control of the policymaking direction of this nation, he said. however, as someone who is not a fan of trump, he found both candidates objectionable given how they tied their campaigns so closely to the president.\n\nperdue ultimately stood out as more of a known quantity, muller said.\n\nhe's more of a politician, meaning that if trump fell out of power, but [perdue] didn't, he would kind of fall back from the trumpism. i think he was just trying to get elected, so to speak.\n\nloeffler, on the other hand, did not seem that way, muller said.\n\nshe did not seem like she was just trying to get elected. she actually seemed like she believed all those things and was in the marjorie taylor greene-wing of the party, which i could not abide.\n\nloeffler sought the endorsement of greene, one of georgia's newest congresswomen who has attracted much controversy for her islamophobic remarks and espousal of conspiracy theories.\n\nmuller thinks there are other voters like him, who have turned against republicans because of what the president has done to the party.\n\nthere's got to be a wholesale rejection of trumpism to get these voters back, he said. otherwise, they're either going to keep sitting on the sidelines or keep voting for democrats like i did.\n\n[loeffler's] messaging was just so, you know, bang, bang, bang the drum for trump. 'more conservative than attila the hun' ... like, are you nuts? muller said, referring to a series of ads the loeffler campaign released, which featured an actor dressed up as the barbaric ruler from the 400s.\n\nyoutube\n\nthat ad also cost loeffler matthew mutnick's vote. he's another perdue-warnock voter, who works in finance in atlanta.\n\nmutnick had planned to vote for loeffler when she was appointed more than a year ago. i thought that she was going to be moderate, he said, citing her business background running a company that created the first regulated cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nand she just went so far to the right that it was unrecognizable to who she was maybe even a year ago.\n\nhe said warnock, a black pastor, also felt more relatable to the average georgian.\n\nloeffler campaigned to the right because of an early challenge from republican u.s. rep. doug collins, pointed out martha zoller, a conservative talk show host from gainesville and prominent loeffler supporter.\n\nbecause of doug collins being in the race initially, she had to go much farther right than i think she probably would have gone had he not been in the race, she said. i think we need to look at that going forward on what the impact of that was, and i think we still don't know.\n\nwhile their number wouldn't have made up the vote margin, zoller said, these split-ticket voters are important for republicans to keep in mind going forward.\n\nit's a swing state now. you can't just focus on your base, she said. you've got to get your base out, no doubt about it. but you've got to understand that it's basically 50/50.\n\nwil stowers, a consultant who grew up in a conservative home in kennesaw, splits his time between georgia and california and normally splits his ticket. in 2018, for example, he voted for democratic gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams and then republicans down the ballot.\n\nin this runoff, he said he knew he would be proud to have warnock represent him in the senate and felt that he understood warnock's vision. i understood what mattered to him, what he was actually running on, stowers said. that was always clear to me. he wasn't running to be, you know, an ally of anybody. he was running to be a senator from georgia.\n\nbut for loeffler, he said, there was no indication in a post-president trump world, what kind of representative she would be. we had two years of senator perdue before president trump. i knew what that was. i knew what that looked like.\n\nstowers wasn't exactly excited about voting for perdue, but he said ossoff's campaign also didn't resonate with him.\n\ni wasn't sure why he wanted to be a senator, why he wanted to represent the state of georgia, stowers said.\n\n[ossoff] really did come across as this articulate, 30-something-year-old white guy who wanted to be a senator. and i guess, maybe that was successful political labeling — it worked.\n\nkoddi lester dunn works in marketing in marietta and ultimately supported both democrats because she wants to see major policy change in response to the pandemic and voting rights. however, she did consider voting for perdue because she wasn't excited about ossoff's candidacy either.\n\nshe has voted republican in the past and understands why people would split their votes.\n\nall politics are local. and then when you go into that little booth, and you are tapping those names, you just want decent people, she said. you just want decent people that in times that you need them, to have the courage to stand up for what's right.

the call-in: teaching and school funding\n\nnpr's lulu garcia-navarro talks with rick and martha moore shaheen. both parents taught school for decades, but they told their son he can't because of low pay and lack of respect for the profession.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\ntime now for the call-in.\n\n(soundbite of corduroi's my dear)\n\ngarcia-navarro: teachers are demanding better pay and better funding for their schools. protests have spread from west virginia to oklahoma and this past week to colorado and arizona, where teachers went on strike.\n\n(soundbite of protest)\n\nunidentified protester: and i think we can say with certainty that it's up to us. it is up to us to fight for our kids and to fight for our state.\n\ngarcia-navarro: we asked you to call in with your stories about what it's like to be a public school teacher in 2018.\n\n(soundbite of call montage)\n\nunidentified teacher #1: i have a master's in adult education, but i cannot make a sustainable wage.\n\nunidentified teacher #2: i have students that are shivering. we're limited on how much paper we can use.\n\nrick shahin: my name is rick shahin (ph).\n\nno. that's what my wife and i - both teachers - told our younger son when he was considering becoming a teacher.\n\ngarcia-navarro: rick shahin's voicemail caught our attention. he taught social studies for 37 years in michigan. and we'll get to that no in a moment because it says a lot about how he thinks the job has changed. but first, here's what he loved about it.\n\nr. shahin: for those who have taught, they understand that it keeps you young. you feed off the energy of kids. and it's that feeling that every day you can walk in and make a difference no matter what happened the day before.\n\ngarcia-navarro: his wife, martha moore shahin (ph), taught english and spanish for three decades. it was a career that she aspired to ever since she was a kid.\n\nmartha moore shahin: i loved to read. i loved the power of books. and i just thought, hey, you know what? i'd like to pass some of this enthusiasm along.\n\ngarcia-navarro: but over the years, they watched as funding and respect for the profession eroded.\n\nr. shahin: the change in status for teachers came about from what was a palpable contempt for what teachers did by legislators and policymakers because most times, you know, parents and teachers are on the same page. they want to do what's best for the children that are in their charge, which is something i think the - people who have never done it don't understand that link and can't understand why it's so vital that it's a people activity, not a business activity.\n\nmoore shahin: the tax cuts and all the changes in the legislature for a long time almost seemed to demonize teachers.\n\nr. shahin: and it also explains why the schools of education in michigan enrollment have dropped by more than 50 percent in the last few years. i mean, we hear stories from the universities that this is just not a field students want to go into - i mean, the beating that teachers have taken. why would somebody go into this?\n\ngarcia-navarro: and that's exactly the point they tried to make to their son, nick (ph). but he told me that when he was growing up, he saw real enthusiasm for the profession.\n\nnick shahin: i was really proud of it. i know every day they would come home, and it would be the question of, you know, how was school today? and i could say, good. how was it for you? and i think it was something that they were both really passionate about, something that they both worked really hard toward.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so, as we heard from your parents there, a lot of people don't want to go into teaching now. but you say that you had an interest in it. what kind of conversations were you having with your parents about that?\n\nn. shahin: so, at the time, i was about a junior in high school when i'm starting to look at colleges and figure out what career path i want to take. at the time, i was enrolled in some computer science courses in my high school, and the teacher was phenomenal. and i could see that as being something i could potentially be doing, as well.\n\nbut it was at dinner one night, i had brought up the subject and said, you know, i'm thinking about potentially going to school to be a teacher. they both just said, no, you don't want to do that. and at first, i thought they were joking - you know, the old, oh, i want to do what my parents do and they say, oh, go do something else. but the more i pushed it, the more they pushed back.\n\ngarcia-navarro: do you, martha and rick, remember that conversation and why you said that?\n\nmoore shahin: i do, and i feel awful sitting here, having had a nice teaching career that i'm now saying, yeah, i told my kid don't be a teacher. but it's true. we were really seeing all the difficulties that were coming - the privatizing of schools, the charter schools that were opening up and taking money away. we had taken huge pay cuts in our last few years of work - more than 10 percent cuts to our pensions, cuts to our health care. and i thought, you know, this kid's going to do four years at u of m. that's a very expensive education, and i'd like him to do something else.\n\nr. shahin: i mean, in my family, the whole idea that in a community there was, you know - the respect was for clergy and then teachers, you know? it's just like there. and i don't think - for teachers, especially - that respect just doesn't seem to be extended by policymakers.\n\ngarcia-navarro: nick, i hear you are graduating from the university of michigan this weekend.\n\nn. shahin: i am.\n\ngarcia-navarro: congratulations.\n\nn. shahin: thank you.\n\ngarcia-navarro: what are you going to do next?\n\nn. shahin: i'll actually be heading off, starting at ford in mid-july as a ford college graduate in one of their starter positions.\n\ngarcia-navarro: do you imagine a time when maybe you could become a teacher?\n\nn. shahin: i'm hoping so. i'd hope to see the pendulum swing back the other way. i know my parents have always said, if you want to be a teacher, go work in industry for 20 years first and save up some money before you do it. and if things keep going the way they're going now, that's how it's going to be. and i'd like to, you know, as my father said, help the generations going forward.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's the shahin family - martha and rick, former teachers, and their son, nick. thank you so much.\n\nr. shahin: thank you.\n\nn. shahin: thank you.\n\nmoore shahin: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

google workers speak out about why they formed a union: 'to protect ourselves'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of raksha muthukumar courtesy of raksha muthukumar\n\nupdated 2:10 p.m. et friday\n\nafter the death of george floyd, google engineer raksha muthukumar sent an email to colleagues.\n\nin it, she pointed to a list of criminal justice reform groups and bail funds for protesters who were seeking contributions. soon after, muthukumar was summoned into a meeting with google's human relations department.\n\ni remember that was such a scary experience. it was such a mysterious hr letter. and i was texting friends who had been involved with organizing and they were like, 'oh, this is my experience with hr. this is what has happened. don't forget to take notes on it,' said muthukumar, 25, who is based in new york city.\n\nshe says she was told that a colleague was offended by her email. one of the pages she referred to did indeed contain harsh language to describe police. still, she never expected the matter to land on the radar of higher ups.\n\nit just seemed like such a neutral thing, sending a little gofundme list, muthukumar said. and that got me in trouble.\n\nfrom a stern talking-to from hr to being demoted or forced out after speaking out, stories about bristling tensions between google workers and executives have consumed the tech giant in recent months.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption noah berger/ap noah berger/ap\n\nand it was against this backdrop that muthukumar and several hundred of her colleagues did something this week rarely seen in silicon valley: they formed a labor union.\n\ncalled the alphabet workers union, after google's parent company, it now represents more than 600 google employees and contractors with the support of the communications workers of america.\n\nunlike traditional unions, this group is a so-called minority union and does not have the power to force the company to collectively bargain over pay and benefits. but organizers say that is not the point. this movement, they say, is to examine google's role in society and help reshape the company's culture.\n\nthe fear of retaliation has always been great and we've seen retaliation, so this is our chance to protect ourselves, muthukumar said.\n\nalready, the union is exerting its influence. after facebook announced it would indefinitely ban trump, and twitter temporarily suspended the president's account for several hours, the google union lambasted their bosses for not doing enough.\n\ngoogle-owned youtube did remove a video address in which trump circulates election falsehoods and glorifies the violent rioters who swarmed the capitol.\n\nthe actions were lackluster, the google union wrote.\n\nwe warned our executives about this danger, only to be ignored or given token concessions, the union said. youtube will continue to function as a vector for the growth of fascist movements if it persists in prioritizing advertisers while exposing the public.\n\nchallenging the 'massive power' of google executives\n\nfor the past year, organizers say, workers at google have been quietly plotting a way to organize the company, with plans of launching later this year.\n\nbut the union sped up its timeline after the abrupt firing in december of prominent black researcher timnit gebru, who co-led a team examining the ethics of artificial intelligence technologies. gebru was also a vocal critic of the company's diversity efforts, and the first black woman to be a research scientist at google.\n\nmore than 2,600 of gebru's former colleagues signed a public letter denouncing google's ouster of gebru — which the company insists was a resignation. the incident reignited worker fury against top executives, underscoring the need for a way to speak out without the fear of reprisal, according to union organizers.\n\nthere is massive power that has been concentrated at the executive level, said alan morales, a google engineer who is now a member of the union. as a tech employee, it's a reasonable ask to ensure that this labor is being used for something positive that makes the world a better place.\n\nthe union is a symptom of a larger shift at google, where the median pay is around $200,000. for years, employees were reluctant to publicly criticize the company.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption virginia mayo/ap virginia mayo/ap\n\nthat began to change in 2018, when 20,000 google workers around the world staged a walkout to protest how the company handled sexual harassment claims. others more recently have openly questioned some of google's work, like selling technology to u.s. border agents and the military. and accounts of how women and people of color receive different treatment at the company have circulated widely since gebru's firing.\n\nall of this, says chris benner, professor at the university of california santa cruz, helped build the momentum for google's union.\n\nit shows that broader concerns about growing income and wealth inequality in our society, and unfair labor practices, are now being shared by some of the most well-paid employees in the tech industry, said benner, who has long studied the tech sector. i would not be surprised if we saw more of this in silicon valley in the coming year.\n\nformer google executive: union could damage company's image\n\ngoogle officials declined to be interviewed about the union.\n\nbut kara silverstein, the director of google's people operations, said in a statement that the company has always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace and that it will continue engaging directly with all our employees.\n\nthat statement struck me as an example that they really don't get it, ross lajeunesse, a former google executive, told npr.\n\nuntil 2019, lajeunesse was the global head of the company's international relations. he says he was forced out of google for raising objections about working with the governments of china and saudi arabia, saying such business ventures would make the company complicit in human rights violations.\n\ngoogle disputes his firing was retaliatory, claiming lajeunesse lost his job due to company reorganization.\n\nlajeunesse says he believes upper management is likely worried the new union will damage google's image at a time when public opinion is turning against big tech.\n\nfirst thing that google executives will be concerned about is potential damage to the brand and the pr efforts the company constantly undertakes, he said.\n\nlajeunesse said the union's creation is proof that company executives have failed to engage directly with growing calls for reform from some of the company's rank and file, and that the distrust sowed between employees and management could hurt the company in the long term.\n\nreally, this should be an alarm to investors and to the board, lajeunesse said. i think there's a real risk of that talent going elsewhere.\n\neditor's note: google is among npr's financial supporters.
house passes historic health care bill\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption charles dharapak/ap charles dharapak/ap\n\ncapping a year of legislative activity and ending decades of democratic frustration, the house on sunday passed a bill that would extend health care coverage to more than 30 million americans.\n\nquoting a letter from the late sen. ted kennedy (d-ma) to president obama, house speaker nancy pelosi said, passing health care is the great unfinished business of our country. she added, that is, until today.\n\nas the gop promised, not a single republican voted for either health care measure before the chamber. this is truly a remarkable moment in the life of this nation. some say we're making history. i say we're breaking history, breaking with our best traditions, said mike pence (r-in), who chairs the house gop conference. only in washington, d.c., can you spend a trillion dollars and say that you're saving the taxpayers money.\n\n'a victory for the american people' obama's remarks on the bill's passage\n\nwith a vote count of 219 to 212, the house gave its approval to a measure initially passed by the senate on christmas eve. thirty-four democrats joined 178 republicans in voting no. that bill now goes to president obama for signing.\n\nthe house also passed a so-called reconciliation measure on a 220 to 211 vote that makes significant changes to the main health care bill. thirty-three democrats voted against the bill, along with 178 republicans. that measure heads to the senate, which is expected to begin debate within days.\n\nobama watched the votes in the white house's roosevelt room with vice president joe biden and about 40 staff aides. when the long sought 216th vote came in on the reconciliation bill — the magic number needed for passage — the room burst into applause and hugs. an exultant president exchanged a high-five with his chief of staff, rahm emanuel.\n\nwe proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things, the president said a short while later in televised remarks. we proved that this government — a government of the people and by the people — still works for the people.\n\na democratic victory lap\n\nsenate action on the reconciliation bill will be marked by extensive parliamentary maneuvering. but democrats are optimistic about their chances in that chamber.\n\nand, for now, they are giddy about passing landmark legislation to provide insurance to 32 million americans.\n\nwe have come to a defining moment in our nation's history, said james clyburn (d-sc), the house democratic whip. this is the civil rights act of the 21st century.\n\nat their victory news conference following the vote, democratic leaders gave a place of honor to john dingell (d-mi), the house's longest-serving member. dingell followed his father into a detroit-area house seat in 1955 and like his father has introduced universal health legislation throughout his career.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption j. scott applewhite/ap j. scott applewhite/ap\n\nwe finally did it, dingell said. this is an extraordinary bill. if you're looking at me, you're seeing a great big polish smile.\n\ndingell was credited with keeping at his protege rep. bart stupak (d-mi) at the negotiating table over the weekend to work out an agreement on abortion restrictions that secured the democrats' legislative victory.\n\nmr. dingell had a piece of me yesterday for quite some time, stupak told reporters sunday.\n\na fundamental transformation\n\ndemocratic presidents — as well as occasional republicans including richard m. nixon — have long sought to enact universal health care legislation. president bill clinton's failed effort in 1993-94 had taken the issue off the table for over a decade.\n\npresident obama has received considerable criticism for having over-learned the lessons of clinton's experience. in contrast to clinton's strategy of crafting a highly-detailed proposal, obama let congress work its will.\n\nwe have come to a defining moment in our nation's history. this is the civil rights act of the 21st century.\n\nthat looked like it might have been a mistake as legislation bogged down at various points — especially when it appeared to have been nearly derailed by the special election of republican sen. scott brown of massachusetts in january, costing democrats their 60-vote, filibuster-proof majority in the senate.\n\nbut democrats have now successfully jumped through most of the procedural hoops. passage of the bill represents the biggest change in domestic policy since the enactment of medicare and medicaid in 1965, says sara rosenbaum, who chairs the department of health policy at george washington university.\n\nwe have now fundamentally transformed american society, she says. we have gone from assuming many people will not have insurance to expecting that people will have insurance.\n\nhighlights of the bill\n\nthe $940 billion bill seeks to extend health coverage to most americans. medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health insurance to the poor and disabled, will be expanded to cover all adults earning less than 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nprivate health insurance will be made available to individuals and small companies through exchanges that will be run by the states. individuals who do not buy insurance face fines, as do most employers who do not offer coverage to workers.\n\nbill sponsors predict that all but about 5 percent of non-elderly americans will ultimately be covered. half of those currently uninsured will receive coverage through the expansion of medicaid and half through private insurance through the exchanges — often with subsidies that make up the bulk of the legislation's projected costs.\n\nthere will be a broad public education effort, so that people understand what's in the legislation, says ron pollack, executive director of families usa, a consumer group that lobbied for the bill. as a result, i think there's going to be growing and substantial support for the reform.\n\ntoggle caption nicholas kamm/afp/getty images\n\nsavings in the future\n\nthe congressional budget office has estimated that the legislation will reduce the federal deficit by $143 billion over the next 10 years and by some $1.2 trillion over the following decade.\n\nit's the biggest deficit reduction we will be able to vote on in this congress, and other congresses as well, said steny hoyer (d-md), the house majority leader.\n\ncritics of the bill say such savings are a fiction, as they are dependent on future congresses sticking to plans to impose major cuts in medicare and unpopular new taxes on health plans. we are creating a massive new entitlement, rep. lincoln diaz-balart (r-fl) said during floor debate sunday.\n\npledging to repeal\n\nrepublicans who are unanimous in their opposition to the legislation will continue their efforts to stymie it in the senate. they have also vowed to make the issue the centerpiece of their campaign to regain control of congress come november.\n\nthis debate is not about the uninsured, it is about socialized medicine, said rep. devin nunes (r-ca). alluding to the ghosts of totalitarianism in the soviet union, he said, with passage of this bill, they will haunt americans for generations.\n\ntwo hundred republican candidates and members of congress have signed a pledge, promulgated by the club for growth, an anti-tax group, to repeal the legislation upon the party's return to power.\n\nif this bill passes, we will have an effort to repeal the bill, house gop leader john boehner (r-oh), said on nbc's meet the press sunday. i'd have a bill on the floor the first thing out.\n\nbut even if republicans do regain control of one or both chambers, they still would have to contend with obama's potential veto of any major changes to the law, at least for two more years. and getting such changes to the president's desk might be just as problematic as passing the health bills in the first place.\n\nwhat are they going to be able to repeal without 60 votes? says robert l. laszewski, president of health policy and strategy associates. the 60-vote rule suddenly works to their disadvantage.\n\nconstitutional challenges\n\nthe legislation will face legal challenges as well. on wednesday, butch otter (r-id) became the first governor to sign a law requiring the state attorney general to sue the federal government if it forces individuals to buy health insurance – a central tenet of the legislation. other states are likely to pass similar measures, including arizona, where the question will be put directly to voters.\n\nchallenges on states' rights grounds are not likely to succeed. but because of the novelty of the requirement that individuals buy insurance, other constitutional challenges are certain.\n\ntwo attorneys for the congressional research service determined last summer that congress is on shaky ground relying on its authority to regulate interstate commerce to create the so-called individual mandate.\n\nwhether such a requirement would be constitutional under the commerce clause is perhaps the most challenging question posed by such a proposal, they wrote, as it is a novel issue whether congress may use this clause to require an

coronavirus faq: how do i protect myself from the u.k. variant?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tolga akmen/afp via getty images tolga akmen/afp via getty images\n\neach week, we answer frequently asked questions about life during the coronavirus crisis. if you have a question you'd like us to consider for a future post, email us at goatsandsoda@npr.org with the subject line: weekly coronavirus questions.\n\ni'm hearing about virus variants that might be more easily transmitted. i'm worried one might be coming soon to my neck of the woods! what precautions should i be taking?\n\nwhile covid-19 has mutated in thousands of mostly harmless ways, the world is increasingly focused on one variant detected in england, dubbed b.1.1.7, and one found in south africa, called 501.v2, because they seem to spread more easily than older strains. although not believed to be any deadlier, b.1.1.7 has now become the dominant variant in some areas of england.\n\nit's not unusual for viruses to undergo mutations — and many may be completely harmless, and many may make it less deadly and less infectious, says dr. prathit kulkarni, an assistant professor of medicine-infectious disease at baylor college of medicine in houston.\n\na dramatic rise in b.1.1.7 cases, especially in southeast london, made experts wonder if the new strain could be more infectious. while researchers are still trying to tease apart whether that's the case, or whether the rise could be attributed to a sociological change such as people mixing for the holidays, there are some biological reasons that make this strain easier to spread, kulkarni says.\n\na top hypothesis that this strain is more infectious comes from a study looking at how much virus a person generates in the nose. the research found preliminary evidence that people infected with b.1.1.7 are more likely to have high levels of virus inside their upper respiratory tracts, so that when they cough, sneeze, talk or scream, they likely expel more virus into the air. more virus in the air likely means you infect more people around you.\n\nless is known about the south african strain, but at least one of its mutations appears to alter the spike protein. so stricter steps, such as lockdowns and border controls, may be necessary to curtail spread, say experts who live in current hot spots.\n\nessentially, the measures that were implemented before that have kept transmission rates relatively stable are insufficient against this new variant, says virus expert eleanor gaunt of the university of edinburgh.\n\nin her home in scotland, before b.1.1.7, people were advised to work from home if they could while schools, colleges and cafes remained open. even with social distancing, wearing masks and hand-washing — these were insufficient to quell this variant, she says. now we have a hard lockdown with all nonessential retail closed and schools closed — and we're still at risk of a collapse of the nhs [the country's publicly funded health care system] because of the crush of patients.\n\nand those of us in the 46 states (and many countries) where the new variant hasn't been confirmed aren't necessarily off the hook. after all, the u.k. found the variant because it was looking for it, says ravina kullar, an infectious disease expert and spokeswoman for the infectious diseases society of america who witnesses hospital overload firsthand in los angeles county.\n\ni think we should assume it is everywhere, she says, pointing out that the u.s. lags behind in sequencing, ranking 43rd in the world at checking for new variants. now is the time to buckle down. there's going to come a point when we're left with no resources.\n\nin lieu of government action, it may be best to avoid other people as much as possible, gaunt says.\n\none of the big problems is people thinking as individuals and not as a global population, she says. the actions of one person have the potential for enormous impact on people they've never met. people need to be thinking that their actions can lead to the deaths of other people's grandparents. we need to be working together as a global population to do everything we can do as individuals.\n\nso is there anything we can do differently to protect ourselves from b.1.1.7?\n\nyes and no, experts say. if you've been following the oft-repeated safety protocols to the letter, you might not have much adjusting to do. but this variant is a good wake-up call for the rest of us, experts say. have you edged closer than 6 feet when you run into a neighbor on the sidewalk? has that mask slipped below your nose? are you singing two full rounds of happy birthday when you wash your hands — every time? despite pandemic fatigue, this is not the time for slacking, the prevention specialists say.\n\nthis variant will likely find the cracks in our armor. it's more likely to infect those people who aren't following the guidelines.\n\nthis is a really stark reminder that we must adhere to basic protection measures, gaunt says.\n\nso, here's a refresher on precautions to follow to a t (or beyond):\n\nphysically distance. the centers for disease control and prevention recommends 6 feet — and farther apart is always better, gaunt adds. socializing outside is not guaranteed to be risk-free, of course, but it's a lot safer than indoors, she says.\n\nmask up. universal masking should be the norm indoors (except when you're at home with your household members, of course). if you're less than 6 feet apart outside, keep your mask on, experts say. if you're not sure? err on the side of wearing it. and consider going a step further than you have before. add another layer to the mask. insert a filter. get one that fits better. if people are breathing out more virus, why not ensure that your mask stops more of it from getting to your nose?\n\nwash hands. you know the drill: wet, lather, scrub for 20 seconds, rinse, dry.\n\navoid crowds, indoors or out.\n\navoid other people indoors as much as possible. before the new strain, adam squires, an associate professor of biochemistry at the university of bath, recommended taking three of the following four measures before any encounter in an indoor situation: opening windows; masking up; keeping it less than 20 minutes; staying at least 6 feet apart. now he suggests taking all four measures ... or, better yet, don't meet indoors at all. and if you can order your groceries online, do it, gaunt says.\n\none new addition, kulkarni adds: when it's your turn, get your vaccine as soon as you can.\n\nit's important to really follow through and be as much of a stickler as you can for the recommendations, kulkarni says. and if we learn more and more recommendations come out, keep an open mind; we may need to do something inherently different.\n\nthere is an upside. if we are actually able to adhere to strict protocols, we'd be rewarded with more than personal protection, squires says. a virus mutates when its rna is incorrectly copied in a host. so when there is less virus circulating, there is less opportunity for those mistakes — making it less likely to mutate further.\n\nsheila mulrooney eldred is a freelance health journalist in minneapolis. she's written about covid-19 for medscape, mpls.st.paul magazine, science news for students and the washington post. more at sheilaeldred.pressfolios.com. on twitter: @milepostmedia
here's just how massive republicans' super tuesday turnout was\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bloomberg via getty images bloomberg via getty images\n\nif voter turnout is any indicator of enthusiasm, this year's gop voters are way, way more pumped than 2012 voters were. democrats, meanwhile? their excitement seems to have dimmed since 2008.\n\nlast night, more than 8.5 million republicans turned out to vote in the 11 gop super tuesday states that reported results. that suggests far more enthusiasm than the last time republicans picked a nominee. in those same 11 states in 2012, turnout totaled only around 4.7 million.\n\nthat makes this year's turnout in those 11 states 81 percent higher than four years ago.\n\ncontrast that with the democrats. in the dems' 11 states reporting results from last night, turnout totaled only around 5.9 million — that's around 2.6 million fewer people than came out in those states 2008, when hillary clinton and barack obama were in the middle of what would would be a long, hard-fought race.\n\nhere's how that looked on a state-by-state basis. only in colorado did democrats exceed their 2008 turnout. on the gop side, vermont was the only place with lower turnout than in 2012.\n\nthe results reflect what many are calling an enthusiasm gap between republican and democratic voters. republicans, eager to remove democrats from the white house, are looking to outsiders like donald trump to change washington. last night's exit polls showed that the overwhelming majority of republican voters are dissatisfied or angry with the federal government. democrats, meanwhile, are more content with the way things are.\n\nand while the democratic side has its own passionate voters, like the throngs of young voters who support vermont independent sen. bernie sanders, turnout just isn't close to where it was eight years ago. democrats, many of whom turned out for obama's hope and change, appear to have lost their fervor.\n\nmany speculate that these kinds of lopsided numbers (and, therefore, potentially lopsided enthusiasm) will mean a similarly lopsided advantage for the gop leading up to the general election. but then, while enthusiasm for trump may be driving many republicans to the polls now, it may in a general election also drive turnout for voters who hope to defeat the highly polarizing candidate.
'x-files' reboot brings back mulder, scully and the search for truth\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ed araquel/fox ed araquel/fox\n\nwhen the x-files appeared on tv in the 1990s, there really hadn't been anything quite like it on tv for a long time. the twilight zone, with its monsters and flying saucers and anything-goes mentality, was an obvious inspiration and precursor. but investigations of unusual or unearthly phenomena, dramatized in a weekly series in ways that could be scary or funny, or both? as tv shows go, that's about as rare a sighting as bigfoot or the loch ness monster.\n\nthe closest thing to the x-files, before the x-files, was a short-lived tv series from the post-watergate '70s called kolchak: the night stalker. in it, darren mcgavin played an old-school newspaper reporter — so old-school he wore a light-blue seersucker jacket. he chased down vampires and zombies and witches and things, only to have his stories spiked or censored by the government or his own editors.\n\nit was a clever show — sometimes creepy, sometimes comical — and when chris carter created the x-files, he cited kolchak as a key influence.\n\nthe x-files, though, has enjoyed its own dynamic from the start, thanks to the chemistry between david duchovny, as fbi agent and conspiracy theorist fox mulder, and gillian anderson, as fbi medical expert dana scully.\n\nscully was paired with mulder by her superiors and asked to report back on him and his theories. the very first time scully visits mulder's cramped basement office, where he sits surrounded by his unexplained case folders and his i want to believe ufo poster, you can tell the tension between them is going to be very dynamic indeed.\n\nthe first time around, the x-files lasted for nine seasons — the last few of them without scully and mulder, which was a mistake. there also were spinoffs, including a pair of big-screen movies, released 10 years apart — the first in 1998, the second 10 years later, long after the tv series the x-files was over.\n\nand now it's back. again. for six episodes, this time, with the possibility that all involved — duchovny, anderson, and series creator carter — may want to keep reuniting down the road for more limited-run short bursts of shows, just like the cast and crew of sherlock.\n\ni've previewed three of the six episodes about to arrive — the first airs sunday night, the second in the show's regular monday time slot — and i think they're good enough, and entertaining enough, that i hope more episodes of the x-files will be produced. to quote mulder's poster: i want to believe.\n\nthe original x-files, as it developed, was divided loosely into three types of shows. some were devoted to the ongoing story of mulder and scully's investigation into ufos and government conspiracies — the show's so-called mythology episodes. others were monster of the week episodes, similar to the structure of kolchak: the night stalker. and still others were just flat-out weird and fun — usually the ones written by darin morgan, like humbug and jose chung's from outer space.\n\nall three of those sub-genres of the x-files are represented in these six new hours, which also bring back such familiar faces (to fans of the old series) as skinner, the cigarette smoking man and the lone gunmen. there's even a new lighthearted episode written by morgan, which features a creature of the week who, when he's in human mode, dresses in the same seersucker jacket as carl kolchak. coincidence? in the world of the x-files, there are no coincidences.\n\nbut what if you're not familiar with that world? the x-files left tv nearly 14 years ago — an eternity, in tv time — and shouldn't expect viewers, especially younger ones, to know, remember or care about this show's long, extremely complicated past. the good news is, it doesn't. instead, it serves up a helpful recap via duchovny's opening narration as mulder, which kicks off sunday's new premiere episode.\n\nthe smartest thing this new x-files does is to establish instantly that mulder and scully became a couple and broke up in the years we haven't been watching them. so now there's no will they or won't they? tension — they did, then they stopped and now they're in a whole new place.\n\nthe premiere features joel mchale in a change-of-pace serious role as a conspiracy theorist with a popular tv show — but other than that, i'll let you discover the enjoyment of this new x-files series for yourself. watch for it this weekend. the truth — and the show — is out there.
twitter users blast reported plan to change display of tweets\n\nmany twitter users responded angrily after a published report said the company is planning to change how tweets are displayed. the buzzfeed article said twitter will switch this week to a curated timeline, based on an algorithm that determines what people want to see. tweets are currently displayed in reverse chronological order. twitter ceo jack dorsey says no such change is happening this week, but he didn't deny that it may happen.\n\nkelly mcevers, host:\n\nit's something that happens every day. things blow up on twitter. trends happen. hashtags are created. happy, angry tweets start flying. and over the weekend, twitter itself became a trending topic. it happened after a report came out that the company would change the way tweets are displayed, that they would show up on your timeline differently. npr's laura sydell is here to talk more about this. and laura, one of the hashtags around this has been twitter rip, as in twitter, rest in peace. why are people so upset?\n\nlaura sydell, byline: well, what happened is buzzfeed reported that an unnamed source claimed that twitter was going to start functioning more like facebook...\n\nmcevers: oh.\n\nsydell: ...and use algorithms that will curate your news feed on twitter. and this upset people because you follow people, and in real-time, they tweet something, and that's what pops up at the top of your feed.\n\nmcevers: it's chronological.\n\nsydell: it's chronological, and people have really liked that because it allows a lot of things to bubble up. you don't have to be famous to get to the top. if a tweet is good, it makes its way to the top. so, you know, something like black lives matter started at the grassroots, bubbled up, and that's why people really like the way it is. so the rest in peace was the fear that they were going to change the algorithm.\n\nmcevers: are they going to change the algorithm?\n\nsydell: hard to say. i think, you know - jack dorsey, who is the ceo of twitter, on saturday, responded with a tweet that said, i want you all to know we're always listening. we never planned to reorder timelines next week. now, mind you, he said next week, so does that mean they're thinking about it in the distant future or in the near future, just not next week? he also said, i love real time. we love live stream. it's us, and we're going to continue to refine it to make twitter feel more, not less, live. again, he didn't say explicitly, we're not going to change and put in an algorithm.\n\nmcevers: i mean, there are a lot of twitter users who are very engaged with this site. i mean, some might even say obsessed. but at the same time, twitter is having trouble building up its user base. i mean, would a new algorithm like this help?\n\nsydell: so twitter has a little over 300 million users who use it on a monthly basis. and it really hasn't been able to make a consistent profit off that. plus, growth has slowed. take facebook. facebook has, you know, over 1.5 billion users, still growing. so investors are saying, hey, come on, you know, twitter; what's going on here?\n\nmcevers: yeah.\n\nsydell: so i think that they've got to do something to make it easier to use. i think people feel that facebook - it's actually fairly - you get on there, and you can see how to use it. twitter takes some work. so there's a lot of pressure, and that, i think, is what this is all about - to make twitter easier for the average person to understand.\n\nmcevers: and i kind of have to ask. i mean, would we be having this conversation if this was some other company, not twitter?\n\nsydell: i have to admit - and, kelly, i suspect you would agree - journalists really do like twitter a lot, and we tend to follow it. and partially, that is because we use it. it is a great source for breaking news. i've used it myself. i mean, there have been moments when, you know, horrible stories - the bombing in boston or whatever - the first of time i saw it was on twitter because people were there on the ground, and they were tweeting it out.\n\nand so i think that's one of the reasons we journalists are always following twitter and excited about it. plus, it's kind of an interesting company. the current ceo, jack dorsey, came back - he's a cofounder. he came back, and he's running two companies at once. his other company is square. so he's a double ceo right now. and i think that also makes for a good story that we journalists enjoy.\n\nmcevers: that's npr's laura sydell. thank you.\n\nsydell: you're welcome.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
be like bernie: sanders looks to spread his political wealth\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mark ralston/afp/getty images mark ralston/afp/getty images\n\nthe political revolution that bernie sanders began may still be felt at the ballot box this november even if he's not the democratic nominee for president.\n\nthe vermont senator is beginning to expand his political network by helping upstart progressive congressional candidates and state legislators, lending his fundraising prowess and national fame to boost their bids.\n\nand win or lose for the white house hopeful, sanders's candidacy has given them a prominent national messenger and new energy they hope will trickle down-ballot in primaries and the general election.\n\nbernie sanders is really building this political revolution all the way up and down the ballot, said matt blizek, moveon.org's electoral field director. his entire campaign, the mantra has been 'not me, us.'\n\npolitics turns local for sanders\n\nsanders underscored that belief as he turned his attention this past week to helping several progressive candidates in races at both the national and local level.\n\non tuesday, he announced he had sent emails to his massive supporter list to raise cash for eight state legislative candidates in south carolina, wisconsin, south dakota, illinois, california, colorado and vermont.\n\nbernie believes that the path toward bold change requires leaders to take back control of state capitols around the country and ensure fair redistricting in 2020, sanders campaign manager jeff weaver wrote in a release announcing the endorsements. the leaders we're raising money for today are the members of congress, senators and presidential candidates of tomorrow.\n\nsanders followed that up on thursday when he sent a fundraising plea on behalf of former wisconsin sen. russ feingold, who's in a rematch with gop sen. ron johnson in a race critical to the balance of power in the senate.\n\nearlier this year, he'd already endorsed and sent online fundraising emails for congressional candidates lucy flores in nevada, pramila jayapal in washington and zephyr teachout in new york.\n\nbut his most shocking endorsement came over the weekend, when he told cnn's jake tapper he was backing progressive tim canova in his primary challenge to democratic national committee chairwoman debbie wasserman schultz (fla.). it's highly unusual for a sitting member of congress to endorse against another incumbent, but was unprecedented for a presidential candidate to do so, let alone the leader of the party whose nomination he's seeking.\n\nthat break may have reinforced something party stalwarts have long been skeptical of — this independent senator's commitment to the party at large. after all, rival hillary clinton — who still leads him in both pledged and superdelegates by a nearly insurmountable margin — has long been fundraising for state and national democrats. by the end of april, she had raised more than $46 million for the dnc and state parties through her hillary victory fund.\n\nsanders hasn't done that yet, and many began to wonder if the candidate would have lingering allegiance to his newly-adopted party. but his actions this week show he does have a plan to wield his legacy on other like-minded candidates — but ones who similarly eschew the democratic establishment and espouse his same populist, progressive ideals.\n\na shot in the arm for candidates\n\nfor candidates who have received the sanders blessing, it's changed the trajectory of their campaign almost overnight.\n\ncanova, a law professor who's challenging wasserman schultz in her southern florida district, was driving by himself to a campaign event when his phone started buzzing last saturday. a staffer told him they had gotten a call from a cnn producer that sanders had just endorsed him in an interview with jake tapper set to air sunday on cnn's state of the union. the next phone call was from that producer asking for a reaction.\n\ncanova was already attracting attention for his upstart challenge to the sitting dnc chairman, who has come under fire from sanders and other progressive activists for her handling of the primary campaign between the two. it was a slow burn for the liberal hopeful.\n\ntoggle caption wilfredo lee/ap\n\nbut once the sanders endorsement came, it was like a spark became a wildfire. over the weekend, he raised $250,000 after the news broke.\n\nthe sanders endorsement has been like a big shot in the arm for excitement and energy and fundraising, and i'm very grateful for his support, canova told npr in an interview tuesday.\n\nhe's had one conversation with sanders since his surprise endorsement, and said the white house candidate told him he'd been planning on endorsing him for a while. but when cnn asked about it, the timeline sped up.\n\ncanova had already endorsed sanders's presidential bid and had previously served on an advisory committee the vermont senator created on reforming the federal serve several years ago.\n\nto him, the sanders blessing is a validation of everything he's been arguing in his uphill challenge to one of the most powerful women in democratic politics — much like sanders has been doing over the past year.\n\ni think there's a real anti-incumbent mood, and it's part and parcel of this progressive wave, and i think bernie sanders has really inspired that and helped build it further, canova said.\n\nin nevada, lucy flores experienced her own windfall when sanders endorsed her congressional campaign. the former state legislator and 2014 lieutenant governor nominee is in an eight-way democratic primary for the right to challenge rep. crescent hardy, one of the most vulnerable republicans in the country.\n\nlike canova, she'd endorsed sanders long ago and campaigned for him in nevada. this time, he returned the favor, and the presidential candidate's fundraising plea on her behalf raised just under $600,000 for her campaign.\n\nit really gave us the ability to compete on big ticket items like tv and other expensive modes of communication. and it really helped us expand our campaign and be able to compete against very, very big money interests, flores said. one of her chief opponents, state senate minority whip ruben kihuen, has been endorsed by both senate minority leader harry reid, d-nev., and former president bill clinton. nevada education leader susie lee has been endorsed by emily's list.\n\nshe's hopeful that due to sanders's rise, issues they've both long been talking about like a minimum wage increase, decriminalization of marijuana and wall street reform will now stay in the forefront.\n\nit's not so much that we are all espousing views that all of a sudden became popular, flores said. those are issues that matter to the everyday person. now, because of bernie i think, people are starting to make that connection between those issues and candidates.\n\nprogressives know that presidential years are better for their chances too, where the electorate leans more democrats and a higher percentage of women, minorities and young voters turn out to the polls.\n\ntoggle caption john locher/ap\n\nand even in 2016, they'll have to prove their mettle in some of these house contests. targeted races for flores in nevada and teachout in new york are gop-held swing seats, and republicans welcome the chance to take on the most progressive nominee. and if these candidates are nominated and lose, national democrats can argue they need more moderate nominees in such toss-up races.\n\nbut flores argued that in 2014 many democrats ran away from their party, and democrats ultimately paid a price. now, she said, the issues they're talking about will energize their base and motivate them to turn out. it's a similar argument that sanders has made about clinton as he points to polls showing him performing better against presumptive gop nominee donald trump\n\nthe party was moving toward the centrist, anti-working families agenda, flores said. the result was that you saw a lot of people get disenfranchised and disenchanted with the system.\n\nif you look at the candidates that really run on being unapologetically progressive, those are the candidates that end up winning, blizek, the moveon.org field director, argued. candidates that are willing to be authentic and really speak to these voters are going to be rewarded.\n\nthe leader progressives have been waiting for?\n\nfor progressive groups who have endorsed sanders and many of the same candidates he's now backing, his turn of attention to down-ballot races is a very welcome development.\n\nthroughout this campaign, sen. sanders has been focused like a laser beam in building progressive power both in the short term and in his presidential campaign, said neil sroka, spokesman for democracy for america. i think the work that he's doing supporting a lot of the candidates that he's announced so far is a reflection of that focus.\n\ndfa, sroka said, has also recommended many candidates to sanders to endorse and is working to continue to identify like-minded progressives who could benefit from his help. and with the grassroots training they've done with sanders volunteers on things like phone banking, door-knocking and fundraising, they're hopeful that will have a trickle-down effect too.\n\na lot of people gave sen. sanders flack for not getting involved in these races earlier, but the reality is he's got a presidential campaign to run, sroka said. as a campaign themselves they should be focused on winning their race. that's one of the reasons we've stepped in.\n\nwhile other leaders like massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren has also proven critical to progressive fundraising and excitement, like-minded groups say they're excited to see how sanders uses his newfound popularity beyond the presidential cycle.\n\nwe're excited to be building infrastructure for progressives running at every level, and hopefully we're going to see in addition to the sanders energy coalescing around these house candidates, but also to activists saying, 'hey, i'm going to run for school board, i'm going to run for city council,' said stephanie taylor, co-founder of the progressive change campaign committee.\n\nprogressive leaders particularly praised sanders's attention to state-level races, something often overlooked in national politics but are contests that can prove especially critical when it comes to redistricting — which was detrimental to democrats after their massive 2010 losses.\n\nhe's bringing this national attention to down-ballot races and the importance of state legislative races. he's saying that it isn't just about the presidency, taylor said.
the puzzle of quantum reality\n\nenlarge this image pasieka/getty images/science photo library rf pasieka/getty images/science photo library rf\n\nthere's a hole at the heart of quantum physics.\n\nit's a deep hole. yet it's not a hole that prevents the theory from working. quantum physics is, by any measure, astonishingly successful. it's the theory that underpins nearly all of modern technology, from the silicon chips buried in your phone to the leds in its screen, from the nuclear hearts of the most distant space probes to the lasers in the supermarket checkout scanner. it explains why the sun shines and how your eyes can see. quantum physics works.\n\nyet the hole remains: despite the wild success of the theory, we don't really understand what it says about the world around us. the mathematics of the theory makes incredibly accurate predictions about the outcomes of experiments and natural phenomena. in order to do that so well, the theory must have captured some essential and profound truth about the nature of the world around us. yet there's a great deal of disagreement over what the theory says about reality — or even whether it says anything at all about it.\n\neven the simplest possible things become difficult to decipher in quantum physics. say you want to describe the position of a single tiny object — the location of just one electron, the simplest subatomic particle we know of. there are three dimensions, so you might expect that you need three numbers to describe the electron's location. this is certainly true in everyday life: if you want to know where i am, you need to know my latitude, my longitude, and how high above the ground i am. but in quantum physics, it turns out three numbers isn't enough. instead, you need an infinity of numbers, scattered across all of space, just to describe the position of a single electron.\n\nthis infinite collection of numbers is called a wave function, because these numbers scattered across space usually change smoothly, undulating like a wave. there's a beautiful equation that describes how wave functions wave about through space, called the schrödinger equation (after erwin schrödinger, the austrian physicist who first discovered it in 1925). wave functions mostly obey the schrödinger equation the same way a falling rock obeys newton's laws of motion: it's something like a law of nature. and as laws of nature go, it's a pretty simple one, though it can look mathematically forbidding at first.\n\nyet despite the simplicity and beauty of the schrödinger equation, wave functions are pretty weird. why would you need so much information — an infinity of numbers scattered across all of space — just to describe the position of a single object? maybe this means that the electron is smeared out somehow. but as it turns out, that's not true. when you actually look for the electron, it shows up in only one spot. and when you do find the electron, something even stranger happens: the electron's wave function temporarily stops obeying the schrödinger equation. instead, it collapses, with all of its infinity of numbers turning to zero except in the place where you found the electron.\n\nso what are wave functions? and why do they only obey the schrödinger equation sometimes? specifically, why do they only obey the schrödinger equation when nobody is looking? these unanswered questions circumscribe the hole at the heart of quantum physics. the last question, in particular, is notorious enough that it has been given a special name: the measurement problem.\n\nthe measurement problem seems like it should stop quantum physics in its tracks. what does looking or measurement mean? there's no generally agreed-upon answer to this. and that means, in turn, that we don't really know when the schrödinger equation applies and when it doesn't. and if we don't know that — if we don't know when to use this law and when instead to put it aside — how can we use the theory at all?\n\nthe pragmatic answer is that when we physicists do quantum physics, we tend to think of it only as the physics of the ultra-tiny. we usually assume that the schrödinger equation doesn't really apply to sufficiently large objects — objects like tables and chairs and humans, the things in our everyday lives. instead, as a practical matter, we assume that those objects obey the classical physics of isaac newton, and that the schrödinger equation stops applying when one of these objects interacts with something from the quantum world of the small. this works well enough to get the right answer in most cases. but almost no physicists truly believe this is how the world actually works. experiments over the past few decades have shown that quantum physics applies to larger and larger objects, and at this point few doubt that it applies to objects of all sizes. indeed, quantum physics is routinely and successfully used to describe the largest thing there is — the universe itself — in the well-established field of physical cosmology.\n\nbut if quantum physics really applies at all scales, what's the true answer to the measurement problem? what's actually going on in the quantum world? historically, the standard answer was to say that there is no measurement problem, because it's meaningless to ask what's going on when nobody's looking. the things that happen when nobody's looking are unobservable, and it's meaningless to talk about unobservable things. this position is known as the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, after the home of the great danish physicist niels bohr. bohr was the godfather of quantum physics and the primary force behind the copenhagen interpretation.\n\ndespite its historical status as the default answer to these quantum questions, the copenhagen interpretation is inadequate. it says nothing about what's going on in the world of quantum physics. in its stubborn silence on the nature of reality, it offers no explanation of why quantum physics works at all, since it can point to no feature of the world that is anything like the mathematical structures at the heart of the theory. there's no compelling logical or philosophical grounds for declaring unobservable things meaningless. and the word unobservable isn't much better defined than the word measurement anyhow. so declaring unobservable things meaningless is not only a silly position, it's a vague one. that vagueness has plagued the copenhagen interpretation from the start; today, the copenhagen interpretation has become a collective label for several mutually contradictory ideas about quantum physics.\n\ndespite this host of problems, the copenhagen interpretation was overwhelmingly dominant within the physics community for much of the 20th century, because it allowed physicists to perform accurate calculations without worrying about the thorny questions at the heart of the theory. but over the past 30 years, support for the copenhagen interpretation has eroded. many physicists still voice support for it — surveys suggest that a plurality or majority of physicists subscribe to it — but there are live alternatives that now have significant support.\n\nthe best known of these alternatives is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, which states that the schrödinger equation always applies and wave functions never collapse. instead, the universe continually splits, with every possible outcome of every event occurring somewhere in the multiverse. another alternative, pilot-wave theory, states that quantum particles are guided in their motions by waves, and that the particles in turn can exert faster-than-light influences on far-distant waves (though this cannot be used to send energy or signals faster than light).\n\nthese two ideas give two very different depictions of reality, but they both line up perfectly with the mathematics of quantum mechanics as we know it. there are also alternative theories that modify the mathematics of quantum physics, such as spontaneous-collapse theories, which suggest that the collapse of the wave function has nothing to do with measurement, and is instead a natural process that happens entirely at random.\n\nthere are many, many other alternatives. quantum foundations, the field that deals in resolving the measurement problem and the other basic questions of quantum theory, is a lively subject brimming with creative ideas. the hole at the heart of quantum physics is still there — there's still an open problem that needs solving — but there are many fascinating theories that have been proposed to solve these problems. these ideas might also point the way forward on other problems in physics, such as a theory of quantum gravity, the theory of everything that has been the ultimate goal of physicists since albert einstein.\n\nwhether that will come to pass remains to be seen. but the problems papered over by the copenhagen interpretation for so long are finally receiving the attention they deserve. and plumbing the depths of the quantum hole may yield an entirely new perspective, not just on the world of the quantum, but on the nature of reality itself.\n\nadam becker is the author of what is real?: the unfinished quest for the meaning of quantum physics, published march 20. he is a visiting scholar in the university of california, berkeley, office for history of science and technology. becker holds a phd in astrophysics from the university of michigan and a ba in philosophy and physics from cornell.

bill kurtis. and here is your host at the chase bank auditorium in downtown chicago, peter sagal.\n\npeter sagal, host:\n\nthank you, bill. thank you so much...\n\n(applause)\n\nsagal: very excited for our first show of 2016. our very special guest will be rapper, actor and movie producer ice cube. he'll be joining us later. but first, very important - there was a big dump of hillary clinton's emails right on christmas eve, right? what were they trying to hide? well, in one email in regard to a foreign crisis, secretary clinton says, quote, she only knows what she hears on npr, unquote.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: and that is scandalous because do we really want a president who only knows what she hears on npr? will she delay air force one because she's having a runway moment?\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: she'll ignore isis in favor of the crisis facing native weavers in peru.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: she'll appoint sarah koenig from serial to the attorney general.\n\n(applause)\n\nsagal: but nobody will ever get convicted.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: however, we're very glad you listen. so we'd love to hear from you, so give us a call. the number is 1-888-wait-wait - that's 1-888-924-8924. it's time to welcome our first listener contestant. hi, you're on wait wait... don't tell me.\n\nleah woodring: hi, this is leah from los angeles.\n\nsagal: hey, how are things in la?\n\nwoodring: they're beautiful. it was raining for two days, so it was like the apocalypse. but now it's nice.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: oh, the world is ending.\n\nwoodring: oh, it was terrible. we suffered.\n\nsagal: did you really? well, it's amazing to me - i used to live in la - and on the rare occasion it rained, everything would turn this amazing emerald green.\n\nwoodring: right...\n\nsagal: yeah, it's quite beautiful.\n\nwoodring: ...beautiful.\n\nsagal: yeah. well, welcome to our show, leah. let me introduce you to our panel this week. first up, it's a comedian and author of the smartest book in the world. he's got a new album now called in the ballpark. it's greg proops.\n\nwoodring: hi.\n\n(applause)\n\ngreg proops: hi.\n\nsagal: next, it's the author of the advice column ask amy, syndicated by the chicago tribune. it's amy dickinson.\n\nwoodring: hi.\n\namy dickinson: hi.\n\n(applause)\n\nsagal: and finally, it's the humorist and author of the upcoming book save room for pie out this march. it's roy blount jr..\n\nwoodring: hi, roy.\n\nroy blount, jr.: hi. how are you doing?\n\nwoodring: i'm good. how are you.\n\nblount, jr.: good, good.\n\n(applause)\n\nsagal: so leah, so glad you're with us. you're going to play who's bill this time? bill kurtis is going to recreate for you three quotations from the week's news. of course, your job - correctly identify or explain 2 out of 3. do that, you win our prize - the voice of the immortal carl kasell on your voicemail. are you ready to do this?\n\nwoodring: i'm ready.\n\nsagal: all right, your first quote is a plea for help from a brave band of patriots.\n\nkurtis: things we could use - cold-weather socks, snacks and energy drinks.\n\nsagal: so what group was pleading for snacks and warm socks to help them defend freedom?\n\nwoodring: are these the people in oregon? i can't remember his name.\n\nsagal: oh, we can't either. but yes, they are the oregon militia.\n\n(soundbite of bell, applause)\n\nsagal: they are, in fact, a group of angry hefty white people with goatees. they decided they would start civil war ii by occupying a government-owned bird sanctuary. amazingly, the federal government still stands as of show time.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: this is interesting - nobody knows what's going to happen. these guys are in trouble. they don't know it. in a very threatening open letter, a leader in the birding community - and remember, they're at a bird sanctuary - a leader in the birding community wrote, quote, we are watching your every move...\n\n(laughter)\n\ndickinson: whoa.\n\nsagal: ...and we have been watching you for a very long time, unquote.\n\ndickinson: so maybe they'll band them, you know, like...\n\nproops: little tags?\n\ndickinson: ...band and little tags, yeah.\n\nsagal: well, these are birdwatchers.\n\ndickinson: yeah.\n\nsagal: they are very observant but that's about it.\n\ndickinson: yeah.\n\nsagal: they're going to be, like, yeah, there they are. and then they're going to write...\n\ndickinson: write it down in their journal.\n\nsagal: ...lunatic redneck in their journal and go home.\n\n(laughter)\n\ndickinson: the red - the rednecked lunatic.\n\nsagal: yes, exactly.\n\nblount, jr.: don't disturb them, don't scare them. shhh...\n\nsagal: what is the bird call to attract the militia guard?\n\nblount, jr.: woo hoo.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: now, there is a big argument in the media about whether these guys should be called terrorists. you know, people are like well, don't call them a militia or protesters. they are terrorists. but that's exactly what they want. they want to be called terrorists in the same way and for the same reasons that your 3-year-old wants to be called a big boy.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: now, your next quote comes from a press release released by the government of north korea this week.\n\nkurtis: there took place a world-startling event to be specially recorded in the national history spanning 5,000 years.\n\nsagal: that was just a portion of the many pages and pages from the government of north korea bragging that they had just done what?\n\nwoodring: an h-bomb - dropped an h-bomb.\n\nsagal: set off an h-bomb - very good, leah, yes...\n\n(soundbite of bell, applause)\n\nsagal: ...right. now, they say they did. earlier this week, international monitors detected a seismic event in north korea. it could have been a nuclear explosion or just supreme leader kim jong un getting carried away in his bouncy castle.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: north korea says it was an h-bomb, but experts say it wasn't nearly powerful enough. analysts believe that the north koreans just took a regular nuclear bomb and put a big h on it.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: so this is north korea's - even if it's not an h-bomb, it was north korea's fourth and so far biggest nuclear test. that is scary. apparently, they don't have a reliable delivery system. so in the meantime, they're using ups to engineer an apocalypse. but here's the thing - if you're not their to sign for it and they can't deliver it, after the third attempt, it goes back to north korea and blows up there.\n\n(laughter)\n\ndickinson: now, i heard that this could be in part because of tension with china? had you heard about that?\n\nsagal: well, people say that there's tension with china. people say that they want more attention. i mean, basically, they're just trying to look tough. they're trying to cover up their insecurity and genuine weakness. so next, the government of north korea is expected to take over a bird sanctuary in eastern oregon.\n\n(laughter, applause)\n\nsagal: we don't want people to get carried away with this whole confiscating bomb thing. you have to listen to the bomb rights advocates. don't just close the bomb-show loophole. what about the law-abiding nation states out there who want to use nuclear weapons for hunting and fishing? like, you want to hunt all the deer there are all at once.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: all right, leah, here is your last quote.\n\nkurtis: my favorite part was people could only be stupid for 140 characters.\n\nsagal: that was sean keller. he is a user - one of many - of a certain social media company which just announced it may make a big change. what?\n\nwoodring: it's twitter.\n\nsagal: it is twitter, yes.\n\n(soundbite of bell, applause)\n\nsagal: twitter announced - or leaked - they may lift their 140 character limit on tweets and instead make it a 10,000 character limit.\n\nblount, jr.: you have fully-developed characters.\n\nsagal: exactly.\n\ndickinson: that would be awful.\n\nsagal: well, i know. i mean, because the 140 character limit...\n\ndickinson: that's the thing...\n\nsagal: that's what twitter is.\n\ndickinson: ...that's the best part.\n\nsagal: i mean, it's perfect for pungent thoughts, quick updates. they're limited, they can't go on. that's the beauty of it. twitter is like your drunk uncle at thanksgiving but he's only got a minute, right? it's limited to, like, one dinner. now twitter is - like, wants your drunk uncle to move in with you.\n\n(laughter)\n\nblount, jr.: you can't call it twitter anymore really. i mean, needs a longer name.\n\nsagal: yeah.\n\nblount, jr.: i would say woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo (ph).\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: now, i believe of all of us here, roy, you are the only one who is not on twitter.\n\nblount, jr.: i don't tweet, no.\n\nsagal: no, have you not been tempted to tweet?\n\nblount, jr.: well, sometimes i - all to myself, ill...\n\nsagal: yeah.\n\nblount, jr.: i'll go off and - but not publicly, no.\n\nsagal: no?\n\nblount, jr.: no. no, i don't tweet. i don't think they should have called it twitter.\n\nsagal: you don't think they should have called it twitter?\n\nblount, jr.: if i started to do it, i would think i'm tweeting. i don't want to do this.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: well, here's a question. as someone who tweets constantly, what do you do with the random pointless thoughts that flow through your head?\n\nblount, jr.: i come on the radio here.\n\n(laughter, applause)\n\nsagal: bill, how did leah do on our quiz?\n\nkurtis: well, the rain in southern california must've been a good sign because she got them all right.\n\nsagal: while done, leah, congratulations.\n\nwoodring: thank you so much.\n\nkurtis: thanks, leah.\n\n(applause)\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
congress' electoral count to resume after violent protests halt process\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption j. scott applewhite/ap j. scott applewhite/ap\n\nupdated at 6:38 p.m. et\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi informed house lawmakers that congress will reconvene wednesday night to continue its constitutional duty to count and certify the electoral votes after pro-trump protestors breached the capitol and forced capitol police to evacuate both the house and senate.\n\npelosi said, in consultation with leader hoyer and whip clyburn and after calls to the pentagon, the justice department and the vice president, we have decided we should proceed tonight at the capitol once it is cleared for use. she added that lawmakers expected the process to go late into the night but we are hopeful for a shorter agenda, but our purpose will be accomplished.\n\nthe u.s. capitol went into a lockdown wednesday as lawmakers were conducting a formal tally of electoral college votes and debating objections to the results.\n\nseveral republican lawmakers who publicly backed the objections were meeting wednesday evening to decide whether they would follow through with those challenges, as pressure mounted on them to stand down after an angry mob rifled through desks on the senate floor, posted pictures in top leaders' offices and were photographed with confederate flags in the hallways outside the senate chamber.\n\na woman shot during pro-trump insurrectionists' assault on the capitol today has died according to the metropolitan police spokeswoman kristin metzger.\n\nwe now will be part of history, as such a shameful picture of our country was put out to the world, instigated at the highest level, pelosi stated in her letter to members.\n\nunder the constitution, the final step in the 2020 presidential election is for a joint session of congress to meet on jan. 6 to count the votes and officially declare a winner. governors certified and sealed their states' results after electors signed off on them on dec. 14, and joe biden and kamala harris won with 306 electoral votes to president trump and vice president pence's 232 votes.\n\nthis session is typically a ceremonial affair, but this year, the protests and the lockdown highlight the bitterly divided reaction between the two major parties to the 2020 presidential election, as many republicans falsely decry rigged results.\n\nthe first objection, to arizona's results, was launched shortly after the session began. the lawmakers then began up to two hours of debate, with the house and senate debating and to vote on the objections separately.\n\naround 2 p.m. et, both chambers went into recess, however, as u.s. capitol police notified staff to shelter in place.\n\nit is unclear when the proceedings will resume. the house sergeant at arms, the top house law enforcement official, told lawmakers earlier that the capitol has been cleared but the process to ensure that the chamber was ready for the joint session appears to still be ongoing.\n\nwatch the livestream of the house floor below when it resumes, and follow more updates here.\n\nhow the joint session works\n\npence presides over the joint session, and it is his duty under the law to announce the results. members of the house and senate convened in the house chamber at 1 p.m. et.\n\nthe certificates from each state are opened and read in alphabetical order. according to gop sources familiar with the discussions about the plans, the republican lawmakers planning to object on wednesday are focused primarily on three states — arizona, georgia and pennsylvania. they are also weighing challenges against michigan, nevada and wisconsin.\n\ntexas gop sen. ted cruz signed on to the challenge regarding arizona's results and is pressing for the appointment of an electoral commission that would examine any claims related to voter fraud.\n\nmissouri republican sen. josh hawley, who was the first senator to announce he would join the house gop effort, has indicated that he is focused on pennsylvania. georgia sen. kelly loeffler, who just lost her seat in a runoff decided overnight, announced monday that she would sign on to a challenge to her home state's results.\n\nprocess for considering and voting on an objection\n\nif any house member is joined by a senator in objecting to any state's electoral vote tally, they can object and force a debate and votes. more than a dozen republican senators and a large group of house gop lawmakers had indicated they would register challenges to multiples states' results.\n\nsome of those members even acknowledged that they don't expect to succeed or change the outcome but are using the process to highlight what they believe are instances of fraud. none has provided any evidence to date, and legal challenges mounted by the trump campaign and its allies have consistently failed.\n\nif both a house member and senator register their objection in writing, the joint session is recessed, and the house and senate meet separately to debate the issue for up to two hours. members are allowed up to five minutes each to speak, and then both chambers vote. a simple majority is needed in both chambers for an objection to succeed.\n\nwith social distancing rules in place during the coronavirus pandemic, voting takes longer, so each objection could result in multiple hours of debate and voting.\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., is presiding over house debate and has tapped democratic reps. adam schiff, zoe lofgren, jamie raskin and joe neguse to lead any responses to gop objections. but democrats from states challenged by republicans are also expected to speak out against the efforts as well.\n\nin a letter to house democrats on monday evening, pelosi called the day of the joint session one of historic significance and said biden and harris won decisively. she cautioned that members should view the session as a solemn occasion and we will have a civics lesson about protecting the integrity of our democracy.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jacquelyn martin/ap jacquelyn martin/ap\n\npence, as president of the senate, is presiding over the senate debate. but iowa gop sen. chuck grassley, who is president pro tempore, is prepared to also be available if pence is not available for any portion of the debate. trump falsely claimed the vice president could alter the results, but neither the constitution nor any federal law allows for that.\n\nan administration official who was not authorized to speak on the record told npr on tuesday, the vp intends to follow the law and uphold the constitution tomorrow. this official noted that pence, who is a lawyer by training, has prepared for the joint session by meeting with the senate parliamentarian, reading legal opinions and studying the constitution.\n\npence released a statement as the session began wednesday, saying he does not have unilateral authority to reject votes. at nearly the same time, in remarks to supporters outside the white house, trump again called on pence to reject biden's win.\n\nafter each chamber votes — and no challenge is expected to garner enough votes to succeed — the members of the house and senate return to the joint session and move on to the next state. after they have processed all the results, pence will read the final tally and announce the election results for president and vice president.\n\nleaders had warned members that the process is likely to last several hours and could involve late-night votes. democrats hold the majority in the house, and roughly two dozen republicans in the senate, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., have indicated they will join democrats to certify biden as the winner, so the outcome is not in doubt.
espn hires jessica mendoza for 'sunday night baseball'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption maxx wolfson/getty images maxx wolfson/getty images\n\nespn has hired former olympic softball player jessica mendoza as a full-time sunday night baseball analyst for the upcoming mlb season.\n\nlast summer, mendoza, 35, became the first woman in the booth during the network's mlb broadcast. in september, she became a sunday night baseball regular, serving as analyst curt schilling's replacement when he was suspended after tweeting a meme that compared muslims to nazis.\n\nmendoza earned a return invitation, and in october, reached another milestone as the first woman to call a nationally televised playoff game.\n\nat the time, she spoke to npr's david greene about being in the booth during the wild card playoff game between the new york yankees and houston astros at yankee stadium.\n\nmy approach coming into it was, like, all right, this is just like the other games, you know, no big deal, mendoza said. and then you get there, and just the atmosphere was on a completely different level. i mean, there was just a ton of people down on the field. if you look up, you see billy crystal. and there's celebrities left and right. and you're like, ok, this is going to be a little bit different.\n\nas for being a woman, mendoza said it wasn't on her mind.\n\ni wasn't even thinking about my gender or anything. i literally was so in tune with the game.\n\nmendoza faced some backlash and sexist comments on social media but, she said, not as much as she expected. mendoza chalked those reactions up to resistance to change and didn't let it bother her.\n\ni mean i've been the girl always trying to play with the boys, you know? i played baseball with all boys, she said. it's the story of everything i've done. honestly, when i read those tweets, i actually got kind of a smile because then i know that i'm doing something right when i'm getting those remarks.\n\nmendoza will be joined in the booth by analyst and former mlb player aaron boone, reporter buster olney and play-by-play announcer dan shulman.
congresswoman on what it was like to be evacuated from the u.s. capitol\n\nnpr's mary louise kelly talks with rep. cori bush, d.-mo., about what it was like to be inside the u.s. capitol when pro-trump extremists broke into the building.\n\nmary louise kelly, host:\n\ndemocratic representative cori bush knows what a protest looks like. she got interested in politics after taking to the streets in ferguson, mo., in 2014. and she says that what happened today at the u.s. capitol - that was no protest but a disgrace to democracy. when i spoke with congresswoman bush earlier this evening, she told me that just before rioters broke into the building, she looked outside the house gallery, and...\n\ncori bush: i was able to see people starting to come closer up the stairs. and so i'm seeing the flags, and i'm seeing people starting to come towards the steps. and so i went on ahead and left and was able to get back to my office. and then within a matter of minutes, probably before i even made it back to my office, they had already come through the doors. so my team and i - we're safe. i'm just glad i was - we were able to get out.\n\nkelly: you're describing it so calmly and matter-of-factly. it must have been quite frightening in the moment.\n\nbush: you know, i come from protests. you know, i've been to hundreds of protests, even though this was not a protest. but the idea that i am seated now to be able to affect change with stuff like this, with an insurrection like this - because i am seated, that gives me hope. and it also helps me to remember my place. you know, my place is to use what i know. watching what happened on the television and looking out of the door, seeing what was happening while i was there - it's not what we were doing fighting for black lives. this is not it. we were fighting in defense of people's lives, making sure that people could have a decent quality of life. and the thing is, what we were witnessing today was a bunch of people who were upset because they want to side with a president who is not for all the people; a president who has decided that he wants to hold on to something that isn't his. and so they want to stand with a person, with a character, with a personality versus making sure that they are upholding and uplifting our democracy. so that's what we were witnessing. it was not a protest. it was a coup. it was a domestic terror attack.\n\nkelly: those are heavy words to hear anybody talking about - about washington, the capital of the united states, in 2021. how much responsibility, in your view, does president trump bear for this? how much does his supporters bear for this?\n\nbush: president donald trump needs to be impeached again. i know that there are people who are probably working on that right now. i hope to see that happen. he incited what happened today. he told his folks to stand by and stand down, you know, and now it was time for them to come out. and so now what did he tell them? you know, you're special. you're very special. so go ahead, and go home. the thing is, you're very special. you did a good job. you did your work today. now go ahead and go home, you know, so i can save face, you know? no, it's done. this was a racist republican attempt to overturn this election and disenfranchise the voices of black and brown and indigenous voters who delivered this election for joe biden and kamala harris and how it has led to a crisis of our democracy. and now it has incited a domestic terror attack. it must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. and i believe the republican members whose actions have incited this violence must be removed in congress. and so let me tell you i am introducing a resolution calling for the removal of any and all members of congress who have, for months, tried to steal this election and invalidate the votes of black, brown and indigenous people.\n\nkelly: you serve in congress. you have to serve with republican lawmakers. how do you work with them going forward? what do you say to them tonight?\n\nbush: that that work was dangerous - and for those that were not a part of it, they need to condemn it. you need to hold your people accountable, hold your party accountable, hold your colleagues accountable because you put the lives of people in danger today over donald trump that, at the end of the day, wouldn't stand up for you; at the end of the day, will throw you under the bus, you know? and so we want to make sure that regardless of where you stand, democrat or republican, that you cannot come and storm the united states capitol. you cannot break windows and break down doors. there is a way to make sure that your voice is heard, and this is not it. this is not it.\n\nkelly: let me ask you quickly. we just have a few seconds left. but in a sentence or two, are you optimistic that a biden-harris administration might help calm these waters?\n\nbush: you know, i don't know that it will calm it, but i will say i'm excited about it. and we are all going to work together. this is what we need right now to fix what donald trump is broken.\n\nkelly: that is representative cori bush, democrat of missouri.\n\nwe appreciate your time. we're glad you're safe.\n\nbush: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
president trump confirms 1st u.s. coronavirus death; u.s. heightens travel warnings\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption roberto schmidt/afp via getty images roberto schmidt/afp via getty images\n\nupdated at 5:54 p.m. et\n\na person in washington state has died of the new coronavirus, president trump confirmed saturday. the fatality marks the first reported death from the virus in the united states.\n\nthe patient who died was a man in his 50s with underlying medical conditions, according to washington state health officials.\n\nalso at the press conference, vice president pence, who has been put in charge of the country's coronavirus response, announced that the u.s. would elevate an advisory to americans to not travel to highly affected parts of italy and south korea. pence also announced an expansion to the already existing travel restrictions on iran, which also has a high number of cases.\n\nsince the start of the month, the state department has advised u.s. citizens not to travel to china, where the outbreak started. most of the u.s. cases involved people who had traveled to china or abroad.\n\nadditionally, the centers for disease control and prevention has confirmed the first possible outbreak in a nursing facility, also in washington state. this is unrelated to the patient who died.\n\nso far, two people at the facility — one health worker and one resident — have tested positive. more than 50 workers and residents are showing symptoms of respiratory infection. some are being hospitalized, and all are currently being tested. none of the new presumptive cases were related to travel, which health officials say could be an indication of the virus spreading within the community. in this localized area, officials say the risk to the public is increasing, although nationwide, the risk remains low.\n\nat a separate press conference in king county, wash., jeffrey duchin, the health officer for public health in seattle and king county, said the confirmed cases are likely just the tip of the iceberg.\n\ngov. jay inslee declared a state of emergency on saturday, saying it is a time to take common-sense, proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of those who live in washington state.\n\nrobert redfield, the director of the cdc, indicated at the press conference at the white house that the person who died did not have any link to foreign travel. the death comes soon after u.s. health officials began warning the public that the coronavirus now appears to be spreading within the country from person to person, independent of travel to affected areas around the world. the cdc acknowledged three other such cases, known as community spread, in the u.s. late friday night.\n\nspeaking at saturday afternoon's press conference, dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institutes of health, told the public to brace themselves for more cases in the country. redfield also said to expect more cases, describing them as likely to occur in clusters in the days ahead.\n\nyou should not be surprised by that, fauci said. that is something that is anticipated when you get community spread.\n\nthe new cases bring the total number of confirmed cases within the united states to more than 60; 44 of those cases originated aboard the diamond princess cruise ship and three other cases involve people who were brought back from wuhan, china, where the first cases were diagnosed. excluding those who were aboard the cruise ship or brought back from china, trump said 22 patients within the u.s. have the coronavirus, four of whom are very ill. another 15 are either fully recovered or are well on their way, according to the president.\n\nso healthy people, if you're healthy, you will probably go through a process and you'll be fine, trump said. there's no reason to panic at all.\n\ntrump said the person who died in washington state was a woman in her 50s; washington state health officials later said the person was a man in his 50s.\n\nthe novel coronavirus continues to spread around the globe, including a massive surge in south korea, where more than 800 new cases were confirmed between friday and saturday and more than 3,000 people are now confirmed to have the virus. the south korean government has urged its citizens to stay indoors.\n\nthough the vast majority of the more than 85,000 confirmed cases have occurred in china, the resulting disease, covid-19, is now in at least 57 countries and on every continent excluding antarctica, according to the world health organization.\n\nthe confirmation of these new cases in the u.s. may actually be somewhat delayed, in part because there was an initial backlog in testing for the virus within the u.s. a problem with the test kits that the cdc distributed across the country required most testing to happen at the cdc headquarters in atlanta. federal health officials now say they have resolved the issue and are now working to distribute new test kits across the country.\n\nadditionally, the university of california, davis medical center in sacramento, where one of the cases not linked to foreign travel is being treated, says that patient didn't meet the cdc's threshold to approve a coronavirus test at first and so diagnosis was delayed for days. the cdc defended that delay, saying cdc guidelines were broad for travelers but not for people within the u.s.\n\nmeanwhile, 124 health care workers who were likely exposed to the virus at that same uc davis medical center were sent home and told by the hospital to quarantine themselves. the workers, who have complied with the order and are being paid, view the hospital's actions as a system failure, according to a report by kqed.\n\nin total, more than 2,800 people worldwide have died from the virus so far, mostly in china, where the death rate is estimated to be around 2 percent, much lower than the death rates for previous coronavirus outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome or middle east respiratory syndrome, which had death rates of 10% and 34% respectively. the death rate of this new coronavirus could also be lower than it appears if mild cases are not being reported.\n\ndespite what could be the start of community spread, people in the u.s. do not need to change their day-to-day habits, according to redfield.\n\nthe country as a whole ... still remains at low risk, fauci said. but when we say that, we want to underscore that this is an evolving situation.\n\nhealth officials maintain that among the best ways to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus are the same as those to prevent the seasonal flu: wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching your face and stay home when feeling sick.\n\nnpr's martin kaste, richard harris and selena simmons-duffin contributed to this report.
david petraeus on soleimani\n\nsarah mccammon, host:\n\nthe targeted killing of iranian general qassem soleimani has sent shock waves through the middle east, as well as the military and foreign policy establishment here in the u.s. in iraq today, the parliament has voted for the expulsion of u.s. troops.\n\nretired general david petraeus was commander of u.s. forces in iraq and afghanistan and led the troop surge in iraq in 2007. we spoke with him prior to today's expulsion vote when he told us he had an adversarial relationship with soleimani.\n\ndavid petraeus: he sent me a message via the president of iraq during the surge in iraq at a time - about a year into it, march, late march of 2008 - when we were supporting the iraqi forces that were attacking the shia militia - the militia, in large part, that he supported - in the second-largest city in iraq, basra. the message he sent indicated that he controlled the policy for iran and that we should deal with him. it said, general petraeus, you should know that i, qassem soleimani, control the policy for iran when it comes to iraq and also syria, lebanon, gaza and afghanistan. in other words, you should deal with me if you want to try to reach some kind of resolution of this issue, short of having to continue the battle in basra, which was quite tenuous at that time. we did not deal with him. i essentially told him to pound sand.\n\nmcammon: you mentioned the shia militia's general. but there are those who see your role as instrumental in the influence of the shia militias inside iraq's u.s.-backed security forces because they were absorbed into the police. how do you respond to that?\n\npetraeus: well, there's no question that, again, there was a presence of these different militias that was emerging during my time as a three-star. there is also no question that i insisted on the removal of key leaders - all of the brigadier generals and above in the police forces, for example. there was - these were actually paramilitary police forces, not just cops on the beat - two full divisions of them.\n\nwe would refuse to reconstitute these forces, to retrain them, to fill them back up with people, equipment and weapons and so forth until the toxic leaders were removed. sadly, those leaders were returned to their positions several years later. and unfortunately, these toxic leaders were a large part of the undoing of iraq that allowed the islamic state to get back up on its feet and ultimately to come back into iraq and to defeat the iraqi security forces in the north and the west.\n\nmcammon: well, as you're no doubt aware, there is video of iraqi security forces letting militia members into the green zone to attack the u.s. embassy last week. so clearly, they continue to have influence with the security forces. what does soleimani's death actually change in terms of the situation on the ground?\n\npetraeus: well, i think it's impossible to overstate the significance of this action, really. and it was hugely disappointing to see a brigade of iraqi forces essentially surrender their mission of defending the green zone as this huge number of militia swarmed into it and then surrounded our embassy and got inside part of it, doing a lot of damage. the real question here is, of course, how do iranian forces directly and their proxies indirectly - throughout the region and beyond, including in cyberspace - respond to this attack? how does...\n\nmcammon: and what's your prediction?\n\npetraeus: ...iran now respond? well, i think iran is not in the strongest of positions, given the sanctions, a dismal economy and widespread iranian popular unrest. so i tend to think it is more likely that we will see a variety of proxy attacks. and again, iran has a lot of proxies throughout the region, thanks to the efforts of qassem soleimani. but really, this comes down to whether or not this has restored some degree of deterrence, which clearly was lacking, given what iran and their proxies were doing throughout the region, and steadily ratcheting the efforts upward.\n\nmcammon: that's your hope that this reestablishes deterrence. but iran is talking about targeting american personnel everywhere and anywhere. what are the chances this backfires?\n\npetraeus: there are chances of that, without question. i mean, look. there's no question that the tensions have been dramatically increased as a result of this action. perhaps the overlooked question is what kind of diplomatic initiative the u.s. puts forward now. this would very well, i think, be the time to - through intermediaries first and then directly with iran - to sit down and say, ok, let's stop. let's come to some agreement because this is clearly headed in a very bad direction. make no mistake about it. there will be losses on all sides if this escalates further.\n\nmcammon: that's retired general david petraeus. thanks so much for talking with us.\n\npetraeus: my pleasure, sarah. thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
'march for our lives' cost $5 million; 'several million' left for lobbying\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption chip somodevilla/getty images chip somodevilla/getty images\n\norganizers of the march for our lives rally in washington put the early cost estimate for the event at $5 million, and said they have several million dollars left to continue to push for stricter gun laws and fight gun violence.\n\ndeena katz, a hollywood producer who became involved in the early stages of planning for the march, said fundraising efforts have been successful enough to ensure continued lobbying and other activism. she did not cite a specific amount, saying donations were still being tallied.\n\ni know we've raised enough that these kids are gonna have several million dollars that they can start their fight after the march, katz said.\n\nthe teenage survivors of last month's shooting at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland, fla., were the driving force behind the march in the nation's capital. similar protests took place in cities around the country, and the world.\n\nthey put on the highly choreographed event in washington, attended by hundreds of thousands of people, in just five weeks.\n\nthe march for our lives funding, according to organizers, came from crowdfunding and other donations — including from household name celebrities such as oprah winfrey and george clooney.\n\nthe nonprofit board of the march for our lives action fund includes political figures and activists. it was formed to help organize the event, manage money and coordinate future lobbying efforts.\n\ncameron kasky, a student at stoneman douglas, started the crowdfunding campaign that had raised a total of about $3.5 million as of monday afternoon. more than 40,000 donations had been made to the campaign. the vast majority were in amounts under $1,000. the highest was $50,000.\n\nhalf of the funds raised from that campaign will go to paying for the march in washington; the other half will provide financial support to the victims and families of the parkland shooting, according to the website.\n\nsome of the biggest contributors to the cause have been celebrities. clooney and his wife, amal, pledged $500,000, and winfrey pledged to match that. director steven spielberg and hollywood producer jeffrey katzenberg also donated half a million dollars each.\n\nthe young activists have emphasized that this is still their movement — despite newfound fame and big money contributions. stoneman douglas students kasky and jaclyn corin made that point in a today show interview last week.\n\nwe don't accept influence. ... the second we let corruption, greed and money get involved with this in the wrong sense, we lose track of where we're going, kasky said.\n\npoliticians have tried to endorse us, but we're here to say you guys can support us all you want, but we're in this for ourselves, corin added. we don't want to let any adults take over because we're kids that created this whole thing, and we don't want to let adults change that.\n\njeri rhodes, the action fund board treasurer, said the young activists wanted to make sure they were heard, and they got help from people who have access to a large amount of money and from organizations and individuals who had done some pretty sophisticated productions.\n\nthe students told us all what they wanted, rhodes said, and people stepped forward.\n\nboth katz and rhodes referred to lobbying efforts as phase two for the group. rhodes is an executive at friends committee on national legislation, a quaker lobbying group that seeks to advance peace, justice, opportunity, and environmental stewardship.\n\naccording to the march for our lives website, the activists say they will fight for comprehensive gun safety legislation at the local, state and federal level and undertake voter education and ballot initiatives.\n\nthe march for our lives nonprofit has made clear that donations would fund those activities.\n\nit's governed by the board comprised of adults. organizers said that's because of legal restrictions on minors being on boards of nonprofits. the board also includes aileen adams, former los angeles deputy mayor, and nina vinik, program director for the gun violence prevention program at the joyce foundation.\n\ngeorge kieffer, chair of the board of regents of the university of california, is also on the board, as are melissa scholz, principal attorney of scholz nonprofit law, and venetta walker, vice president of programs and chief governance officer at boardsource, a d.c. nonprofit executive training organization.
trump unveils 'hard power' budget that boosts military spending\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption win mcnamee/getty images win mcnamee/getty images\n\nupdated: 5:08 p.m. et\n\nthe trump administration's new budget blueprint aims to quantify the president's nationalistic agenda in dollars and cents. the plan, released thursday morning, calls for significant increases in military and border-security spending, along with corresponding cuts in many other parts of the government.\n\nthe blueprint was designed to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong-power administration, office of management and budget director mick mulvaney explained on wednesday as he previewed the document in a briefing with reporters.\n\nit also sends a clear message domestically: this administration is willing to make drastic, controversial cuts to fund that strong-power message. that includes slashing spending on foreign aid and the environment, as well as long-standing programs aimed at boosting the arts and humanities, as well as the fortunes of the most vulnerable americans. the question now is how much the republican-controlled congress will go along with that vision.\n\nlike any white house budget, trump's blueprint is more of a political document than an accurate predictor of government spending. congress controls the purse strings and lawmakers may have very different priorities. as a statement of presidential intention, though, the blueprint is crystal clear.\n\nthis is the america first budget, said mulvaney wednesday. in fact, we wrote it using the president's own words. we went through his speeches. we went through articles that have been written about his policies ... and we turned those policies into numbers.\n\nthere's no question this is a hard-power budget, mulvaney also said wednesday. it is not a soft-power budget. this is a hard-power budget. and that was done intentionally.\n\ntrump wants lawmakers to boost military spending in the coming fiscal year by 10 percent, or $54 billion. rather than raise taxes or increase the deficit, the president is calling for equivalent cuts in other areas. foreign aid would be especially hard hit, with the state department's budget cut by about 28 percent.\n\nalongside defense, the agencies for which the white house proposes spending increases are almost entirely military- and national security-related. the department of homeland security would see a hike in funding of 6.8 percent, as would the department of veterans affairs (5.9 percent) and the national nuclear security administration (11.3 percent).\n\nthe president ran [his campaign] saying he would spend less money overseas and more money back home, mulvaney said wednesday. when you go to implement that policy, you go to things like foreign aid, and those get reduced.\n\ncritics argue the administration's single-minded focus on hard power is short-sighted, and could ultimately be detrimental to national security. they point to past comments from defense secretary james mattis, a retired marine general, who once told lawmakers, if you don't fund the state department fully, then i need to buy more ammunition, ultimately.\n\nthe white house blueprint does not address major safety net programs such as social security and medicare, which the president has promised to protect. but trump is calling for sharp cuts in discretionary spending, including the environmental protection agency.\n\nthe administration is proposing cutting the epa's budget by 31 percent, from $8.3 billion in fiscal year 2017 to $5.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. that's the largest cut among all cabinet departments and major agencies.\n\nthe budget says that slash in funding is necessary to ease the burden of unnecessary federal regulations that impose significant costs for workers and consumers without justifiable environmental benefits.\n\ninstead of carrying out many of its current functions, the agency would primarily support states and tribes in their important role protecting air, land, and water in the 21st century, the document adds.\n\nthe epa's new administrator, scott pruitt, is a longtime critic of what he sees as the agency's activist agenda. he and the president have both promised to scale back environmental regulation, including efforts to curb carbon pollution and promote alternative energy. last week, pruitt reiterated his doubts that carbon emissions are a primary contributor to climate change. that puts him at odds with the overwhelming scientific consensus.\n\nclimate research at nasa could also take a hit under trump's budget. the plan would reduce overall spending at nasa by around 1 percent, mulvaney said, but would increase spending on space exploration, which trump supports.\n\nwe're not spending money on this anymore. we consider that a waste of your money, mulvaney said about climate change research as he took questions from white house reporters at thursday's afternoon press briefing.\n\nin addition, funding for the national institutes of health would fall by 18 percent, or $5.8 billion. that cut involves a major reorganization of nih's institutes and centers, including closing some of those centers, to help focus resources on the highest priority research.\n\nin a speech to a joint session of congress last month, trump promised to bring renewed hope and opportunity to what he called our neglected inner cities. the department of housing and urban development will not be the vehicle for that effort, though.\n\nwe've spent a lot of money on housing and urban development over the last decades without a lot to show for it, mulvaney said wednesday. he added that trump prefers to invest in cities' infrastructure and school choice.\n\nnobody's going to get kicked out of their houses, mulvaney told reporters thursday afternoon, reiterating that many of the hud cuts were related to infrastructure and would be addressed in the massive infrastructure plan the president wants to implement.\n\nthe president's plan calls for a 6 percent increase in spending by the department of homeland security, including $2.6 billion to begin work on a planned border wall. the white house is also asking congress to devote $1.5 billion to the wall in the current fiscal year, which ends sept. 30.\n\ntrump claimed throughout the campaign that he would get mexico to pay for the wall, but mulvaney said thursday afternoon that, as to the source of funds, that's up to the president, the treasury and the state department and wouldn't commit to getting the funds from mexico.\n\nleading democrats on capitol hill slammed trump's budget blueprint as wrongheaded. president trump is not making anyone more secure with a budget that hollows out our economy and endangers working families, house minority leader nancy pelosi, of california, said in a statement, adding, the budget is a statement of values, and president trump has shown he does not value the future of children and working families. the senate's top democrat was more direct: democrats in congress will emphatically oppose these cuts & urge our republican colleagues to reject them as well, sen. charles schumer, of new york, said on twitter.\n\nthe two republican hill leaders were supportive of the blueprint but both signaled a long process lay ahead. i welcome the president's blueprint for next year's budget, which turns the page from the last eight years, house speaker paul ryan, of wisconsin, said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to reviewing this with the appropriations committee and our entire conference. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, of kentucky, said he pleased to see an increased focus on our national security and veterans budgets, calling them positive steps in the right direction, according to the washington examiner. but mcconnell added he looked forward to reviewing this and the full budget when it is released later this spring.\n\namong all the proposed spending hikes and cuts, some areas would see spending cuts of 100 percent. the administration wants to eliminate the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities. together, the two groups receive about $300 million annually.\n\ntrump also wants to eliminate funding for the corporation for public broadcasting, which helps to finance public radio and television stations. cpb received $445 million in the current fiscal year.\n\nseveral of these eliminated programs aim to help the poorest americans. the low income home energy assistance program (liheap) helps people pay utility bills and weatherize their homes. and the community development block grant, a part of hud, helps support affordable housing and infrastructure (among many other things).\n\ngrants to meals on wheels would also likely be eliminated as part of the cuts to the community development block grant program, and mulvaney defended those cuts thursday afternoon, claiming the block granting program was not showing any results.\n\npressed on whether cutting back or eliminating altogether programs that help the poor was not being compassionate toward people who needed help the most, mulvaney said that passing this budget was one of the most compassionate things we can do because it was being compassionate toward taxpayers who are funding those programs.\n\nthe budget also proposes eliminating the appalachian regional commission, which promotes economic development in the region stretching from northern mississippi to western new york. many counties in that swath heavily supported trump in november.\n\nnpr intern maya fitzpatrick contributed to this report.
historian henry louis gates jr. on dna testing and finding his own roots\n\nas host of the pbs series finding your roots, gates tells celebrities about their family history. he reflects on his own history and some of the more controversial aspects of dna testing.\n\ndave davies, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm dave davies in for terry gross. as we honor the memory of dr. martin luther king today, we're going to listen to an interview terry recorded with historian henry louis gates. the new season of his tv series finding your roots is now showing on pbs. in the show, notable guests discover their family roots based on genealogical research and dna results. this kind of research has been especially important for african-americans whose ancestors had their names and families taken away when they were enslaved. one episode this season explores gates' own dna and family history.\n\nprofessor gates is the director of the hutchins center for african and african-american research at harvard and has produced numerous books and documentaries about african-american history. terry spoke to henry louis gates in front of an audience last may when he was in philadelphia to receive whyy's annual lifelong learning award.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nhenry louis gates: thank you.\n\nterry gross, byline: because you've talked to everybody about their genealogy, i want to talk with you about yours and what you've learned about yourself and the larger meaning of what you've learned about yourself. and i want to start with the person who got you started in genealogy. it was really, like, the photograph of her - of your great-great-aunt jane gates. and you've...\n\ngates: great-great-grandma.\n\ngross: great-great-grandma, i mean.\n\ngates: yes.\n\ngross: yeah. thank you. so i want to read something that you wrote about her. and you got this from the 1870 census - (reading) that jane gates, age 51, female, mulatto, laundress and nurse, owns real estate valued at $1,400; born in maryland; cannot read or write. now she was born in 1819; died in 1888. you were 9 years old when you found her picture.\n\ngates: right.\n\ngross: and you got this information from the 1870 census. so reading this - that she's a mulatto; she'd been a slave - the first question that comes to my mind - and i don't know if it was the first question that came to yours - was, was she raped by the man who owned her?\n\ngates: i can't believe you asked this question because...\n\ngross: is that too personal? it's a horrible way to start, in a way.\n\ngates: well, the average african-american...\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: the average african-american is 24 percent european. now think about that. and most dna companies in the united states will tell you that they have never tested an african-american who is 100 percent from sub-saharan africa. this is called an admixture test. it measures your ancestry back 500 years approximately. so what that means is that it's the percent of - if you had a perfect family tree, what percent would be from sub-saharan africa? what percent would be from europe? what percent would be native american?\n\nafrican-american - i love to joke about this. african-americans all think that they're a descendant from a native american. and the average african-american has less than 1 percent native american ancestry, but they have 24 percent european ancestry. so where does that come from? it comes from slavery. was this an equal sexual relationship? of course not. so obviously rape or, at best, cajoled sexuality was the cause, but there are exceptions. when i did morgan freeman's family tree, it was obvious through his dna that he was descended from a white man who was an overseer on a plantation in mississippi. and we knew the name of his great-great-grandmother and the name of this white man. so overseer, slave plantation - rape, right? except in the next scene, i showed him their headstones. they were buried next to each other. as soon as the civil war ended, they became common law husband and wife...\n\ngross: wow.\n\ngates: ...which was illegal in mississippi. they lived together. they had kids, and they're buried next to each other.\n\ngross: ok. so let's get back to your great-great-grandmother.\n\ngates: ok.\n\ngross: so you assume it was not a consensual relationship, but she managed to own her own home five years after being freed from slavery.\n\ngates: for which she paid cash. so you...\n\ngross: how do you do that?\n\ngates: because of this white man. you don't get $1,400 by saving your nickels and dimes as a slave, right?\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: so obviously somebody gave her that money. she paid cash for that house in what was largely a white neighborhood. and our family - my cousin, johnny gates (ph), still owns that house to this day. it was just put on the historic...\n\ngross: that's amazing.\n\ngates: ...register in maryland. isn't that a cool thing? but i saw that photograph and read her obituary on the day that we buried my father's father, edward st. lawrence gates. and the obituary said, died this day in cumberland, md., january 6, 1888; aunt jane gates, an estimable colored woman. and that night - and then daddy showed my brother and me, dr. paul gates now, chief of dentistry at bronx-lebanon hospital...\n\ngross: very impressive.\n\ngates: yeah.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: well, it's the spirit of my mother. i could've won the nobel prize, and somebody would say congratulations. my mother would say, tell them about your brother who's a dentist.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: i go, yeah, i got a brother who's a dentist, you know? ok. so we went - my father showed us that picture and that obituary, and we went home. and the last thing i did before i went to bed was - we always had a desk in our bedrooms and had a bookcase. and on my desk set a red webster's dictionary. kids don't even know what they are anymore, but everybody here does. and the last thing i did before i went to bed on july 2, 1960, was to look up the word estimable. and that imprinted this woman's story in my mind. and the only reason that i started making the series that became finding your roots is because of that obituary and that photograph. so i'm telling this story over and over of my - of rediscovering my own lost roots. and the geneticists have found the identity finally of jane gates's paramour, the man...\n\ngross: oh, really?\n\ngates: yes. my great-great-grandfather's now been found.\n\ngross: and who is he?\n\ngates: we know he was irish from my dna. i have the ui neil haplotype. you get your y dna from your father, and that's what makes me a man. and you don't have a y dna, so that's why you're a woman. and my y dna, which is - comes in an unbroken chain, descends from this irishman. so we knew he was irish. yeah.\n\ngross: ok. on your mother's side, you found out that you had three men in the family who were freed slaves - freed before 1776. and they fought in the revolutionary war. and consequently, you are now a member of the sons of the american revolution.\n\ngates: yeah, isn't that a hoot?\n\ngross: it's amazing.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: my...\n\n(crosstalk)\n\ngates: and, you know, what's even more amazing, it's - one, it was my mother's third great grandfather - my fourth great grandfather. his name was john redman. and he fought in - for the continental army. he was a free negro, as we would have said then. and he mustered in in winchester, va., on christmas day, 1778, and was mustered down the continental army in april of 1784. it's the damnedest thing i ever heard. and what's the real showstopper for me is the fact that my three sets of my fourth great grandparents lived 18 miles from where i was born. i don't think that's true for very many people in this room or any - or many people who are watching this show. it's incredible that the mystery to my family tree - i'm looking toward africa, and it was 18 miles away in moorefield, w.va., county courthouse.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: that's incredible.\n\ngross: that's really interesting. yeah.\n\ngates: it's really interesting.\n\ngross: but when i think about your ancestors fighting in the revolutionary war and then...\n\ngates: just one. john redman.\n\ngross: just one. ok.\n\ngates: yeah.\n\ngross: and then your slightly more contemporary ancestors not having any rights in the country, you know, or very few rights - not being able to vote, having to live in segregation. it's just - when you think about american history...\n\ngates: it's mind-boggling.\n\ngross: ...it's mind-boggling. i mean, like, my - i'm second-generation american.\n\ngates: oh, you are?\n\ngross: yeah. and when my grandparents came as immigrants, my family was able to assimilate pretty easily because we're white. you know, and your family was, one of them anyways, was in the revolutionary war.\n\ngates: and think about it. they - but you're absolutely right. even if you were free and you were black...\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: ...in most states, you weren't allowed to vote. in some states - like, new york would let them vote sometimes, and then take it away. and then it was a property requirement. it was a horrible, horrible thing. it was better to be free than be a slave, but you were free but not free.\n\ngross: ok. so you found out that your ancestors were, like, 18 miles away from where you lived.\n\ngates: yeah.\n\ngross: but you also wanted to know who were your african ancestors.\n\ngates: yeah.\n\ngross: so when you had your dna done, did you have a wish for a certain area of africa or a certain group of african people who you wanted to be your ancestors?\n\ngates: yeah. no one's ever asked me that, but the answer's yes because i studied with a person who has been on your show, wole soyinka, the nigerian playwright, when i went to the university of cambridge. he was there in exile because he had been in prison and to be offering civil war for 27 months and was given a fellowship at the university of cambridge. and i showed up from yale, and he became my mentor. and so he introduced me to the yoruba people. you know, we used to say tribe, but now that's not politically correct - so the yoruba ethnic group in western nigeria. and i wanted to be from them. but when i started the series, it wasn't called finding your roots. if you remember, it was called african-american lives. i only did black people.\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: i did an episode with oprah and quincy jones and bishop t.d. jakes and chris tucker. and the dna tests we were doing at that time - when they analyzed my y dna, it went to ireland. and when they analyzed my mitochondrial dna, it went to england. i am descended from - on my father's side - from a white man who impregnated a black woman and, on my mother's side, from a white woman who was impregnated by a black man.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: so if you were a martian and came down to look at my dna results, you'd think i was a white boy, you know?\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: and then when they did my admixture, i'm 50 percent sub-saharan african and 50 percent european and virtually no native american ancestry, which really pisses my family off.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: admixture, i'm 50 percent sub-saharan african and 50 percent european and virtually no native american ancestry, which really pisses my family off.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: so you're not yoruba.\n\ngates: but then they did another special test. and i cluster more toward the yoruba than any - because 50 percent...\n\ngross: oh, ok.\n\ngates: ...of my ancestry is from sub-saharan africa. but it's just not those two genetic lines.\n\ndavies: henry louis gates speaking with terry gross in may of last year. we'll hear more after a short break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of sonny rollins' skylark)\n\ndavies: this is fresh air. and we're listening to terry's interview with henry louis gates. they spoke in front of an audience last may when gates received whyy's annual lifelong learning award. the fifth season of gates' tv series finding your roots is now running on pbs. when we left off, gates was talking about his own dna mix. testing showed he had ancestors from sub-saharan africa, ireland and england.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: so given this kind of really rich mix that you've just described and all the surprises that you've just described, what does race mean to you? what is race? does race exist?\n\ngates: no. race is a social construction. but mutations exist. biology matters. when my daughters were born, i had them tested for sickle cell because - black people are not the only people in the world that have sickle cell. but we have a disproportionately higher risk of sickle cell. you might have prostate cancer that runs in your family. you might have breast cancer. we know that brca1, brca2 - they're genetic. and if you're ashkenazi jewish, you might have a higher risk for those kind of things or tay-sachs. you can say on the one hand that race is a social construction. but on the other hand, you can't say that biology doesn't matter because it does matter. so i just wrote an essay that was published by yale university press about race. and the title is race is a social construction, but mutations are real (ph).\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: but race is...\n\ngross: have you been medically dna tested?\n\ngates: huh?\n\ngross: do you know - do you want to know your medical dna?\n\ngates: oh, my father and i were the first father and son of any race and the first african-americans fully sequenced. in 2009, when i did faces of america, a retail value of full genomic sequencing was $300,000.\n\ngross: whoa.\n\ngates: and because it was pbs, we negotiated a deal with this company illumina which sequences everybody. for $50,000, they sequenced my father, me and then 12 of the guests who were in faces of america - not a full genome but a dense genotyping. so that was a steal. now you can get a full sequence for less than $5,000 - some people say $1,000 or $2,000. that's how much the science of genetics has changed in terms of the retail market since 2009. it's incredible.\n\ngross: so you know your medical background and if you're...\n\ngates: yeah. well, i'll tell you a funny story. i told them that i did not want to know if i had any of the sort of - i don't know - the slam-dunk genes for alzheimer's disease.\n\ngross: right. right.\n\ngates: and they said, ok, we won't tell you. and so then they came in - this is a big deal back in 2008. and we filmed the whole thing. they had two geneticists. they had a medical doctor who specializes in sharing this information. they flew him in from san francisco. and another person to interpret my genetic data because it's 6 billion base pairs, right? it's a lot of data to process. and i sat down. we started to roll. and the first thing they said was, you don't have any of the genes that's going to give you alzheimer's.\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\ngates: i said, thank god. thank god. thank god.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: and my father lived to be 97 1/2 without any dementia. so i thought that i had a pretty good chance. so what i did - my father and i agreed, for science, that we'd put our genomes in the public domain so that any scholar or student can study our genome. so i'm out there.\n\ngross: right, right.\n\ngates: you know, i'm totally exposed. that's the way it is.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: so having done your, like, ancestry and everything, were you close to your parents?\n\ngates: was i close to them?\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: very close to them, yeah, particularly to my mother. when i was a boy, i was closer to my mother than my father. when i became a teenager, my father and i bonded. my father loved sports, and i didn't care about sports that much. i was more of a bookworm. and when i was a young teenager, early adolescence, my father and i connected through the news. he loved the news. and i loved the news. and my brother went off to dental school. so it was just the two of us and my mom, right?\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: that was one of the happiest days of my life when my brother went to dental school.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: he wasn't even out the door, and i moved into his bedroom. i go, goodbye. i hope you never come back, you know?\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: maybe for christmas, ok, that's fine (laughter). so then i became close to them but in two completely different ways.\n\ngross: your father died not too long ago - a few years ago. he was 97, as you said.\n\ngates: yeah.\n\ngross: because you knew so much about your family history and because the day you got interested in your family history was the day your grandfather died...\n\ngates: right.\n\ngross: ...was that reflected in the way you wanted to say goodbye to your father at the funeral?\n\ngates: yeah. you know, i try to - doing finding your roots is a way to paying homage to my mother and father every year. it's - remember, it's - my father dragged my brother and me upstairs in his parents' home and made us wait why he'd look through half a dozen of his father's scrapbooks, about which we knew nothing - complete mystery, a secret to us - looking for that obituary. and it's for my father. it's a gift - and for my mom. and it turned out - my father used to say, you know, your mother's family is really distinguished, too? and i couldn't imagine what, but two sets of those fourth great-grandparents are from my mother's line.\n\nand my mother used to write the eulogies, the obituaries for all the black people in the potomac valley, where i grew up. and they would be published in the newspaper. and then when we go - when you were buried, she would stand up. the minister would call on her. and she would stand up and read their obituary, their eulogy. and before i started school - i started school when i was, well, 5, turning 6 - i would get dressed up, and i would go to church with my mom. and i would watch this beautiful, brilliant goddess. my mother was a seamstress, as you know. and your father was a tailor, which is why we...\n\ngross: my grandfather, yeah.\n\ngates: your grandfather.\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: and my mother went to atlantic city. and we have a wall of degrees at home. and i have my mother's certificate from this vocational school where she learned to be a seamstress. and she was a beautiful woman. and i realized only recently that though i was raised to be a doctor, deep down, i really wanted to be a writer. and the reason i wanted to be a writer is that my mother wrote so beautifully and read so beautifully. so my whole life is really an attempt to honor and please my parents and make them proud of me, you know. and i hope they are.\n\ngross: but it's making me think of how much death figured into your formative thoughts - the death of your grandfather, which led you to see the picture of your great-great-grandmother, everybody's deaths through your mother memorialized in those obituaries.\n\ngates: that's true. so you're saying i should have been an undertaker. there we go.\n\ngross: yeah. that's...\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: that was my next question. yeah.\n\ngates: (laughter).\n\ngross: (laughter) so i want to change the subject a little bit. people might remember the beer summit, when you were stopped in your own home trying to unjam a lock after a long trip. and your driver was helping you - well, he was shoving his shoulder against the door trying to open it.\n\ngates: yeah, he knocked the door down.\n\ngross: he knocked it down. ok.\n\ngates: yeah. right.\n\ngross: and it was reported as if it was a break-in, and a police officer came and arrested you.\n\ngates: he arrested me. yes, he did.\n\ngross: huge story. and it really kind of deepened the racial divide in america, with everybody taking sides because...\n\ngates: for two...\n\ngross: ...the officer was white.\n\ngates: for two weeks. yeah. right.\n\ngross: ok, for two weeks. but then president obama called you both together. and he, and you, the officer and joe biden sat down, had a beer or two. it's called the beer summit.\n\ngates: right.\n\ngross: and i read you talking about this. you said that after - you had been getting death threats and these angry emails and everything. after that, everything stopped.\n\ngates: right after the beer summit, it all went away.\n\ngross: and it made me think about - because i was just reading this - it made me think about how a president can set the tone for the country on so many things, including, you know, racial issues, immigration. i think you know where i'm heading here. so (laughter) given the example that president obama set in calming down that kind of argument in america over you and this officer, what do you hear now coming from our president?\n\ngates: well, i was on the view. and one of the, you know, wonderful people on the view said did i think that donald trump is racist. i said, well, i've never met donald trump. and i think that we throw terms like that around too loosely. so i would say, you know, no, i don't think so. i have a couple black friends - i went to yale with ben carson and with ben's wife. i mean, they know donald trump. armstrong williams, a person i really admire and like, i ask him, and he said absolutely not.\n\nbut i think that donald trump's rhetoric and some of his actions - for instance, after charlottesville - encourage unfavorable race relations in the united states. and i think that that's sad. and i don't think that he understands how much power that - to heal, to bind that the oval office metaphorically has. barack obama understood that and, i think, certainly helped our nation to heal.\n\nbut on the other hand, terry, there were a lot of people who never forgave the country for electing a black man to the white house. and there were a lot of people who voted for donald trump as a repudiation vote. and i was shocked by that. remember all the talk about post-racialism that...\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: ...we thought when obama - we had turned a corner, and we could, you know, beat our - the plowshares into pruning hooks - right? - like the bible says? that's not the way it was.\n\ndavies: henry louis gates spoke with terry gross before a live audience in philadelphia last may. after a break, he'll talk about his childhood and about how dna evidence demonstrates there's no such thing as racial purity. also, journalist brian palmer talks about how slavery and the civil war are described at confederate historic sites in the south. i'm dave davies this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ndavies: this is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross. we're listening to the interview terry recorded with harvard historian, author and filmmaker henry louis gates before an audience at whyy in philadelphia last may. the new season of gates' tv series finding your roots is now running on pbs.\n\ngross: there's some people who are trying to use genealogy to out people who are white supremacists and say, oh, you think you're so pure white, that that's such a big deal?\n\ngates: right.\n\ngross: let's look at your ancestry and see who's really in it.\n\ngates: right.\n\ngross: and it's a way of outing people as not being who they think they are and not recognizing that we're all descended from so many different people. but the ancestry is being investigated against the will of the people being outed. what do you think of that?\n\ngates: well, i think that you should have the right to - you have to ask someone. you have to get permission. the only reason people...\n\ngross: i think they're doing it through records and not through, like, secretly getting their blood samples.\n\ngates: oh. no, but it - or...\n\ngross: (laughter) but - yeah.\n\ngates: now, we don't do blood anymore, right? we'd spit in a test tube.\n\ngross: oh. oh, right. right, right.\n\ngates: but everyone who's in one of those databases has given some kind of permission.\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: otherwise they wouldn't be in a database. but i think that you should have to get permission before someone is creeping around in your dna.\n\ngross: right. right.\n\ngates: don't you? but i think that one of the mottos of finding your roots is that there is no such thing as racial purity, that these people who have fantasies, these white supremacists, of this aryan brotherhood, you know, this aryan heritage that is pure and unsullied and untainted, that they're living in a dream world. it doesn't exist. we're all admixed. you know, no matter how different we appear phenotypically, under the skin we're 99.99 percent the same. and that is the lesson of finding your roots.\n\nthe lesson of finding your roots - we're all immigrants. black people came here - not willingly, of course. they came in slave ships. but they came from someplace else. even the native americans came from someplace else about 16,000 years ago. so everybody who showed up on this continent is from someplace else. and under the skin, we are almost identical genetically. and that is the strongest argument for brotherhood, sisterhood and the unity of the human species. and i make it every week over and over with finding your roots.\n\n(applause)\n\ngross: so i want to squeeze in one more question.\n\ngates: sure.\n\ngross: when you were 14, you had a football injury. and i don't know if that ruined your sports career forever, but it affected your leg forever.\n\ngates: my sports career was ruined before...\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: i've interviewed many people over the years. and i've learned that a lot of artists and writers and scholars, at some period in their life, were sick or physically laid up for an injury or...\n\ngates: oh, interesting.\n\ngross: yeah. and they stayed home, and they read. or they stayed home, and they drew. or they stayed home, and they listened to or played music. and i'm wondering if being laid up from an injury for a while affected your desire to - and your time to immerse yourself in books.\n\ngates: i was bookish from the beginning.\n\ngross: were you?\n\ngates: yeah, i loved books. my mother used to read me - the greatest book ever written to me was the poky little puppy, right?\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: and i gave it to my mother once. i found the first edition when i was an adult. and i gave it to her for birthday. and she burst into tears because she used to read me that book all the time. and my father would just make up stories and tell my brother and me. but i was in traction for - six weeks in traction when i was...\n\ngross: whoa. that's a long time when you're young.\n\ngates: yeah, i was 15 years old. and that is a long time. and by in traction, i mean on my back with my foot up with weights.\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: they don't do that anymore for this particular kind of - i had a broken hip. it was just misdiagnosed. and...\n\ngross: you had a broken hip?\n\ngates: yeah. and i was in the hospital for six weeks. and it's just crazy. and a doctor from the philippines taught me to play chess at west virginia university medical center in morgantown, w.va. and he'd come around in rounds. and we'd have the chess board set up. and he'd make a couple - a move. then he'd come back. and then he'd - and i read quite a lot. but i also watched tv. and tv was on kind of like the hearth in new england.\n\ngross: yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\ngates: our tv - when we woke up, the tv was on, and nobody ever turned it off until you went to sleep. and i watched reruns of early black films like amos 'n' andy and beulah. all that was on still in 1965 in syndication. and i learned a lot about the medium. and deep down, i realized in retrospect that my desire to make films was probably born about that time.\n\ngross: did you watch old movies on tv?\n\ngates: yeah, i loved them.\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: and we - they only put - remember the late show?\n\ngross: oh, yeah.\n\ngates: and then there was the late late show. and at the time, the airwaves were so segregated, they only put black films on the late late show. and then black people would tell each other - they would say, you know, be sure to watch the late late show tonight because imitation of life, which is my favorite film - 1934, with claudette colbert. and when this little girl's passing for - she passes for white and breaks her mother's heart. and she come to - it's the woman who invents box pancake mix - right? - like the aunt jemima figure. and she's the cook for claudette colbert. and she and claudette colbert are both unmarried mothers. and she invents this pancake mix, and they become fabulously wealthy. and the black woman says all she wants is enough money to have a new orleans-type funeral. so everybody knew that this whole thing was building to the climax when delilah - is her name - the character. and she dies of a broken heart because her little girl passes for white and goes off - and never sees her again.\n\nand you - the last scene is the funeral. and they have a horse-drawn carriage. it's beautiful. and they got the brothers in uniforms with swords and stuff coming out of the church with this sad, black church music. and then you see this white girl next to claudette colbert. and you realize it's peola, grown up, coming back. and she throws herself on the casket. mama - i'm sorry, mama. i killed my mama. and at this point, i'd run over to my mother and say, mama, i'll never pass for white, mama.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: i'll never - i love you, mama. i love you. i love you being black. i'm going to be black.\n\ngross: but you had family that passed for white.\n\ngates: oh, yeah.\n\ngross: you had family that passed for white.\n\ngates: yeah, yeah.\n\ngross: yeah.\n\ngates: the gateses all looked - my father looked white.\n\ngross: i saw his picture in the obituary. he looked white.\n\ngates: yeah, yeah. and my grandfather was so white, we called him casper behind his back.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: but i have an announcement to make...\n\ngross: yes.\n\ngates: ...for you. in front of all these people and all these viewers. i'm here to ask, on behalf of our production staff, if you will be a guest in next season...\n\ngross: oh, you're kidding (laughter).\n\ngates: ...of finding your roots. yeah. would you do it?\n\ngross: yeah.\n\n(applause)\n\ngates: ok.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: got you.\n\ngross: all right.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngates: she can't even talk.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: i can't - stunned.\n\ngates: terry gross speechless - first time in 35 years.\n\ngross: totally stunned. i regret we are out of time.\n\ngates: ok. i can do it. this is fresh air.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: it has been a great honor to speak with you. thank you so much for accepting this award. and...\n\ngates: thank you.\n\ngross: ...thank you for all of all of the things you've written for your tv shows, for your movies. thank you for being you.\n\ngates: thank you, darling. thank you.\n\n(applause)\n\ngates: salt and pepper (laughter).\n\ngross: terry gross interviewed henry louis gates last may when he was in philadelphia to accept the whyy lifelong learning award. gates is the host of the tv genealogy series finding your roots. terry will be one of the guests whose family history is explored next year in the sixth season of the show. the fifth season of finding your roots is currently showing on pbs. coming up, journalist brian palmer talks about how slavery and the civil war are described at confederate historic sites in the south. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of allen toussaint's egyptian fantasy)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
major oil companies take a pass on controversial lease sale in arctic refuge\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption u.s. fish and wildlife service u.s. fish and wildlife service\n\nupdated at 7:54 pm et\n\none of the trump administration's biggest environmental rollbacks suffered a stunning setback wednesday, as a decades-long push to drill for oil in alaska's arctic national wildlife refuge ended with a lease sale that attracted just three bidders — one of which was the state of alaska itself.\n\nalaska's state-owned economic development corporation was the only bidder on nine of the parcels offered for lease in the northernmost swath of the refuge, known as the coastal plain. two small companies also each picked up a single parcel.\n\nhalf of the offered leases drew no bids at all.\n\nthey held the lease in anwr — that is history-making. that will be recorded in the history books and people will talk about it, said larry persily, a longtime observer of the oil and gas industry in alaska . but no one showed up.\n\nthe sale generated a tiny fraction of the revenue it was projected to raise.\n\nit was a striking moment in a 40-year fight over drilling in the coastal plain, an area that's home to migrating caribou, polar bears, birds and other wildlife. it also potentially sits atop billions of barrels of oil, according to federal estimates.\n\nbut amid a global recession, low oil prices and an aggressive pressure campaign against leasing by drilling opponents, oil analysts have for months been predicting little interest in the sale.\n\npersily took the sale as evidence that while drilling in the refuge remains a long-held dream of some politicians, it is no longer treasured by oil companies.\n\nit was, in the oil industry terms, a dry hole. a bust, he said. they had the lease sale, the administration can feel good about it, but no one's going to see any oil coming out of anwr.\n\neven kara moriarty, head of the alaska oil and gas association, acknowledged that the sale results weren't as robust as expected. but she said the industry still supports future access to the coastal plain.\n\ntoday's sale reflects the brutal economic realities the oil and gas industry continues to face after the unprecedented events of 2020, coupled with ongoing regulatory uncertainty, she said in a statement.\n\nthe lease sale raised a total of $14.4 million in bids, according to the bureau of land management, the federal agency that held the sale. nearly all of that came from alaska's state-owned economic development corporation, the alaska industrial development and export authority.\n\nhalf of the cash will go to the federal government, and half will go back to the state of alaska.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption liz ruskin/alaska public media liz ruskin/alaska public media\n\nthe amount raised is nowhere near what was projected when a republican-led congress officially opened the coastal plain to drilling in 2017 as part of the tax cuts and jobs act. the bill ordered two lease sales, the first by the end of this year, with the revenue aimed at offsetting massive tax cuts.\n\ndespite the lack of industry interest, alaska's congressional delegation applauded the sale on wednesday, and so did officials with the bureau of land management, describing it as historic and a success.\n\nit was a joke\n\nopponents had a different reaction.\n\ni laughed out loud. it was a joke. a joke to the american people, said desirée sorenson-groves, director of the arctic refuge defense campaign.\n\ni'll tell you, i have a message to those who bid today, there were only three. but here's the message: 'you will never ever drill in the arctic refuge. we'll stop you.'\n\nthe land that received no bids on wednesday will not be leased in this sale.\n\nof the two small companies that did win leases, one is regenerate alaska, a subsidiary of australia-based 88 energy. the other is knik arm services, a small alaska company managed by an investor named mark graber.\n\nthe state-owned entity which dominated the sale, has never held federal oil leases before.\n\nbut alaska politicians, including former republican gov. frank murkowski, recently pushed the state to bid, citing the lack of industry interest. murkowski, in an interview wednesday, said he expects the corporation to eventually partner with companies to do the actual drilling.\n\nwe'll see how good an investment it is when we see what the interest is from some companies to negotiate, he said.\n\nthe oil leases are still not finalized.\n\nthat process, which includes an anti-trust review by the u.s. department of justice, typically takes about two months. but the trump administration is expected to rush to issue the leases formally before the president leaves office in two weeks.\n\neven if it succeeds, additional oil leasing and drilling in the refuge will face headwinds, said u.s. rep. jared huffman, d-calif., a longtime drilling opponent.\n\nhe said his next step will be pushing for permanent protection for the arctic refuge. he's likely to have support from a biden administration. the president-elect and his appointee to lead the interior department have both said they oppose drilling there, and georgia's run-off elections give democrats control of the senate along with the house.\n\nhuffman said he's open to a

trump regulator's rule would force banks to lend to gun-makers and oil drillers\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption elaine thompson/ap elaine thompson/ap\n\nthe trump administration is trying to push through a last-minute rule that could force banks to offer loans to gun-makers and oil exploration companies or to finance high-cost payday lenders.\n\nthe move follows announcements by the biggest u.s. banks that there are some industries and activities they don't want to finance, such as drilling for oil in alaska's arctic national wildlife refuge or making loans to gun manufacturers who make assault-style weapons. some major banks have sworn off making those loans.\n\n\n\nnow, a trump-appointed banking regulator is pushing for a rule that considers that an unfair, discriminatory practice.\n\nit's a very poorly constructed rule, says john court, the head of regulatory affairs at the bank policy institute, which represents the biggest banks in the country. he says the rule is clearly hastily conceived and hastily constructed.\n\nthe rule was proposed in november after president trump lost his reelection bid. and court says it appears that the trump-appointed acting head of the office of the comptroller of the currency is scrambling to enact it before the biden administration begins next week.\n\ncourt says many financial firms are getting more focused on environmental, social, and governance — or esg — issues.\n\namong those are racial equality, climate, other issues, court says. and this proposal clearly would undercut the ability of a banking organization to achieve or administer any so-called esg goals that it might have.\n\nthe rule is based on the concept of fair access to credit, which traditionally had to do with preventing racial discrimination.\n\nthe occ declined an interview. acting head brian brooks said in a press release that fair access to financial services, credit, and capital are essential to our economy.\n\nbut critics say the rule is really about forcing banks to finance firearms companies that make assault-style rifles, or even predatory payday lenders that charge 300% in annual interest.\n\npayday lenders not only disproportionately harm people of color, they target communities of color, says rebecca borné, a lawyer with the nonprofit center for responsible lending.\n\nso the agency is really taking the language of civil rights to do something that's fundamentally inconsistent with the original intent of that language. says borné. the result, she adds, would be to exacerbate lending discrimination, cloaking it in this language of civil rights.\n\nthe main trade group for payday lenders, infin, said in a statement that it supports steps by the occ to protect legal businesses from discrimination under the proposed fair access rule.\n\nif the trump administration finalizes the rule before president-elect joe biden takes office, court says that would make it harder, but not impossible, for the new administration to undo it. and he says if it comes to it, banks would likely sue to try to stop the rule.\n\nit's removing the ability to make decisions, it's removing that from the bank and effectively vesting it in a government mandate, he says.\n\nand court says the rule is so broadly written that it would apply to mundane business decisions as well as broader ones based on what the management of the bank thinks is good or bad for society — whether that involves climate change, assault rifles, payday lending, or anything else.\n\nthe rule could also be scrapped by congress through an oversight tool called the congressional review act, especially since democrats will now control both the house and the senate.
hum along with male plainfin midshipman fish\n\nit's time for another installment in our occasional series wild sounds — short stories that take you to remote parts of the world to hear the sounds of rare animals. biologist andy bass of cornell university explains what makes the plainfin midshipman fish hum.\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\nso that's the sound of prosperity. and next, we will hear a sound from nature. our series wild sounds puts a microphone to the animal kingdom. biologist andy bass of cornell university has been listening to the midshipman fish.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish humming)\n\ndr. andy bass (biologist, cornell university): it's from the plainfin midshipman fish. they have an air-filled bladder known as a swim bladder that most fishes use to change their position in the water column, but many fish have secondarily adapted this organ for sound production.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish humming)\n\ndr. bass: individual males build a territory, if you will, under a rock shelter. and from that rocky shelter, they produce that hum advertisement call to attract females to their nest.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish humming)\n\ndr. bass: we put a hydrophone out by a nest, and then at night, which is when they start becoming very vocal, we can record all of those sounds.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish humming)\n\ndr. bass: now the other sound you heard coming in in the background is the hum from a neighboring male.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish humming)\n\ndr. bass: the other guy is humming at the same time, competing, perhaps, with that other male, trying to attract a female to his nest.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish humming and grunting)\n\ndr. bass: the grunt is the simplest signal that they produce. it's very brief in duration. it appears to depend on whether or not another male actually gets inside of a nest of a male.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish grunting)\n\ndr. bass: what we've discovered is the same regions of the brain that a fish uses to produce sound - in fact, i can show you those same regions in the brain of a human or a bird or a frog.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish humming)\n\ndr. bass: we were out recording these sounds at the study site up in washington state. and then sure enough, right about 9:00 at night, suddenly, the water becomes alive with sound. and it goes on for hours. and it's just incredible to listen to. we're sitting there with earphones clipped to our heads listening to these fish all night making these growls and hums and grunts.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish humming)\n\ninskeep: thanks to npr's christopher joyce for tracking down our wild sounds, including the midshipman fish, which are part of the cornell laboratory of ornithology collection. you can find out more about the fish at npr.org.\n\n(soundbite of plainfin midshipman fish humming)\n\ninskeep: this is npr news.\n\ncopyright © 2009 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
in 'herself' a mother (literally) rebuilds her life after domestic abuse\n\nnpr's scott simon talks to director phyllida lloyd about her new movie, herself, where she tackles the subject of domestic violence.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nthere is already oscar talk in variety magazine - 2021 oscar talk - for phyllida lloyd's new film herself - small, relatively short film with no big-name stars, no cgi super-natural avengers or warriors, but was a standout at the last sundance film festival. it opens with sandra, a mother, dancing joyfully in the kitchen with her two young daughters.\n\n(soundbite of film, herself)\n\nclare dunne: (singing, as sandra) like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist.\n\n(laughter)\n\nunidentified actor #1: (as character) daddy.\n\nunidentified actor #2: (as character) daddy.\n\nian lloyd anderson: (as gary, laughter).\n\nunidentified actor #2: (as character) dance with us, please.\n\nanderson: (as gary) ah, geez. will you just let me get in the door? will you do something for me? will you go outside and play and let me talk to your ma?\n\ndunne: (as sandra) ah, gary.\n\nunidentified actor #1: (as character) please, i don't want to go out.\n\ndunne: (as sandra) it's cold out.\n\nunidentified actor #1: (as character) please.\n\nanderson: (as gary) they have coats. go on.\n\nunidentified actor #1: (as character) please.\n\nanderson: (as gary) out.\n\nunidentified actor #1: (as character) please.\n\nanderson: (as gary) now.\n\nsimon: we see that sandra and her daughters are about to escape from a brutal relationship. and sandra is determined to build not just a new life for her family, but a home, and by hand. herself stars clare dunne, who also co-wrote the screenplay, dame harriet walter and conleth hill. and phyllida lloyd, cbe, joins us now. thanks so much for being with us.\n\nphyllida lloyd: thank you for having me.\n\nsimon: you've directed some big-budget films with household names - mamma mia, the iron lady. what drew you to tell this story in this way?\n\nlloyd: well, i'd been looking to do a lower budget film for several years. and clare dunne and harriet walter, who also plays in herself, and i were working together in an all-female theater troupe. we were performing shakespeare set in women's prisons. and we were very preoccupied by the number of women we met whose journey into the criminal justice system had begun against a background of abuse in childhood. and then clare had a friend who became homeless in her hometown of dublin. she was a single mom with three kids. and clare was just so outraged at the lack of support for her that she sat down and started writing this, her first screenplay. i think, you know, we've all seen the story of the so-called battered woman, but i hadn't read a story like this.\n\nsimon: and my gosh, i will attest, the results are absolutely stunning. one of the themes that weaves in and out of the story of the building of the house is, as you note, how daunting it is legally and socially for a battered woman to find support in ireland. and i - my reporting tells me it is not dramatically different in the u.s. and the u.k.\n\nlloyd: no. i think that's one of the huge issues in the u.k. and ireland, that there's very little social housing, very little rental accommodation that ordinary people can afford. and so people are ending up - there are about 10,000 families in dublin, which is a very small city, living in hotel accommodation, sometimes for up to three years - you know, families living in one room and miles away from their schools and their communities. and this is what we saw when we went to do the deep research for the film.\n\nsimon: the flashbacks of domestic violence are very hard to see. and at one point in the film, sandra is asked in court, why didn't you leave?\n\nlloyd: yeah, most homicides that occur in domestic abuse situations occur at the point when the woman crosses the threshold either with or without her children. it's the moment you're most likely to die. and so it's a preposterous question - you know, why didn't you leave sooner? - because not just you might be going to die, but where do you go? who's going to support you? where are you going to literally lay your head for the night? and that is one of the climactic scenes of the film that clare plays very powerfully.\n\nsimon: it's the story of a strong, independent woman. but you are reminded how in life, nobody can really be that independent. we all need help, don't we? and she finds it.\n\nlloyd: yeah, i think the themes of isolation, such as sandra's experiencing before she leaves her partner, an isolation from her community, and community itself, those two things are something we've all come in the last year to really, really understand. and she does find a community who help her to rebuild herself, literally. and there's an irish word in the film, meitheals, which means when neighbors come together to help each other accomplish a task like reroofing a barn, for example, in the village. and this couldn't be done without this diverse community of people who all come to help, you know, for their own reasons.\n\nsimon: my mother used to use that word (laughter), my irish mother. i - it made me tear up. i tell you another line that made me tear up - when they begin to build the house and somebody hands sandra a pickaxe and says, we'll let herself do the honors. oh, boy.\n\nlloyd: yes. yes. well, with your irish roots, you would understand that herself, the double meaning of that, that in ireland, it means the boss. you know, will - i'll - where you say, you know, do you want to come in for a drink? and the man will say, i'll have to ask herself. so, yeah, you would have picked that up.\n\nsimon: what do you think a film like this can - how do you think it can reach into people?\n\nlloyd: well, i think that it can make us think about what kind of neighbors we are. and i think that, again, the last year have made us all very contemplative of, you know, am i a good neighbor? how much do i need my neighbor? and i think it's about empathy. it's about looking out for each other. and i hope that anyone who sees it who is in a fragile position like sandra might be moved to think there are people out there if i make a step change.\n\nsimon: phyllida lloyd herself - her new film, herself, - thanks so much for being with us.\n\nlloyd: thank you so much, scott.\n\nsimon: if you or someone you know confronts domestic abuse, please use a safe computer and contact help. that could include a local shelter, or you can call 911 or the national domestic violence hotline at 1-800-799-7233.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
n.c. officials face doj deadline to change 'bathroom law'\n\nrenee montagne talks to n.c. rep. paul stam, one of the sponsors of house bill 2, about the justice department's determination that the measure violates federal civil rights laws.\n\nrenee montagne, host:\n\nthe governor of north carolina decides today how to respond to the justice department's determination that a new state law violates the federal civil rights act. that law, known as hb2, prevents local governments from banning discrimination against lgbt people.\n\ndavid greene, host:\n\nthe most controversial aspect of this law involves bathrooms. the law says government buildings, public schools and state universities must restrict bathrooms and locker rooms according to people's sex on their birth certificates. north carolina gov. pat mccrory defended the law yesterday on fox news sunday.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npat mccrory: when you go into a restroom or your wife goes into a restroom, you assume the only other people going to that restroom or shower facility is going to be a person of the same gender.\n\ngreene: now, passage of the bill was swiftly followed by economic repercussions. entertainers like bruce springsteen and cirque du soleil canceled shows in the state. corporations from paypal to the nba canceled or are reconsidering projects there.\n\nmontagne: and other states and cities banned official travel to north carolina. despite the pressure, dallas woodhouse, as head of the north carolina republican party told the state's convention over the weekend that north carolina should stand firm.\n\n(soundbite of archive recording)\n\ndallas woodhouse: if this bathroom thing needs to be tweaked a little bit, it's going to be. but this legislature will remain strong on protecting the rights of parents to feel comfortable sending their children into public restrooms.\n\nmontagne: and let's hear now from one of the sponsors of hb2, paul stam. good morning.\n\npaul stam: good morning.\n\nmontagne: now, the governor has not said how he will respond to the justice department today, although we've just heard him sound pretty firm about the law as well. what do you expect him to do?\n\nstam: probably - although, i don't have inside information - announce that probably the state will sue the department of justice for a declaratory judgment on this.\n\nmontagne: so basically fight this.\n\nstam: yes. well, that's what i would hope and expect him to do.\n\nmontagne: ok. the federal appeals court with jurisdiction over north carolina recently aloud a transgender student to sue for discrimination for being required to use the bathroom that corresponds to his biological sex, pretty much the same thing that hb2 requires. do you worry that the federal courts won't hold out much hope for north carolina's position?\n\nstam: well, five courts have held the other way. this particular one is still on appeal to the fourth circuit. if you read the opinion, it begins with a logical fallacy identified by aristotle 2,500 years ago, and it's an absurd opinion. i hope you'll read it.\n\nmontagne: you know, the other possible outcome though of this is that the federal government could decide to withhold billions of dollars in funding for public schools and state universities. how would north carolina make that up?\n\nstam: to put that in context, that would take years for that process to unwind. and after the process is finished, the state or any other academic institution would have 30 days to comply. so the idea that this is some imminent threat is an empty one.\n\nmontagne: well, another possible threat for north carolina, which is a very popular tourist destination - it's also a state that has a lot of conventions come there, depends on them quite a bit. how much are you concerned that that part of your economy will be hurt?\n\nstam: it's an issue. but just last week, site selection magazine ranked north carolina number one with texas as the best place to go despite house bill 2. we've just been named by the census bureau as the fastest-growing economy in the nation.\n\nso these folks are going to have to do a little double take because if they boycott us, they'll have to explain why they didn't boycott houston for the final four. and as far as cities, while there are a hundred cities with a obama-type bathroom ordinance, that means there are 10,000 cities that don't. so they're going to have a real tough time finding a place that will suit them.\n\nmontagne: still, in all, at least one member of the general assembly - he's a democrat, larry bell - said he now regrets voting for hb2. do you think the assembly should consider changing anything in the law?\n\nstam: as far as the obama administration threats, those issues no, nothing will be changed. there's some - a couple of sentences that have nothing to do with the department of justice - they didn't even cite a couple of the issues that might be possibly tweaked but has nothing to do with the department of justice.\n\nand i need to put their threats in perspective. they didn't just threaten on title ix. they also threatened on title vii, the equal employment opportunity civil rights act, which affects 80 percent of the employees nationwide. so this is no longer a threat against north carolina.\n\nevery business in the nation that employs more than 15 people is under threat if they don't adopt this bathroom policy that the federal government will sue them because virtually all of them have the same bathroom policies as the state of north carolina does.\n\nmontagne: thank you very much for your time.\n\nstam: thank you.\n\nmontagne: rep. paul stam was one of the sponsors of hb2 in the north carolina general assembly.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
celebrating 30 years of 'fresh air': remembering horror film director tobe hooper\n\nterry gross, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. we'll conclude today's edition of our 30th anniversary retrospective with a 1988 interview that has become an obituary. tobe hooper, who's best known as the writer and director of the 1974 film the texas chain saw massacre, died last saturday. he was 74. the texas chain saw massacre was so gruesome, it helped inspire a wave of slasher films, but it was also so interestingly made that it was added to the permanent collection of the museum of modern art.\n\nthe movie is about a group of hippies who meet up with a family of homicidal maniacs who kill strangers to the area, eat their flesh and turn what's left over into sausage. the main character, known as leatherface, wears a mask of human skin and attacks his victims with a chain saw.\n\n(soundbite of film, the texas chain saw massacre)\n\npaul a partain: (as franklin) come on, franklin. it's going to be a fun trip. if i have any more fun today, i don't think i'm going to be able to take it.\n\n(soundbite of chainsaw revving, screams)\n\ngross: before the texas chain saw massacre, horror usually meant the supernatural - zombies, monsters and other creatures. but in chain saw, it was people who ate flesh and played out our worst nightmares. here's what tobe hooper told me in 1988.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ntobe hooper: i don't think i set out to change the genre consciously. i was just - i was a movie fan, you know. i was a horror film buff. and i simply made a film that i wanted to see because i felt that at that time - and we're talking about something like close to 15 years ago - the horror films that we were getting, it had gotten, you know, very boring and totally unscary (ph) and hokey and bad. i wanted to make something that worked again, that had chair jumpers in it, you know, that moved an audience. so i really set out as a fan of the genre to do something that gave you your, you know, gave you your money's worth.\n\ngross: your movie is very threatening. it's very ugly. it's very hard to sit through in some ways, but it's really not that explicitly gory. it's not as gory as you'd expect it to be. was that intentional on your part, or have standards just changed since 1973?\n\nhooper: no, that was intentional. and it also had to do with my awareness of getting a rating on the picture. and i actually set out to get a pg rating.\n\ngross: are you kidding?\n\nhooper: no, i'm not kidding. i - in fact, when i was shooting the picture, i called the mpaa and told them what i was doing. and i said, how - now, how can i make this pg? you know, i know the concept is rough, but let's hypothetically talk about a sequence that i have. a sequence, for instance, where a girl is - a big guy hangs a girl up on a meat hook. and if you don't see penetration and you see the girl hanging on the meat hook and you've suggested penetration in a kind of hitchcock way, you know, what will i get? does that get an r? does that get an x? or how about pg?\n\nso over the phone, talking the mpaa all the way through while shooting, i was trying to do what they suggested so i could have a pg rating. well, when the film was finished and they saw it, it was really amazing. they have these little clipboards, you know, with lights on them in the dark room. and every few seconds, those lights would pop on. and they were making notes. and i thought, oh, that's trouble. that means they're talking about cuts. well, ended up not having to make any cuts, but, of course, we took the r rating. and i don't know, however, had i not sincerely tried to go for pg, the picture may have been an x.\n\ngross: did anybody in the movie industry thought - think that you were insane or dangerous after seeing the movie?\n\nhooper: well, you know, it's the first time i've been asked that question. and - but, you know, i didn't get the kind of response then that as a young film director would get now making a genre piece. they would instantly be embraced because of the numbers, you know, because of the scoreboard. i mean, a hit is something that makes money. and i've seen lots of young film directors embraced for making terrible movies that made, you know, made a lot of money. but, i mean, it was very strange because it as - soon as it was released, it did get mixed critical acclaim, but the positive acclaim was very positive and on a big scale.\n\nfor instance, the film that year was an official film in - at the cannes film festival for the directors' fortnight. it's a branch of the cannes film festival that spotlights up-and-coming directors. and also, chain saw was put in the permanent film archives of the museum of modern art. it won awards all over the world and opened a few doors, but i think it took seven or eight years before mainstream filmmakers - producers, i should say, the heads of studios - before were, for some reason, able to recognize this as an artistic piece of work and a very good technical piece of directing because of what it was and because of the effect it had on you.\n\ngross: tobe hooper, recorded in 1988. he died last saturday. he was 74. tomorrow, we'll continue our 30th anniversary retrospective, featuring interviews from the first couple of years of our show. we'll hear three interviews from 1987 - with max roach, who kind of invented modern jazz drumming, pianist jay mcshann, who led the band in which charlie parker first became known - mcshann was at the piano for our interview - and singer anita o'day, who inspired many of the so-called cool jazz singers. i hope you'll join us.\n\n(soundbite of charlie parker's cheryl - 2003 remastered version)\n\ngross: fresh air's executive producer is danny miller. our technical director and engineer is audrey bentham. our associate producer for online media is molly seavy-nesper. roberta shorrock directs the show. i'm terry gross.\n\n(soundbite of charlie parker's cheryl - 2003 remastered version)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
soaring popularity of grass-fed beef may hit roadblock: less nutritious grass\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alex smith/harvest public media alex smith/harvest public media\n\na few years ago, kansas city restaurateur anton kotar surveyed the local and national restaurant scenes and concluded his town's reputation as a steakhouse paradise had slipped.\n\nthe problem, he says, is the way conventional beef is raised – bulked up with grain on feedlots, making it cheap and plentiful and changing what americans expect to taste.\n\ni think some of our best steakhouses chased the quality of the beef to the bottom, kotar says.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alex smith/harvest public media alex smith/harvest public media\n\nso, he opened a steakhouse that's focused on bringing grass-fed steaks to tables — meat he and a skyrocketing segment of beef consumers believe is both healthier to eat and healthier for the environment. but if the idea that more grass equals better steaks is true, there's trouble on the prairie that could affect cattle nutrition and the already-high price of the valued cuts of meat.\n\none hundred and twenty miles west of kansas city, researcher joe craine kneels in the tallgrass prairie national preserve to grab a handful of grasses.\n\nfrom the road, this looks like an unbroken wave of green. a close look at craine's hand shows a variety of grasses, a small sample of the preserve's hundreds of different species.\n\nthe prairie is so diverse, in fact, that to study it, craine and researchers from texas a&m university don't actually study the plants themselves. they study poop, collected between 1994 and 2016 everywhere from texas to kansas to montana.\n\nsomewhere on the order of 50,000 cow pies got shipped to texas for this study, says craine, who co-owns boulder, colorado-based jonah ventures.\n\nwhat he's found is a trend in the nutritional quality of grasses that grass-fed cattle (and young cattle destined for grain-heavy feedlots) are eating. since the mid-90s, levels of crude protein in the plants, which cattle need to grow, have dropped by nearly 20 percent.\n\nif we were still back at the forage quality that we would've had 25 years ago, no less 100 years ago, our animals would be gaining a lot more weight, craine says.\n\ncraine thinks part of the problem may be related to moving cattle to feedlots. when cattle are taken from the prairie, their manure, which delivers nutrients into the soil, is removed.\n\nbut he has a sneaking suspicion that rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are contributing as well. increased co2 levels have been linked to fewer nutrients in plants like rice, wheat and potatoes.\n\ncraine thinks this may be happening on a large scale in the prairie, and that it's just a matter of time before prairie grasses simply don't have enough protein to support grazing.\n\npretty soon you're at the point where the protein concentrations are too low for too long a period for the animals to gain any weight, craine says.\n\nit's an idea that jerry voleski, a professor and range and forage research with the university of nebraska-lincoln, is a bit skeptical of.\n\nit is an interesting hypothesis, voleski says.\n\nhe says he's unsure about studying manure for nutritional trends, and instead favors a method that takes samples of what cattle are eating directly from their digestive system.\n\nbut he thinks craine may have a point about rising carbon dioxide levels: the more carbon dioxide, the bigger the plant, but the amount of nitrogen, which makes plants nutritious for cattle, doesn't change.\n\non a native rangeland or grassland, nitrogen is the nutrient that is the most limiting, voleski says. there just seems to be enough to get by with each year.\n\ncraine hasn't made an official determination of why nutrients in grasses are dropping, but if the trends he has noticed continue, beef producers may need dump huge amounts of nitrogen across the great plains.\n\nextreme measures might be necessary, considering how quickly demand is growing for grass-fed beef. sales have soared from $17 million in 2012 to $272 million in 2016. and industry analysts say grass-fed beef could make up 30 percent of the market within 10 years.\n\nfeeding that demand, however, could be a lot more complicated — and expensive — if prairie grass' nutrient problems aren't solved.\n\nthis story comes to us from harvest public media, a reporting collaboration focused on food and agriculture.
maddie sofia, host:\n\nyou're listening to short wave from npr.\n\nin the last few months, scientists have moved at an unprecedented speed to learn as much as they can about the coronavirus. and the good news is new information has been coming out really fast. but that also makes it tough to stay on top of.\n\ned yong: it's truly incredible. i mean, i'm talking to you now, and every sentence is out of date before i started, probably.\n\nsofia: that's atlantic science reporter ed yong, who, these days, is pretty busy.\n\nyong: i've been pretty much continuously reporting for the last 812 years.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsofia: ed's been so busy precisely because there is so much to learn about this pandemic. and in his latest story for the atlantic, he writes about some clues scientists are beginning to uncover that may suggest why this coronavirus has taken off.\n\nyong: and i think actually, even though there are a huge number of unknowns left, it is astonishing how much we know about this virus considering that literally no one knew that it existed mere months ago.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nsofia: this episode will break down what the early science suggests about why this virus has spread so much faster than similar viruses like sars, where it came from and if it'll slow down here in the u.s. as the weather gets warmer. i'm maddie sofia, and this is short wave, the daily science podcast from npr.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nsofia: as we say at the top of all of our coronavirus episodes, we are learning a lot about this virus really fast. the information in this episode is what we have learned as of our recording on monday, march 23, and what we know will probably change.\n\nyong: agreed.\n\nsofia: ok. so the coronavirus that's causing this pandemic is part of a larger group or family of coronaviruses. so some cause the common cold. there are famous ones like mers and sars. but only this one has caused a pandemic. so, ed, let's talk about why that might be.\n\nyong: so if we look at the structure of the virus, we see certain clues about why it's behaving in such an extreme way. so like all coronaviruses, this one is basically a ball with some spikes sticking out of it. those spikes are what the virus uses to launch an infection. they bind to a protein called ace2, which sits on the surface of our cells. and this binding, like a key fitting into a lock, is the first stage of any infection.\n\nnow, if we compare the shape of the spike protein on this new coronavirus to that of, say, the original sars virus from 2003, we see that it sticks to the ace2 protein much more tightly, much more strongly. and that is likely to influence the course of an infection. so in very broad terms, the stronger the stick, the less virus you probably need to actually start an infection.\n\nsofia: and that's really important - right? - because if it doesn't take as much virus to start an infection, it's easier to transmit the virus from person to person. it's what we call an infectious dose.\n\nyong: that's right.\n\nsofia: so basically, this virus is stickier than the virus that caused sars.\n\nyong: that's right. this virus is better at recognizing and latching on to human cells...\n\nsofia: yeah.\n\nyong: ...we think.\n\nsofia: ed, in your piece, you suggested that some of the virologists that study these families of viruses have started calling the sars virus sars classic...\n\nyong: (laughter) right.\n\nsofia: ...which is (laughter) - it's kind of delightful, in a way.\n\nyong: it is a moment of, like, light comic relief in the middle of this horrific catastrophe. i think that because this new virus has been called sars-cov-2 and the original virus, the sars from 2003, is technically called sars-cov - it's very difficult to talk about the two of them without getting confused and without sort of muddling up which sars you were talking about. so yeah, virologists have found all kinds of hilariously colloquial work-arounds, calling the first virus original sars or sars classic as if it were some kind of soda.\n\nsofia: (laughter) yeah.\n\nyong: could be diet sars.\n\nsofia: right. and as we know, the sodas get worse and worse as more of them get produced - is how i feel.\n\nyong: agreed.\n\nsofia: ok.\n\nyong: it's meant for so many levels jokes.\n\nsofia: ok. so those spikes that the viruses use to attach to our cells - those spikes have to be activated. and that activation happens more readily in this coronavirus than the classic sars, or sars classic virus.\n\nyong: it seems that way. so the spike consists of two halves, which must first be split apart for the virus to begin infecting a cell. and that split happens with some difficulty with sars classic, but it seems to occur more readily with this new virus because the two halves can be separated by an enzyme called furin, which is quite widespread in the human body.\n\nsofia: right. so much like an avocado...\n\nyong: (laughter).\n\nsofia: ...that spike protein is really only ready to do its job once it's split in half. and this coronavirus can make use of a protein in our body that is - you know, our body's already naturally producing...\n\nyong: yes.\n\nsofia: ...to make that cut for it.\n\nyong: correct. and thanks for ruining avocados for me.\n\nsofia: (laughter) ok.\n\nyong: (laughter) you monster.\n\nsofia: so basically, that split seems to be happening easier in this coronavirus than in the sars coronavirus, and that split is really important to activating the infection process.\n\nyong: correct.\n\nsofia: you also wrote about how this plays into a potential reason why the virus can spread between people before symptoms show up. talk to me about that.\n\nyong: right. so in most respiratory viruses, you either get infections in the upper airways - in which case symptoms are mild, but the virus spreads more easily - or you get infections in the lower airways - in which case symptoms are more severe, like pneumonia, but the virus is harder to transmit. it seems that the new coronavirus can infect both sites. so perhaps it infects the upper airways, causing mild symptoms and spreading easily before moving down into the lower airways and causing some of the more severe illnesses we've seen in the worst covid-19 cases. and maybe the reason it can do all those things is that it relies on this furin enzyme, which is found in lots of different tissues.\n\nsofia: right.\n\nyong: now, of course, this is still conjecture. it's kind of a - if you look at it, it's a plausible story. it makes sense, and it checks out.\n\nsofia: yeah.\n\nyong: but it could also be completely wrong.\n\nsofia: yeah. this is actually kind of, you know, newer data. that's kind of interesting because i think initially, we thought, you know, the majority of that infection is in the lower respiratory system, right? that's very similar to sars or the classic sars. and now we're starting to get, maybe, some data that shows that that upper respiratory tract can be infected, too. but like you said, this is pretty preliminary stuff.\n\nyong: right. you know, i keep reminding myself that this is a virus that no one knew about.\n\nsofia: yeah.\n\nyong: so we're really racing to understand it even while we're also trying to control it.\n\nsofia: absolutely. absolutely. ok, so let's talk about the animal origins of this virus.\n\nyong: sure.\n\nsofia: what we know now is potentially that the closest wild relative of this virus is found in bats. is that right, ed?\n\nyong: yeah, that's right. so there are millions, perhaps billions of coronaviruses out there in other animals. and of all the ones that scientists have found so far, the one that most closely resembles sars-cov-2 is one that is found in bats. so it's likely that the virus originated in some kind of bat and eventually hopped into humans either directly or via another intermediate species.\n\nsofia: right. and so that jump from an animal to us - there's a difference in what happened with this virus, we think, versus what happened with the original sars virus. is that correct?\n\nyong: that's right, yeah. when a virus enters a new host, there's often a brief period of acclimation, a little span of time when it's mutating a bit and finding ways of better existing within that new type of body. and that's what we saw with sars classic. it took a little while before the virus became very good at infecting humans, and it doesn't seem to be the case with this new coronavirus. it seems to have been a really good human pathogen right off the bat...\n\nsofia: yeah.\n\nyong: ...so to speak.\n\nsofia: yeah. so basically, sars had to take another step before it was good at infecting us. and regardless of where this virus came from, as soon as it got into us, it seems to be just kind of great at infecting humans.\n\nyong: right. yeah. it just seems like it was good to go from the off.\n\nsofia: ok. so let's talk a little bit about, you know, the seasonality, potentially, of this virus.\n\nyong: sure.\n\nsofia: so what did the experts that you talked to say about whether or not this outbreak will let up soon with the change of the seasons?\n\nyong: so it's really hard to say. and there are actually several papers out there now that seem to come to differing conclusions about the seasonality question. so in general, coronaviruses do tend to infect people in the winter, and they disappear in the summer because it's hotter and more humid. now, it's possible that this new coronavirus will also behave in the same way. and a lot of the people i spoke to felt that seasonality was likely. the problem is that the virus is now spreading through a global population of people who have no pre-existing immunity to it.\n\nsofia: right.\n\nyong: and it's just moving really easily from one person to another. the speed at which it's moving might be a little slower come the spring or summer but not enough to curtail the spread of the pandemic on its own. one epidemiologist explained it to me like this. it's as if the world is just full of tinder, and you've got this gigantic wildfire that's blazing through it. and hoping that seasonality will help is a bit like hoping that a light rain is going to douse it. it might make it a little weaker.\n\nsofia: sure.\n\nyong: but that fire is still going to blaze.\n\nsofia: so one thing that i found really interesting in your article was the state of coronavirus research in general and how that plays into how prepared we are right now. like, this is a big group of viruses that cause a decent bit of disease throughout the world. but one researcher you talked to said that until recently, not that many people were studying coronaviruses.\n\nyong: right. so a very small group of people - maybe, you know, several dozens of researchers - have focused on coronaviruses for a few decades now. but it really has been a very, very niche field, even among virologists. when sars classic first emerged, i think coronavirus researchers were really shocked that the things that they were studying were suddenly of public health importance.\n\nsofia: right.\n\nyong: and they are even more flabbergasted now.\n\nsofia: and so because of that - because even after sars, there wasn't a huge uptake in how many people were studying this, we don't necessarily have surveillance networks in place for coronavirus like we do for the flu.\n\nyong: right. a lot of our preparedness measures in general have been focused on flu as the most likely next pandemic - and for good reason - because flu actually is the most likely next pandemic. it just so happened that this time, it was a coronavirus. and we don't have surveillance for coronaviruses. we know, actually, surprisingly little about coronavirus biology. and all of those deficiencies have contributed to this dire situation that we're facing when we don't know enough but we're forced to act as quickly as possible.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nsofia: ok, mr. ed yong. thank you for coming by and talking about the science of this virus with us.\n\nyong: thanks, maddie.\n\nsofia: ed yong. we have a link to his piece in the atlantic in the notes of this episode, which was produced by brent baughman, fact-checked by emily vaughn and edited by viet le. i'm maddie sofia back tomorrow with more short wave from npr.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
opinion: paintings by adolf hitler are 'unremarkable,' so why forge them?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption daniel karmann/afp/getty images daniel karmann/afp/getty images\n\nif you saw some of these paintings — of flowers, fields and foggy townscapes — for sale at a summer art fair, you might point at one to say, well, maybe for the guest bathroom.\n\nfive pictures allegedly painted by adolf hitler are scheduled for auction at an art house in nuremberg saturday. two dozen more were pulled after german police raided the place on thursday, on suspicion that a number of the paintings signed, a. hitler, are forgeries.\n\nimagine acquiring the technical proficiency to counterfeit a work of art, only to use those skills not to fabricate a fictitious picasso, el greco, gauguin or georgia o'keeffe — but a watercolor by a highly mediocre painter who went on to exterminate 6 million jews and try to enslave the world.\n\nin his 20s, the future fuhrer was twice rejected by vienna's academy of fine arts for what they called his unfitness for painting. hitler stayed on in the city to study with private teachers and tried to sell his paintings and postcard sketches for spare change.\n\nwe asked jerry saltz, the pulitzer prize-winning art critic, for his appraisal of a. hitler's artwork.\n\nphysically and spatially dead, jerry told us, generic academic realism, the equivalent of mediocre exercises in aping good penmanship. he was an adequate draftsman, utterly unimaginative, and made the equivalent [of] greeting cards.\n\nthen why would someone want to create a forgery of a hitler painting?\n\nthe opening bid for one of those hitler paintings is more than $50,000.\n\nnot because it's that good, but because it's painted by history's great monster.\n\nthat same auction house sold 14 hitler paintings in 2015 for almost a half million dollars; auctioneers say their bidders were from all over europe, china and the united arab emirates.\n\nwhy would anyone who could afford to bid so high spend so much good money on a bad painting by an evil man?\n\nit is tempting to believe that each and every hitler artwork should be tossed onto the trash heap of history and burned. but critics and scholars remind us it's important to be able to see hitler's middling and unremarkable paintings to try to find clues into his monstrous mind and malicious life.\n\nyou see the soft landscapes that a. hitler painted, of thatched-roof houses, old stone churches, slim flowers and snowy countrysides, and realize one of the most frightening facts of all.\n\nhistory's great monster was human.
female marines join fight against culture of sexism\n\nafter seeing her photo with other female marines get attacked on social media, maj. janine garner joined about 100 other women to try to end sexism and misogyny in the marine corps.\n\naudie cornish, host:\n\nthe leaders of the u.s. marine corps are still trying to cope with a widespread scandal that came to light last month. hundreds of marines are being investigated for sharing nude photos in a closed facebook group, photos of women, including fellow marines, without their consent. the pentagon is investigating, and congress has held hearings.\n\nmeanwhile, women in the marines say this is not an isolated incident, and the broader culture of the marines is in need of change. this week, about a hundred of these marine women signed an open letter to the service that said this.\n\nmajor janine garner: (reading) we have allowed to thrive and, in some instances, even encouraged a culture where women are devalued, demeaned and their contributions diminished. we understand why. in a culture that prizes masculinity, it is easy to mistake barbarism for strength, brutality for power, savagery for ferocity.\n\nari shapiro, host:\n\nthat's major janine garner, one of the marines who signed the letter. she's a pilot based out of cherry point, n.c., and joins us now. welcome.\n\ngarner: hi.\n\nshapiro: why did you decide to address this issue in such a large scale, public way?\n\ngarner: one of my experience in the marine corps, particularly given that i'm in aviation, has been one where women are frequently isolated and often wonder and think that these things that we experience happen only to us. well, when my friends and i - my peers and i got together and we started talking - because obviously everybody was very upset with the - everything that happened with marines united - and again, that was just the catalyst.\n\nshapiro: marines united was the name of the photo-sharing page where all of this unfolded - yeah.\n\ngarner: exactly. so it was kind of a catalyst. and as we got together and we spoke, we realized that we couldn't stay quiet anymore and that by coming together, we had a much stronger voice than just kind of individually screaming, you know, in our little stovepipes i guess, for lack of a better term, that this was not ok.\n\nshapiro: can you tell us about the personal experience you had that convinced you that things needed to change?\n\ngarner: for me, it really came to a head back in i want to say around may of 2016 where a facebook group similar to marines united took a picture from my personal instagram page that was a photo of me and seven other female marine field grade officers as we were at lunch in our uniforms and took this picture, posted it to the page.\n\nand i watched in real time as hundreds of people commented on this photo and said things like, you know - they wanted to rape us. they immediately reduced us to our sexuality, as to whether we were doable, not doable, every amount of vitriol. we were called the worst names. and i mean these were leaders in the marine corps. i guess for myself, i was less upset because i've dealt with stuff like this before, but these seven other women who i highly respect and admire who have deployed multiple times, gone to combat, are marines just like everybody else were being demeaned in this way.\n\nand the conversation, because of the marines united, was all about the nude photos. the dialogue kept being the nude photos, the nude photos, the nude photos. oh, well they shouldn't have taken those pictures of themselves. the problem isn't the photos. the problem is the treatment of one marine to another, and that is completely unacceptable and goes against our core ethos and values.\n\nshapiro: on the policy level, what do you think needs to change in the marine corps?\n\ngarner: well, in terms of policies, the first change i'd really like to see is an increase of numbers of women in the marine corps. i believe we need to improve our recruitment and our retention of female marines specifically. i'd like to see our numbers get up to at least 20 percent.\n\nshapiro: now it's around 7 percent. is that right?\n\ngarner: it's currently around 7 percent. and in aviation, we make up less than 4 percent. for example, i'm at the largest marine corps air base, and i am the only female pilot on this base. and that's incredibly isolating, and that means wherever i go, i'm the unicorn. i'm, oh, the female pilot, if that makes sense. so it's still an oddity. it's still commented on.\n\nand one of the ways that this changes the culture is when female marines become 1 in 5 of every marine you have, at least it's no longer female marine, male marine. it's marines at that point, which is how we should be looking at things anyway. but you no longer see them as the - oh, there's the token marine for the squadron. oh, there's the token female marine for the section, you know? it's just marines. it's normal. it stops being an oddity. we stop being other.\n\nshapiro: and in terms of the culture, which is much more difficult to change, what kinds of changes do you think need to be made there?\n\ngarner: in the past when we've had issues with, say, drinking and driving, drug use - in the '90s, a big problem was racism - the marine corps basically sat down and said, no, this is completely unacceptable; we're going to change the culture in this. and it took time, but the way the marine corps did it was through a lot of education and a lot of training. young recruits and poolees - poolees being before they go off to recruit training when they're talking to recruiters - knew right from the get-go where the marine corps stood as far as drug use, as far as alcohol abuse, racism and things like that. and so coming into the marine corps, they knew what the stance was. and we saw over time a drastic change.\n\nthere are very, very strict career repercussions when you violate these policies, and everybody knows that. that's marine corps-wide. that took several years to change. but we can do the same with this subculture of sexism and misogyny in the marine corps. nobody is born a misogynist. it's learned behavior, and it can be unlearned.\n\nshapiro: i know some women were afraid of speaking out, worried that there could be career repercussions. do you think that's a justified fear? did you have that fear yourself?\n\ngarner: i absolutely had that fear myself. i spent so much time, particularly my first few years in the marine corps, just trying to be accepted that i didn't speak up many times when i probably should have because i didn't want to call additional attention to myself. and in many ways, it was just about kind of survival, if that makes sense. and i think there's always that fear.\n\nshapiro: you're obviously extremely accomplished, have lots of options available to you. why stay and try to fix this broken culture rather than just say, i'm not appreciated here; i'll take my talents elsewhere?\n\ngarner: because the marine corps is amazing, and it's wonderful. and the majority of the people in the marine corps are people - they're the reason i joined. they're honest, good people who are committed to serving this country and defending americans and the constitution. there are no better people i would want to be working with and mentoring.\n\ni don't want to leave a marine corps that is less than what it could be. it's an amazing institution and, in my opinion, should be setting the example for every other military service out there, for every other organization out there. and my job as a leader in the marine corps is to continue to make the marine corps better and to continue to push that. so that's why i stay. i stay for the generations behind me.\n\nshapiro: major janine garner is a pilot in cherry point, n.c. major garner, thanks for speaking with us, and thank you for your service.\n\ngarner: anytime.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

saudi king deposes crown prince and names 31-year-old son as new heir\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption simon dawson/bloomberg via getty images simon dawson/bloomberg via getty images\n\nsaudi arabia's king salman bin abdulaziz al saud has changed his pick for a successor, naming his son prince mohammed bin salman as crown prince and deposing prince mohammed bin nayef from the post. at 31, the country's new successor to the throne is 50 years younger than the current monarch.\n\nmohammed bin nayef, 57, had served as crown prince since 2015, taking the post shortly after salman, his uncle, was crowned. he also had been saudi arabia's interior minister — another job that will now be filled by mohammed bin salman.\n\naccording to the royal order making the change, the saudi allegiance council overwhelmingly approved the new line of succession, by a vote of 31-3.\n\nthe abrupt shuffle has come as a surprise to many: when mohammed bin nayef became crown prince two years ago, he was the first member of his generation to rise to the top of the royal family. with his removal, saudi arabia is now on a path to be led by someone far younger.\n\nthe newest crown prince has amassed a number of responsibilities and powers, and while he's known for his economic and social ideas to modernize the kingdom, he also served as the saudi defense minister during the kingdom's military intervention in yemen.\n\nhe symbolizes the hopes of a youthful local population, more than half of which is under 25, gulf news reports. the site adds that because the king's son has acquired such a wide portfolio, diplomats nicknamed him mr. everything.\n\nyoutube\n\na public pledge of allegiance to the new crown prince is scheduled for wednesday evening; in a video that was posted shortly after the change was announced, the two princes are seen greeting each other and exchanging pleasantries.\n\nthe shake-up in the saudi line of succession comes as the kingdom and other gulf arab states continue a feud with qatar that has seen borders close and trade shipments halted, npr's peter kenyon reports for our newscast unit. the u.s. state department appears to be losing patience with the saudis and their allies, demanding that they reveal their list of grievances against qatar.\n\nmohammed bin salman has already met several world leaders. he visited president trump at the white house in march and hosted u.k. prime minister theresa may in riyadh in april. in may, he visited russian president vladimir putin in moscow.\n\nof the new crown prince's personal life, gulf news reports: a law graduate from riyadh's king saud university, the dark-bearded prince with a receding hairline is the father of two boys and two girls and has married only once.
bulky cameras, meet the lens-less flatcam\n\nyoutube\n\ncamera technology has improved dramatically in the past decades, but one thing about even the newest cameras has stayed constant: they all have lenses.\n\nnow, that's changing.\n\nengineers in texas are building a camera that can make a sharp image with no lens at all.\n\nwhy would you want such a camera? richard baraniuk, a professor of computer and electrical engineering at rice university, says lenses make a camera bulky. he and his colleagues wanted to build a camera that could fit into spaces where traditional cameras could never go.\n\nto design their camera, baraniuk and his colleagues looked to the past for inspiration.\n\nback to really the very first cameras, pinhole cameras, baraniuk says.\n\npinhole cameras have been here for quite a while. according to some scholars, they were first described by the chinese philosopher mo ti around 400 b.c. these cameras later came to be known as the camera obscura. light enters through a small hole into a darkened space, sometimes as large as a room, and an image of what the hole was pointed at appears on a screen.\n\nwith the invention of film and later photo sensors, it became possible to capture that screen image.\n\nthe disadvantage of a pinhole camera is that while it provides the simplicity of interpretation of the image, it lets very little light through, baraniuk says. so it's very inefficient that way. it's a pinhole after all.\n\nso he and his colleagues decided to build a camera based not around a single pinhole like you might build for a science fair project, but one with literally millions of pinholes, baraniuk says.\n\nthese millions of pinholes in baraniuk's camera are really tiny, so you can pack a lot of them together on a thin piece of plastic. lay the plastic down over a semiconductor chip that's sensitive to light, and voila: you've got a camera that's almost completely flat.\n\nbut there's a problem. a million pinholes produce a million images, all smeared on top of one another.\n\nhow to separate them?\n\nashok veeraraghavan, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at rice, says the answer is computation. lots of digital cameras use computation to improve the quality of the image created by the lens in a traditional camera.\n\nthe entire community of computational imaging has started recognizing that computation can not only be used to improve images that have been captured by the earlier camera designs, but actually change these camera designs in radical fashions, veeraraghavan says.\n\nsuch as a camera made from a million pinholes.\n\nveeraraghavan says it's possible to computationally unsmear those million images from those million pinholes to make a single sharp image of what the camera is pointed at. for details on how it's done, you can see this paper.\n\nbaraniuk agrees their work will radically change camera design.\n\nyou could imagine making, for example, wallpaper that you could paper over a wall to create an extremely massive camera, he says.\n\nusing an entire wall as a camera means you could see absolutely everything in the room, including things that would be out of sight or distorted in a single, smaller camera.\n\nor build a cylindrical camera, put something in the middle of the cylinder, and you can take pictures of it from every angle at the same time.\n\nright now the images his flatcam can produce are about as good as the first conventional digital cameras, but baraniuk expects they'll get better very soon. he expects people will come up with ways to use the new camera that he can't even imagine yet.
michel martin, host:\n\nroger severino is a successful civil rights lawyer. when he was at the justice department, he fought to uphold the rights of african-americans trying to rent homes after hurricane katrina. and he won. for the last year, though, under president trump, he has led the office for civil rights in the health and human services department. and in that time, he has put the right to religious freedom front and center as he fights against discrimination in health care.\n\nhere's severino back in january when he announced the creation of a division of conscience and religious freedom within hhs.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nroger severino: times are changing, and we are institutionalizing a change in the culture of government, beginning with hhs, to never forget that religious freedom is a primary freedom, that it is a civil right that deserves complete enforcement and respect.\n\nmartin: npr health policy correspondent alison kodjak has this profile of roger severino.\n\nalison kodjak, byline: there's a good chance you didn't know that the nation's health department has a team of lawyers dedicated to protecting your civil rights. traditionally, they focus on making sure you're not denied medical care because of your race or gender or on protecting your medical privacy. roger severino says he plans to continue to defend those rights. but he's also made it clear that his top priority is to protect health care providers' religious freedom.\n\nseverino: america's doctors and nurses are dedicated to saving lives. and they shouldn't be bullied out of the practice of medicine simply because they object to performing abortions against their conscience.\n\nkodjak: when i sat down with severino last month, he pointed me to his long and distinguished record of achievement in civil rights and says it took root in his childhood. he grew up in la as the spanish-speaking child of colombian immigrants.\n\nseverino: i had experienced discrimination as a child. and that leaves a lasting impression.\n\nkodjak: kids at the public pool where he took swimming lessons hurled racial epithets his way. and when he got to high school...\n\nseverino: the menu of options i was given were remedial classes, the equivalent of shop class and a vocational class. and i said, well, don't you offer honors classes? and the counselor, who was white, said, yeah, but you'd have to take a test.\n\nkodjak: severino is conservative and a devout catholic. he previously worked at the becket fund, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on religious freedom. and he ran a center on religion at the conservative heritage foundation. since he joined hhs just a year ago, he's issued a new rule that allows employers to refuse to cover birth control if they have a religious or moral objection. and he created the new religious freedom division to ensure that health care workers and companies are never forced to participate in medical services like abortion if they object.\n\nseverino: all we're doing is saying that we will be enforcing all the civil rights laws. and all those civil rights laws include conscience and religious freedom. and we believe they weren't given the proper attention for too long a time.\n\nkodjak: severino's critics say his efforts are likely to make it harder for women to get abortions. but they could go much farther. several of his critics, including judith lichtman, met with the new civil rights director shortly after he joined hhs.\n\njudith lichtman: he opened the meeting telling us his heartfelt story about knowing and understanding discrimination. and frankly, you know, stories will get you just so far.\n\nkodjak: lichtman is a senior adviser to the national partnership for women and families. she says severino's actions since that meeting suggest he intends to protect people who want to discriminate against women who want birth control or abortions, which she points out are legal health care services.\n\nlichtman: i say that's pretty abhorrent.\n\nkodjak: harper jean tobin, policy director at the national center for transgender equality, was also at that meeting.\n\nharper jean tobin: director severino presents himself as a civil rights lawyer. and what he has done as ocr director is turn the idea of civil rights on its head.\n\nkodjak: traditional civil rights advocates, she says, have fought hard to make sure everyone can get the medical care they need. but severino, she says, is instead fighting for the right of doctors to discriminate.\n\ntobin: no one is forcing doctors to perform gender-affirming surgeries against their will. but what is happening every day is transgender patients are being denied every kind of medical care you can think of.\n\nkodjak: she says more than a third of transgender adults said in a survey that they had experienced health care discrimination in the last year. i reached out to several people who have worked with severino and none would speak with me about him on the record. those who spoke on background say he's a straight shooter who has a way of connecting with his clients. and they say they expect he'll apply the law fairly. alison kodjak, npr news, washington.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
behind the border 'crisis': more migrant families risk dangerous remote crossings\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption joel rose/npr joel rose/npr\n\nin a desolate stretch of desert outside yuma, ariz., there's a spot where more than 350 migrants, including children, burrowed under the steel border fence a few weeks ago.\n\nthis only goes down just about probably another foot, this steel, said anthony porvaznik, chief patrol agent for the yuma sector of the border patrol. he says smugglers tried digging in more than a dozen spots, looking for places where the ground was soft enough.\n\nthis is very sandy, porvaznik said. it's like that all the way down, and so it was easy to dig.\n\nabout once a week, border patrol agents come across migrant groups of 100 people or more in some of the most isolated parts of the southwest border. in arizona, the number of migrant families and children crossing the border more than doubled last year, straining resources in the u.s. and mexico.\n\nthe white house says the situation is evidence of a broader crisis at the southern border. on friday, president trump declared a national emergency to free up billions of dollars to expand the border wall. the administration wants a total of about $8 billion, including the $1.4 billion in the funding bill passed by congress, for border wall construction.\n\nbut immigrant advocates say u.s. officials have exacerbated the situation at the border by limiting the number of migrants who can seek asylum at legal ports of entry. they say that's pushing a growing number of migrant families to cross illegally in more remote areas of arizona and new mexico, miles from the nearest food, water and medical care.\n\nwe hesitate to use the word 'crisis,' because we don't think that this is a threat to the country, said joanna williams of the kino border initiative, a humanitarian group that operates a migrant shelter in nogales, mexico.\n\nthe vast majority of these migrants are fleeing violence and poverty in central america. and williams says u.s. immigration officials have underestimated their desperation to reach u.s. soil.\n\nthey're trying to find a route to safety, williams said. for them, the risks are worth it.\n\nno longer the 'wild, wild west'\n\ndespite the recent influx of migrant families, the yuma sector is widely considered a border enforcement success story.\n\nthe number of illegal border crossings in yuma today is just a fraction of what it used to be in the early 2000s. former acting homeland security secretary elaine duke touted the sector's turnaround in a 2017 op-ed in usa today titled border walls work. yuma sector proves it.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption joel rose/npr joel rose/npr\n\neven as border patrol agents were arresting on average 800 illegal aliens a day, duke wrote, we were still unable to stop the thousands of trucks filled with drugs and humans that quickly crossed a vanishing point and dispersed into communities all across the country.\n\nit was just to me like the wild, wild west. it was just out of control, said barbie moorhouse, a helicopter pilot in the border patrol.\n\nbefore she was a pilot, moorhouse worked on the ground as a border patrol agent in the mid-2000s. back then, she says, agents ran themselves ragged chasing migrants who were trying to cross illegally.\n\nwe did the best we could with what we had at the time, moorhouse said. but it is definitely a better situation today than it was 10 years ago. the change was pretty dramatic.\n\nsince then, the border patrol's ranks have swelled. more miles of wall and fence have been built. and the number of illegal border crossings is far below what they used to be.\n\nbut today, the face of those migrants has changed. instead of farmworkers and laborers trying to dodge agents, nearly 90 percent of the border-crossers are families and children. instead of trying to get away, they're trying to get caught.\n\nand once again, the u.s. is not prepared.\n\nit is a crisis for us because this is a situation that the border patrol is not resourced or geared to deal with, said chief patrol agent anthony porvaznik.\n\nborder patrol agents are spending hours caring for the migrants in their custody, porvaznik said. they pick up hundreds of hamburgers at a time from mcdonald's and wait with migrants at the hospital if they need medical attention.\n\nwe need additional manpower to deal with the population that we have to essentially babysit.\n\nwe need additional manpower to deal with the population that we have to essentially babysit, porvaznik said. and that takes border patrol agents away from a national security border security mission to deal with a humanitarian mission.\n\nporvaznik says big groups of migrants have been especially frustrating, because they take his agents away from the law enforcement tasks they signed up for when the joined the border patrol.\n\nwe're here to arrest people that are trying to do bad things and bad people trying to come into the country, porvaznik said. and we still do that. but when we have this priority mission of having to deal with children and families, that takes away from our ability to get manpower out where we need them.\n\nunlike the border-crossers of a decade ago, many of these central american migrants are trying to turn themselves in to the border patrol to request asylum in the united states.\n\nthere's not an incentive to travel in smaller groups or to try to hide from immigration officials, said the kino border initiative's williams. so these migrants are crossing in larger groups because in many ways, it's safer, she said.\n\na few years ago, it was more common for migrant families to cross in places like the rio grande valley in texas. but williams says that route has become increasingly dangerous because the mexican side of the border is controlled by cartels. so migrants are crossing in remote borderlands, in spite of the risks.\n\nin december, an 8-year-old girl died in u.s. custody after crossing with a large group of migrants in a remote corner of new mexico. her death, as well as that of a second migrant child a few weeks later, prompted the border patrol to expand medical screenings for all migrants in its custody.\n\nthere's another reason these migrant families have gotten more desperate, says williams. in the past, they might have gone to legal ports of entry to request asylum. but since last year, u.s. officials have been letting only a few families in at a time at many ports of entry.\n\nso these migrants have to choose between two bad options if they want to reach the united states: they can cross the border illegally in remote areas, or they can wait, sometimes for months, in border towns.\n\nstrained resources in mexico\n\nin the town of san luis río colorado, right across the border from yuma county, ariz., hundreds of migrant families sleep out under blue tarps — the same kind you'd see emergency responders hand out after a hurricane.\n\na few feet away, two clogged lanes of traffic also wait to get into the united states. occasionally the drivers roll down their windows to give money to the migrants or buy them snacks from street vendors.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption joel rose/npr joel rose/npr\n\nthe migrants themselves keep track of everybody's place in line in a simple spiral notebook. on this day, the notebook is in the hands of a guatemalan asylum-seeker named herbert leal. he flips through the pages to show me the names of more than 100 families from southern mexico, honduras, and el salvador. leal says they're waiting because they want to do this the right way.\n\nto show u.s. authorities that we are able to wait, he said through an interpreter. that we respect the laws of mexico, and we respect the laws of the united states. that is why we're here.\n\nthese migrants are afraid to leave this spot because they might lose their place in the line to request asylum. but some do venture to a migrant shelter in town called casa del migrante la divina providencia.\n\nthis house was made originally for men, explained martin salgado, who runs the shelter. salgado's mother helped found the shelter in the 1990s. back then, salgado says, it was primarily a way station for migrant men trying to get to the u.s. to work.\n\nbut now salgado says the majority of migrants are women and children seeking asylum.\n\nfrom a year ago, there's a lot of women, salgado told me. in the past, you didn't see this picture.\n\nbefore, this was a place to

the growing number of migrants.\n\nwe started back in 2014 in tucson at the bus station, says diego javier pina lopez, the lead coordinator for the shelter. casa alitas moved into a house, which it quickly outgrew, and then two houses.\n\na few weeks ago, the shelter relocated again, to its biggest quarters yet: a former benedictine monastery in tucson. the owner, a local real estate developer, is planning to build apartments on the property but is letting migrants stay there until construction begins.\n\nwe essentially got the keys on a wednesday, pina lopez said, and then we were told we needed to open on that saturday.\n\nmost migrant families stay at the shelter for less than 24 hours.\n\nthey truly believe that their lives are at risk and, even worse, the lives of their children are at risk.\n\nthey're dropped off by immigration officials after they're released from custody, typically with a notice to appear in immigration court. the shelter offers them a place to shower, eat and sleep. volunteers provide medical screenings and flu shots and help the migrants book their bus tickets to join friends and relatives across the country.\n\none room in the sprawling 1940s monastery is full of donated toys. in another, piles of coats, jackets, backpacks and shoes are free for the taking.\n\nthe staff members at casa alitas say it's unlikely that more miles of border wall will deter these migrant families from coming to the united states.\n\nthey truly believe that their lives are at risk and, even worse, the lives of their children are at risk, said teresa cavendish, director of operations for catholic community services of southern arizona, which runs the shelter.\n\ni think it will actually cause more suffering to have the walls in place, cavendish said, because folks will simply go to further extremes in order to make it here.
in philadelphia, judges rule against opening 'supervised' site to inject opioids\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption kimberly paynter/whyy kimberly paynter/whyy\n\nefforts to open the first supervised injection site in the u.s. for users of heroin, fentanyl and other opiates experienced a setback this week after a federal court ruled that it would violate federal law.\n\nsafehouse, a philadelphia nonprofit, had been trying for years to open the first such facility in that city. the supervised injection site would allow people to bring illegal opioids and inject them under medical supervision to prevent fatal overdoses. in canada and several european countries, injection sites also refer clients to substance abuse treatment and other social services.\n\na three-judge panel of the 3rd u.s. circuit court of appeals issued a 2-1 ruling on tuesday. judges stephanos bibas and thomas l. ambro called safehouse's motives admirable but said that while the opioid crisis may call for innovative solutions, local innovations may not break federal law.\n\nbut congress has made it a crime to open a property to others to use drugs. ... and that is what safehouse will do, the opinion said, citing a federal law passed in 1986 and commonly known as the crack house statute.\n\nsafehouse formed in 2018 after the city of philadelphia announced plans to support a supervised or safe injection site. it embraces harm reduction techniques as a way to reduce death and illness from the drug epidemic, and its leadership team includes ronda goldfein, executive director of the aids law project of pennsylvania; jose benitez, executive director of prevention point, the city's only sanctioned syringe exchange; and former pennsylvania gov. ed rendell, who was instrumental in helping prevention point open in 1992 despite federal law prohibiting needle exchanges.\n\nu.s. attorney william mcswain sued the nonprofit in february 2019, not long after it formed, claiming that a site where people could bring their own illegal opioids to inject under medical supervision would violate federal law. u.s. district judge gerald mchugh ruled in favor of the nonprofit in october 2019, writing, the ultimate goal of safehouse's proposed operation is to reduce drug use, not facilitate it.\n\nmcswain swiftly appealed and has now won a victory in the 3rd circuit.\n\nthe third circuit's opinion is a faithful reading of the statute's plain language and is consistent with congress's intent to protect american neighborhoods from the scourge of concentrated drug use, mcswain said in a statement.\n\nphiladelphia is known around the world as the birthplace of our wonderful nation and of liberty itself. due to the dedicated work of those at the u.s. attorney's office, it will not be known as the birthplace of heroin injections sites.\n\nthe court fight hinged on the interpretation of section 856 of the u.s. controlled substances act. this crack house statute from 1986 was written at the height of the country's crack epidemic as a way to strengthen prosecution of drug crimes. the law prohibits anyone from maintaining a place for the purpose of using, selling or storing drugs. the statute was later used to prosecute people hosting raves where ecstasy and other popular party drugs were consumed.\n\nduring oral arguments in november, attorneys for safehouse told the court that the federal law does not apply because the central purpose of the site was not, in fact, facilitating drug use but preventing overdoses for those who would be using drugs anyway. the appeals court disagreed.\n\nalthough congress passed [section] 856 to shut down crack houses, its words reach well beyond them, the opinion said. safehouse's benevolent motive makes no difference. and even though this drug use will happen locally and safehouse will welcome visitors for free, its safe-injection site falls within congress' power to ban interstate commerce in drugs.\n\nin her dissenting opinion, judge jane r. roth agreed that those using safehouse to inject drugs would be using drugs whether they did it at safehouse or not.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption kimberly paynter/whyy kimberly paynter/whyy\n\ngoldfein, a safehouse board vice president, said she was disappointed by the ruling, but that it would not be the end of the road for safehouse.\n\nthe opinion doesn't change the science, she said. we have an evidence-based initiative that works, that's still true. that law was not intended to force people to stand by idly while their brothers and sisters are dying.\n\nsafehouse will review its legal options, goldfein said, to determine the best strategy to pursue before moving forward. but she said the safehouse team is hopeful the justice department under the biden administration will be more favorable to its initiative. mcswain, the u.s. attorney, is resigning jan. 22, a move that was expected as part of the transfer of power to the biden administration.\n\nas a u.s. senator, joe biden was among the principal authors of the 1985 federal drug crimes law, but in recent years he has considerably shifted his stance on addiction and substance use. biden has acknowledged the law's sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine led to racial injustices, and he introduced a new bill to eradicate the difference. biden's language about addiction has changed, too, especially in the context of his son hunter's struggle with it.\n\nstill, biden's plan to end the opioid epidemic is light on harm reduction strategies: it makes only one mention of syringe exchanges and no reference to supervised injection sites.\n\nthis story comes from npr's health reporting partnership with whyy and kaiser health news.
on 'big tuesday,' michigan is the biggest prize\n\nafter bernie sanders' disappointing finish in the super tuesday contests, his campaign may hinge on one state voting today: michigan.\n\nsanders himself has called michigan the most important state on this big tuesday.\n\nit's a state where sanders has a lot of history. it was the site of his biggest upset victory in 2016 over hillary clinton, and sanders returned there ahead of donald trump's inauguration to rally in support of the affordable care act.\n\nheading into the primary, sanders has been ramping up his attacks on joe biden's voting record in the senate, particularly his support of trade deals such as nafta and the iraq war.\n\nbut that message doesn't seem to be hitting home for voters. the former vice president, not sanders, has the lead in polls.\n\npatricia scott says she wants to see stability and someone who's able to unify the country in the democratic nominee. she says sanders' attacks on biden don't represent that unity.\n\ni don't think people will [see] bernie … as someone who can really unify the whole country, she says. i think people are looking for a more civil approach to doing things, a more civilized proposal for talking to people and a more civilized approach with a candidacy. and i think joe biden is that [person].\n\nfor julián guerra, the concern over sanders is more a question of whether the vermont senator is too far left for most of the country.\n\nguerra lives in rochester, mich., and says he's happy to see biden emerging as the front-runner.\n\ni'm an idealist guy, guerra says. so i guess bernie would be my guy. but, you know, people aren't going to vote for him. what he wants to do – everything is great and we need it, right? but people are not going to stretch themselves that far out.\n\na loss in michigan would be a big blow for sanders, both for its 125 delegates and for its political symbolism.\n\nbut some supporters here are still hopeful.\n\nariel friedlander, in her senior year at the university of michigan in ann arbor, says she still believes sanders is the only candidate who can beat trump in november.\n\ni don't think [biden] has the momentum to really build a campaign that will turn people out to vote for him, she says. [young voters] need someone they can actually really get behind and get excited about. and that's definitely not biden.\n\nfriedlander says she thinks people are uncomfortable with the big ideas of sanders' campaign. but the hard truth is that that's why people vote for trump, she says and sighs. they wanted big change and they followed the wrong leader and he didn't give them the change they wanted. bernie sanders is the change people want to see.\n\n— barbara sprunt, scott detrow
boston changes 'yawkey way' to 'jersey street' after concerns over racist legacy\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tovia smith/npr tovia smith/npr\n\nupdated at 11:40 a.m. et\n\nboston's yawkey way will be renamed jersey street.\n\nthe boston red sox have won their bid to change the name of the tiny, two-block street outside fenway park. team owners say the change is needed to distance themselves from a history marred by racism under the late, former owner tom yawkey, who was known for his philanthropy, but also for his historically racist ball club.\n\nthe boston public improvement commission voted unanimously thursday to approve the name change.\n\nthe team's current owners have said they're still haunted by yawkey's legacy, and they asked for the street to be renamed to distance themselves from the team's checkered past.\n\nthe yawkey foundations, which advocated keeping the name, called thursday a sad day and said the effort to change the name has been based on a false narrative about his life.\n\ntom yawkey deserved to have his name live on at fenway park, a statement from the yawkey foundations read. we can't change today's decision, but we remain hopeful that he will be remembered as the good and decent man he truly was.\n\nthe red sox were the very last team in the majors to integrate, only finally hiring a black player, elijah jerry pumpsie green, in 1959 — 12 years after jackie robinson broke the color barrier with the brooklyn dodgers. the sox front office was notorious for racism, even spewing the n-word, as many fans were reputed to do as well. the ugly history made it all the more painful last summer at fenway, when orioles center fielder adam jones said a sox fan hurled the n-word at him, along with a bag of peanuts.\n\nsports a history of activism in baseball a history of activism in baseball listen · 3:46 3:46\n\nthe incident triggered an apologetic scramble from the current sox owners, who said they were sickened by the behavior. the team lost no time ejecting the guilty fan, banning him for life, and reiterating that the sox have zero tolerance for any such intolerance. shortly after, as if to underscore their commitment to inclusion and hoping to finally shake off their sordid past, the sox began a campaign to strip yawkey's name from the street they call fenway's front door.\n\nthe undeniable and regrettable history of the red sox make it difficult to continue to give prominence to a symbol associated with an era marred by racial discrimination , said red sox attorney david friedman, at the start of a recent hearing before boston's public improvement commission. the panel, used to much more subdued hearings on street signs and utility poles, got a roomful and an earful about yawkey way.\n\nit is a disgrace, boomed walter carrington, a former u.s. ambassador, who once headed up a state investigation into alleged discrimination by the red sox organization. calling yawkey way massachusetts' confederate statue, he said, every time i — or any black — go into fenway park, it's an insult.\n\nsports latest show: the life and legacy of jackie robinson latest show: the life and legacy of jackie robinson listen · 49:11 49:11\n\nin 1959, when carrington was head of the massachusetts commission against discrimination, he says the red sox organization was rife with bias in its hiring of players — and staff. carrington's investigation included interviews with red sox players, and with jackie robinson, who had been passed over by the red sox after a tryout widely believed to have been a sham.\n\nby the end, carrington came out agreeing with robinson.\n\n[robinson] said then to me, as he has said publicly, that he believed that tom yawkey was the biggest bigot in professional baseball, carrington recalled.\n\nbut the bid to erase yawkey's name has also rallied his fans, like former red sox pitcher jim lonborg. he says yawkey eventually came around to fully embrace the team's black players.\n\ni understand a lot went on early in the history. but i personally saw a change in mr. yawkey...when i think he became a better man, lonborg said, his voice cracking with emotion. and we were all ... better people because he was in our club house.\n\ntoggle caption charles krupa/ap\n\nyawkey's defense included a long line-up of bostonians who've been beneficiaries of all the charity that's been given by yawkey, and his late wife jean, through their foundation, yawkey way 2. the foundation has poured some $300 million into boston organizations — from the boys and girls clubs, to hospitals, the jimmy fund for cancer care and research, food banks, colleges, the urban league, museums, youth programs and more.\n\nthe yawkey family and foundation have helped generations of the least fortunate in this city, said boston business man and philanthropist jack connors. he implored the commission to keep yawkey way, saying that changing it would unfairly smear the yawkeys' name, and complicate the foundation's good work.\n\nhe also warned the commission against heading down a dangerously slippery slope.\n\nwhat ever happened to common sense? he protested. if we're talking about street signs, who's going to talk about washington street, or jefferson way, or madison place?\n\nthe view is shared by other prominent leaders, including some in boston's african-american community.\n\nit's a very slippery slope and ultimately a very divisive slope, says rev. ray hammond, pastor at the historically black bethel ame church in boston, and a yawkey foundations trustee.\n\nthe street name yawkey way is nothing like the confederate memorials that deserve to be dumped, he says. yawkey's sins don't compare, he says, and must be considered in the context of the era, his personal growth, and his generosity. and he says, one must allow for his redemption.\n\nlet's understand all heroes probably have feet of clay. and let's be honest about those feet of clay, and learn from those feet of clay, he says. and maybe bring even a little level of humility to it ourselves, because when our kids evaluate us, they're going to also find feet of clay.\n\nbut others are less forgiving.\n\nredemption starts with someone saying 'i'm sorry', says state rep. byron rushing, and yawkey never publically apologized for the sins of his ball club. so, rushing says, no amount of charity after his death can absolve him.\n\nthat doesn't quite do it, rushing says. this is not an argument about the yawkey foundation. we're talking about the person, not the foundation.\n\nit's why some have suggested a compromise to change the name from yawkey way to yawkey foundation way.\n\noutside fenway fans are mixed on the question.\n\nahhh, that's a hard one, sighs 53-year-old construction worker, william celeste. you can go both ways on it, because everybody in the world is going to do some bad, so there's no such thing as somebody doing all good, right?\n\ntoggle caption david l. ryan/boston globe via getty images\n\nfor retired political science professor john carroll, yawkey's record makes it not a close call at all.\n\nhe was a bigot, carroll says. i certainly knew what the score was in the '50s and '60s. they were an out and out racist organization.\n\nbut others lean more toward a compromise, including some tourists from the south. shawn livermore, from alabama, says whitewashing history would hurt more than it helps. he'd rather see the city keep the yawkey way street name, but also post a plaque nearby, offering a fuller version of history, and a lesson to learn from.\n\nthis knee jerk reaction is to remove it, he says. but i really feel that's begging for history to repeat itself by not making all those moments teachable moments.\n\nlauren mckone agrees that the yawkey way name should stay, even if just out of nostalgia.\n\nit's like a tradition now, the 25-year-old says. you come to yawkey way, and you get sausage on the street before the game. i like yawkey way, and it would be weird if it changed from yawkey way now.\n\nespecially weird, she says to see the street revert to its old name: jersey street. as many have noted, that might not be such a great trade for the red sox. the jersey street name was apparently meant to honor the british isle of jersey, where — in a long ago era — local aristocracy boosted their fortunes buying and selling slaves.
bernie sanders' hallmark rally strategy\n\nthe senator and democratic presidential hopeful designs his rallies with a loose, homemade feel.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nbernie sanders and the other senators running for president are trapped in the president's impeachment trial. but later today, they will zip out back onto the campaign trail using every precious hour to try to make their final pitch to voters. for mr. sanders, that's often at sizable rallies, a hallmark of his campaign. npr's don gonyea takes us to new hampshire to see how the vermont senator has been rallying his loyal base.\n\nsimon: a bernie sanders rally has kind of a loose, homemade feel to it. often, they start with a local band to warm up the crowd, like last weekend on a freezing cold saturday night inside a middle-school gym in manchester.\n\nunidentified person: ladies and gentlemen, please welcome jake swamp and the pine with special guest, the drummer from phish, jon fishman.\n\njake swamp and the pine: (singing) we should left long ago and just gotten out of town.\n\ndon gonyea, byline: and so a night at a bernie sanders rally begins. there are often celebrity activists on hand. in manchester with a basketball hoop and a bernie sign as a backdrop, it's actor john cusack.\n\njohn cusack: we have never ever in our lifetimes had a truer champion of social, economic and climate justice this close to the white house.\n\n(applause)\n\ngonyea: union leaders, campaign volunteers and local candidates take turns at the mike - finally, sanders himself.\n\n(soundbite of song, power to the people)\n\njohn lennon: (singing) power to the people - power to the people...\n\nbernie sanders: thank you.\n\ngonyea: outside, it's been snowing hard since people started arriving hours earlier.\n\nsanders: i am glad to see a little bit of snow does not intimidate those of us from northern new england, right?\n\n(cheering)\n\ngonyea: sanders' speech is heavy on issues - medicare for all, climate change, banning assault weapons, the need for a wealth tax, raising the national minimum wage.\n\nsanders: you know, many of my opponents are saying, oh, bernie. it's too much. we can't pay teachers a living wage. we can't make public colleges and universities' tuition should free. really? that's exactly what we intend to do.\n\ngonyea: as for president trump, the language is blunt.\n\nsanders: that we can't have a president who is a racist and a sexist and a homophobe and a xenophobe and a religious bigot.\n\ngonyea: and a boast about the small-dollar donations to fuel his campaign.\n\nsanders: no campaign in the history of the united states of america has received more contributions from more people at this point in a campaign than we have. that's a political revolution.\n\n(applause)\n\nsanders: thank you all very much.\n\n(soundbite of song, takin' it to the streets)\n\nthe doobie brothers: (singing) takin' it to the streets.\n\ngonyea: afterward, sanders doesn't hang around long, taking selfies like most other candidates do. he works the rope line for a bit then exits out a back door. but the audience is clearly energized by this 78-year-old candidate.\n\nyou seen bernie before?\n\nalice symmes: never - this is my first time. and i got my mom to come with me (laughter).\n\ngonyea: this is alice symmes, a behavior analyst who works with special needs children and their families.\n\nyou're here wearing a button that says bernie beats trump.\n\nsymmes: yes, i am.\n\ngonyea: a lot of people say bernie can't beat trump. some democrats say that.\n\nsymmes: i say they're wrong. and i have confidence that the truth and integrity and character will win.\n\njake swamp and the pine: dick monks is a retired union carpenter who backed sanders four years ago then voted for hillary clinton in the general election. now he's with sanders again. he looks around at a packed house on a night with lousy weather.\n\ndick monks: but this is where people want to be. i think sanders can win because people really want him.\n\ngonyea: and he worries if someone like joe biden wins the nomination then all the enthusiasm democrats have in 2020 could fade. there's something else he likes about this sanders crowd.\n\nmonks: they're young people. the way he mobilized the youth in '16 - he's doing it again. that's encouraging to me.\n\ngonyea: there was yet another bernie sanders event a day later in conway at a brewpub a couple hours to the north - again, a full house. volunteer frank thompson is one of those young sanders supporters.\n\nfrank thompson: so over winter break, i've been campaigning for bernie, canvassing, putting up signs. right now, you know, i'm just kind of...\n\ngonyea: when i asked him to size up the audience at this event, he had the opposite take as dick monks who appreciated all the young people a day earlier in manchester.\n\nthompson: every time i come out here, i am super surprised at how many, you know, older folk are here. i think that's really important for them to turn out.\n\ngonyea: back at the manchester rally, in that saturday night snow, i talked to some sanders supporters outside. zachary merriam as a 23-year-old machinist and labor organizer.\n\nzachary merriam: he's strongly supports the working class. i don't see any other candidate that stacks up with him.\n\ngonyea: if he's not the nominee, what do you do then?\n\nmerriam: i'm not going to vote.\n\ngonyea: you won't vote.\n\nmerriam: no, i won't. i will not.\n\ngonyea: there's no other option.\n\nmerriam: nope.\n\ngonyea: that's a sentiment you heard more often from sanders supporters in 2016. this time, you hear fewer claims that the nominating process is rigged against sanders and more who sound like alice symmes.\n\nsymmes: if i choose not to vote then i feel like that abstaining helps trump. and there's nothing about me that wants to help trump.\n\ngonyea: after the rally, the cleanup crew stacks the folding chairs. music still pipes through the sound system. and with senator sanders tied up with the impeachment trial in these days before iowa and new hampshire, he'll need the people who show up at events like these to reach out to potential backers and to show that the grassroots can turn out the vote, even if the candidate is around a lot less.\n\n(soundbite of song, talkin' 'bout a revolution)\n\ntracy chapman: (singing) talkin' 'bout a revolution.\n\ngonyea: don gonyea, npr news, manchester.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
what drove the drop in kids' asthma er visits at a boston hospital during lockdown?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption pixelseffect/getty images pixelseffect/getty images\n\njust one week after massachusetts closed schools and day cares in march, boston children's hospital saw a drastic change in asthma-related visits to the emergency room: they were down 80% from the prior two months.\n\nfor two more months, during the state's stay-at-home order, they stayed that way. when the order began lifting in late may, the er was seeing 82% and 87% fewer asthma emergency visits compared with 2018 and 2019, according to a recent study published in the journal annals of the american thoracic society.\n\ndr. tregony simoneau, a pediatric pulmonologist and lead author of the study, says she expected a drop-off similar to those seen during summer breaks, but the sustained nature of it and the dramatic drop were surprising.\n\nthe study's authors suggest emergency room avoidance wasn't solely responsible for the decline, but that pandemic-driven changes in individual, community and environmental circumstances are likely at play.\n\nwhile the overall number of er visits went down for patients between the ages of 2 and 22 after the shutdown, the decline was much steeper for the proportion of asthma-related visits in contrast to other types of pediatric emergencies. this held true when compared to the two months before the shutdown and the same time periods in 2018 and 2019, and across ethnicities.\n\nwhat about the children who did require care for asthma emergencies? there was no increase in the share who required hospitalization, suggesting most cases that made it to the er weren't any worse than usual.\n\ndr. alan schroeder, a pediatric critical care doctor at stanford's lucile packard children's hospital, says he has seen a similar trend with pediatric asthma during california's stay-at-home orders early in the pandemic, and in the months since.\n\nlike the boston researchers, he believes the results likely reflect environmental and behavioral changes — ones that might be sustainable in a post-pandemic world.\n\nhere are some of the factors identified by the researchers:\n\nbetter medication adherence\n\nthe centers for disease control and prevention estimates only 54% of children who take asthma medications use them as prescribed, which can lead to more frequent, and severe, asthma attacks. throughout the covid-19 crisis, simoneau says she has noticed patients and families refilling controller inhalers and rescue inhalers earlier and more often, and reporting better adherence to daily medications.\n\nthough it can't be determined if the change is due to fear of hospitals in the pandemic, health talk in the media or other factors (like spending more time at home), the study authors suggest medication adherence could be a big contributor to how long the er visits were able to stay so low, as medications are able to maintain better control of symptoms over time.\n\nschroeder, too, has witnessed a prevailing sense of trying to do everything you can at home to avoid being hospitalized, adding that if that meant more parents encouraging their kids to [use] their inhaler, it wouldn't be surprising as one of the mechanisms at play here.\n\naccess to telemedicine\n\ntelemedicine, also believed to help with medication adherence for adolescents, has had a much bigger role in the delivery of health care while people in the u.s. have sheltered in place.\n\nthe convenience and availability of virtual visits means patients and parents can reach doctors earlier in the course of symptoms, and more often. by providing a platform for better at-home management of asthma symptoms, telemedicine could help fend off emergencies.\n\npreventive hygiene\n\npublic health measures such as hand-washing, social distancing, disinfecting surfaces and staying home when sick are far more common in pandemic life, schroeder points out. and doctors have seen fewer infections with common viruses in the past 10 months — infections that can be lethal for children who have asthma.\n\nthese [measures] work. we've not seen the type of transmissible infections that we would normally be seeing — rsv, rhinovirus, influenza, metapneumovirus. in trying to prevent the transmission of covid-19, we've also prevented the transmission of these other seasonal viruses that cause asthma exacerbations, schroeder says.\n\nsimoneau credits these hygiene habits with keeping asthma emergency rates at boston children's lower going into winter in comparison to previous years, noting only a slight increase in the fall.\n\nenvironmental and other factors\n\nthe study authors also cited environmental reasons: improved air quality as more americans worked from home and had less contact with outdoor allergens such as pollen and dust on playgrounds, many of which have been off-limits during the covid-19 crisis.\n\nthe researchers additionally suspected the lack of participation in school sports, which are known to trigger exercise-induced asthma, both indoors and outdoors.\n\nwhether these factors are sustainable, pandemic-driven lifestyle changes have brought the pediatric community closer to solving a problem that has long plagued them: how to better protect children with asthma and save lives.\n\nit's really an opportunity to do a deeper dive into understanding more about which element has had the greatest contribution to the drop in emergency room visits, simoneau says. this is something we, as both clinicians and researchers, have been struggling with for quite some time, and yet this pandemic was quite effective in showing us what works. we just have to tease apart the things that could be really useful for the future.\n\nand while the value of mask-wearing in non-pandemic times is another question for the future, it's not stopping simoneau's young patients from stepping up to do the right thing now — never mind the contentious debate over mask-wearing among grown-ups.\n\nover time, and with some practice, they're able to wear them, she says of the kids she treats. most of our patients are doing quite well with it.\n\nkristen kendrick is a board-certified family physician in washington, d.c., and a health and media fellow at npr and georgetown university school of medicine.
trump administration rescinds obama rule on transgender students' bathroom use\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption sara d. davis/getty images sara d. davis/getty images\n\nthe trump administration is rescinding protections for transgender students in public schools.\n\nthe move by the justice and education departments reverses guidance the obama administration publicized in may 2016, which said a federal law known as title ix protects the right of transgender students to use restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities.\n\nbut on wednesday, the two federal departments said the obama documents do not contain extensive legal analysis or explain how the position is consistent with the express language of title ix, nor did they undergo any formal public process. this interpretation has given rise to significant litigation regarding school restrooms and locker rooms.\n\na letter issued by the departments also says there must be due regard for the primary role of states and local school districts in establishing educational policy.\n\nthe president has made it clear throughout the campaign that he's a firm believer in states' rights and that certain issues like this are not best dealt with at the federal level, said white house spokesman sean spicer.\n\nabout 150,000 young people ages 13 to 17 identify as transgender, according to the williams institute at the ucla school of law.\n\ncivil rights groups say they worry that the reversal could lead to bullying and violence against vulnerable transgender kids. some protested outside the white house on wednesday evening.\n\nwhen then-president barack obama issued the guidelines last year, the white house directed schools to allow students to use the restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities, citing a federal law that protects students from gender discrimination.\n\nas npr's scott horsley reported, the obama administration warned that schools that defied the recommendation could be at risk of losing federal funds. thirteen states challenged the obama guidelines, and a texas judge put them on hold.\n\nthat administration said the directive was meant to help school districts avoid running afoul of civil rights laws, as we reported.\n\nunder obama, the department of justice sued the state of north carolina over its so-called bathroom law, which prohibits municipal governments in the state from passing laws protecting the rights of transgender people. it also requires trans people in government facilities to use the bathroom corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate.\n\nnorth carolina has lost business over the law, including ncaa championship events that were scheduled to be held in the state.\n\nstate legislatures in new hampshire, colorado and texas, among other states, have also considered bills that would restrict access to restrooms for transgender people.\n\non march 28, the supreme court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in a lawsuit filed by a high school student in virginia. as npr's nina totenberg has reported:\n\ngavin grimm, a 17-year-old senior in gloucester county, [va.] ... came out as transgender when he was a freshman in high school. the school principal allowed him to use the boys' bathroom, until some parents complained, and the school board adopted a policy that required students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their biological sex, or a separate single-stall restroom office.\n\ngrimm sued the school board. his lawsuit argues the bathroom policy is unconstitutional under the 14th amendment and violates title ix of the u.s. education amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination by schools.\n\nin april, the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals allowed the case to proceed. in august, the supreme court ruled 5-3 that the school board did not have to allow grimm to use the restroom of his choice in the interim.\n\njustice stephen breyer said he voted to stay the lower court order as a courtesy to maintain the status quo while the court considered whether to hear the lawsuit, as the two-way reported.\n\nwednesday's documents say the trump administration will more completely consider the legal issues involved in the obama rules and in litigation will not rely on the views expressed within them.\n\nthe american civil liberties union's james esseks says in a statement:\n\nwhile it's disappointing to see the trump administration revoke the guidance, the administration cannot change what title ix means. when it decided to hear gavin grimm's case, the supreme court said it would decide which interpretation of title ix is correct, without taking any administration's guidance into consideration. we're confident that that the law is on gavin's side and he will prevail just as he did in the fourth circuit.
feeling sidelined by mainstream social media, far-right users jump to gab\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption gab.ai/screenshot by npr gab.ai/screenshot by npr\n\na new social network has grown quietly in recent months. it's called gab, and its users are invited to #speakfreely — an appeal attractive to many members of the far right and others who feel their views are stifled by mainstream sites like twitter and facebook.\n\ngab.ai was born not long before the election, a brainchild of a young ceo in a make america great again hat, taking on what he calls the big social with a motto free speech for everyone. while facebook and twitter are attempting to clean up offensive content and misinformation, gab ceo andrew torba argues the efforts result in censorship.\n\nfor whatever reason, we're shying away from individual liberty, individual responsibility to this nanny-state, big-brother-esque forum or model of the internet, which is really scary to me, torba said in a recent conversation with a commentator on youtube.\n\ninstead, gab makes the case for people to be able to post whatever they want, as long as it's legal. that means the site's user guidelines prohibit very few types of posts: illegal pornography, threats of violence or terrorism, confidential information of users without their consent.\n\nshortly after gab launched, a wired article described the site as an artifact from a dystopian universe where the alt-right completely took over twitter. the alt-right has been associated with racism, anti-semitism and misogyny.\n\nrichard spencer, the white nationalist and a major alt-right figure, was suspended from twitter in november along with several other alt-right figures. to be honest, i don't know what i'm going to do, spencer said in a follow-up youtube video. there's obviously gab, which is an interesting medium. ... i think that will be the place where we go next.\n\na wave of news stories followed. the new york times described gab as a digital safe space for the far right. a salon reporter asked torba about gab's logo — a green frog dubbed gabby: i suspected it was a reference to pepe the frog, the reporter wrote, referring to the internet cartoon character that's been associated with the alt-right, neo-nazis and white nationalists. torba says the gab frog is a religious reference, a symbol of exodus and rebirth.\n\nat the time, in the fall, gab was invitation-only. thousands of people were said to be on the wait-list. gab is less than a month old, so it may well flame out like peach or ello, wired's emma grey ellis wrote in that september feature.\n\nearlier this month, gab.ai opened to the public. it is funded with users' contributions. in a post on medium on may 8, gab leaders shared the latest statistics: in under nine months, 170,000 gabbers have 7.6 million posts and raised $145,000 to help us expand our team and cover operational expenses.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption gab.ai/screenshot by npr gab.ai/screenshot by npr\n\ni want a buffet\n\nvisually, gab sort of combines some of the features of twitter, reddit and facebook. you can follow people and repost or comment on anything anywhere. posts are restricted to 300 characters and can be upvoted by the community. gab has developed an android app, but apple has so far rejected the social network from its app store.\n\nthere are permanent categories like cuisine or sports and sort of trending ones, called live topics, like julian assange or seth rich (both reflecting the latest news cycles). before gab got rid of trending hashtags, #maga, #gabfam and #trump were the virtually permanent mainstays.\n\nthere are no bans on hate speech or harassment (and language does fly freely). the users have the option to mute whatever people or terms they want. in the wild, without muting or following particular people, a random scroll through categories on gab is a roller-coaster of posts: some benign ones (a chicken recipe, a prayer in support of president trump, some links to music clips), then a startling one (a photo of a group of klansmen, the leo frank lynching), then back to regular internet lore (a dog video, a saturday night live skit). throughout it all, there's a tremendous amount of debate over news, with a heavy dose of conspiracy theories.\n\neven when you have a bunch of people that are anti-politically correct and, you know, 'things were better in the 50s' or whatever the case ... people you might call alt-right, there's a much bigger group of people that aren't that, says ryan donker.\n\ni originally saw him posting in the science topics on gab and later followed him on twitter. his online handle is @truckdrivinryan — he drives 18-wheelers for a living.\n\nas a local driver doing port work, i have a lot of down time. most of my day is sitting at the port waiting for a box to be taken off or put on, donker says. it's times like that when i'll go on the internet, goof off with people, read up on interesting things, get into arguments — whatever i can do to pass the time.\n\ndonker describes himself as libertarian. he says trump is better than hillary clinton but he does not always agree with the president. donker is also openly gay. his partner is an immigrant. on gab, he says he's faced off with a few haters — but that's what he likes about it: he says here, people are laid bare.\n\nyou know, this social media starts as a place to be free and open and share a bunch of thoughts and ideas all willy-nilly is the way it should be, donker says. i don't want you to feed me — i want a buffet, where i can pick what i want. i don't want an algorithm to control my news feed, i want to decide for myself.\n\nenlarge this image gab.ai/screenshot by npr gab.ai/screenshot by npr\n\nconservative exodus from twitter\n\nas told by ceo torba, gab's birth dates to the controversy over facebook's sidelining of conservative-leaning topics from the trending display.\n\nthat's when i saw the opportunity to ... step up and defend free speech, defend individual liberty, defend the free flow of information that i saw under attack, torba says in the recent youtube video, in which he also describes feeling like a minority in silicon valley as a conservative, as a christian, as a straight white male in a place that's very far-left, very progressive and very liberal-minded. (he now lives in austin.)\n\ncraig combs, a poet and writer from michigan, says he felt facebook was dominated by the liberal left. he says his posts there would regularly get removed, which he attributes to censorship. it was almost like being thrown into a timeout corner as a child, he says. i'm 48; i don't need to be treated this way.\n\ncombs says he first heard about gab from david seaman and other youtubers as he followed the pizzagate conspiracy. (combs does not believe mainstream fact-checking and news sites that have debunked the rumors, and in an email said the story has the potential to get very, very huge indeed.) he quickly shifted to the new platform, and describes himself as an avid poster.\n\nat first, i will be frank, it was a little culture shock for me, he says. going from the liberalism of facebook and having to adjust to that culture, then going to gab — which frankly, even four months ago was very different than it is now. ... it was like a conservative exodus from twitter.\n\ncombs says he is not conservative — he has conservative values, but he describes himself as a libertarian, an independent thinker, and he is also gay.\n\ni was at odds quite a bit over that, combs says. i have encountered several people on gab when i first started, i will be very frank, there is a very conservative thread that runs through that platform. and i think they're starting to get it that they're not there to control the conversation.\n\ncombs and donker both say gab's decision to open the floodgates is already helping to add diversity of views to what they both assume was the original crowd of hard-line conservative republicans.\n\nbut are there any liberals? donker laughs. there are a few, he says, later adding: i've never heard anybody say they support hillary. but then again, gab is a big place.\n\neditor's note: one change has been made to the web version of this story. earlier, we wrote that craig combs maintains his belief in the debunked pizzagate stories. it now simply quotes what combs said in an email to npr, that the pizzagate story has the potential to get very, very huge, indeed.
cdc changes course, says everyone should cover their face in public\n\nu.s. officials say high-quality masks should still be saved for health care workers, but are encouraging people to use something to cover their mouth and nose when they're out in public.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\ngot masks? well, you should. there's new guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention, which now says they recommend wearing cloth face coverings in public, where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain like the grocery store or the pharmacy or a workplace. npr's allison aubrey joins us. morning, allison.\n\nallison aubrey, byline: good morning.\n\nsimon: we know we're supposed to keep 6 feet between each other when we're out of the house. and, of course...\n\naubrey: that's right.\n\nsimon: ...we've known for weeks wash our hands. tell us now about covering our faces.\n\naubrey: well, the cdc says that what scientists know now, given recent studies, is that a lot of people with coronavirus lack symptoms or they have only mild symptoms, and they can transmit the virus. so this means if an infected person goes out and interacts in close quarters with others, they can unknowingly spread it. one person who pushed to make this change recommending broader use of masks is the former fda commissioner scott gottlieb.\n\nscott gottlieb: so if you're a person who has the coronavirus and you're mildly symptomatic - you don't think you're sick - or you're asymptomatic and don't even know that you have symptoms at all, and you have a mask on, you're going to be far less likely to transmit the infections.\n\nsimon: but, allison, we know there's a shortage of masks for health care workers who need them.\n\naubrey: that's right.\n\nsimon: we're being asked to aid in what's being characterized as a war effort and put our own masks together.\n\naubrey: you know, the cdc guidance is pretty open-ended it says cloth face coverings fashioned from household items made from, quote, common materials at low cost can be used. and if you go online, there is no shortage of ideas of how to make these masks. you can fold them. origami masks. you can 3d print them. you can sew them. there are burberry-inspired masks on etsy for the fashion minded. so, you know, there are some unanswered questions. not all studies point to a benefit from cloth masks compared to other types of medical-grade masks. and the type of material you use probably can make a difference. a physician i spoke to yesterday pointed out that a face covering made of a knitted wool scarf where you can see the holes is probably not as protective compared to, say, a tight weave cotton fabric. so a cdc spokesperson told me they do hope to add some more details soon, and they have information on there now about how best to wear and how to clean your face coverings.\n\nsimon: there is a social aspect, too, though isn't there? wearing a mask sends a message.\n\naubrey: yeah, i think so. i mean, i spoke to michael klompas, he's an infectious disease expert at brigham and women's hospital. and, you know, he told me there is a symbolic power in wearing a mask. he says to him, the message it sends is this.\n\nmichael klompas: watch out. there's a public health crisis right now. there's a virus going around. we need to be on our top guard. and so i think it can actually be a reinforcer, a reminder of the state of crisis that we face here in society.\n\nsimon: president trump emphasized yesterday this is voluntary. he volunteered that he's not volunteering. what do experts say?\n\naubrey: (laughter) that's right.\n\nsimon: yeah. what do experts say?\n\naubrey: the president kind of downplayed it. some say he downplayed it, calling it voluntary, saying do it if you want to. and a federal official told me last night that the white house kind of leaned on the cdc to emphasize that this recommendation is especially aimed at people living in hot spot areas where there are a lot of cases. but the cdc, this source tells me, really wanted to encourage all americans everywhere to follow the guidance because it's not just a few hot spots. so at this point, staying socially distant, obviously, and covering your face when you must go out into a crowded space could benefit all of us.\n\nsimon: npr's allison aubrey. thanks so much.\n\naubrey: thank you, scott.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump visits cdc after coronavirus fears throw schedule into chaos\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jim watson/afp via getty images jim watson/afp via getty images\n\nupdated at 7 p.m. et\n\npresident trump on friday stopped in at the atlanta headquarters of the centers for disease control and prevention, the agency marshaling the response to coronavirus — a major political test for his administration.\n\nthe trip itself was almost derailed by coronavirus fears, and mixed signals about what was happening created an on-again, off-again drama that played out in front of television cameras. the chaotic impression clashed with the white house quest to show that the public health crisis is under control.\n\nit will end. people have to remain calm, trump said.\n\ntrump and his officials did a 47-minute impromptu news conference, answering questions both scientific — and very political.\n\ntrump slammed jay inslee, the democratic governor grappling with an outbreak in his state. vice president pence had spent time with inslee on thursday and praised his work.\n\nthat governor is a snake, trump said, grousing that he expected inslee would be critical of the job his administration is doing on coronavirus. mike may be happy with him, but i'm not.\n\nand moments before pence, at a white house briefing, somberly announced that some 2,500 passengers stranded on the grand princess cruise ship off the california coast would be brought to land to be tested and quarantined — trump said he would rather they stay on the ship.\n\nour numbers are going to go up, he complained, referring the number of cases of coronavirus. pence said of 46 tests done so far, 19 crew and two passengers have tested positive. (the crew will remain in quarantine on the ship.)\n\nthe white house carefully staged a series of events this week to try to show that it had taken charge of the coronavirus response: meetings with congress and industry leaders, a tour of a vaccine lab at the national institutes of health, and vice president mike pence's trip to washington state to meet local leaders grappling with the outbreak.\n\nto cap off the week, trump was supposed to sign the $8 billion emergency funding package for the response into law in atlanta at the cdc. pence even mentioned it in remarks during his washington visit.\n\nbut late thursday night, when the white house issued trump's daily public schedule, it surprisingly did not include a stop in atlanta. it took some time for the white house to explain the change.\n\nthe president is no longer traveling to atlanta today. the cdc has been proactive and prepared since the very beginning and the president does not want to interfere with the cdc's mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency, a white house official first explained, in a statement.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption win mcnamee/getty images win mcnamee/getty images\n\ntrump was still slated to fly to tennessee to survey tornado damage. before he left, the white house hastily arranged a bill-signing ceremony.\n\nthat's when trump revealed a different explanation for the scheduling snafus.\n\ntrump said a cdc employee had showed symptoms of the virus. the white house learned about the suspected case on thursday.\n\nthey had one person who was potentially infected, trump told reporters. the staffer was tested, then cleared. it turned out negative, so we'll see if we can do it, he said of the visit.\n\nwe're going to try to go, he told reporters before leaving for nashville. i may be going, we're going to see if we can turn it around.\n\ntrump later said it made sense for him to stop in atlanta, given that he was on his way from nashville to palm beach, fla., where he plans to spend the weekend. it was a big deal with the secret service, but they're fantastic and they worked it out, he said.\n\nthere were no immediate details from the cdc about the suspected case.\n\nduring the flight to nashville, white house spokeswoman stephanie grisham told reporters on air force one that the atlanta stop was back on the schedule. what the president said is true, grisham said, referring to the suspected case.\n\na cdc staffer was suspected of having contracted the virus, so the white house canceled the stop out of an abundance of caution, grisham said.\n\na spokeswoman for the cdc did not go into specifics. cdc has many employees who have deployed in support of the nation's response to covid-19, some of whom are returning from areas where covid-19 may be present, kristen nordlund said in a statement.\n\ncdc has issued guidance to these employees, including self-quarantine for 14 days after they have returned to their duty stations for those returning from certain areas. they will also undergo daily, active monitoring. no cdc employees have tested positive, nordlund said.\n\nasked why the initial white house statement had provided a different explanation than the president, grisham said it had been carefully worded so that it was accurate — including language about the cdc keeping its people safe — without revealing the concern about the possibly infected cdc employee.\n\nthankfully she's negative, the person, grisham said.\n\nnpr's miles parks and joe neel contributed to this story.
fresh air remembers oscar award-winning actor martin landau\n\nlandau, who died saturday, appeared in the films crimes and misdemeanors and ed wood, as well as in the 1960s tv series mission impossible. originally broadcast in 1990.\n\nterry gross, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. we're going to listen back to an interview with actor martin landau. he died saturday at the age of 89. for 20 years, landau took many movie and tv roles that he didn't much like. when he finally got a challenging role as a businessman hustler in francis ford coppola's 1988 film tucker, landau that was nominated for an academy award for best supporting actor.\n\nthe next year, woody allen gave him a part in crimes and misdemeanors as a philandering husband who has his mistress murdered when she threatens to tell his wife about their affair. again, landau was nominated for an oscar. he won an oscar for his 1994 portrayal of bela lugosi in tim burton's movie ed wood. more recently, he received two emmy nominations for his performance in the tv series without a trace. back in the '60s, landau was best known for his role in the tv series mission: impossible as covert operations agent rollin hand.\n\nlandau got his start in the actor's studio, which was founded in the late '40s in new york by elia kazan and lee strasberg and was the training ground for actors such as marlon brando, james dean, geraldine page, robert de niro and steve mcqueen. when i spoke with landau in 1990, he told me about getting admitted to the actors studio in 1955.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nmartin landau: that year, 2,000 people auditioned trying to get in, and two were accepted that year. steve mcqueen and i were the only two. and it was tough to get in. it's still tough to get in.\n\ngross: what did you have to do to get in?\n\nlandau: well, i did a scene - a five-minute scene with a partner - not classical, contemporary, you know, give-and-take scene. you can't do a monologue. and it's still the case. and i did a scene from a play called clash by night. lee strasberg actually directed it on broadway with a cast consisting of lee j. cobb, tallulah bankhead and joseph schildkraut. at any rate, i chose a five-minute scene from that piece. everyone told me i was crazy because lee had directed it. and they said there's nothing - there would be no way that he would, you know, agree with what i chose because he - his closeness to that material.\n\nat any rate, the final audition was being judged by elia kazan, you know, who directed streetcar named desire and - on broadway and in the movie and on the waterfront and east of eden, and cheryl crawford, who was a famous broadway producer and one of the co-founders of the group theater and lee strasberg. and you had to get three one votes from all of them - one, two or three. three meant no. two meant not bad; come back another time. and one meant you were in. and i guess in retrospect it was a bit daring, but strasberg did - gave me a one vote as well.\n\ngross: so is you and steve mcqueen, who got in, of those 2,000 people who auditioned, were you and steve mcqueen competitive with each other at all as the two newcomers?\n\nlandau: not really, no. steve was very different physically than i was. i was very lean and very dark and much more ethnic in feel. and steve was - i think he was much more competitive with a very close friend of mine called jimmy dean, james dean. i was in a different sort of category. johnny cassavetes and sydney pollack and those kinds of fellows were my competition.\n\ngross: now, you stuck with the actors studio as a teacher. you met a lot of actors before they had the screen personas that they're now famous for - for instance, jack nicholson who had been one of your students. would you have guessed working with him early on that he would have become - i don't mean as famous as he is - that he would have had the kind of persona that we now know him for?\n\nlandau: yes. a lot of that was evident. i mean it's - you know, it's silly to, you know, to say that, but it's true. in choosing that particular group of people - there were 16 in all - i saw 200 people, and i spent my time not auditioning them but talking to them and trying to discourage them from coming into my class because what i did in the class demanded a certain kind of allegiance and diligence and tenacity and hard work.\n\nbut i looked for things in the people, and jack did all the right things wrong and all the wrong things right, which is what i always looked for. strange - it's hard to say. it's sort of a kinesthetic thing, but i saw a lot of stuff in jack. and he looked like the boy next door in those days, but there was nothing about the boy next door and his persona.\n\ngross: knowing as many actors and directors as you did through the actors studio, how do you think that affected your early career getting roles?\n\nlandau: well, i was always considered very offbeat in those days. i was very...\n\ngross: for what reason?\n\nlandau: ...very thin.\n\ngross: oh, i'm sorry, yeah.\n\nlandau: i was very thin, exceedingly thin. if you look at north by northwest, you'll get a clue. and...\n\ngross: you were one of the spies in north by northwest.\n\nlandau: well, yeah. james mason and i played the two spies - very, very lean and very kind of stark looking. and it was a period where, you know, plays like picnic were being done on broadway, and movie actors look more like rock hudson and guy madis and tab hunter. and i was, you know, intrinsically a character actor but not easy to cast because of a very, you know - it was a different time. i mean there were no - you know, al pacino and dustin hoffman and bobby de niro would also have had a great deal of problem in those days because they would have been considered offbeat. but times change. and i wound up playing many, many bad guys in movies as a result of my looks.\n\ngross: like what? which kind of roles are you talking about? which movies?\n\nlandau: well, all kinds, you know - i mean gangsters, the untouchables. i would always be some kind of deadly guy, you know, who talked like this, you know, very dangerous - and just, you know, westerns. i mean if you look at a picture like nevada smith, i - you know, i play a maniacal killer that steve mcqueen chases down because my character along with arthur kennedy and karl malden have killed his parents. that's the essence of that film that henry hathaway directed.\n\nas - you know, hitchcock cast me in north by northwest even though he saw me in a play in which i didn't play a conventional bad guy, though i was the catalyst in the piece. it was paddy chayefsky's first play on broadway called middle of the night. i toured with that, and that brought me to california. and hitchcock saw me on opening night and had me in mind for north by northwest as a result of that. though the character was 180 degrees different than the role i played in north by northwest.\n\nso the old guys - i mean the old, wonderful, imaginative fellows historically have always had imagination and broken conventional thinking. i mean even as recently as my being cast in tucker - i mean i don't think there's anyone in the world who would have cast me in tucker other than fred roos, who was francis coppola's producer, and francis coppola. it would not have been conventional thinking on anyone's part for, you know - in fact there were people who after they'd heard i'd been cast in that role who were involved were surprised at the casting. but the...\n\ngross: what would have surprised them about it? i mean you fit the role so perfectly seeing the movie.\n\nlandau: well, but that's after the fact.\n\ngross: right. that's after the fact. how was it - was the role...\n\nlandau: i mean everyone is very quick to jump on me...\n\ngross: right (laughter).\n\nlandau: ...after the fact in this world, and on - you know? and i mean immediately after playing tucker, there were, you know, script after script after script with a lot of very ethnic, mostly jewish, older men - were sent my way. it takes a woody allen to think of me as the character i played in crimes and misdemeanors, again a departure from anything i'd ever done before and anything he'd seen me in before.\n\nbut it takes those kind - you know, i'm an actor who's got a very wide range, i mean much more so than almost anyone i know in deference to myself. i'm not speaking, you know, egocentrically at all, but i do have a very wide range. i could play a lot of things. and it's hard for people and logically hard and understandably hard for people to think of me for certain roles.\n\ngross: actor martin landau is my guest. you have received academy award nominations both for tucker and for your role in woody allen's movie crimes and misdemeanors.\n\nlandau: crimes and misdemeanors, yes.\n\ngross: now, you had told us that it was, like, 20 years since you'd gotten, like, a really good movie role.\n\nlandau: that's right.\n\ngross: how did you feel to you, like, in the mind of the public, you know, and some people in hollywood to kind of go overnight from being the guy who played the heavy all the time in movies to suddenly being this, you know, venerated actor (laughter) you know?\n\nlandau: well, it's, you know - the interesting thing is - i mean among actors over the years, i've always had a great deal of respect from them as a director, as an actor, as a...\n\ngross: as a teacher.\n\nlandau: ...as a teacher. so i mean it's something that they've always said to me. what's wrong with the business? i mean i know a number of actors, for instance, personally who should be doing much more work than they are doing because they're awfully good. but i worked with a lot of great directors when i first came to hollywood with a reputation as a good new york actor - theater actor, live-television actor. so that seemed to have been curtailed by my, quote, unquote, success on mission impossible, where suddenly i became super spy and, you know...\n\ngross: so you feel in a way that mission impossible hurt your career afterwards.\n\nlandau: well, it helped me in many ways, and it hurt me in other ways.\n\ngross: yeah.\n\nlandau: but i think there are always - when somebody gives you something for a headache, there are sometimes side effects. you get an upset stomach.\n\ngross: right.\n\nlandau: i got a chance to play almost a one-man rep company - everything from adolf hitler to martin bormann to myself blond and young - 10 years younger, to all kinds of different dialects and accents and the like, you know, and the middle-european people - and crazy, all kinds of things, if you know what i'm saying, my dear.\n\ngross: you are the master of disguises on this show.\n\nlandau: that's right, a man of a thousand face.\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\nwe're listening back to a 1990 interview with actor martin landau. he died saturday at the age of 89. we'll hear more after a break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. let's get back to my 1990 interview with martin landau. he died saturday at the age of 89. one of his best-known performances is in the woody allen film crimes and misdemeanors. he played judah rosenthal, a philandering husband whose mistress is threatening to tell his wife about their affair. she's also threatening to reveal information about judah's questionable business deals. in this scene, judah's brother, played by jerry orbach, tells judah that he has friends who can take care of judah's problems. martin landau as judah speaks first.\n\n(soundbite of film, crimes and misdemeanors)\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) i'm fighting for my life. this woman's going to destroy everything i've built.\n\njerry orbach: (as jack rosenthal) that's what i'm saying, judah. if the woman won't listen to reason, then you go on to the next step.\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) what, threats, violence? what are we talking about here?\n\norbach: (as jack rosenthal) she can be gotten rid of. i mean i know a lot of people. money will buy whatever's necessary.\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) i'm not even going to comment on that. that's mind-boggling.\n\norbach: (as jack rosenthal) well, what did you want me to do when you called me?\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) not to do dirty work despite what you think. i don't know what i expected from you, jack, but...\n\norbach: (as jack rosenthal) you know, you're not aware of what goes on in this world. i mean you sit up here with your four acres...\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) don't give me any of that. i don't want to hear about my success.\n\norbach: (as jack rosenthal) ...and your country club and your rich friends. and out there in the real world, it's a whole different story.\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) oh, come on.\n\norbach: (as jack rosenthal) i've met a lot of characters from when i had the restaurant...\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) i know you have. i've heard these stories before.\n\norbach: (as jack rosenthal) ...from seventh avenue, from atlantic city. and i'm not so high-class that i can avoid looking at reality. i can't afford to be aloof. i mean you come to me with a hell of a problem, and then you get high-handed on me.\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) jack, i don't mean to high-handed. i haven't been sleeping nights. i'm irritable, ok?\n\norbach: (as jack rosenthal) ok, ok, forget i said anything.\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) let me just get something straight here. am i understanding you right? i mean are you suggesting getting rid of her?\n\norbach: (as jack rosenthal) you won't be involved, but i'll need some cash.\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) what will they do?\n\norbach: (as jack rosenthal) what'll they do? they'll handle it.\n\nlandau: (as judah rosenthal) i can't believe i'm talking about a human being, jack. she's not an insect. you don't just step on her.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: let me ask you about crimes and misdemeanors. did woody allen or one of his people call you and say, we want you for the role, or did you have to audition for it?\n\nlandau: no. what happened was, i got a call saying that woody was interested in me for a role. and i said, well, is there a script? and then - which was greeted with laughter on the other side of the telephone because i mean woody doesn't - you know, i mean most of the time the actors don't read the whole script. no one reads the whole script except woody and maybe mia and the casting director. so - but i was then told that it would be worth my while to fly into new york. so i did.\n\nbut prior to what i - i also went out and did a little homework because i - reading a script and seeing a movie are two different experiences. so i went out to samuel french, which is a theatrical book store here in los angeles and in new york as well, and got eight of his screenplays. so when i met with woody and we talked, he then gave me the script, which was unusual i found out afterwards, to read in the hotel room, which i did.\n\nso it was the 9th screenplay of woody's that i read in four days, and it was the best one. and it was one of those times when you - well, your heart starts beating faster, and adrenaline starts flowing. first of all, it was the biggest male role he'd ever written outside of the woody allen character because his protagonists generally have been women - diane keaton, mia farrow, even recently gena rowlands, geraldine page in interiors. so he'd never really written a big male character that wasn't played by woody.\n\ngross: why did he feel that you needed to read the whole script?\n\nlandau: well, because there was no way to play that character without knowing everything about that movie because of the delicacy of it. i mean there's no - i mean it's a terribly - an incredibly delicate, delicate thing. you're dealing with a man who's a rich brat of a man, who's a liar, who's a cheat, who's an embezzler, who's a murderer, who's - i mean there's not a redeeming thing he does. and yet, the audience has to, you know - from my point of view, and this is what i expressed to woody - has to empathize and sympathize and join up with him as they're being horrified by what he does.\n\ni felt it was essential that the audience see themselves in this character, and that the only way to do that - i mean, the character doesn't do one single thing of redemption in the entire movie. he's an awful person. and i - you know, you could - in this clicker mentality we're living in, where people click things off television in 15 or 20 minutes, it'd be very easy for the audience to say, hey, this guy's a jerk, i don't like him, in 20 - and you don't have a movie. so how to delicately deal with that and also, you know, the claire bloom character...\n\ngross: ...who plays your wife.\n\nlandau: yes, but she doesn't know what the - you know, i mean, that's a very delicate thing. i mean, she knows that i'm having some problems. but she doesn't know the degree to which the problems are - i mean, this is a man who's - has a - who's having a major, major breakdown, a nervous breakdown, on top of the fact that he does something that is among the most heinous things a, quote, unquote, leading character has ever done.\n\ngross: so does claire bloom - when you were acting with claire bloom, had she not read the part of the script where...\n\nlandau: no, she didn't read anything but her parts of the script.\n\ngross: ...it's revealed that you're a murderer?\n\nlandau: she just knew that we were a happy couple.\n\ngross: so she had no idea what you were really guilty of. she knew something was up, she had no idea what, when she was acting that part.\n\nlandau: well, she just knew that i was, you know, having some business problems, possibly.\n\ngross: do you think this works? do you think this is a good way to go about doing that?\n\nlandau: well, it depends. it works with woody, doesn't it?\n\ngross: yeah.\n\nlandau: i mean, he didn't want anjelica to know what kind of life my home life was because i don't let her in on that. so anjelica's character was not privy to that part of the story. you know, a lot of times, actors are bogged down by obligation. an actor knows much more about a character than the character knows about himself. and to know everything there is about a character consciously may not enable you to play the character, necessarily.\n\nit's what motivates you unconsciously that drives you on. characters reveal things inadvertently, very often, not purposefully. no one walks into a crowded room at a cocktail party filled with strangers and says, hello, everybody, i'm embarrassed.\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\nlandau: you know, that's not something people do.\n\ngross: right.\n\nlandau: therefore, what you - what people in that condition are trying to do is trying to convince themselves they're relaxed and trying to appear relaxed to other people when, in fact, what's going on is contrary to that. so the actor has to create the degree of unrest and then try to cover it.\n\ngross: i want to thank you very much for talking with us.\n\nlandau: thank you very much.\n\ngross: my interview with martin landau was recorded in 1990. he died saturday at the age of 89. after we take a short break, maureen corrigan will review two comic novels. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of lary barilleau and the latin jazz collective's carmen's mambo)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
reaction to white house directive on transgender bathrooms\n\nthe obama administration says schools must allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. david greene talks to matt sharp of the alliance defending freedom.\n\ndavid greene, host:\n\na letter is going out later today from the obama administration to every school district in the country. it says schools must allow transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. this move was quickly welcomed by mara keisling. she's the executive director of the national center for transgender equality. she said she hopes that parents can set their biases aside as the new rules are implemented.\n\nmara keisling: there's all sorts of kinds of kids that other people's parents don't feel comfortable with, and that's not how we decide who gets to learn safely in school. all children get to learn safely in school.\n\ngreene: and let's hear another voice now. it's matt sharp. he's an attorney with the faith-based legal group alliance defending freedom, which has opposed similar policies in public schools across the country. mr. sharp, good morning.\n\nmatt sharp: thank you for having me.\n\ngreene: well, thanks for things coming on the program. we appreciate it. let me just ask you - i mean, the administration, this letter going out this morning. the real foundation of it is this federal law called title ix that prohibits sex discrimination in schools. and the administration is saying this protects transgender people based on their gender identity. tell me your reaction to that reading of the law.\n\nsharp: well, it's completely wrong. for over 40 years now, congress and courts that have looked at title ix have all consistently said title ix was meant to combat sex discrimination. it's never been interpreted to include gender identity, and so the idea was always to ensure equal opportunities for men and women. importantly, title ix was specifically written to protect student privacy. it allows schools to have separate restrooms and locker rooms and dormitories on the basis of sex. so what the obama administration is doing here is essentially rewriting the law, ignoring congress, ignoring the normal process they're supposed to go through to force their agenda on schools across the country.\n\ngreene: well, what would you tell a family with a transgender child who identifies as a girl or a boy and believes that their girl or boy is going to school and deserves those protections under title ix and believes very much in what the obama administration is doing and wants their child to be protected and not discriminated against?\n\nsharp: well, their child should absolutely be protected against bullying, harassment or anything else. and we've seen schools across the country do a great job of protecting every student under their care. but part of that duty of protection is also protecting the right of privacy. and so we're hearing from lots of students across the country and parents saying this violates our right to privacy when we're forced to share locker rooms, showers and restrooms with someone of the opposite sex. and so that's actually what motivated, i think, over 130 parents and students in chicago to actually sue the federal government because they came in and forced the school to open up their restrooms and locker rooms to the opposite sex.\n\ngreene: can you understand, though, that the family or parents of a transgender child who believes this is a delicate situation, but that their - the rights of their child might - you know, might be more important than sort of another child having to sort of get used a situation that he or she might find, you know, a little sensitive in a bathroom?\n\nsharp: well, but it's not about one student's rights being more important than another. it's about protecting every student's rights to privacy. and so what we've seen schools do is offer accommodations to any student, including transgender students, that are not comfortable with communal restrooms, allowing them to use single-stall restrooms or whatever's available so that they've got a choice. but they also have a duty to protect every other student's constitutional right to privacy when the courts across the country have recognized as implicated when you've got restrooms and locker rooms and why title ix was drafted the way it is. so schools have to protect that. and what they're trying to do is make sure that every student has a place where they can use restroom, change and shower and feel comfortable without having to break down our traditions of having separate restrooms on the basis of biological sex.\n\ngreene: let me just - you're representing 51 families in a school district in illinois, which allows students to use bathrooms according to gender identity, and these families are fighting that policy. can you tell me the story of just maybe one family and exactly on a personal level what they're objecting to?\n\nsharp: absolutely. and so we've got several families there that the obama administration came in and forced the district 211 to allow a biological boy into the female's restrooms. and so these girls are telling stories about how when they're in their locker room changing for pe, they're now uncomfortable knowing that a boy can walk in at any time under the school's new policy. they talk about how one girl in particular does not change out of her gym clothes but rather wears them all day long, wears them after going to gym, after getting them dirty and nasty through pe class and then just puts her clothes on top of it because she's so nervous about the possibility of having to change and shower and whatnot in front of this boy. and we hear stories like that across the country of these girls speaking out and saying, look, we don't want this student to be bullied or harassed or anything, but we also want our privacy protected. and we just want to know that when we go into these lockers and shower rooms that we're not going to be forced to share with someone of the opposite biological sex. that's all these girls are asking for.\n\ngreene: matt sharp is an attorney with alliance defending freedom, a faith-based legal advocacy group. mr. sharp, thanks for your time this morning.\n\nsharp: thank you so much.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
harvard professor's arrest raises questions about scientific openness\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption charles krupa/ap charles krupa/ap\n\nuntil late last month, charles lieber lived the quiet life of an elite american scientist. his lab at harvard university researched things like how to meld tiny electronics with the brain. in his spare time, he grew award-winning pumpkins in front of his house.\n\nand then, on jan. 28, the fbi came knocking on his door.\n\nnow lieber faces charges of trading knowledge for money and lying about it. prosecutors allege he set up a lab in china in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments from the chinese government and then denied knowledge of those payments to u.s. investigators.\n\nlieber's attorney, peter levitt, declined to talk to npr about the allegations. but others watching the case say it raises important questions about ethics, scientific openness and possible racial profiling in an era of geopolitical tension.\n\nthis is a big, big case, says frank wu, a professor at the university of california hastings college of the law who tracks chinese espionage cases. this is a case that's all about u.s.-china relations. it's about competition. it's about how science should be done.\n\nthe lieber case centers on a chinese recruitment program called the thousand talents plan. it was started by the chinese government in 2008, primarily as a way to draw chinese researchers back to china, according to michael lauer, the deputy director of extramural research at the national institutes of health.\n\nthe chinese government wanted to bring back outstanding scientists to china, so as to develop their science and technology, lauer says.\n\nover time, the program began to recruit western scientists as well. researchers were asked to set up labs in china and spend at least part of their time doing work there, in exchange for grants and expenses paid. some relocated to china, but others split their time between their home institutions and a chinese university.\n\nsuch programs exist in other countries. canada, for example, has had a 150 research chairs program that looks similar in many ways to the thousand talents plan.\n\nbut the nih has become aware of numerous ethical breaches related to the chinese plan, lauer says. some researchers have submitted identical grant applications to both the nih and thousand talents. others have shared confidential grant applications from other researchers with their collaborators in china. and then there is the question of money: researchers are failing to disclose the funding they receive from china to u.s. agencies like the nih, as required by law.\n\nthe types of behaviors that we are seeing are not subtle or minor violations, lauer says. what we're seeing is really quite egregious.\n\nthe funding issues have already cost over a dozen researchers their jobs at institutions around the u.s. lauer says the nih is investigating about 180 other scientists, though many other participants appear to be conducting their work aboveboard.\n\nthe increased scrutiny by research agencies like nih has been accompanied by a rise in criminal prosecutions by the justice department. in 2018, attorney general jeff sessions launched what he called the china initiative, a broad program to crack down on the transfer of u.s. knowledge to china. to date, the initiative has brought criminal charges against dozens of people and won several convictions for espionage.\n\nthese kinds of cases are not always straightforward, especially when fundamental research is involved. in spring 2015, xi xiaoxing, a physicist at temple university in philadelphia, was arrested and accused of sharing sensitive technology with his collaborators in china.\n\nit later emerged that he never did. what's more, he says, everything he did share was already public, because the findings of basic research aren't secret. they're published in scientific journals.\n\nacademic espionage is a contradiction, xi says. there's nothing to steal, you can just sit there and read your paper.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption saul loeb/afp via getty images saul loeb/afp via getty images\n\nthe federal prosecutor who is pursuing the case against harvard chemist charles lieber agrees.\n\nall the thousand talents program does is induce people who are doing research in the united states to come to china, and do the same research, by offering them money, says andrew lelling, the united states attorney for the district of massachusetts. and that's not illegal, per se.\n\nbut lelling says researchers have to disclose the money they receive to funding agencies and to their home university. that's in part because federal research agencies don't want to pay for the same science twice — in the u.s. and in china.\n\nthe criminal complaint against lieber alleges that he lied to both the government and harvard about his involvement in the thousand talents plan. according to the complaint, lieber was involved with the program from at least 2012 to 2017. his contract called for a salary as high as $50,000 a month, along with about $150,000 per year for living expenses and $1.5 million to establish a lab at the wuhan university of technology.\n\nlieber set up the wut-harvard joint nano key laboratory, according to the complaint, without telling harvard about it. the complaint says that when questioned by harvard and investigators from the department of defense, which, together with the nih, gave him nearly $18 million in grants, lieber said, he was never asked to participate in the thousand talents program. lieber is currently out on a $1 million dollar bond.\n\nlieber isn't chinese, but many of the researchers getting arrested or fired over accusations they took money from the thousand talents program are chinese nationals or of chinese ethnicity. that has led some to assert that the government is racially profiling, a charge lelling denies.\n\nif it was the french government that was attempting to steal u.s. technology in a massive decadelong campaign, we'd look for french people. but it's not, it's the chinese government, he says.\n\nstill, law professor frank wu says a recent increase in criminal prosecution marks a big change. up until a few years ago, universities were urging their researchers to collaborate with china. if there was a funding issue, a researcher might face disciplinary action, but you wouldn't face being fired and going to prison and having your name dragged through the mud as a spy, wu says.\n\nwu says he fears this new, and in his eyes heavy-handed, response could end up alienating tens of thousands of students and researchers of chinese origin. these are researchers who he believes provide the u.s. far more than anything china is getting through its thousand talents plan.\n\nscientific progress here, entrepreneurial progress here, has been driven

30 years after explosion, challenger engineer still blames himself\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bob pearson/afp/getty images bob pearson/afp/getty images\n\nthirty years ago, as the nation mourned the loss of seven astronauts on the space shuttle challenger, bob ebeling was steeped in his own deep grief.\n\nthe night before the launch, ebeling and four other engineers at nasa contractor morton thiokol had tried to stop the launch. their managers and nasa overruled them.\n\nthat night, he told his wife, darlene, it's going to blow up.\n\nwhen challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff, ebeling and his colleagues sat stunned in a conference room at thiokol's headquarters outside brigham city, utah. they watched the spacecraft explode on a giant television screen and they knew exactly what had happened.\n\nthree weeks later, ebeling and another engineer separately and anonymously detailed to npr the first account of that contentious pre-launch meeting. both were despondent and in tears as they described hours of data review and arguments. the data showed that the rubber seals on the shuttle's booster rockets wouldn't seal properly in cold temperatures and this would be the coldest launch ever.\n\nebeling, now 89, decided to let npr identify him this time, on the 30th anniversary of the challenger explosion.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption howard berkes/npr howard berkes/npr\n\ni was one of the few that was really close to the situation, ebeling recalls. had they listened to me and wait[ed] for a weather change, it might have been a completely different outcome.\n\nwe spoke in the same house, kitchen and living room that we spoke in 30 years ago, when ebeling didn't want his name used or his voice recorded. he was afraid he would lose his job.\n\ni think the truth has to come out, he says about the decision to speak privately then.\n\nnasa ruled the launch, he explains. they had their mind set on going up and proving to the world they were right and they knew what they were doing. but they didn't.\n\na presidential commission found flaws in the space agency's decision-making process. but it's still not clear why nasa was so anxious to launch without delay.\n\nthe space shuttle program had an ambitious launch schedule that year and nasa wanted to show it could launch regularly and reliably. president ronald reagan was also set to deliver the state of the union address that evening and reportedly planned to tout the challenger launch.\n\nwhatever the reason, ebeling says it didn't justify the risk.\n\nthere was more than enough [nasa officials and thiokol managers] there to say, 'hey, let's give it another day or two,'  ebeling recalls. but no one did.\n\nebeling retired soon after challenger. he suffered deep depression and has never been able to lift the burden of guilt. in 1986, as he watched that haunting image again on a television screen, he said, i could have done more. i should have done more.\n\nhe says the same thing today, sitting in a big easy chair in the same living room, his eyes watery and his face grave. the data he and his fellow engineers presented, and their persistent and sometimes angry arguments, weren't enough to sway thiokol managers and nasa officials. ebeling concludes he was inadequate. he didn't argue the data well enough.\n\na religious man, this is something he has prayed about for the past 30 years.\n\ni think that was one of the mistakes that god made, ebeling says softly. he shouldn't have picked me for the job. but next time i talk to him, i'm gonna ask him, 'why me. you picked a loser.' \n\ni reminded him of something his late colleague and friend roger boisjoly once told me. boisjoly was the other thiokol engineer who spoke anonymously with npr 30 years ago. he came to believe that he and ebeling and their colleagues did all they could.\n\nwe were talking to the right people, boisjoly told me. we were talking to the people who had the power to stop that launch.\n\nmaybe, ebeling says with a weak wave as i leave. maybe roger's right.
dutch police bust gang that allegedly snatched iphones from moving trucks\n\nfollowing a heist that's being compared to something out of a fast & furious film, dutch police have arrested five men who allegedly snatched $600,000 worth of iphones from a moving truck.\n\nand, police say it probably wasn't their first big job.\n\npolice described the men as a gang from romania. they allegedly used a modified van to match the speed of a truck full of iphones along the a73 highway near horst, not far from the german border directly west of dusseldorf.\n\nduring the nighttime raid, police say one of the suspects climbed aboard the moving truck, opened the rear doors and passed boxes of iphones to his accomplices through a hole in the van's roof, according to the guardian.\n\nthe theft occurred on july 24. the men were arrested on saturday in central netherlands. their van, containing the iphones, was seized.\n\ndutch police spokesman ed kraszewski said authorities had been investigating a series of thefts involving high-end smartphones stolen from delivery trucks. they apparently had considered the possibility of the two-moving-vehicles scenario, but had previously dismissed it as likely impossible to pull off.\n\nnot anymore. the truck was taking its freight from a to b and did not stop. even so, [the phones] were gone. so it must have happened that way. and now we finally have the evidence, with the van and the loot, kraszewski said.\n\npolice believe the men arrested may have been responsible for 17 such heists in the past two years.\n\na video released by romanian police shows surveillance video from 2012 of a similar night raid on a truck that gives an indication of how it might have gone down (if in fact it isn't the work of the very same gang). the footage shows a van pulling up behind a truck, someone getting out and opening the truck's doors. in the video, the thieves apparently change their minds and break off the heist.\n\n2012 surveillance video of attempted robbery in romania. romanian police youtube\n\nas a result, dutch police are now calling the highway robbery (well, technically highway burglary) the romanian method.\n\ndid the thieves really get the idea from hollywood? perhaps we will learn more when the suspecys are arraigned in dutch court on tuesday. but until then, it's worth noting that two of the seven films from the fast & furious franchise are among romania's top five grossing movies of all time.
out of bounds: new research on race and paying college athletes\n\na new study shows race is a factor in the debate over whether to pay college athletes. npr's lulu garcia-navarro talks to umass amherst political scientist tatishe nteta, who co-authored the study.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nlourdes garcia-navarro, host:\n\nwith college basketball in its march frenzy, a new angle on the old question of whether ncaa players should get paid.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified announcer: for the championship - yes.\n\n(soundbite of news montage)\n\nunidentified man #1: we prevent these gifted kids from being able to earn any money.\n\nunidentified man #2: you don't deserve the revenue.\n\nunidentified man #3: i see my name being used to profit somebody else.\n\ngarcia-navarro: a new study suggests opinion on this debate could be shaped by racial prejudice. in today's edition of out of bounds, we talk to the study's co-author tatishe nteta. he was driving to his job one day at the university of massachusetts amherst when he heard a radio commentator slam the idea of paying college athletes. he heard hints of racial bias. being a social scientist, nteta wanted to test his hunch. he devised a survey that weighed variables like age, sex and interest in college sports and negative attitudes towards african-americans, a measure he calls racial resentment. then nteta crunched the numbers.\n\ntatishe nteta: we found that race was the strongest explanation of white opposition to pay for play.\n\ngarcia-navarro: was it surprising that race came into this debate?\n\nnteta: that was surprising. we actually - i didn't think we would find what we found in terms of the impact of race. but also shocking was the impact of attendance at a power five school. so we found, amongst our respondents who attended these power five schools, which are just simply schools from conferences that have high-powered college football and college basketball teams, that attendance at this school actually leads to stronger opposition to pay for play.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so can you just break it down for us? when you say that there's racial resentment...\n\nnteta: yeah.\n\ngarcia-navarro: ...over these issues, what does that mean? is that something that they're conscious of or not? i mean, what can you extrapolate from that?\n\nnteta: racial resentment is a new way to measure what is negative attitudes or negative affect towards african-americans. and it's based not on the notion that blacks are biologically inferior but that they violate cherished values, values like hard work and meritocracy and respect for authority. so there are a number of different ways of measuring this.\n\nso it's more subtle, this animus towards african-americans, but it's animus nonetheless. so they'll ask questions like the irish and the italians and jews faced discrimination but worked their way up to success. african-americans should do the same. and you agree, or you disagree? and so agreeing with that sentiment would be an indication of racial resentment.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and in this scenario, to do with this particular issue, the idea's that somehow they don't feel that african-americans are deserving of the money...\n\nnteta: yeah.\n\ngarcia-navarro: ...and that they won't, i guess, use it in the correct way?\n\nnteta: if we really want to drill down - and to be fair, we don't have the specific answer to your question with our data - but if you really want to drill down, i think that's what's going on here is that there's a long history in political science of whites, when faced with policies in which african-americans are the beneficiaries or african-americans are the targets, their negative views of african-americans tend to be a good measure of understanding their opposition to these particular policies.\n\nso for instance, something like welfare reform - welfare reform is ostensibly not a racial policy. however, when you think about the individuals who are most likely to be on welfare, the picture that comes to your head is of usually an african-american and usually of an african-american woman. and so study after study have found that negative attitudes towards african-americans affect your attitudes regarding welfare reform.\n\nso we believe that pay for play is very similar. if you just look at the percentage of african-american men in college basketball and college football, they far outdistance any other group. the picture in your head when you come to think about pay for play in terms of who will benefit if there's a change to the policy are going to be young african-american men. so for some whites, this is a subliminal connection. they're not aware. it's implicit. and for others, it's more explicit. they don't want african-americans to benefit financially in this sense, and they use those attitudes to sort of frame, or structure, their opinion on pay for play.\n\ngarcia-navarro: tatishe nteta is an associate professor of political science at the university of massachusetts amherst.\n\nthanks so much for being with us.\n\nnteta: thank you for having me.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
where the u.s. stands on north korea ahead of the trump-kim summit\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption carl court/getty images carl court/getty images\n\npresident trump will meet with north korea's leader kim jong un this week in vietnam, as he attempts to get pyongyang to move toward what has been an elusive goal: complete denuclearization.\n\ntrump has maintained that his ultimate goal is to get kim to relinquish the regime's nuclear program. but, in the lead up to this second summit, he has repeatedly stressed that he's not setting a deadline for north korea to act.\n\ni think a lot can come from it — at least, i hope so — the denuclearization, ultimately, trump said at a white house event last week. i'm in no particular rush. the sanctions are on; the relationships are very strong, and a lot of good things have happened.\n\nthis was not always the case. after trump's historic meeting with kim in june 2018, secretary of state mike pompeo floated a goal of getting north korea to give up its weapons by january 2021.\n\ntrump put a stop to that talk, however. in september of last year, trump told reporters that he had directed pompeo to not get into the time game.\n\nif it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter. there's no nuclear testing and there's not testing of rockets, trump said.\n\ndespite trump's insistence that he's not in a hurry, administration officials say he's urged his negotiators to try to get north korea to agree to concrete steps.\n\nthe administration has offered few details ahead of the summit, which officially takes place feb. 27 and 28, but the format will be similar to the talks held in singapore in june 2018.\n\ntrump and kim are expected to meet with each other one-on-one and to participate in sessions with expanded bilateral delegations, and trump has now arrived in vietnam.\n\nwhat does denuclearization mean?\n\na major point of dispute over the years between the u.s. and north korea has been that the two sides have different perceptions of what denuclearization would actually mean.\n\nin the past, north korea has argued that the u.s. should also remove any nuclear weapons it has deployed in the region.\n\nofficials participating in lower-level negotiations in preparation for the summit say they are working to reach a shared understanding on this point.\n\none criticism of trump and kim's initial meeting was that it only produced a vague agreement, with little in the way of specifics.\n\nbut jessica lee, a senior director of the council of korean americans, says there may be some benefit to lowering expectations about quick results.\n\nboth the united states and north korea have to be a little bit less ambitious and more realistic when it comes to outcome, knowing that the eventual goal of eliminating nuclear weapons in north korea is going to be something that takes years, if not decades, lee said.\n\nafter years of basically no diplomatic ties and rising tensions, lee said it's important to establish a dialogue.\n\ngiven the kind of country we're dealing with in terms of their nuclear and missile capability, it's absolutely prudent to develop channels of communication and to talk rather than pursue other means of resolving our differences, she added.\n\nsome experts have raised concerns that trump may bargain away too much in search of a pact with north korea. there had been some worry that trump might agree to remove u.s. troops from the peninsula in exchange for action from pyongyang.\n\nbut, trump said friday that troop draw downs are not on the table.\n\nfred fleitz, a former chief of staff to national security adviser john bolton, says he does not think trump will agree to any easing of sanctions at the vietnam meeting. before that happens, fleitz believes north korea will have to take substantial steps toward giving up its weapons.\n\nfleitz said it's possible that the administration might be willing to open an official liaison office in north korea, which would open the door to diplomatic relations.\n\nit's such a minor concession, but for the north koreans it might be important, he said.\n\nthe white house acknowledges that eventually north korea's kim will have to make a decision about whether he's serious about abandoning his country's nuclear program.\n\nwhile talks may hold off the immediate threat of a military conflict, they also give north korea time to continue to develop its arsenal.\n\nif north korea wants to change its status with the u.s., frank aum, of the u.s. institute of peace, says the country cannot keep its weapons.\n\ni don't think the u.s. would agree to have normalized relations and accept north korea back into the fold as a responsible member of the international community until north korea denuclearizes, aum said.
how the nfl's new rule on protesting is being perceived by players\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption elaine thompson/ap elaine thompson/ap\n\nthe nfl announced a new rule banning players from kneeling in protest during the playing of the national anthem before games. if they choose not to stand, they can stay in the locker room, but if they violate the new rule, their teams will be fined.\n\nthe policy decision comes after months of controversy and divisive debates on players taking a knee or making other statements as the national anthem is played.\n\nduring the preseason in august 2016, then-san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick took a knee during the national anthem. he was, at first, alone in his protest, but continued it into the regular season as countless others joined him.\n\ni am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color, kaepernick told nfl media in august 2016.  to me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. there are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\n\nmore than a year after kaepernick's original protests, president trump expressed his disapproval on twitter and at rallies, which sparked larger and more united protests among players and at times, entire teams.\n\nuntil the announcement on wednesday of the new policy, the league and the players' union made no suggestions that such a change was coming.\n\nsince the announcement, howard bryant, sports journalist and author of the heritage: black athletes, a divided america, and the politics of patriotism, spoke with npr's weekend edition about the reactions he's heard from players and what might happen before the official start of next season.\n\nwell i think they've taken the position that the nfl has decided to fully engage with this culture war initiated by the president, bryant says. when [president trump] first attacked the nfl players in september, one of the questions of the book that i was asking was 'who gets to be the patriot?' \n\nwhen the president began commenting on the players' protests he called them unpatriotic, bryant says. trump then said players choosing to take a knee or sit during the national anthem shouldn't have jobs.\n\nsince then trump has praised the new rule announcement, but questioned whether those who don't stand for the anthem should be allowed to stay in the u.s.\n\nwell, i think that's good, trump said in an interview with fox news. i don't think people should be staying in locker rooms, but still i think it's good. you have to stand, proudly, for the national anthem or you shouldn't be playing, you shouldn't be there, maybe you shouldn't be in the country.\n\nbryant says the new rule makes it appear that the nfl is going along with it as well. i think that this has really reignited some really bad blood between the players and the owners.\n\nthat bad blood comes after many players thought they had reached an agreement on the matter last season.\n\nthey had agreed with the owners to a $90 million partnership to fight social [injustice], so i think that they had believed that they had reached an accommodation, bryant says. now we're seeing that that accommodation isn't such an accommodation and i think the players are trying to strategize with their union to figure out just what's going to happen.\n\nthis latest move by the league, bryant says, is seen as a hostile act by the players. there's no question about that.\n\neven with the new rule, the debate on the issue is not over as many continue to debate what it is the players are protesting when they take a knee.\n\nbryant says players have said they are protesting police brutality, but others see this as an issue of respect for veterans and those who have served the country.\n\nnobody wants to see the flag or the national anthem weaponized, bryant says. they don't want to see citizenship weaponized and the veterans that i've spoken with do not want to be used as commercial props and yet sports is doing both.\n\nthe phrase weaponizing patriotism has been used frequently in this debate. bryant says the players do not want their citizenship questioned, and that what they're doing in this protest is the ultimate example of citizenship.\n\nit is how those protests are framed, bryant says, that begin to weaponize patriotism.\n\nwhat we've seen in sports over the last couple of years now is to paint the players as unpatriotic, he says. instead of thinking about their reasoning — which is police misconduct and about supporting some of the people who don't have a lot of power in our country — it's been directed toward the flag as if the players don't care about their country when actually, they do.
virginia gov. ralph northam cancels appearance at civil rights forum\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption steve helber/ap steve helber/ap\n\nvirginia gov. ralph northam has decided not to launch his reconciliation tour as planned on thursday morning at virginia union university.\n\nthe change comes days after the student government president of the historically black university urged the embattled democratic governor to come another time.\n\non wednesday evening, northam obliged, tweeting out a statement that said, i appreciate the original invitation of vuu's administration, but i will abide by the students' wishes. he said he accepted the student government's invitation for future dialogue and honest conversation on issues of race, reconciliation and equity.\n\nnortham has kept a low public profile since a racist photo with an individual in blackface and another in ku klux klan garb, appearing on his 1984 medical school yearbook page, came to light earlier this month.\n\na day after initially saying he was in the photo, northam then said he wasn't. but he did admit to darkening his face that same year to impersonate pop star michael jackson in a dance contest.\n\nnortham has vowed to dedicate the remainder of his time in office to healing and racial reconciliation. he has resisted calls for his resignation.\n\nattorney general mark herring has also admitted wearing blackface in the 1980s while in college. lt. gov. justin fairfax, the man who would succeed northam should he decide to step down, faces sexual assault allegations from two women. he vehemently denies the allegations.\n\nlike northam, herring and fairfax have said they will remain in office.\n\nbut it was the governor's scandal that led student government association president jamon phenix to send a letter to northam's office this week asking him to reschedule for the spring.\n\nvirginia union administration officials had extended an invitation to northam to attend thursday's faith, identity and social justice forum.\n\npart of that program was to pay tribute to the richmond 34, a group of virginia union university students who were arrested during a nonviolent sit-in demonstration at a thalhimers department store protesting its white's-only dining policy in 1960.\n\nphenix's letter said northam's presence would cast a cloud over the historical significance of the event.\n\nin his statement, northam said he admires the actions the richmond 34 took to fight segregation, and he added that he would pay his own tribute to them at the governor's mansion later this week.\n\nnortham said, i look forward to hosting the richmond 34 at the executive mansion on friday to honor their bravery and courage. i welcome opportunities to listen, learn and discuss how we can move virginia forward.
mcdonald's commits to more balanced happy meals by 2022\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bloomberg via getty images bloomberg via getty images\n\nburgers and chicken nuggets are still the mainstay of the happy meal. but on thursday mcdonald's announced its goal to market more balanced kids meals around the globe.\n\nthe company says by the end of 2022, at least 50 percent or more of the kids meal options listed on menus will meet new global happy meal nutrition criteria: meals will have 600 calories or less; no more than 10 percent of calories from saturated fat; no more than 650 mg sodium; and no more than 10 percent of calories from added sugar.\n\nthese goals build on the commitments mcdonald's has made to improve options for kids. and, in many cases, these goals represent small tweaks. for instance, to reduce sugar, mcdonald's locations in the u.s. have already switched to organic apple juice that is lower in sugar and calories. now, the company plans to reformulate chocolate milk to a lower-sugar version. in addition, they will downsize the size of the fries served with the six-piece chicken mcnugget happy meal. currently it comes with a standard small fry, but going forward this will change to a smaller kiddie size.\n\n\n\nthe company also says it will aim to use its size and scale to leverage innovative marketing to help serve more fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy, whole grains, lean protein and water in happy meals, according to the company release.\n\nin a statement, the american heart association applauded mcdonald's planned changes to the happy meal. this is an important step in the right direction and we look forward to seeing how today's announcement will lead to kids eating fewer calories and less sugar, saturated fat and sodium, the group's ceo, nancy brown, said.\n\nnot everyone is impressed by mcdonald's announcement. this is more of the same. old tricks from an old dog, says alexa kaczmarski of corporate accountability, a watchdog group that campaigns for mcdonald's to change the way it markets to children. it doesn't matter how you dress it up, happy meals are vehicles for hooking kids on junk food and building brand affinity for life.\n\nso, when will mcdonald's customers see alternatives to the burgers and nuggets for kids' entrees? mcdonald's is testing the waters outside the u.s.\n\nlast month mcdonald's in italy introduced a new happy meal entrée called the junior chicken --a lean, grilled chicken sandwich. mcdonald's australia is currently exploring new vegetable and lean protein options and mcdonald's france is looking at new vegetable offerings, the company said in a statement.\n\nthe u.s. will keep an eye on these, says julia braun, a registered dietitian and head of global nutrition at mcdonald's. we're committed to exploring new options.\n\noutside kids' meals, mcdonald's has introduced vegetarian and vegan burger options in parts of europe. i tasted it. i enjoyed it, braun says of the veggie burger in france.\n\nas for plans to introduce a veggie burger in u.s. stores? braun says it needs to be led by the customer. the fast-food giant would need to see that the demand is there. it's got to have mass appeal.\n\nin announcing its new goals, mcdonald's also touted its success in removing sugary soda from the happy meal section of menu boards. this action was taken as part of a commitment with the alliance for a healthier generation, a group that aims to empower kids to develop lifelong healthy habits.\n\nfrom day one, healthier generation knew our work with mcdonald's could influence broad scale improvements to meal options for kids everywhere, said dr. howell wechsler, chief executive officer of alliance for a healthier generation in a statement. today's announcement represents meaningful progress.\n\nmcdonald's says since 2013, the company has tracked a 14 percent increase in the number of happy meals ordered with milk, juice or water. according to the company, for the first time, more than half of happy meals ordered in the u.s. have included water, milk or juice as their beverage of choice.

reflecting on a year of protests for racial justice\n\nwe look back at how the killings of george floyd, breonna taylor, and others galvanized the black lives matter protest movement in minneapolis and across the country.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\na traffic stop led to another fatal police shooting in minneapolis this week. throughout 2020, angry and grieving demonstrators took to the streets across the country to protest racial injustice and police violence, shouting the names of slain black men and women - george floyd, breonna taylor, jacob blake and so many more. they dealt with the pandemic, insults from president trump and armed police and in some cases counterprotesters to try to make their point. covering these protests from minnesota public radio has been jon collins, who joins us now. jon, thanks so much for being with us.\n\njon collins, byline: you're welcome. thanks for having me.\n\nsimon: please tell us the latest we know about wednesday's shooting. who was the victim, and what have we learned from police body cam footage?\n\ncollins: the shooting happened around 6:15 on wednesday night. and i live in this neighborhood here, actually, and i heard a series of pops. what we found out since is police apparently pursued dolal idd as part of a crime detail about weapons, because violent crime has been rising in minneapolis, like it has other places. and the body camera footage shows us that police tried to box idd in at a gas station with their suvs. idd was in the driver's seat of a vehicle. he drew a gun. and it's hard to tell exactly what happened, but the glass from idd's car window appears to explode out. perhaps a shot was fired, and then there's a series of maybe a dozen shots that ring out. and idd died at the scene. and there was a woman in the car with him. she was not injured, and no police were injured.\n\nsimon: you have been covering these racial justice protests, which really seemed to peak over the summer. what's some of what you've seen?\n\ncollins: the protests have changed. they are more focused, and the folks who are coming out to protests are experienced. and they know how to deal with police, and they know kind of what their demands might be in. and it is a younger constituency than you would see in protests, say, two years ago. so george floyd was killed on may 25, and there were protests, you know, in minneapolis and st. paul. the protests started out very peaceful, you know, as marches. it was signs. it was the stuff that you typically see during these protests. and when they were met with force by law enforcement, activists would say they escalated. and what ended up happening is that the protests turned into riots, looting and arsons in some case. what did come out of it was that george floyd square, which is 38th and chicago in minneapolis, has been occupied by protesters since may. and the city doesn't seem to really have a plan to reopen it. so that's a tactic that they've used, is creating this sort of de facto autonomous zone, and that's something that we've seen in seattle and other places, too.\n\nsimon: why do you think these protests came to a head on an issue that sadly has been with us for many years?\n\ncollins: yeah, i think it's the drumbeat of these sort of killings by police officers. in minnesota, but also across the country, people, as more and more of these incidents happen, feel frustrated that change isn't coming as quickly as they want. they've lost some faith in institutional change.\n\nsimon: i know you talked to a lot of people in the community. what have you heard about what they feel they might have been able to achieve over this past year?\n\ncollins: during the summer, there was a lot of optimism. you know, there was a big rally in the park, including city council members, about defunding the police. and what has happened is that the city council has been moving money out of the department. it's not happening super-fast. it's not a majority of the money, but they're moving it into services, not law enforcement, that they say prevent crime. and activists have claimed this movement of funds is a victory. at the same time, mayor jacob frey has been announcing some departmental changes to the police force. just this week, they announced that they're going to beef up investigations into officer misconduct, so that leads to the officers that we fire for misconduct losing their jobs permanently and not being put back on the police force.\n\nand as far as the activists, we're just going to see them keep pushing the envelope when someone's killed by police, like they did this week. one activist who's been involved for years, nekima levy armstrong, was telling us that she's pleased the city is taking the steps of releasing the body camera footage more quickly. but that by itself doesn't make up for decades of mistrust.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nnekima levy armstrong: here's the body camera footage being released so swiftly because people are demanding the release of the information or because police feel that there's information that will vindicate or exonerate the officers involved.\n\nsimon: did police change their strategy, tactics, patrol, response?\n\ncollins: in may, when peaceful protesters marched to the precinct, they were met with tear gas, pepper spray and, you know, lines of riot cops. on wednesday, i saw police officers, like, standing behind police tape. some of them didn't even have helmets on. there was no pepper spray that i saw being used. there was no arrests made. the police were relatively restrained.\n\nsimon: minnesota public radio reporter jon collins, thanks so much.\n\ncollins: yeah, thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights

preventing diabetes: small changes have big payoff\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy tim and paul daly courtesy tim and paul daly\n\nif it's hard to imagine how small differences in lifestyle can make a big difference in your health, consider this story of identical twins tim and paul daly. they shared almost everything in childhood, including the same eating habits, the same love of basketball and the same genes — some of which predispose them to diabetes.\n\nback in 1996, one of the twins was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\n\nwhen you first get diagnosed, it's like a punch in the stomach, says paul daly, who is now 60.\n\nor it's a wake-up call — if you're the identical twin. since the disease runs in families, it seemed almost a certainty that tim would develop it, too.\n\nbecause we know that type 2 is genetic disease, and since he has an identical twin, he has a risk that's about 95 percent, says diabetes expert dr. david nathan of massachusetts general hospital.\n\nbut 14 years later, tim still does not have diabetes. and he doesn't take any medicine to keep his blood sugar down. instead, he has been able to make small changes to his eating habits and exercise to keep diabetes at bay. he isn't alone — a large national study conducted at 27 sites around the country, including massachusetts general hospital, found that small lifestyle changes are far more successful at warding off diabetes than a drug.\n\noverweight and at risk\n\nboth daly brothers had gained weight in middle age. it's just that one gained more than the other. in 1996, when he was diagnosed with diabetes, paul weighed 220 pounds — too much for his 5-foot-10-inch frame. looking back, paul says he hadn't stuck with much regular exercise.\n\nby comparison, tim was still playing tuesday-night hoops games with friends. the year his brother was diagnosed, tim topped the scale at about 200 pounds.\n\nat the time, neither brother realized how closely type 2 diabetes tracks with obesity. still, they both set out to drop some weight.\n\na lifestyle change, not a diet\n\ntim wasn't stoked about giving up the foods he loves — or his regular beer-and-pizza outing after his weekly golf game.\n\ncan you imagine telling someone they can never have another french fry or potato chip? it's like people will give up right away! tim says he recalls thinking.\n\nbut to his surprise, the changes he needed to make were not as drastic as he feared.\n\nit's not that different from many of our other patients, says nathan. when people lose weight, their blood sugars respond favorably.\n\ndiabetes prevention program\n\ntim volunteered to take part in a huge national research study aimed at determining exactly what it takes to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.\n\nlike him, all of the 3,234 volunteers in the study were at high risk of developing the disease. the volunteers were broken down into three groups.\n\ntim was randomly assigned to the lifestyle intervention group. he received intensive counseling from a dietitian and motivational coach who helped him develop a plan to eat less and exercise more.\n\na second group of participants took a diabetes medicine called metformin twice a day. these volunteers received information about diet and exercise, but they didn't get motivational counseling. a third group received placebo pills instead of metformin.\n\nresearchers wanted to know which intervention would work best to prevent diabetes and all of the complications that can develop as a result: loss of vision, kidney failure, amputations and a substantial increase in risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nas it turns out, the study found lifestyle changes to be twice as affective as the medicine.\n\ntwo-and-a-half hours of exercise a week\n\nduring tim's first appointment with his coach back in 1996, a blood sugar test showed he was pre-diabetic — meaning his blood glucose levels were higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. pre-diabetes is also called impaired glucose tolerance (igt) or impaired fasting glucose (ifg).\n\nat that appointment, he was given two specific goals:\n\nhe needed to lose 14 pounds [7 percent of his body weight], and he needed to reach a target of exercising for 150 minutes per week, explains linda delahanty, a registered dietitian at massachusetts general hospital.\n\nhis standing appointment with tuesday-night basketball accounted for the first 60 minutes of exercise. but he needed to step it up.\n\nso he added some brisk walks and jogging a couple of miles a few times per week. he also made a change during his weekly golf game. he began walking the course instead of riding in a cart.\n\nduring a recent game in framingham, mass., just before the first snowfall, tim's brisk pace combined with the work of lugging his clubs gets his heart rate up in the moderate range for exercise.\n\nlook at this — that's a heck of a shot, he calls over to his friend. it's hard to hear the thwack of the ball being hit with all the laughing and joking.\n\ni come out here with my buddies, talk about life, enjoy the scenery, he says. it's one of the great pleasures of his life.\n\ntim says learning to build more exercise into his week was not as challenging as learning to eat small portions all the time. but he learned to make that a habit, too. for instance, he knows the rule of thumb on portions of meat: each serving should be no bigger than a deck of cards. and what about chips?\n\nyes, i can have some potato chips, tim says. but i pour a bit into a cup, and that's what i have.\n\nover time, all of these small changes led to something more significant than just getting down to his goal weight.\n\nreversing pre-diabetes\n\nlosing that 14 pounds actually caused his blood sugar to revert to the normal range from the pre-diabetes, delahanty says.\n\npeople think they need to lose 50 pounds or 100 pounds, delahanty says, but in this case, just 14 pounds made the difference. and this was typical of the participants in the diabetes prevention program. losing 7 percent of their body weight helped the volunteers in the study to cut the risk of diabetes by nearly 60 percent.\n\nsmall steps can result in really large benefits, nathan says. just doing a little more will help enormously to prevent this. and that's what the diabetes prevention program showed.\n\nnathan says the daly twins are not an anomaly. eating better and exercising is incredibly effective in helping to manage type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. though paul daly is living with the disease, he has been able to make progress by stepping up his daily walks. his battle is tougher than his brother's, so he has vowed to try harder. and there is now strong evidence that exercise — even in the absence of weight loss — can help improve blood sugars.\n\nthe brothers say nothing has changed since their childhood days when they defended each other from a playground bully.\n\nwe have that special bond, tim says. we look out for each other, paul adds. they're fighting diabetes together. and we're going to win it, tim says.\n\nit's the kind of attitude that makes nathan hopeful.\n\nwe have 1.6 million new cases of diabetes per year, he says, and it's possible to prevent the onset of hundreds of thousands of these cases.\n\nnathan says it's not clear if tim will be able to keep diabetes at bay for the rest of his life. we're still studying that.\n\nso far, what he can say with certainty is that that maintaining the weight loss and exercise can successfully prevent the onset of the disease for more than a decade. in the follow-up study to the diabetes prevention program, one-third of those at highest risk of the disease are still diabetes free.\n\nhe says an epidemic could begin to be reversed if lots and lots of people made these small lifestyle changes — and sustained them over time.
after stinging presidential loss, popular vote movement gains momentum in states\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrew harnik/ap andrew harnik/ap\n\nan attempt at an electoral college workaround is gaining momentum in the mountain west.\n\ndemocrats in colorado and new mexico are pushing ahead with legislation to pledge their 14 collective electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote — no matter who wins each state.\n\nthe plan only goes into effect if the law passes in states representing an electoral majority. that threshold is 270 votes, which is the same number needed to win the presidency.\n\ndemocrats have been stung by the fact that president trump's victory marked the second time in five cycles that a democrat lost the presidency while winning the popular vote. 2016 was the most egregious example, with hillary clinton winning 3 million more votes than donald trump, but losing the election. it was the largest margin ever for someone who won the popular vote, but lost the electoral college.\n\nproponents of the national popular vote measures have argued that it's not political, but republicans, who have benefited in recent elections from the electoral college system, disagree.\n\nand while a majority of the country has expressed support for giving the presidency to the person who wins the most votes — 55 percent in the latest pew research center poll — there are sharp partisan divides. three-quarters of democrats are in favor of amending the constitution to do so, but less than a third of republicans are.\n\nso far, 11 states — including new york, california and new jersey — have joined the effort along with the district of columbia, putting the effort 98 votes short of its goal.\n\ncolorado appears poised to join as the 12th state. the state legislature passed the bill thursday, and gov. jared polis is expected to sign it. in new mexico, the legislation is awaiting consideration in the state senate after the house approved it earlier this month.\n\nif the bills pass, it would show the plan has momentum outside of the coastal u.s., especially in places where democrats have full control of state government.\n\njohn koza devised the plan and chairs the organization behind it. koza also co-invented the scratch lottery ticket and taught computer science at stanford. he turned his attention to the electoral college, however, after growing frustrated with winner-take-all laws.\n\nkoza said the rules are why presidential candidates only campaign in a handful of states. he recognized what might be a potential loophole in the constitution — that while the electoral college is in the constitution, nothing says a candidate who wins a state has to get all of its electoral votes.\n\nthe political power to the choose the president was basically given by the founders to the state legislatures, koza said. and over the years they've passed different laws specifying how to allocate their state's electoral votes.\n\nin fact, maine and nebraska do not have winner-take-all systems. they allocate their electoral votes to presidential candidates by congressional district, with an additional two electoral votes going to the winner of the state.\n\ncolorado state sen. mike foote, who's sponsoring legislation, insisted that it's not a partisan response to trump's 2016 win. rather, he said, it's about upholding the democratic principle of one person, one vote.\n\nit's about time that every vote in the country counts equally, he said. right now, if you live in a state that is not a battleground state, then your vote doesn't count nearly as much.\n\nbipartisan appeals have not gone far in colorado. not a single republican voted for the bill as it moved through the state legislature. during a debate on the house floor, one republican even suggested renaming the bill the we really, really, really, really, really hate donald trump act of 2019.\n\nrepublican state sen. jerry sonnenberg, who represents the plains east of denver, worries about the impact of a popular vote on rural america. he said it would lead candidates to only campaign in the largest media markets, like new york and los angeles.\n\nyou drop us from nine [electoral] votes to 5.5 million people, all of sudden colorado is irrelevant, he said. this is all about making sure presidential candidates realize colorado is important to the rest of the country.\n\nthat partisan divide isn't limited to colorado. across the country, pollsters have seen a steep drop in republican support for a popular vote for president since 2016. national popular vote's koza said it has been much harder to get republicans to support his plan in recent years.\n\nwhile those opinions could change over time, it signals the compact is unlikely to succeed in the short-term. only democratic-leaning states have joined so far. swing states, like ohio and florida, have the least reason to sign on, which means it likely needs support from deep red states.\n\nthere's also a broader question as to whether it would be constitutional. the electoral college is clearly written into the nation's founding document. some insist that congress would have to approve it since it would overhaul national election procedures. other scholars have argued that states can't bind their electors to voters outside their boundaries.\n\nkoza insists article ii gives states broad power to decide how they choose electoral delegates. still, he expects a series of lawsuits if enough of the national popular vote efforts went into effect.\n\nseth masket, a political science professor at the university of denver, said those legal battles are a long way off. in the short term, he sees it as a way to center a familiar debate over the unique way the country decides its president.\n\nit's about saying the status quo is unacceptable, he said. this might not be the best way of changing it, but it's at least a way of forcing some change and forcing some discussion of it.\n\nnpr's domenico montanaro contributed to this report.
slovakia government's collapse not enough to end protests over journalist's murder\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption soraya sarhaddi nelson/npr soraya sarhaddi nelson/npr\n\na love story turned murder mystery led to the collapse of slovakia's government last week. but that failed to quell the largest protests in the central european country since 1989, when the velvet revolution brought down communism there.\n\nthe prime minister-designate, peter pellegrini, who was a deputy to his predecessor, robert fico, is now scrambling to form a new government to calm the situation. pellegrini's original picks for his cabinet were rejected by the president and he plans to discuss new names on wednesday.\n\npellegrini is also hoping to restore public trust in his political party smer-sd or direction - social democracy — a successor to the communists — as well as the other factions that form slovakia's governing coalition.\n\nthe catalyst for the public outrage in the nation of 5.4 million began in what nowadays is a heavily guarded newsroom at aktuality.sk, an online news site run by a swiss-german media conglomerate.\n\nthere, ján kuciak, 27, was part of a three-member investigative team covering corruption in the slovak government and business community. it was a formidable task in a country where corruption is deeply ingrained in society, a holdover from communist times.\n\nthings were so bad that then u.s. secretary of state madeleine albright had called slovakia the 'black hole' of europe [in the late 1990s] — and for good reasons, said jozef bátora, a political science professor at comenius university in bratislava.\n\nthis kind of malpractice has been developing in all parts of the society, he added. wherever you want to do something in public offices, very often you are sort of expected to pay a little bribe.\n\nkuciak was determined to uncover just how deep the corruption went. he was a rising star in slovak journalism known for his reporting on the panama papers, leaked documents published in 2016 that showed where wealthy people worldwide hid their assets.\n\nfriends and colleagues say kuciak was gifted at crunching numbers. our editor-in-chief used to joke that he was the most terrible journalist when it came to writing, because when he was looking through the data he always found a lot of connections and wanted to put everything on paper, so to speak, recalled peter habara, an editor at aktuality.sk.\n\nján was a dedicated person — not only a journalist, but a dedicated son of slovakia, if we can use this term, because he was trying to make this country better, habara said.\n\nkuciak also rattled the political and business establishment. kuciak told slovak prosecutors last fall that he received a threatening phone call from local businessman marián kocner, habara said. forty-four days later, authorities had failed to act on that report, kuciak wrote in an oct. 20 facebook post.\n\nthe businessman allegedly threatened to set up a website smearing kuciak and others reporting on his case.\n\nbut it was kuciak's last story that investigators suspect ultimately cost him and his fiancée, martina kusnírová, their lives. police discovered their bodies on feb. 25 in the white bungalow they'd been renovating since last summer in the small village of veľká maca in southwestern slovakia. he was killed with a gunshot to the chest and she, with a bullet to the head.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption david w. cerny/reuters david w. cerny/reuters\n\nkusnírová was an archaeologist specializing in ancient history who loved animals, said her friend and fellow archaeologist, peter debnár.\n\nshe, like kuciak, was 27 and they had planned to marry in early may. their friends describe the couple — who met and fell in love in college — as hardworking and socially conscious. the song they'd selected for their wedding is a melancholy ballad called sarajevo by czech songwriter jaromír nohavica about the bosnian city ravaged in the 1990s during the balkan war.\n\nkuciak also wrote a poem for his bride-to-be in which he vowed to love her forever.\n\nmissteps in the subsequent forensic examination and criminal investigation leave a four-day window as to when the couple died, making the murders difficult to solve and ultimately prosecute. habara says kuciak often worked remotely and was last in the office on feb. 21.\n\nhis unfinished article, which his colleagues fact-checked and edited, has since been published worldwide. it documents italian crime gangs infiltrating the poorer, eastern part of slovakia and shady deals with local politicians and misappropriation of european union money.\n\nthe article links mária trosková, a former miss universe contestant and one of fico's assistants, to antonino vadala, an italian businessman living in slovakia, who italian authorities allege has ties to the 'ndrangheta crime syndicate. slovak legislator viliam jasan, who is in fico's party and was part of slovakia's state security council, is also alleged to have close business ties to vadala.\n\ntrosková and jasan announced on feb. 28 they were leaving their posts until the murders are solved and vehemently deny having anything to do with the killings. npr requests to interview fico, his interior minister and other officials within smer-sd were declined or did not receive a response.\n\nseven male suspects were detained earlier this month — according to slovak media, one of them was vadala — but were released within 48 hours for lack of evidence. fico, who has repeatedly accused reporters and the opposition of using the tragedy to further their own agendas, also held a news conference on march 1 offering a 1 million euro ($1.2 million) reward to find the couple's killers. the money was piled in neat stacks in front of him on a table.\n\ni have to say that i felt a bit sick when i saw that, habara recalled. it was one of the biggest flaws i've ever seen in any kind of moral authority here in slovakia.\n\nmany other slovaks felt that way, too, said ján orlovský, who heads the open society foundations in slovakia. it's like, you know, the little pot with the lid. so the pressure builds up and then something unexpected comes out.\n\nit was a major mistake of the government not to say, 'we are very sorry, we will investigate and these people will be removed right away,' because that's their political responsibility, he added. it was just another show of arrogance, like we can afford [to do] anything and you can't do anything.\n\nexcept they did, said juraj seliga, who is a lawyer and one of the organizers of the mass protests calling for justice and early elections. slovaks are really sad, really angry young people were murdered like this. and they're really seriously suspicious that the reason for the murders was jaán's work, he explained. when you have tens of thousands of people in the streets, there is a real hope for

50 years later, mister rogers remains our favorite neighbor\n\nfred rogers' pioneering childrens' show debuted on feb. 19, 1968. we look at what made the series different for its time and how fred rogers contributed to saving public broadcasting.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nfifteen years after his death, fred rogers is having a moment.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, mister rogers' neighborhood)\n\nfred rogers: (as himself, singing) it's a beautiful day in this neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor. would you be mine?\n\ngarcia-navarro: your favorite neighbor is about to get his face on a stamp, his own movie starring tom hanks and two documentaries. it's no coincidence tomorrow will be 50 years since mister rogers' neighborhood first aired on national tv. npr's andrew limbong has this on the lasting legacy of the show.\n\nandrew limbong, byline: there were other kids' shows in the 1960s that had puppets and talked to kids. but mister rogers' neighborhood was different. he was on public television, for one thing - no commercials. and he was relaxed.\n\nelizabeth mahoney: he was never as obvious as those other shows.\n\nlimbong: that's elizabeth mahoney from the university of pittsburgh. for more than 20 years, she oversaw the rogers archive - tapes of the show, scripts, puppets - cataloging data. she noted the show's soft, subtle repetition. the shoes always went on and off. the jacket was always traded in for a sweater.\n\nmahoney: he really did create an environment that children were comfortable in because some of the same things happened every day.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, mister rogers' neighborhood)\n\nrogers: (as himself) do you ever change your shoes when you come home from some place - oh, your school or your work or - get ready to play?\n\nlimbong: mahoney says fred rogers got help from a child psychologist named margaret mcfarland.\n\nmahoney: she talked with him about the manner in which children see the world and thinking about, how can this 3- or 4-year-old understand my concept?\n\n(soundbite of tv show, mister rogers' neighborhood)\n\nrogers: (as himself, singing) fences - the world is full of fences. and some i like. and some i don't like - the kind that keep me out.\n\nlimbong: while the show was comforting, it also pushed against the status quo of 1968. mister rogers' neighborhood was one where men baked cakes in the kitchen. women wore army uniforms. michael long is author of the book peaceful neighbor: discovering the countercultural mister rogers. he says the show dealt with the heavy topics of the time.\n\nmichael long: in 1967, just before the show debuted nationally, race riots were rocking the country.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified reporter #1: in a hundred places, detroit is afire.\n\nlong: and at the same time, the vietnam war was raging.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified reporter #2: in the weekend of last saturday, 218 americans died in combat.\n\nlong: and mister rogers decides that he's going to devote the first week of his national program to issues of war and peace.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, mister rogers' neighborhood)\n\nrogers: (as himself) here we go, to make believe.\n\nlimbong: on the first week of his show, there's this five-day story arc where king friday xiii is preparing to go to war...\n\nlong: ...because he's upset that things have changed in the neighborhood.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, mister rogers' neighborhood)\n\nbetty alberlin: (as lady alberlin) just because lady elaine made a few changes is no reason for you to set up border guards.\n\nrogers: (as king friday xiii) there may be other changers, and i refuse to let them come in.\n\nlimbong: the king builds a fence with barbed wire around the castle. people are required to give their name, rank and serial number if they want to come over.\n\nlong: and so lady aberlin decides that she's going to exercise a voice of dissent. and she and another character in the neighborhood of make-believe devise a plan whereby they're going to float peace balloons with peace messages attached to them. and these peace balloons are interpreted by king friday to be paratroopers. and he calls for his armed troops to fire on these peace balloons.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, mister rogers' neighborhood)\n\nrogers: (as king friday xiii) fire the cannon. fire the cannon. man your stations...\n\nlimbong: eventually king friday xiii acquiesces and accepts the messages of peace and change. from issues like violence to border walls to gender roles, mister rogers' neighborhood has something to say to kids and to the rest of us 50 years later. andrew limbong, npr news.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, mister rogers' neighborhood)\n\nrogers: (as himself, singing) tomorrow -

outrage over arrests at philly starbucks fuels twitter conversations\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption saul loeb/getty images saul loeb/getty images\n\nthe arrests of two black men waiting for a friend at a philadelphia starbucks continues to fuel conversations about implicit racial bias in public spaces. many of those conversations begin with i'm not surprised.\n\nwhen i have to move through predominately white spaces i'm always on alert and my anxiety is always high because i don't know what's going to happen at that moment, says elon james white.\n\nwhite is a writer, performer and founder of this week in blackness. he was one of the many people who used social media to share their experiences where everyday situations became suddenly menacing. here are some more of those stories.\n\ni got on twitter and i wanted people to understand because i was seeing and lot of white people who were expressing just shock. i need people to understand that it's the cumulative effect of knowing everywhere you go that you aren't welcome, says ijeoma oluo, a speaker and writer from seattle. oluo shared statistics about how black and brown youth are often criminalized from as early as preschool. those statistics point to the issues behind a lot of these incidents, she says.\n\ni had visited with some middle school students in st. louis, mo., and these were black students and hispanic students telling me about a field trip they had to take. and then they were talking about how on their way back they stopped at a subway and the teacher had handed out, you know, chips and drink to all of the kids, and then they each had like five dollars to go get a sandwich, oluo says.\n\nand they went up they were getting a sandwich and the lady at the counter decided to accuse one of the boys of stealing his bag of chips ... and she was threatening to call the police.\n\neven after the children's teacher approached the lady at the counter and vouched for him, she insisted that the boy had stolen the chips, oluo says.\n\nthey were saying even that this brand of chips wasn't even sold at this location, she says. and she still didn't want to believe them. and i wanted to people to see that what happened at the starbucks is part of this emergent pattern.\n\nshay stewart bouley from maine is the executive director of community change and the creator of the blog black girl in maine. she tweeted a story about an incident that happened to her while she was waiting for an amtrak train. she was the only black person standing on the crowded platform, she says, and she jostled a white woman standing near her.\n\nshe just looked over at me and gave me this nasty look, she says, and it's 8-something in the morning and all i want to do is get on this train. and then she says out loud to her traveling companion 'this woman is in my space.'\n\nwilliam ketchum iii is a journalist based in new york city. he tweeted that about a conversation that is had ubiquitously between parents and children in the black community about how to interact with police. his father had a similar conversation with him about visiting businesses.\n\nhe always told us that no matter how long or short our visit is to a business to always always buy something that way we buy something, ketchum say. then, we hopefully won't be perceived as a threat to steal something or as a threat to rob the store.\n\nketchum says he has spent a lot of money buying drinks or appliances that he didn't even want to ensure he wouldn't be perceived as a threat to a business.\n\nanytime i go to a gas station, not only do i buy something but if i need to use the bathroom right when i get there i'll tell the clerk at the counter, 'hey i do plan to buy something but i need to use the bathroom first.' \n\nit's similar to the way that he would speak to a police officer, he says.\n\nyou tell him, 'ok, i'm reaching for my wallet. my wallet is in my back pocket. i'm going to reach in my back pocket now to get my wallet.' ... i guess you can say that it's paid off because i'm alive and i haven't been to jail.
how election fraud claims may disenfranchise black voters\n\nnpr's audie cornish talks with the new yorker's jelani cobb about president trump's call to georgia's secretary of state, pressuring him to find votes, and the impact on black voters.\n\naudie cornish, host:\n\nthe leaked call between president trump and georgia election officials is something of a greatest hits of the president's frequent election-related grievances - allegations of voter misconduct and fraud without evidence; many levied at counties where black voters showed up in force. in georgia, fulton county has drawn his ire. much of atlanta is in fulton county. in pennsylvania, it was philadelphia. in michigan, wayne county, home of detroit. just a few examples there. jelani cobb is a staff writer at the new yorker and professor of journalism at columbia university. he's here to talk more about it.\n\nwelcome to the program.\n\njelani cobb: thank you.\n\ncornish: so you drew our attention because of a tweet last night where you said this is an attempt to take us back to the post-reconstruction era. and of course, this is the time after the civil war, when the federal government had pulled out of the south. what specifically - what is the parallel that you see in this moment?\n\ncobb: well, i mean, it's exactly the things that you were talking about. you know, the grievances around who won the election call back to 1876, which was the disputed election between rutherford b. hayes and samuel tilden. and the result of that was the deal that was cut that allowed rutherford b. hayes to assume the presidency, but also ended reconstruction and ended the period of democracy that the newly emancipated black people had experienced. and that was when we saw the onset of things like violent voter suppression.\n\nand, you know, what i was saying about what we're seeing now is the specificity of those concerns in the counties and cities where overwhelmingly black voters came out in this past presidential election. and those are the places that are being targeted. those are the votes that are being disputed.\n\ncornish: but they're also overwhelmingly democrat, right? so what's your response to a republican who is going to say, look, these are places where we have concern about democratic votes, not black votes?\n\ncobb: yeah. i think that that's a kind of distinction without a difference. we could have said the same thing about black people voting republican in the south in 1880. and so it was more a matter of removing people from contention politically.\n\ncornish: almost no one believes that trump can change the outcome of the general election right now. but do you see people being rattled? and i won't have you speak for, you know, all black voters, but do you see something in particular for black voters to be truly concerned about?\n\ncobb: sure. i've seen, you know, people i've talked to who are very keenly aware of the difficulties that their family members or even some older people had in their own lives casting ballots. you know, my father grew up in georgia at a time where attempting to vote would have got him killed.\n\nand so, yeah, i think that this has raised echoes, you know, of history for people in some ways. and not simply for african americans. i think there are lots of people who are looking at the anti-democratic impulses we're seeing indulged right now and saying that whatever the policies you favor, this behavior is not beneficial to upholding a democracy or a democratic society.\n\ncornish: people have been voting for weeks now in that runoff election in georgia. do you think that these attacks on the vote are going to have a galvanizing effect, especially on black voters there, or a cooling effect?\n\ncobb: i think that we've seen - this is anecdotal. i don't know that there are hard numbers around it. but this seems to be a boomerang dynamic where once people become aware that there are attempts to ward them away from the polling places, it really does incense them. and it makes people more likely to come out and vote.\n\ncornish: if there is a parallel to the political moment that you're talking about, what do you see as a positive, you know, or what are you going to be looking at going forward?\n\ncobb: well, i think that the level of engagement that we saw was really astounding. and there's now a roadmap in many places in terms of voter engagement, voter registration, how you move people from being inactive to being active participants in democracy.\n\nthe other part of it is that there's - every four years - the discussion of does my vote really matter? i think that it's much more difficult for people to raise that question right now as we are literally counting every single vote in these places. it's hard to make an argument that you don't think your vote matters right now.\n\ncornish: jelani cobb is a staff writer at the new yorker and professor of journalism at columbia university.\n\nthank you for your time.\n\ncobb: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
a school goes from andrew jackson to mary jackson\n\njackson elementary school in salt lake city will keep its name, but change its namesake. it will no longer be named for president andrew jackson, but mary jackson, nasa's first black female engineer.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\njackson elementary school in salt lake city will keep its name but change its namesake. jackson elementary will no longer be named for andrew jackson, the u.s. president who owned slaves and ordered the forced brutal removal of native americans from their lands. this week the salt lake city school board voted unanimously to name the school in honor of mary jackson, the first black woman to be a nasa engineer. her story was told in the book and the movie hidden figures. the salt lake tribune says the crowd at the school board meeting burst into applause and a standing ovation.\n\nmary jackson, who was from virginia, died in 2005 at the age of 83. she spent 35 years at nasa, beginning in 1951, at a still segregated division called the west area computing unit which calculated the trajectories of some of nasa's first space shots. she worked with children in her retirement - even helping them build a wind tunnel for science experiments at a local community center, like the kind she once helped build to test the equipment that would send men and women into space.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
wolf sets goal for pa. to cut greenhouse gas emissions\n\namy sisk bio recent stories amy sisk reports for stateimpact pennsylvania and wesa, pittsburgh's npr member station. she comes to pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, north dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the bakken oil patch for inside energy and prairie public broadcasting. amy's stories often air on npr, including those from the eight months she spent following the dakota access pipeline protests. a reporting trip to the bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.\n\ngetty images\n\ngov. tom wolf has set a new goal for the state to combat climate change: reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025.\n\nlong-term, the governor wants to see an 80-percent reduction by 2050.\n\nhe announced the goals tuesday in pittsburgh, saying they are based off the state's 2005 greenhouse gas emission levels.\n\nwe're about halfway there, which means we have work to do, he said.\n\nthe goals stem from the state's draft climate action plan, released in november by the department of environmental protection. the draft states that if every state and nation met comparable goals, global temperature rise could be kept below the 2-degree celsius threshold that experts say is necessary to mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change.\n\nin his announcement, wolf called for more wind and solar energy. he said he is open to beefing up the state's alternative energy portfolio standard — which requires utilities to buy certain amounts of power from alternative sources — though that would require the republican-controlled legislature to act.\n\nwolf also cited recent efforts already underway to reduce emissions, such as a proposed rule to cut methane emissions from natural gas well sites and a new law bolstering in-state solar energy.\n\nwolf did not say whether the state should act to help the nuclear power industry. nuclear power generation does not release carbon emissions, but it's struggling to compete with cheap natural gas and renewables.\n\ni haven't decided what the state ought to be doing, wolf said.\n\nasked about emissions tied to the state's growing petrochemical industry — including an ethane cracker plant under construction in beaver county — he indicated his support for the industry.\n\nwolf said it's important that natural gas production to fuel facilities like shell's cracker plant is done responsibly.\n\nif you want an either-or situation, i'm not your guy, he said. i want to do both. i want to have an energy efficient future, i want to have a strong environment and i want to have a good economy in pennsylvania, and i think we can do all of those things.\n\nthe shift away from coal-fired electricity to natural gas power generation has helped the state achieve greenhouse gas reductions below its 2005 levels, according to the state's draft climate action plan.\n\nwe encourage policymakers, including gov. wolf, to support common-sense energy and climate-related solutions that encourage responsible natural gas production and use given the overwhelmingly clear benefits of this american resource, said david spigelmyer, president of the marcellus shale coalition, a trade group for pennsylvania's natural gas industry.\n\nmany environmental groups praised wolf's emissions reduction goals, including the environmental defense fund.\n\nandrew williams, director of legislative and regulatory affairs for edf, said wolf's efforts to cut methane emissions are a good step. to achieve major reductions, he said he would like to see even more action.\n\nthere needs to be a limit placed on carbon emissions from the power sector, williams said. we're talking about setting a firm statewide limit on the co2 emissions coming from the power sector that would then incentivize the development of a cap-and-trade program.\n\na program like that would set a limit on the state's emissions and allow companies to buy or sell allowances based on what they emit. other northeast states have joined together to form a regional cap-and-trade program, but pennsylvania is not a member.\n\nsome environmental groups urged the governor to be far more ambitious in setting goals. food & water watch, for one, said the state should aim for 100 percent renewable energy by 2035 with significant job growth in clean energy.\n\nwolf on tuesday also announced the greengov council, a committee that will work with all state agencies to reduce energy use and bolster energy efficiency within state buildings. the council has several of its own targets:\n\na 3 percent reduction in overall energy consumption per year.\n\nreplace 25 percent of the state car fleet with electric vehicles by 2025.\n\noffset at least 40 percent of the commonwealth's annual electricity usage with renewable energy.\n\neditor's picks
facebook moves to decide what is real news\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption noah berger/ap noah berger/ap\n\nfacebook is rolling out a major change to its news feed: pushing up news articles that come from high quality sources, and pushing down the others. the move signals that, in an effort to combat the problem of fake news, the social media giant is willing to play a kind of editorial role — making decisions based on substance, not just how viral a headline may be.\n\nceo mark zuckerberg said in a post to his facebook page:\n\nthere's too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today. social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don't specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them. that's why it's important that news feed promotes high quality news that helps build a sense of common ground.\n\nnational security experts say facebook's latest attempt to stop fake news isn't foolproof experts say facebook's latest attempt to stop fake news isn't foolproof listen · 4:10 4:10\n\nthe company asserts that its own executives will not pick and choose favorites. rather, they'll let the users decide what counts as a trusted source.\n\nspokesman todd breasseale says in an email: as part of our ongoing quality surveys, we asked a diverse and representative sample of facebook users across the us to gauge their familiarity with, and trust in, sources of news. a source's broad trust is one of many signals that determine stories' ranking in news feed. we boost links from sources with high trust scores and demote links from sources with low trust scores.\n\nthe internet has plenty to say in response to the announcement. on twitter:\n\nfacebook recently announced other reforms that, the company estimates, will result in less news in the news feed overall — from the current 5 percent down to an estimated 4 percent.
steve inskeep, host:\n\nhow many weeks of social isolation is enough? it is a life-or-death question. every day that people stay indoors could save many lives, although people would also like to go out and restart the economy. yesterday, the president leaned heavily on the side of the economy.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npresident donald trump: we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. we're not going to let the cure be worse than the problem. at the end of the 15-day period, we'll make a decision as to which way we want to go.\n\ninskeep: he's referring to 15 days of social distancing recommended by the cdc. new york governor andrew cuomo also says a time must come when he loosens his state's tight restrictions, but cuomo says that's not going to be for a while, as new york's caseload soars. we have an outside evaluation of the administration's response from ron klain. he served as the ebola response coordinator in the obama administration and is now an adviser to democratic presidential candidate joe biden. mr. klain, welcome to the program.\n\nron klain: steve, thanks for having me.\n\ninskeep: is this the right time to talk about reopening for business?\n\nklain: well, look - i think there's nothing wrong with talking about it. talking about it and doing it are two different things. and i think it's important to know, first and always when we have this conversation, that at a time when many businesses are shut down, already many businesses are open.\n\ngovernor cuomo's executive order that we refer to as a shutdown exempts 59 specific occupations that are at work today in new york. and so any of us who are working from home also need to recognize that there are a lot of americans who don't have that option, and they continue to provide the electricity, the health care, the package deliveries - all the things we rely on in this shutdown environment.\n\ninskeep: oh, people are going to work so that the rest of us can stay at home, is what you're saying.\n\nklain: absolutely. and that is impactful in this conversation, steve, because that means that we're not in a kind of a national bubble where, after 14 days, this is all going to go away. those people who are out there doing their jobs are going to continue to get the disease and - completely no fault of their own - spread it, as will our health care workers on the front lines of the hospital. so it's going to take more than 15 days for this to be behind us. that's what other countries have seen already. there's no reason to think that's not true for us.\n\nand indeed, right now, of course, we're still on the uptick of the curve, cases mounting every day. we're nowhere near bending that curve and getting it back down.\n\ninskeep: is it also a problem that there's been a patchwork of measures by different states? texas is doing something a little different on a different timeline than new york, which is different from florida. is that a problem?\n\nklain: i don't think that's a problem. it is a big country, and it's hitting the countries - the country at different times. i think it's a problem that washington hasn't provided clear leadership. the trump administration hasn't provided clear guidance on what the restrictions should be, how long they should last and what we should expect to see. i mean, that is, i think rather than assuming we should have a conversation about what day this should change, the thing is what conditions need to be present to make it change?\n\nthere should be ubiquitous testing so we know who has the virus and who doesn't have the virus before we send people back to work. we should know that our hospitals have the capacity to treat patients, have the staff, the gear, the equipment to treat the patients before we risk a new surge in cases. so again, i think rather than focusing on the date, there's, like, a series of tasks to be done. those tasks need to be done. the trump administration has failed to do those tasks already, but i think we should put those tasks back front and center in the conversation the president wants to have.\n\ninskeep: so what you're saying is that this is a long fight. we discussed this on the program yesterday - might be 18 months before there's a vaccine. there is going to be another phase where more of us head out of the home, but you want us to be ready for that. what is a way to grade the federal response, to know day by day or week by week whether the trump administration has done enough?\n\nklain: well, look - i think the ways to grade our metrics, they're in front of all of us. is a test easy to get? is it free? is it something you can get if you're sick, if you suspect you're sick? right now that's nowhere near true. three weeks ago, vice president pence said we'd have a million tests that week. last night, he announced we're only at 330,000, three weeks later. we are so far behind on testing. and even more critically, we have this crisis in our hospitals. patients who are getting sick, you know, are being treated by doctors who are inadequately protected.\n\ni host a podcast, steve, called the epidemic podcast, and we have an episode coming out today with an emergency room doctor discussing what it's like in new york right now, how she had to go a whole shift with just one set of protective gear. there is no way that is the right thing in this country. we've got to get that fixed. and of course, we have to make sure we have enough hospital beds, enough doctors, nurses. this is going to get worse before it gets better. we need to...\n\ninskeep: few seconds left here. few seconds left, ron klain.\n\nklain: yeah, we need to get on top of this.\n\ninskeep: i want to ask about - you were criticized in the ebola response because you were not a medical professional. the president isn't a medical professional, but he's determined to make this decision, not leave it entirely up to the professionals. is there a place for a political judgment here - in a few seconds - as well as a medical one?\n\nklain: look - ultimately, it's a political judgment, but it has to be influenced by the doctors and the experts. their views have to be the most important ones.\n\ninskeep: ron klain served as ebola response coordinator in the obama administration, now advises joe biden. mr. klain, thanks so much.\n\nklain: thanks, steve.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
what to expect from obama's final state of the union\n\nsteve inskeep talks to former obama speechwriter jon favreau about what it takes to write such a speech. president obama delivers his final state of the union address tuesday night.\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\nlet's be frank. a big part of tonight's state of the union ritual is about style. the president of the united states stands before congress. lawmakers applaud or do not.\n\ndavid greene, host:\n\ninspirational figures play their part by sitting in the gallery. everyone's playing to the tv cameras. but there is also a degree of substance, the presidential speech itself.\n\ninskeep: this is obama's last state of the union address. and we got a sense of its preparation by talking with a past obama speechwriter. his name is jon favreau.\n\njon favreau: usually we began talking about the state of the union around thanksgiving. the writing would really begin in earnest around christmas. once the new year came and went, there would be a frenzied couple weeks of writing and editing and rewriting, right up until the final speech and then practicing the speech on the last day.\n\ninskeep: jon favreau, who's now in los angeles, started working with the president during his first senate campaign.\n\nfavreau: i think from the very beginning, i learned that speeches are not a collection of applause lines and sound bites. speeches are a story that you tell. they have a beginning, a middle and an end. they have structure. and more than anything else, the president's mind as a lawyer and a professor come out when he's working on a speech because everything in the speech is very logical. and there's a story to every speech.\n\ninskeep: of course, there is now a grand story of an entire administration that is beginning to near its close. what does that mean for a speech like this?\n\nfavreau: you know, i think it's tempting at first to use a speech like this to only look backwards and sort of talk about all the accomplishments and the administration, everything that we've achieved. and i think there'll be a little bit of that. but for the president, it's more important right now to look forward with this speech. i think in some ways, this is the morning in america speech in response to the malaise speech that the republican candidates have been giving the entire primary season.\n\ninskeep: that's an interesting challenge, to try to convey that sense of morning in america - using a phrase from ronald reagan's era, by the way - because hasn't this president been trying to say for several years it's morning in america. things are moving in the right direction. things are better. and according to surveys, there's just an awful lot of people out there - even people who may support him - who don't see it that way.\n\nfavreau: well, and every year he says it, it becomes more true (laughter). no, but there is. look, and i think if you say it without acknowledging the very real anxiety that working people face - you know, wages still aren't growing fast enough. there's still too many people without jobs. but the fact is, if you look at the markers by almost every economic statistic, we're in a vastly better place than we were.\n\ninskeep: and you think this is a moment when he can sell that case.\n\nfavreau: i do. i think - i think it's a moment where he has to try, certainly, because i think, you know, if all people hear when they turn on the tv or the radio or read the news is dreary and dismal accounts of what america is going through, you know, it ultimately affects the national mood. and i think the president has the opportunity here to say, no; we have a lot going for us as a country.\n\ninskeep: it's said of president george w. bush that his main role in crafting his communications was to hone them, to make them sharper and shorter and simpler. why say it in seven words if you can say it in five? what's president obama's role in that process?\n\nfavreau: (laughter). president obama, he usually adds words when he writes himself because, you know, i think sometimes he has a frustration with the sound bite culture that we have right now, right? and so sometimes, he wants to take the time to make the exact point, even if it takes a couple extra words or a couple extra sentences. and then, once he's comfortable that he's achieved that, he'll then come to the speechwriters and say, ok, you guys cut it down.\n\ninskeep: were there occasions when you would simplify his complexity, take it back to him, and he'd make it complex again?\n\nfavreau: he would, many times (laughter). he would say, you know what, that's just a shortcut. we're just being lazy here. and then towards the end, his role is to really add poetry to the speech. you know, he's better than all of us at finding language that you don't hear in politics every day. and so a lot of sort of the uplifting, lofty rhetoric that he's known for in these speeches, you know, he comes up with himself.\n\ninskeep: how do you think this president has changed over seven years in office?\n\nfavreau: i think he's probably even more patient than when he first - when he first got here, right? i think he sort of knew that the change he spoke about in the campaign would take quite a while. but i think now that he has seen politics and government up close for seven years, he knows that for a lot of these big, transformational changes, it takes a lot of time.\n\ninskeep: it's interesting to hear you say that you feel that he's become more patient over time because there are also moments in recent months when he has seemed a little fed up with his critics. i'm thinking notably of when his isis strategy was being criticized. and he said, well, if people want to pop off about that, they ought to come up with a better idea. that was taken as a sign of annoyance.\n\nfavreau: well, yeah, there's definitely annoyance (laughter). that's part of the job too. you can't do these jobs and deal with around-the-clock criticism without ever getting a little annoyed.\n\ninskeep: knowing him as you do, what have you thought when you've seen him be publicly emotional in recent weeks and months, perhaps most notably when he shed tears when talking about gun control?\n\nfavreau: you know, it didn't totally surprise me. you know, i remember when the tragedy at newtown elementary took place. and we had handed him a first draft of the speech he would give at the press conference that day, walked into the oval and tried to pick up the edits. and he barely even looked up from his desk because there were tears in his eyes. i mean, he was so emotional that day, and you know, the first time he came home from dover air force base and saw a flag-draped coffin come off that plane. i think the weight of what it means to be the president of the united states, the commander in chief, when tragedies like this happen really affects him not only as a president but as a parent.\n\ninskeep: well, jon favreau, thank you very much.\n\nfavreau: thanks for having me, steve.\n\ninskeep: on this morning of the state of union speech, that's jon favreau, former speechwriter for president obama.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
history of our time: making sense of this moment\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption larry downing/reuters; ariel zambelich/npr; jason decrow/ap larry downing/reuters; ariel zambelich/npr; jason decrow/ap\n\nthis story is part of a series of conversations on morning edition with politicians, writers, scientists, theologians, tech innovators and others. from globalization to religious tolerance, identity to climate change, our conversations seek to capture this moment and how we're shaped by it — as individuals, nations and as a global civilization.\n\nin 1965, the rev. martin luther king jr., said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\n\nto borrow king's imagery in 2017: which way is the arc of our history bending?\n\nthat's a big question we're posing at npr. we can't easily report on the future, but we can ask smart people how they think we got to this point in history, and where they think we're going.\n\nit's a vital conversation at this transformative moment in our political and social order, here and around the world. depending on where you stand, we're experiencing either a long-needed course correction or a feeling that the world has lost its way. whatever your view, the rate of change has been dizzying.\n\nso what is really going on? we're asking a diverse group of thinkers to help chart what amounts to the history of our time.\n\nthese conversations began with the social scientist francis fukuyama, who famously proclaimed the end of history just as the cold war was coming to an end. what fukuyama meant was that a single form of government — liberal democracy — was on its way to triumph over competing models like communism. a quarter century later, the forms of democracy remain in place around the world. but many are becoming less liberal. russia has an elected president and parliament but has cracked down on dissent and the press. turkey has also cracked down on the press, and in a recent democratic vote chose to concentrate power in the hands of one man.\n\nlisten: npr's interview with francis fukuyama listen · 6:54 6:54\n\nlisten: npr's interview with mary robinson listen · 7:15 7:15\n\nin another conversation, ireland's former president, mary robinson, warned of a strange moment in history. much of the world had committed itself to very strong multilateral institutions, but she says, we seem to be now going into identity nationalism in a narrow sense. identity nationalism, concludes pakistani writer mohsin hamid, is almost hopeless — and it boils down to fear of change.\n\ntechnological change is intensifying. we're becoming terrified by social media, by information, and in this state of high anxiety, we're looking to attach that anxiety to something, he says. and cultural change, demographic change, is what we're attaching it to.\n\nlisten: npr's interview with mohsin hamid listen · 7:19 7:19\n\nrecently we heard from an adviser in the trump administration. michael anton's official title is deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications at the national security council. he says he's been so consumed by the day-to-day, he's had little chance to focus on the long term — despite that he came to prominence as a man who was trying to think long term. in 2016, while working at an investment firm, anton anonymously published essays that sought to make sense of the trump phenomenon. the most famous was the flight 93 election. anton compared trump voters to passengers on the plane hijacked on sept. 11, 2001, who were choosing to rush the cockpit. they might still die but it was their only hope.\n\nin his conversation with npr, anton was a bit more gentle in his description of the world situation. his new boss, he says, views britain's exit from the european union as both a hopeful sign and as a reassertion of nationalist sentiment.\n\nlisten: npr's interview with michael anton listen · 7:00 7:00\n\nwe want to put the brakes on globalization a little bit and reassert control over our country, our borders, our economic policy, our tax policy, with the recognition that the distinction of citizenship means something and citizens are in it together fundamentally in a way that the world community is not, anton says.\n\nanton spoke just as trump was nearing his first 100 days in office — and as the president was discovering some of the limits on what he could achieve.\n\ntrump recently mused in an interview on sirius xm that had andrew jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the civil war. the president was returning to one the most studied eras of american history: the antebellum period, the decades leading up to the civil war. the causes of the conflict can be traced back to the beginnings of the country. it is poignant and instructive to read the accounts of people who lived in the 80 years before the calamity. many knew that something was going grievously wrong, that the political system was beginning to seize up, caught in its own contradictions. some desperately warned against disaster. yet no one truly foresaw what history had in store for them.\n\nin the early 21st century we, too, are headed toward some destination we cannot know, but we can at least get a handle on the direction we are moving. will we know by the end of these conversations which way the arc of history is bending? maybe not, but it's worth trying.\n\nweb producer heidi glenn and morning edition editor jacob conrad contributed to this report.
cruise ship passengers disembark after being stranded at sea over virus fears\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption heng sinith/ap heng sinith/ap\n\npassengers and crew aboard a cruise ship, who were denied entry at several asian ports in recent days because of fears of coronavirus, cheered as they were finally allowed to disembark in cambodia on friday.\n\nthe ms westerdam with nearly 1,500 passengers aboard had been rebuffed by japan, taiwan, thailand, the philippines and the u.s. territory of guam before ultimately being allowed to dock at the cambodian port of sihanoukville.\n\nalthough none of the passengers or crew aboard had reported any symptoms of covid-19, the pneumonia-like disease caused by the novel coronavirus, concern of contagion had forced them to remain at sea after the vessel docked in hong kong on feb. 1.\n\nnothing to fear, we are all about peace and love: #cambodian pm hun sen personally welcomes passengers of #westerdam, the cruise ship earlier turned away by thailand, philippines, taiwan, japan and guam. #coronavirus pic cr hun sen's fb page pic.twitter.com/hxlriy56qt — tan hui yee (@tan_hui_yee) february 14, 2020\n\ncambodia's authoritarian prime minister, hun sen, said he allowed the westerdam to call in his country for humanitarian reasons and greeted the passengers as they disembarked.\n\nhow wonderful it is to be here. thank you very much to the prime minister. he has a wonderful heart, said anna marie melon, from queensland, australia, according to the associated press. i'm very excited (to be here), she said as she waved a rose hun sen handed to her.\n\ncambodia alone, even the united states, guam, did not let us land, but cambodia did, so that's wonderful. absolutely wonderful, joe spaziani, 74, of florida told local reporters. we appreciate it very, very much. it's been a long struggle and we appreciate everyone being here.\n\nholland america, which operates the westerdam, said in a statement on

diamond princess, passengers were celebrating valentine's day in quarantine as they remained shipbound at the port of yokohama, near tokyo. nearly 220 people aboard the ship carrying 3,700 passengers and crew have been diagnosed with coronavirus infection.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption xinhua news agency/getty images xinhua news agency/getty images\n\nin china, where the virus was first identified in december, health officials reported 5,090 new infections and 121 new deaths, bringing the total number of cases in china since the outbreak began to 55,748, with 1,380 deaths. in its announcement on thursday, the national health commission said the new toll takes account of some deaths in hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, that were previously double counted.\n\naccording to the world health organization's latest situation report on thursday, there have been another 447 confirmed cases in 24 other countries outside of china, with one additional death.\n\nthe figures from china were the second batch released after hubei changed the diagnostic criteria for the disease, adding patients who were showing symptoms of covid-19 but that either had not been tested for the virus or had previously tested negative. the change, apparently in response to a scarcity of test kits and concerns about their reliability, caused a sharp uptick in cases.\n\nthe world health organization on thursday took pains to dispel concerns that the sudden increase resulting from the revised criteria in hubei meant any shift in the mortality or severity of the epidemic.\n\nthis does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak, said mike ryan, head of who's health emergencies program.\n\nmeanwhile, a chinese state-owned biotech company announced thursday that antibodies harvested from the plasma of patients who had recovered from covid-19 were showing promise as a possible treatment for the disease.\n\nchina national biotec group said it had detected antibodies to the novel coronavirus in plasma of people who had been infected but recovered. they used the antibodies to treat patients in critical condition, with significant results, according to the official xinhua news agency.\n\nthe report said the company sent a team to collect plasma from patients in the central city of wuhan, where the outbreak began and where the largest number of coronavirus cases are still found, on jan. 20.\n\nit said three critically ill patients in the jiangxia district of wuhan received the treatment on feb. 8 and that currently more than 10 critically ill patients were being similarly treated.\n\naccording to clinical results, 12 to 24 hours after the patients received the treatment, they have shown improved clinical symptoms, with main inflammatory indexes decreased significantly and some key indexes such as blood oxygen saturation improving comprehensively, xinhua reported.
china's president celebrates hong kong handover with a visit to the city\n\npresident xi jinping gave a televised speech at an event that was closed to the public, and warned hong kong residents that any attempt to challenge the power of china's government is impermissible.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\ntoday marks the 20th anniversary of the handover of hong kong from great britain to china. china's xi jinping celebrated with a visit to the city.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npresident xi jinping: (speaking chinese).\n\nsimon: president xi gave a televised speech at an event that was closed to the public. he warned hong kong residents that any attempt to challenge the power of china's government or its sovereignty over hong kong is absolutely impermissible. npr's rob schmitz joins us from hong kong. rob, thanks for being with us.\n\nrob schmitz, byline: well, thanks for having me.\n\nsimon: why such strong words at what's supposed to be a celebration?\n\nschmitz: yeah. i mean, part of the reason is that this is not only xi jinping's first visit to hong kong as president, but it's also his first visit since 2014. and that's the year that pro-democracy protesters shut down the city's financial district for months. and that led to a violent police crackdown. and the protesters were angry because they felt china broke its promise from back in 1997 that it would ensure a high degree of autonomy for the city, and it would allow hong kong citizens to vote for their local leader.\n\nmany hong kong residents say under xi jinping's leadership, china's government has tightened its grip over the city. and the president's speech this morning, which was closed off from the public because that relationship between the public and china's government is so toxic, was a warning that if there are more protests, the situation could get worse.\n\nsimon: what kind of response are you hearing from people in hong kong?\n\nschmitz: well. i've heard many complaints about xi jinping and chinese rule during my reporting here this week. but what's interesting is that there were many protests scheduled yesterday and today countering xi jinping's visit. and in every single one of them, the turnout was less than expected. yesterday, the student activist leader joshua wong called on people to protest xi jinping's visit, and only a few dozen people showed up.\n\nit was an interesting situation where the international media and police officers outnumbered the actual protesters. this afternoon here in hong kong, i attended a pro-democracy march. and now, there were a couple thousand people who showed up to that. but according to isabel chang, a local hong kong resident, it paled in comparison to the turnouts of previous years. and here's what she said.\n\nisabel chang: you know, hong kong's the only place in china that we have the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, you know, to express our woe. but not much people are exercising that, yeah, so i'm a little bit disappointed.\n\nsimon: rob, what do you make of a small turnout like that?\n\nschmitz: yeah. i asked a lot of people about this this week. and most people here told me a slightly different version of the same story. earlier this week, i spoke to emily shi, a local hong kong resident who works as a flight attendant. and here's what she told me.\n\nemily shi: (speaking chinese).\n\nschmitz: she's saying here that a lot of people have been protesting in hong kong in recent years, and it's really gotten nowhere. she says the government isn't willing to change. and she doesn't see things getting better any time soon as china tightens its grip over the city. and as that happens, young professionals like emily are becoming more and more frustrated. and it's interesting, nearly everyone i spoke to in the local hong kong neighborhoods that i visited this week were not complaining about their political rights. they were complaining about their economic rights.\n\nemily is a good example. she's 27. she's married. both she and her husband are employed, yet neither of them can afford to buy even the tiniest apartment in the neighborhood where they grew up. property prices here are some of the highest in the world. and locals blame an influx of wealthy mainland chinese, who they say are buying up property, making it impossible for them to thrive. and the numbers seem to back this up. the wealth gap in hong kong is at its widest since china took control of the city 20 years ago.\n\nsimon: npr's rob schmitz in hong kong. thanks so much for being with us.\n\nschmitz: thanks.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created

despite few details and much doubt, the green new deal generates enthusiasm\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption j. scott applewhite/ap j. scott applewhite/ap\n\nfor a nonbinding resolution with an uncertain future, the green new deal is getting a lot of attention, along with a decidedly mixed reaction.\n\ndozens of democrats on thursday introduced the measure, an ambitious framework for future legislation designed to eliminate the u.s. carbon footprint by 2030.\n\nour energy future will not be found in the dark of a mine but in the light of the sun, said sen. ed markey, d-mass., as he announced the legislation on capitol hill.\n\nthe resolution has few details, but it aims to overhaul the u.s. economy and spread wealth more evenly. it calls for a speedy shift in energy generation, from fossil fuels to renewable sources like wind and solar, and for a fair and just transition for all communities and workers.\n\nmuch of the early criticism revolves around the scope of the plan, which backers say is big to match the challenge of the climate change problem.\n\nall great american programs, everything from the great society to the new deal, started with a vision for our future, said co-sponsor rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y.\n\nbut this vision is for an extremely near-term future.\n\ni'm afraid i just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in a 10-year time frame, former energy secretary ernest moniz tells npr's all things considered.\n\nmoniz, now ceo of energy futures initiative, agrees that the u.s. needs to pick up the pace of its shift away from carbon, but he calls the decade-long time frame impractical. he worries it could turn off key constituencies needed in the climate effort, including labor unions, oil companies and the business community.\n\ni'm afraid i just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in a 10-year time frame.\n\nthe green new deal doesn't even mention some of the usual ideas for addressing climate change, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program. instead, it calls for lots of spending to create, among other things, infrastructure and transport that don't rely on fossil fuels.\n\nenvironmental groups generally support the resolution.\n\nit is a breath of fresh air to see leaders in congress discussing climate solutions that rise to the scale of the challenge, said aliya haq, federal policy director for the climate & clean energy program at the natural resources defense council in a statement.\n\nbut some groups were disappointed the plan doesn't call for a complete end to using fossil fuels.\n\nwe have 12 years, according to science, if we're going to meet the challenge of the climate crisis. and to do that we have to tackle fossil fuels head-on. and the resolution just doesn't quite get us there, says nicole ghio, senior fossil fuel program manager at friends of the earth.\n\nthe oil industry says it's already reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector as coal plants switch to natural gas.\n\nthey need to do a whole lot more homework\n\nthese days, transportation accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. green new deal backers say they want more high-speed trains to make airline travel less necessary, and more electric cars and charging stations. but experts warn that changing the existing fleet of cars in the u.s. would be an extraordinary effort.\n\nthere's 350 million liquid fuel cars on the road today in the united states and most americans don't buy a new car except every decade, says amy myers jaffe, director of the program on energy security and climate change at the council on foreign relations.\n\ngreen new deal backers say they also want to eventually phase out nuclear energy, which currently supplies 20 percent of electricity in the u.s. the nuclear energy institute argues in a statement that its electricity is carbon-free and should be a part of any program addressing climate change.\n\nthe proposal takes aim at methane from cows, too. methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas, and cows produce a lot of it. but the beef industry is at a loss to respond because of the lack of details in the green new deal.\n\nthey need to do a whole lot more homework and much more research and analysis before we can ever even really engage in this discussion, says colin woodall, senior vice president of government affairs for the national cattlemen's beef association.\n\nso far the plan's biggest success may be that it's energizing thousands of young activists.\n\na group called the sunrise movement held a web meeting with supporters around the country tuesday. jeremy ornstein, 18, says he deferred going to college to work with the organization.\n\nornstein is among the sunrise movement organizers who plan three weeks of activism, including lobbying members of congress to sign onto the green new deal.\n\nand we're going to give our elected officials a deadline. they've got to get an answer to us by feb. 26 or face the consequences, warns ornstein. he says activists around the country will occupy members' offices in what the group calls a nationwide day of action.\n\ngiven the scope and ambitious nature of the green new deal, it might be tempting to criticize or dismiss activists supporting it. but amy myers jaffe hopes older, more experienced policymakers won't do that.\n\nwe need not to discourage them, she says. they have an energy and will to innovation that is not only infectious, but inspiring.\n\nand she says that could be what's needed to address a problem as daunting as climate change.

works by women, says linda falcone, the director of advancing women artists. it was something that had never been done before because no one had ever before asked the question, 'where are the women?' \n\nin the years since, awa has shed light on a forgotten part of the art world, identifying some 2,000 works by women artists that had been gathering dust in italy's public museums and in damp churches. it has also financed the restoration of 70 works spanning the 16th to the 20th centuries.\n\nthe organization was founded by jane fortune, an american philanthropist who died in 2018. fortune was an intrepid art detective whom florentines nicknamed indiana jane in homage to her native state and her renaissance treasure hunting skills.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption marco badiani/awa marco badiani/awa\n\nfor centuries in italy — the cradle of renaissance masters — women with artistic talent were not allowed to enter academies. and the names of the few female artists from centuries past have mostly faded into oblivion.\n\nduring the renaissance, falcone says, women didn't have citizenship. they couldn't produce art as a profession. they couldn't issue invoices. they couldn't study anatomy.\n\nso, she says, no in-the-nude figures, for example, because it just wasn't considered appropriate. the inability to study in the same forum as male artists is very significant.\n\nand yet the artists persisted. a few italian women were able to study painting in their fathers' studios — most notably artemisia gentileschi, daughter of the 17th century painter orazio gentileschi.\n\nawa is responsible for restoring david and bathsheba, one of her paintings that was found after being hidden in a florentine palazzo's attic for 3 1/2 centuries.\n\nthe group also rediscovered a 21-ft.-long canvas depicting 13 life-size males — the only known last supper painted by a woman. it is by the 16th century dominican nun plautilla nelli — whose workshop was inside a convent in florence.\n\nflorence has a long last supper painting tradition. but, says falcone, most of the works are static.\n\nwhereas, she says, nelli actually chooses sort of the key moment in which christ announces his betrayal. and you have all of the apostles feeling the emotion of that very serious news. and so she is able to do a study of their responses, of their psychological responses.\n\nand, unlike most last suppers by male artists, nelli puts food on the table, says falcone.\n\nshe has lettuce, she has salt cellars, a lot of wine, bread for every apostle and knives and forks and beans and lamb — she did a last supper were people were meant to eat, first of all, she says.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption rabatti & domingie firenze/awa rabatti & domingie firenze/awa\n\nalso, unlike male artists of the time, nelli signed her canvas — adding the words pray for the paintress.\n\nthe nun's works were prized by florentines during the 16th century because they were believed to be imbued with spirituality. her contemporary, the art historian giorgio vasari, wrote that she would have done marvelous things if, like men, she had been able to study and to devote herself to drawing and copying living and natural things.\n\nart restorer elizabeth wicks, an american based in florence, says that like so many female artists, nelli was then forgotten.\n\nit seems to me to be about the middle of the 19th century when these paintings stop being mentioned in the guidebooks, she says. women artists stop being mentioned. and if nobody writes about you, then you fade from history.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption rabatti & domingie firenze/awa rabatti & domingie firenze/awa\n\nwith backing from advancing women artists, wicks is currently restoring two large works by violante ferroni, an 18th century child prodigy of whom little is known today.\n\nborn in 1720, ferroni lived in a period of great sociological change in florence, says writer ann golob, who has done research work for awa.\n\nwe do know that well-educated women certainly were getting much more of a seat at the table and there were definitely a few women who were achieving much greater prominence than beforehand, she says.\n\nat the time, female artists were usually limited to painting still-lifes and small portraits. but while still in her 20s, ferroni was awarded a prestigious commission by florence's san giovanni di dio hospital to paint two ovals — each of them 8-by-11 1/2 feet — with spiritual scenes to help heal the ill. the subject was usually reserved for men.\n\nfor wicks, restoring these paintings during the coronavirus pandemic has had particular relevance.\n\njust to be able to work on this project was so healing for me, she says. i mean, i was healing the art, but i was also healing myself in a certain sense.\n\nthe art of healing has been a constant theme of awa's mission, says falcone.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ottaviano caruso/awa ottaviano caruso/awa\n\nart is a living entity and a piece of art has its life, she says. you know, it gets hurt. it gets damaged. it it needs renewal. it needs to be talked about and paid attention to, et cetera.\n\nfalcone says that through restoration work, documentation and exhibits, awa has contributed to a growing worldwide interest in and awareness of art by women. yet the organization recently announced it is shutting down next june because it does not have sufficient funds to expand.\n\nfalcone says the group has accomplished what it set out to do.\n\nit's a victory, she says, because we're saying, wow, we're at a point where the museums are starting to place value on the female part of their collection.\n\nadvancing women artists has fulfilled its mission, says falcone because art lovers are now beginning to find answers to the question: where are the women?
is putin withdrawing from syria out of strength or weakness?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alexey druzhinin/afp/getty images alexey druzhinin/afp/getty images\n\nrussian president vladimir putin just made another shrewd and decisive move with his surprising decision to start withdrawing forces from syria. or, the russian leader was overextended abroad and short of cash at home and was looking for a quick exit.\n\nputin wants everyone to believe the former, claiming the russian airstrikes and the syrian government army have achieved a fundamental turnaround in the fight against international terrorism.\n\nbut some analysts are arguing the latter, saying putin provided a temporary boost for syria's embattled president, bashar assad, but lacked the power and the will to change the trajectory of the 5-year-old conflict.\n\ndespite the fact that assad only gained back 5 percent of syrian territory [during the russian campaign], putin is declaring victory, andrew tabler, a syrian expert at the washington institute for near east policy, told npr's morning edition.\n\nhere's a look at both sides of the question.\n\nthe case for strength\n\nsimply by intervening, putin demonstrated russia is still an influential player in the middle east. ever since the soviet breakup a quarter-century ago, russia has struggled to project itself as a global power and this was an opportunity to play a prominent role in a major conflict and challenge the u.s. at the same time.\n\nthe russian airstrikes, which began last sept. 30, allowed assad and his forces to go on the offensive in the western part of the country, where most of the population and the major cities are. they advanced on several fronts in a war that had largely turned into a stalemate.\n\nrussia really turned the balance of power. assad was struggling. now he's been on the offensive, and the rebels are in chaos, joshua landis, head of the center for middle east studies at the university of oklahoma, told npr's all things considered. there's real depression amongst rebel ranks. so in that sense, the regime is solid.\n\nsyria is particularly important because moscow has supported assad, and his father before him, since the 1970s. syria is russia's strongest ally in the arab world.\n\nrussia's intervention also made clear it would defend the mediterranean naval base it's had since soviet times, and russia also added an new air base in the same region. even as it draws down, russia plans to keep about 1,000 military personnel at the two bases, according to russian officials.\n\nputin's announcement also appeared well timed. a truce, now in its third week, is holding up much better than expected. and syrian peace talks resumed on monday in geneva, highlighting putin's call for a diplomatic push.\n\nassad, meanwhile, can argue that he's still in control of damascus and has been gaining ground in other key parts of the country. this strengthens his case to remain in power, despite all the opposition groups that insist that he must go.\n\nsaving assad from defeat and perhaps making him impervious to demands that he step aside are no small feats, fred hof, who follows syria at the atlantic council, said of the russian intervention.\n\nbut he added: on balance, a sizeable drawdown could mean that russian president putin calculates he has gotten his maximum military bang for the buck in syria, and that anything further would encounter diminishing returns.\n\nwhich leads to ...\n\nthe case for weakness\n\nwhile assad does have some breathing space, there's no military victory in sight. the syrian leader still faces opponents on all sides, from the islamic state, which hold nearly half the syrian territory, to moderate rebels backed by the united states.\n\nand nothing has been decided politically. russia says assad should remain as president, but all the forces opposing him, including the u.s., say they will never agree to a peace deal that allows assad to stay.\n\nlooking at this in any way you want, there is no way conceivable that assad's writ will ever extend throughout the country again, brett mcgurk, president obama's special envoy for countering isis, recently told the new yorker. it's just not realistic after everything that's happened. so we have to find the formula for that transition.\n\nrussia's bill for the syrian intervention has been relatively low-cost, but far from cost-free. syria did not become the quagmire some had predicted, but russia is mired in recession at a time when it's involved militarily in syria and has also been supporting rebels in eastern ukraine.\n\nrussia has taken hits on other fronts as well. assad and his government are dominated by alawites, an offshoot of shiite islam. russia's military backing has alienated the sunni muslim majority in syria as well as the sunni powers in the region, including turkey and saudi arabia, which back the rebels.\n\nturkey shot down a russian fighter plane in november along the syria-turkey border, escalating tensions between two countries with strong trade ties.\n\nand shortly after russia began bombing in syria, the islamic state claimed responsibility for bringing down a russian commercial plane full of vacationers over egypt's sinai peninsula.\n\nrussia played a weak hand, at least in terms of assad's domestic standing, very, very well, says tabler. but the war in syria is far from over. i don't think the assad regime expected this, and it puts a lot of the military burden back on the assad regime and its allies to keep their head above water.\n\ngreg myre is the international editor of npr.org. follow him @gregmyre1.
writer created 'fleabag' by looking at what she loved, then taking it away\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption luke varley/courtesy of amazon studios luke varley/courtesy of amazon studios\n\nfleabag is the name of a british comedy that tackles intimacy, feminism and womanhood. writer phoebe waller-bridge created the show and plays its main character, also named fleabag.\n\nshe's a young woman living in london, waller-bridge tells npr's rachel martin. the relationship that she treasures most in the world, treasured most in the world, was that with her best friend who she recently lost in a terrible accident.\n\nfleabag copes with that loss by breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the camera. she tries to keep her life humorous and amusing for the benefit of this audience that she has invited in, waller-bridge says.  ... and eventually that relationship starts to break down in itself and she starts to regret bringing the audience in in the first place — because, of course, she has these secrets and these feelings of grief and misery underneath all the comedy.\n\ninterview highlights\n\non how she named the show\n\nit's a word that i'm really close to because it's actually my family nickname — well, flea is my family nickname. and it was actually a real pain the ass when i realized that fleabag was the perfect name for this show in my mind, because, you know, i felt like i was slapping my own name on it. it just begs certain questions about the rest of the show.\n\non how she came up with the show's premise\n\nwell, i have a best friend [vicky jones]. and when i found her and we found our friendship, i just suddenly felt so much more invincible in the world. and i felt like she understood me and would forgive me my kind of weird, quirky thoughts and personality traits and all those kinds of things, and me her as well. and it was so glorious to me. and my biggest fear — and i always end up writing my worst fears, really — my biggest fear was what would happen if i lost her now?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption luke varley/courtesy of amazon studios luke varley/courtesy of amazon studios\n\nand the moment i came up with that idea and we sat there, i was like, what if she had a best friend that had died? both me and vicky were like, oh no, that's a horrible story. and i was like, yeah, i love it. i love it. every time i'd say something and vicky's face would scrunch up and go, no, that's horrible, i'd be like, haha, brilliant, it's going in. and then that informed a lot of it. and just seeing things that i loved in my life and imagining if i wasn't lucky enough to have them — kind of sadomasochistic, really.\n\non deciding to give fleabag an active sex life\n\ni was attracted to the idea of creating a character who does just have a lot of sex and doesn't need to kind of explain it away. so that was the first impulse was just, yeah, she just likes having a shag occasionally.\n\nbut then in order to deepen the character i did have to kind of analyze that a little bit more. and i think there's a bit in episode two when she says that she loves everything about sex: the drama of it, the performance of it, the kind of build up to it — but she doesn't actually like the feeling of it. and that is, i think, at the heart of what's complicated [about] the character. ... the moment that it's about sex, it's incredibly clear, and that's a relief for her and a release. so she's like, the moment she sees desire, you know, flutter across somebody's eyes, she's like, i know this game. i know what we're doing here. i just need to do this; that person will do that; we'll end up having sex and then i'm in control. i am desired. and for a short moment, you know, she has agency over her life.\n\non how fleabag's feelings about sex change by the end of the show\n\nshe just feels the pressure of being sexual and being sexually attractive so much more that it's kind of become innate in her character. and my fear for so long about younger women, especially today, was that they would feel like a vital part of being a woman and especially a young woman is how sexually attractive you are. and i wanted to create a character that kind of was the walking example of how that can go wrong, because she does feel like that i think.\n\non the audience never really learning the root of fleabag's pain\n\ni felt for a long time that if there was an explanation, if i could easily explain away fleabag's emptiness or sadness, i felt like i'd be betraying her own complexity, really. but some people are just susceptible to feeling certain things that others aren't. and i feel so often that stories of angry young men are often unexplained, and actually so often when there's a broken, damaged woman it's because at the end you go, oh right, oh, it's because she was abused. that's why. or, you know, she was abandoned or she was raped. ... i was really determined to make sure that she didn't have the one reason.
biden's plan to release more vaccine is a gamble. is it worth the risk?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption paul sancya/ap paul sancya/ap\n\npresident-elect joe biden is planning to take a dramatic step aimed at increasing the amount of vaccine available to states.\n\nhis transition team says he'll change a trump administration policy that kept millions of doses in reserve, only to be shipped when it was time to administer people's second doses.\n\ninstead, the biden administration plans to send most of the currently reserved doses out right away, allowing more people to get first doses. for people who've gotten initial shots, the biden team is making a bet that new doses could be manufactured in time to keep booster shots on schedule.\n\nthe two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by pfizer and moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. the need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.\n\naccording to cdc, there have been 22 million doses distributed, but just 6.7 million administered.\n\nthe president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. he supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in americans' arms now, spokesman t.j. ducklo said in a statement to npr, noting more details would be available next week.\n\nsome public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. they point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.\n\ndr. anthony fauci of the national institutes of health — who advises both the trump administration and the incoming biden administration on the federal covid-19 response — tells npr there's no plan to abandon the two-shot regimen.\n\nthe biden team is not talking about withholding and not giving the second dose, he says. they are completely committed to giving the second dose on time. they feel that the importance of getting as many people as possible is worth the risk.\n\nthe biden team is hopeful companies will be able to manufacture more doses quickly.\n\nwe have faith that the manufacturers can produce enough vaccines to ensure people can get their second doses in a timely manner, while also getting more people their first dose, biden's incoming press secretary jen psaki said in a briefing friday. the president-elect has said he will use the defense production act as needed to help produce materials and whatever else is needed to ensure supply.\n\nhowever, operation warp speed, the federal vaccine effort launched by the trump administration, defends its current policy.\n\nif president-elect biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening, wrote spokesperson michael pratt in a statement to npr. operation warp speed monitors manufacturing closely, with the intent to transition from reserving as many second doses as manufacturing further stabilizes with a consistent flow of vaccines.\n\na key question is whether public health officials across the country would be able to effectively make use of a larger supply of vaccine doses and quickly bring more people in to get vaccinated. vaccine hesitancy and disorganization have proven to be problems in many places, not just supply of doses.\n\nthe head of the association of immunization managers, claire hannan, says in her view, it's probably a good thing to get more doses flowing. the goal, she says, should be to send doses to the field as fast as possible. get it, thaw it, give it. [then] order the second dose. don't try to store it at cdc, don't try to store it at mckesson.\n\nmarc lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health, agrees that this is a good move. he says it's become even more urgent to get as many people vaccinated as fast as possible because of the emergence of new variants of the virus that appear to be more contagious.\n\nas the virus continues to spread and as we begin to contemplate the possibility of the new variant or other new variants becoming more of a problem in this country it's a race against time and the faster we get more vaccine out the better, lipsitch says.\n\nthere is a concern that if something goes wrong with manufacturing there may not be a steady supply and booster shots will end up getting delayed. this is worrisome because it's not clear how good the protection from one shot will really be or how long it will last.\n\nthe danger of a one-shot regimen is that the vaccines might actually be — long term — less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use, explains angela rasmussen, a virologist at the georgetown center for global health science and security. it could be potentially harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.\n\nrasmussen and others worry that a weak immune response could actually lead to the virus developing new mutations that are even more dangerous. the food and drug administration issued a statement earlier this week confirming the importance of the booster shots.\n\nbut many approve of the biden policy announced friday.\n\nthis strategy makes tons of sense, dr. robert wachter of the university of california, san francisco wrote in an email to npr. we know from the data and models that getting more people vaccinated with their first shots quickly will save the most lives.\n\ndr. marcus plescia, chief medical officer of the association of state and territorial health officials or astho, calls the biden move aggressive and responsive to calls to speed up vaccination. the big question for state health officials is that they still don't have a lot of information about what kind of supply chain there's going to be for vaccine in the upcoming months, he explains.\n\nour hope is that the biden team has gotten some of that information and feels that we can make this kind of a change and that there's going to be adequate continued supply of the vaccine, he says. so that when people do come back for their second doses, there will be a second dose for them to have.\n\nif it turns out there are production issues down the line, the biden decision could be reversed, suggests julie swann, a supply chain expert and professor at north carolina state university.\n\ni think it is a good idea to send out as much vaccine as possible — as long as there is an indication that the manufacturers will be able to supply more, she says. [if] that supply becomes jeopardized, it would absolutely be a reasonable strategy to go back to the strategy of reserving some vaccine for that second dose.\n\npien huang contributed to this report.
'fresh air' marks the 90th birthday of broadway composer john kander\n\nkander and his partner, fred ebb, wrote the songs for a number of musicals, including chicago, kiss of the spider woman and cabaret. kander spoke to terry gross in 1991 and 2015.\n\ndavid bianculli, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm david bianculli, editor of the website tv worth watching, sitting in for terry gross.\n\n(soundbite of overture/and all that jazz)\n\ntaye diggs: five, six, seven, eight.\n\nbianculli: today, we celebrate the birthday of broadway composer john kander, who turns 90 years old tomorrow, with excerpts of two interviews he recorded with terry. along with his longtime lyricist, the late fred ebb, john kander wrote the songs for such broadway shows as cabaret, chicago and kiss of the spider woman, and as well as the songs for martin scorsese's 1977 film new york, new york. the title song was a big hit for frank sinatra.\n\n(soundbite of song, new york, new york)\n\nfrank sinatra: (singing) start spreading the news. i'm leaving today. i want to be a part of it, new york, new york. these vagabond shoes...\n\nbianculli: in a moment, we'll hear kander and ebb performing the first version they wrote of new york, new york. that version is included on the new double cd john kander: hidden treasures, which was the occasion of terry's interview with him in 2015. many of the recordings are demos featuring kander and ebb performing. so here's the first draft of new york, new york with today's guest, composer john kander at the piano and lyricist fred ebb singing. this demo was recorded in 1976.\n\n(soundbite of song, new york, new york)\n\nfred ebb: (singing) new york, new york, new york, new york. new york, new york, new york, new york. doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo doo doo (ph). they always say it's a nice place to visit, but i wouldn't want to live there - new york. they always say it's a nice place to sightsee, but i wouldn't want to live there - new york. of course, i do like a do on park avenue or to view a gnu at the central park zoo or stare at the glare of the broadway lights or go to madison square to catch the fights. well, they...\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nterry gross, byline: john kander, welcome to fresh air. it's such a treat to have you back on the show. i love this new collection. i'm so glad that it was produced. it's so much fun to hear that first draft of new york, new york and compare it to the anthem that you finally wrote. tell the story of why this version was rejected.\n\njohn kander: well, to start with, i'm surprised that i ever let anybody hear that first version.\n\ngross: (laughter) why?\n\nkander: it's - i guess because it's terrible.\n\n(laughter)\n\nkander: that's part of the reason. the story of how the other one got written is fred and i were writing songs for a film called new york, new york. martin scorsese was directing it. and it starred liza minnelli and robert de niro. we wrote five or six songs and went down to marty's (ph) office to play them. and liza and marty were there. and then in the background - i don't know if we got introduced or not - was robert de niro sitting on a couch. i'm not sure i even knew that at the time. anyway, we played the songs for them. and everything was all set until suddenly we saw this arm waving from the couch. and marty went over and said excuse me, de niro wants to speak to me. and then we watched what was a very animated conversation. and we couldn't hear anything. and scorsese came back and in a very embarrassed way said that de niro had felt that the title song, which was very much attached to him in the film, was just too lightweight compared to the song that was attached to liza, which was the world goes round. and would we consider taking another crack at it? and of course we left and thought, some actor is going to tell us how to write a song? and we could not have been more internally pompous, i think. anyway, we went back to fred's apartment. and i think because the juices of rage were coursing through our bodies, we wrote another song very fast, probably 45 minutes, called new york, new york and took it back. and that was the song that was used in the movie and became the song which is now pretty well known.\n\ngross: let's move on to a very famous song you wrote from a very famous show, cabaret. you wrote the songs with fred ebb for the show, which was revived as recently as last year. and i was surprised to learn in the liner notes for the new album of your demos that the song cabaret, the title song, was actually written during the dress rehearsals. was there a hole that needed to be filled that you needed to write a new song for?\n\nkander: i am trying to - i'm trying to remember exactly what was going on. i know that the moment when sally makes a decision to have an abortion was a moment which, i think, had not yet been properly musicalized. i'm just trying to remember this now. i don't know if it's all correct. but we wrote a song which did exactly that. it was a song which starts out very jaunty and nasty and cheerful all at the same time, sung by a girl who's just been insulted by her lover and who's found out that she's pregnant and is in - actually is in misery. and in the middle of the song, our intention, without tipping it lyrically, was that she make her decision to get rid of the baby. i think it works really well on the stage. the interesting element in that song is that all the sort of popular versions of it - most of those performances are of a very jaunty, cheerful, hey mate, come in from the rain and let's have a good time. and, of course, that's the opposite of the intention of the song.\n\ngross: yeah. the song is all about denial. sally bowles is in denial that she's pregnant and is probably going to have an abortion. this means the end of her relationship with her lover, who is also bisexual. that was not necessarily going to go well anyways. and she's in denial that the nazis are taking over germany. and it's not going be a fun time. things are on the verge of not only collapse, but destruction. so, you know, you get that in the show, but, yes, when people sing it out of context, it's like, yeah, isn't life fun?\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: so let's hear the demo recording. so this is you at the piano. and fred ebb is singing. this was recorded in 1965.\n\n(soundbite of john kander song, cabaret)\n\nebb: (singing) what good is sitting alone in a room? come hear the music play. life is a cabaret, old chum. come to the cabaret. put down your knitting, your book and your broom. time for a holiday. life is a cabaret, old chum. come to the cabaret. come taste the wine. come hear the band. come blow a horn. start celebrating. right this way, your table's waiting. no use permitting some prophet of doom to wipe every smile away. life is a cabaret, old chum. come to the cabaret. i used to have a girlfriend known as elsie.\n\ngross: so that was a 1965 demo recorded with the composers john kander at the piano, lyricist fred ebb singing. john kander, what impact did writing the songs for cabaret have on you as a secular jew? because it's - you know, it's set in germany as the nazis are coming to power.\n\nkander: i don't think i ever thought about that. i think i thought about it - a piece of theater. so i guess that...\n\ngross: it's just that it's a terrifying piece of history, particularly for jewish people.\n\nkander: yes, and - but a piece of history and something that you're writing are two different things. once you write - start writing - you're not thinking extracurricularly - or at least for me. we're thinking about the moment in the theater. so if i went to see cabaret and had not written it, i would have a reaction to it that would be somehow or other colored by being a jew. but maybe it's some defect on my part. but i did not think about that when we were writing.\n\ngross: i saw the revival of the revival (laughter) with alan cumming last year.\n\nkander: right.\n\ngross: he was wonderful, so was linda emond in the title...\n\nkander: oh, you bet she was.\n\ngross: so was linda emond in the role that was originated by lotte lenya in cabaret as fraulein schneider. and lotte lenya was such a great singer. and she was also, of course, the widow of kurt weill. and some of the songs sound to me very influenced by kurt weill, who, i would imagine, you, you know, listened to a lot while writing the songs since he's the composer we most associate with that period. he's the songwriter we most associate with that period. he's a german songwriter who fled the nazis.\n\nkander: the interesting thing is that i listened to everybody but kurt weill because i knew that was a dangerous area to be walking into. i listened to lots and lots and lots of german jazz and german vaudeville music of the '20s. but i stayed away zealously from listening to weill at all. what i think happened is that the kind of kurt weill musical pieces that we hear in our heads were influenced by the same thing that i was sort of digging into. his early music and more serious music is in many ways in a totally different style and quite wonderful and slightly academic. when he comes to writing to his musicals or operas, if you will, he's reflecting the sounds of those vaudeville houses and german jazz and that sort of sleazy world that i was trying to reflect, also. but the actual influence of weill's music itself was nonexistent.\n\ngross: and you said it would've been dangerous to listen. and i assume you mean you didn't want to risk imitating him.\n\nkander: i didn't want to sound like second-rate kurt weill.\n\ngross: right. lotte lenya and kurt weill fled the nazis, so they - they really know - they know the story. they know the climate in which cabaret is set. so i want to play a song that you wrote for her character that she does such a wonderful job with in the original cast recording and that linda emond did such a great job with in the revival. and the song is, what would you do? and this character that she plays is a tough but lonely older women who runs a boarding house. there's a jewish man who wants to marry her. but when it's clear the nazi's are coming to power, she rejects him to save herself. and she sings this song, what would you do? as if to ask, if you were in her position, would you stand up for your principles or save yourself? let's hear a little bit of the song.\n\n(soundbite of song, what would you do?)\n\nlotte lenya: (as fraulein schneider, singing) with time rushing by, what would you do? with the clock running down, what would you do? the young always have the cure - being brave, being sure and free. but imagine if you were me, alone like me. and this is the only world i know, some rooms to let, the sum of a lifetime, even so. i'll take your advice. what would you do? would you pay the price? what would you do? suppose simply keeping still means you manage until the end. what would you do, my brave, young friend? grown old like me, with neither the will nor wish to run; grown tired like me, who hurries for bed when day is done; grown wise like me, who isn't at war with anyone - not anyone.\n\nbianculli: that's lotte lenya from the original cast recording of cabaret. our guest, john kander, wrote the music. his longtime late collaborative partner wrote the lyrics. we'll continue our celebration of john kander's 90th birthday after a short break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nbianculli: this is fresh air. composer john kander turns 90 years old tomorrow. with his lyricist partner fred ebb, he wrote the music for the broadway musicals cabaret and chicago, as well as for the martin scorsese movie new york, new york. the first time terry gross spoke with john kander was in 1991, when she asked about the origins of his songwriting partnership.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: now, you met your partner almost on a blind date, so to speak (laughter).\n\nkander: it sounds like it, yes.\n\ngross: yeah, because you were basically set up by the music publisher tommy valando, who had been publishing both of you independently. and - what? - he suggested that you get together? is - do i have the story right?\n\nkander: he literally said, i think you two guys should meet each other. i think you'd like each other. and so since we always followed his advice, separately at the time, we did meet each other. we did like each other. and we started writing almost immediately. i don't know, we were just pregnant with song all the time, it seemed to me. and from then on, we've been one of those marriages in which you're pretty faithful to each other. fred has done some material with someone else and i do an occasional movie score, as i am at the moment. but when it comes down to the hardcore of what we've written, we write together.\n\ngross: what is your process of working together? do you work together in the same room, at the same time?\n\nkander: right. we - fred lives about four blocks from my house. and he likes to stay home to work, i like to go out to work. and at 10 o'clock or so in the morning, i'll go over to his house and we will sit around the kitchen table and have some coffee and gossip a little and then go to work. and we - if we're working on a moment in a show, for instance, we'll be talking about the characters and the situation that we're about to musicalize (ph). and fred may have an idea or a phrase, and from that phrase maybe we'll develop a rhythm.\n\nit's very hard to describe it after that except to say that we improvise together at the same time, in the same room. it's a kind of unique way of working for us. most people do not work that way. either somebody hands somebody a melody or - and - or somebody hands somebody a lyric. we - that never happens to us or almost never. and for the 26 or so years that we've been together, that's always been the way we work.\n\nand it's always fun. i don't know how to say that without sounding goony, but it's true. whatever else is going on in our lives, sitting together in a room and writing a song is always a good time, even when it's - even when our work is bad.\n\ngross: let me pick up on what you just said, even if the work is bad. now, when do you decide that you don't like a song if you're going to tear it up? do you know that right away? or is it, like, three days later that you realize, god, that was a bad song?\n\nkander: sometimes you know it right away. usually it takes about 24 hours. and then i'll come back the next day, we'll look at it, we'll both stick our fingers down our throats and tear it up and go to work again. but it's - that's never a terrible moment. i think it's very important - at least it always has been important for us to stay very loose, which allows you to write badly as well as to write well. but we write a lot and we tear up a lot.\n\nbianculli: john kander speaking to terry gross in 1991. his songwriting partner, fred ebb, died in 2004. after a break, we'll return to her more recent interview with john kander from 2015. also, film critic david edelstein will review the new movie t2 trainspotting and i'll review the new julie andrews children's series for netflix, julie's greenroom. i'm david bianculli, and this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of song, maybe this time)\n\nliza minnelli: (singing) everybody loves a winner, so nobody love me. lady peaceful, lady happy, that's what i long to be. well, all the odds are, they're in my favor, something's bound to begin. it's got to happen, happen sometime. maybe this time i'll win 'cause everybody, oh, they love a winner, so nobody love me. lady peaceful...\n\nbianculli: this is fresh air. i'm david bianculli in for terry gross, back with more of our salute to broadway composer john kander, who turns 90 years old tomorrow. along with the late lyricist fred ebb, who died in 2004, he wrote the songs for such musicals as cabaret, chicago and the kiss of the spider woman, and for the film new york, new york. when terry spoke with john kander in 2015, he had just released a double cd called john kander: hidden treasures. it collected many of his demo recordings as well as recordings of great songs from his shows that weren't hits.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: fred ebb died in 2004 of a heart attack. how did you carry on musically after having collaborated with him for so many years?\n\nkander: it's a hard - hard thing to answer. we had been together for so long that it seemed - sometimes, things like somebody's death seems unlikely because for years and years or years, that person has been alive and part of your life. one of the main things i think that helped me out was that we had three shows which were incomplete. one was scottsboro. one was the visit and one was curtains. and so for the next few years, finishing those shows felt like working with fred so that it wasn't that kind of sudden break-off of a - of an artistic relationship.\n\nthe songs that had to be written or the scores that had to be completed, i did the lyrics for them with - to the best of my ability and trying to sort of conjure fred when i was working. and i think they came out all right. and so in that way, it wasn't until we finished the visit that it was the end of our collaboration.\n\ngross: and the three shows that you mentioned - the visit, scottsboro boys, and curtains all made it to broadway.\n\nkander: yes they did. and i - and i like them.\n\ngross: so i want to hear - i want to play another demo that you wrote. and this is the first song that broke through that you wrote with lyricist fred ebb called my coloring book. what was the occasion for writing this song?\n\nkander: this was very early in our collaboration. and fred had an idea for writing a comic song about a coloring book. and my memory of it was that i think when he suggested it, for some reason i had some sort of mild annoyance. and i think i said to him, why does everything have to be funny? and we started talking about how you could take a song about a coloring book and make it real, poignant, somehow or other truthfully emotional. and so we went in that direction. i have to preface this by saying freddy i wrote a lot. we were pregnant all the time. so the idea of writing a song...\n\ngross: (laughter).\n\nkander: it's really true. we just wrote songs, and we liked to write songs. so the idea of taking that idea and going in another direction was not a moment of friction between us. it was, ok, let's try that. and we ended up writing a song which i like very much to this day because it's so simple.\n\ngross: i like it a lot too. and i remember when it was a hit by sandy stewart in - was it the '50s or the '60s?\n\nkander: oh, freddy i met in 1962.\n\ngross: so this was in the 1960s. that was a hit. this is a version that you recorded in 1973. i think that this was in performance at the 92nd street y.\n\nkander: yes.\n\ngross: ok. so this is this is john...\n\nkander: i think so.\n\ngross: i think that's right. so this is john kander at the piano playing and singing a song he wrote with fred ebb called my coloring book that had been a hit for sandy stewart and has been recorded by many other people.\n\n(soundbite of song, my coloring book)\n\nkander: (singing) if you admire coloring books - lots of people do - i've a new one for you. a most unusual coloring book, the kind you never see, crayons ready? very well, begin to color me. these are the eyes that watched him as he walked away. color them gray. this is the heart that thought he would always be true. color it blue.\n\ngross: that's my guest, composer john kander, performing a song that he wrote with fred ebb, my coloring book. how did that song change your life - because it was a big hit?\n\nkander: i think internally, it sort of validated us. i don't know if that's true or not. looking back on it, i think so. suddenly, there was a song out there that lots and lots of people were singing. and it sort of puts you in a - or at least it did for me - a slightly different place in your head. it's good and bad.\n\ngross: what's the bad part?\n\nkander: i think it scares - it's a little scary. if you're writing, as i do, really kind of for the pleasure of writing, it suddenly puts you in a kind of commercial place that you hadn't really thought of or - i don't know how to express it quite. i remember i was in an elevator, a tall building on a high floor. and i got into the elevator. and i was the only person in the elevator. and the doors closed, and muzak - remember muzak?\n\ngross: yeah.\n\nkander: and the doors closed on the 535th floor of this building. and a gooey, string version of my coloring book started. and nobody else was on the elevator. and we were going down fast. and i thought, i am going to die.\n\n(laughter)\n\ngross: one of my favorite recordings on this collection is sung by linda emond, who is the performer who i heard in the role that lotte lenya originated in cabaret. i saw linda emond in the revival of it. and on this new collection of your songs, she sings a song that you and fred ebb wrote for the musical adaptation of the thornton wilder play, the skin of our teeth.\n\nand the 1999 production never made it to broadway. you were revamping the production when fred ebb died in 2004. the song is called he always comes home to me, and i think this is, like, a married woman singing to her maid. and the married woman knows that her maid has probably had an affair with her husband. do i have that right? i've never seen the show.\n\nkander: yes.\n\ngross: so what happened to this song? it's a beautiful song. actually, let me play the song. and then we'll find out what happened to it. it troubles me when a song this good (laughter) hasn't had - hasn't had the life it deserves. so here's linda emond singing a song by john kander and fred ebb.\n\n(soundbite of song, he always comes home to me)\n\nlinda emond: (singing) there were others - quite a few. some were strangers. some i knew. but he always comes home to me. late for dinner quite a lot. do i argue? i do not. for i wake in the morning and see he's laying there close to me at home. i know you think i'm foolish. i ought to be more strong, combat him, defy him. but i say you're wrong. i've children, a marriage. i'd do it all again. it's just an inconvenience he puts me through now and then. so i'm staying.\n\ngross: that's linda emond singing a song by john kander and fred ebb. that's included in the new collection john kander: hidden treasures, 1950-2015.\n\nso you mentioned that the show that that song was written for, the skin of our teeth, that you lost the rights to it, that the thornton wilder estate withdrew the rights. so what happens to the song when you lose the rights to the show?\n\nkander: well, i guess i'm busy finding that out. we own the songs that we wrote. so what i think we can't do is mount a production of it. but i don't know how far we can go in properly presenting these pieces because a lot of it has to do with situations which only exist in the story. he always comes home to me is a song which has a general enough sort of narrative and an implication to it that you can actually sing it and an audience will understand.\n\ngross: right. how frustrating is it for you when a song as beautiful as that doesn't make it to broadway and doesn't have a life?\n\nkander: i don't know exactly how to answer that. i really don't want to sound phony on this. most of the fun of writing is the fun of writing and rehearsing and hearing people sing it and working with that. what happens later, that includes going through to a complete broadway production or whatever, is kind of secondary. i don't think i'm - i don't think i'm lying here. it's great when it happens. but the real fun is writing it and - or having linda sing it. i think it would probably upset fred more than me. i'm sad about it and a little bitter, but not overwhelmed because you just keep on writing.\n\ngross: john kander, it's been wonderful to talk with you. thank you so much.\n\nkander: thank you.\n\nbianculli: john kander speaking to terry gross in 2015. the composer of the music for cabaret, chicago and new york, new york turns 90 years old tomorrow. coming up, film critic david edelstein reviews t2 trainspotting. this is fresh air.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
'we're just astonished that this is happening,' sen. tammy duckworth says\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alex brandon/pool/ap alex brandon/pool/ap\n\nas pro-trump rioters began storming the u.s. capitol on wednesday afternoon, sen. tammy duckworth was heading to the senate floor.\n\ni was actually in the tunnels under the complex when the breach occurred and capitol police told me to barricade myself in a secure location, which i did, the illinois democrat told npr's all things considered.\n\nspeaking early wednesday evening from an undisclosed location within the capitol complex, duckworth said she was in a room full of her republican and democratic senate colleagues and their staffers.\n\nwhen the u.s. capitol police placed the congressional complex on lockdown, many senators were brought to that secure location, she said, adding that others were still being brought in from around the congressional complex.\n\nwe're just astonished that this is happening, grateful to the capitol police for keeping us safe, duckworth said. but frankly, we're anxious to get back to work.\n\ni think many of the republican senators feel the same way, i have not spoken to all of them.\n\nbefore the mob breached the capitol, congress was in the process of officially recognizing president-elect joe biden's election win. proceedings had just been delayed after republican lawmakers challenged the results of arizona's vote.\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi said later that congress would reconvene wednesday night to continue the certification process.\n\nwhen duckworth was asked if she thinks the shocking scenes at the capitol would cause any of those republican objectors to change their minds about the election, she said she wasn't sure.\n\ni don't know that they disbelieved the results of the election, duckworth said. i think that maybe some of them are realizing the enormity of appealing to, you know, those who believe in conspiracy theories, and the damaging effects it has on our democracy and our institutions.
should science take sides in the gulf?\n\nsome scientists say they're being locked out of research on the oil spill because they refuse to sign confidentiality agreements. ira flatow and guests discuss the problems of doing scientific research when a lawsuit is pending. is there a way to keep science independent?\n\nira flatow, host:\n\nyou're listening to science friday, from npr. i'm ira flatow.\n\nimagine that the gulf of mexico was a giant crime scene. you know that yellow crime-scene tape, imagine that it's spread all over the gulf and if you want to cross it, you can't, without getting permission from the authorities who have roped it off.\n\nso if you're a scientist, and you want to investigate that giant oil plume 22 miles long that the scientists at woods hole now say exists, or if you want to measure how much oil has sunk to the bottom and may be affecting the wildlife there, you as an important, independent scientist, may not be allowed in.\n\nthe only information or the facts that are allowed to be collected belong to the parties involved. that's bp and the u.s. government. and because both bp and the feds have a vital and monetary interest in the amount of oil still in the water and on the wetlands, you have to get past the lawyers first, before you can go on to public property and waterways.\n\nand with billions of dollars at stake, the government and bp will head to court. the extent of the damage and how much spill should cost bp will be decided through the legal system. and as one of my guests writes in an editorial in the washington post, both sides will seek to use science in a legal context.\n\nmuch of the information obtained from research and monitoring will be tied up in the courts rather than being made publicly available and scrutinized.\n\nso where does that leave science and scientists? some say it leaves them locked out of doing independent research unless you want to sign an agreement to hand over all the data that you collect, and lose control of it.\n\njoining me now to talk about this are my guests. linda hooper-bui is an associate professor at louisiana state university agricultural center and at the lsu a&m. she joins us by phone from baton rouge. thanks for talking with us today, dr. bui.\n\ndr. linda hooper-bui (associate professor, louisiana state university agricultural center, louisiana state university a&m): hello, how are you?\n\nflatow: hi there. christopher d'elia is professor and dean of the school of the coast and environment, also at louisiana state university. he joins us today. welcome to science friday, dr. d'elia.\n\ndr. christopher d'elia (professor, dean, school of the coast and environment, louisiana state university): hi, ira, how are you?\n\nflatow: you're i'm well, thank you. cary nelson is president of the american association of university professors. he's based in urbana-champaign, illinois. he joins us from maryland. thanks for being with us today.\n\nprofessor cary nelson (president, american association of university professors): glad to be here.\n\nflatow: glad to have you. let me begin with you, christopher d'elia. you wrote that in the washington post. is science being held hostage to the lawyers now?\n\ndr. d'elia: well, in a way, it is. the oil pollution act of 1990, which was put together really to respond to the exxon valdez situation that occurred just prior to that, provides for what is called the nrda process, the national resource damage assessment process, which essentially is a legal process.\n\nand it pits the government that's trying to maximize the damages for obvious reason against the industry, in this case bp, that's trying to minimize the damages.\n\nso science is being used in both sides but in an advocacy role by the attorneys that are representing the two groups.\n\nflatow: linda hooper-bui, tell us of your personal experience and those of your student scientists.\n\ndr. hooper-bui: we've had trouble getting access to publicly available sites. in one area, we were my student was working, and samples were removed from his possession. they are actually still sitting in an office in south alabama.\n\nflatow: who removed them?\n\ndr. hooper-bui: in another area, we were actually prevented from going, in south louisiana, into grand isle and into another area adjacent to that, port fourchon.\n\nflatow: who took your samples from you?\n\ndr. hooper-bui: u.s. fish and wildlife officer.\n\nflatow: and what was the reason that they gave you for that?\n\ndr. hooper-bui: because we were not my project was not approved by incident command, and i wasn't participating in the nrda process, as dr. d'elia indicated.\n\nflatow: and these are places you had gone countless times on your own in the past.\n\ndr. hooper-bui: in south louisiana, yes, absolutely, or publicly available areas that, you know, normally one would have access to, yes.\n\nflatow: and you study the wetlands?\n\ndr. hooper-bui: yes.\n\nflatow: and you were there looking to collect data about the oil spill on the wetlands?\n\ndr. hooper-bui: sure. i study insects, and we were very interested in looking, using you know, this is a huge drilling disaster, and as a scientist, you know, we don't often get an opportunity to look at that amount and type of stress that would happen to the food web in the wetlands. and so we are using this as an opportunity to test scientific hypotheses.\n\nflatow: and are you now - have you given up trying to go back?\n\ndr. hooper-bui: well, we found we've just, we've tried to find friendlier areas, friendlier people, people who are willing to allow us to have access to the areas and to the land. so we found adjacent areas. it's very time-consuming to do that, though.\n\nflatow: so why not just sign those papers that they want you to sign?\n\ndr. hooper-bui: no way. first of all, i have a ph.d. student who came from china to study in the wetlands. this is the greatest wetlands in the world, according to him. and my role as a professor is to teach him how to conduct science, and science is conducted in an open, peer-reviewed way, and to teach him how to present his work and to write up his work. and his ph.d. would pretty much be on hold.\n\nand also, it's just, it's not how - i test hypotheses. i don't collect data for, to support somebody's idea to go into litigation. that's not how i operate as a scientist.\n\nflatow: cary nelson, what obligations or responsibilities do individual scientists in this to their work or to bp or the government?\n\nprof. nelson: well, the aaup, which i'm president of, has actually been involved in this issue since the first statement we issued, which was in 1905, and we warned against the danger of powerful economic and business interests limiting the free flow of the results of scientific research.\n\nthis, of course, happened after the exxon valdez spill, when there was the same conflict between nrda's desire to control information so as to have, you know, power over it during the litigation process, and of course, exxon's desire also, to have data and scientific testimony that would be under their control.\n\nand in the short term, which in this case means several years, the losers is first of all the public, which doesn't get to know the results of scientific research; and secondly, congress, which potentially passes legislation; and then thirdly, regulatory agencies, which during a normal timeframe, might well want to revise regulations about drilling in the gulf.\n\nbut bp's limitation on the exchange of research, they're willing to control research from people who sign contracts with them for up to three years. the average sea turtle can't sit in an oil slick for three years without some assistance. i mean, that's realistically, that's the entire time period in which either legislation or regulations would likely be adjusted. i mean, thats three years is a long time for american memory.\n\nso, i mean, this because the context of litigation puts some pressure on the litigants to withhold data, it means that the public good is finally not being served. i mean, what we believe is that scientific research should be freely shared.\n\nthere are restrictions here not just against publication but even against talking with one another. and then there's a whole additional level of problem, which is that the failure to share the information means that in many cases, scientists involved in individual research projects can't see the whole picture.\n\ni mean, if they've signed either the nrda contract or the bp contract, they may simply be collecting data, but they don't have the full range of data available to them from other researchers to be able to do a full analysis of the problem.\n\nand as we've seen with the gulf oil spill, there's a need for information, which is continuous and considerable. i mean, day by day, the situation changes, and one needs to be able to respond. one needs to know what the best clean-up methods are. one needs to know the damage to the environment. and all of these all of this tremendous need to know, because it affects what you do, is being compromised by the limits on the flow of information.\n\nflatow: and of course, because we have two conflicting parties in a lawsuit here, potential lawsuit, being bp and the government, they both have a vested interest in what numbers you come up with.\n\nprof. nelson: right. i mean, it's an extraordinary situation. i mean, in an odd way, there was no real preparation, of course, for dealing with the oil spill, that is for responding to it. but at the same time, there was really no comprehensive notion of what this scientific investigation should be like.\n\nand it seems to me that after the exxon valdez spill, there would have been some concerted government effort to decide how best to coordinate the science, how to maximize the gathering of data and the analysis of the data in as public a format as possible. and neither thing happened.\n\nflatow: yeah, let me to go the phones, darren(ph) in college station, texas. hi, darren.\n\ndarren (caller): hello, ira.\n\nflatow: hi, there.\n\ndarren: i'm an adjunct professor here at a&m, and we were also in the gulf, but got thrown out. we were testing a theory that the chemical composition of the dispersant they were using was causing the oil to sink. and we'd been there for approximately three days, and federal agents flat told us to get out. and it wasn't fish and wildlife officers. these were homeland security officers, and we were told that it was in the interest of national security.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nprof. nelson: i mean, i could see restricting access so that 500 people shouldn't be able to ride their dune buggies along the beach, but reputable scientists should have access.\n\nflatow: darren, did take your samples away or anything - take anything away from you?\n\ndarren: oh, yeah, they inspected the boat. they, of course, checked everyone's identification, and they took all the samples that we had. and they also took some notes that we had. the theory that we were operating upon was information that had been given to us by someone who worked in the plant that made that dispersant. and they took everything.\n\nflatow: wow.\n\ndarren: (unintelligible)...\n\nprof. nelson: ira, it's really kind of an insane world that we've entered into in terms of the barring of reputable scientists from a public site where they can contribute considerably to the knowledge that we have.\n\nflatow: dr. d'elia, do you know of other cases like darren's?\n\ndr. d'elia: yes, i've heard of other cases anecdotally. but i think that there are a couple of other points we made in our washington post op-ed piece that are really critical, and they bear on this, as well, that probably, the foremost one is something that cary nelson just said, which is we're not really planning, in a comprehensive way, how to deal with large-scale scientific disasters. and what plans apparently do exist seem to be within the government only, and do not extend to the academic community.\n\nand we think that ostp really is where there should be much more of this planning going on. they coordinate national science efforts, and we would hope to see more of that, or to have seen more of that. the second point i would make - and it's very important - is there's a de facto inability to get out if there's no money to go out and study what's going on out there. and the federal government has made very, very little money available for independent research to do studies of the oil plumes.\n\nflatow: mm-hmm.\n\ndr. d'elia: and the only place that we've really had substantial success with is the national science foundation, but the total amount of funding they've had available is relatively small from the grant (unintelligible).\n\nflatow: linda hooper-bui, you got a grant, did you not?\n\ndr. hooper-bui: yes, sir. the national science foundation, to date, has funded $6.9 million to 70 projects which may - like my project has a total of 10 investigators working together on this project, and our project is funded at the level of 137,000. so it's very - we used all of our discretionary money to rush out, gather preliminary data, and then we have $137,000 between 10 investigators to analyze oil, analyze some pretty complex samples, to look at oyster uptake of oil and effect of growth on oysters, mussels and snails, and then also look at the insect samples and some foraminifera. we have a lot of research that we've coupled together, and we have a one-year process that's going to occur.\n\nflatow: you're listening to science friday, from npr.\n\nprof. nelson: it's also disturbing that i've seen the inhibitions on science research have also made it easier for spokespeople from both bp and, indeed, from the federal government to claim facts about the oil spill which are not factually demonstrable and, indeed, may be very much in doubt.\n\nflatow: mm-hmm.\n\nprof. nelson: you know, such as the, you know, 75 or 85 percent of it's gone, and they don't bother to look what's settled to the bottom of the seafloor, which is, after all, what happened a lot of the oil after the exxon valdez disaster. and so it wouldn't take a genius to figure out the same thing might have happened here.\n\nflatow: we're talking about oil in the gulf this hour on science friday, from npr. i'm ira flatow.\n\nlinda hooper-bui, if you got more money, could you still go back and study what you need to? or you're still restricted because, as you say, you're not signing those confidentiality agreements, and i imagine you're not letting your other students sign that?\n\ndr. hooper-bui: no, sir. we are not signing, and will not sign a confidentiality agreement. i view my job as i'm a public servant, so that i'm not serving the public and keeping my data quiet. the interesting thing is, in recent days, as the cleanup efforts and the number of people in the beach has decreased, the areas have gotten a little bit more open. and also, there's been some mechanisms put in place through the lsu-a&m campus office of research and economic development, where their - the facilitation of access appears to be opening.\n\nflatow: mm-hmm. how did - the woods hole oceanographic institute this week issued a press release - actually, the results of a study in which they sort of contradicted the government study. and they found that there is, in fact, a 22-mile plume of oil from data that they had collected in june. dr. d'elia, how were they able to get in there and collect that data?\n\ndr. d'elia: well, they were very fortunate. they got in early, and they did get permission from incident command to do it. they had nsf rapid funds, as linda does, and they used very sophisticated instrumentation not available to the government to find this oil. and i think that is -another dimension here is the way that the government does its science is really pretty conservative and based on established and old practices. and the way that the research community and the academic world operates were constantly trying to be at the cutting edge. and i think the woods hole group was definitely in that area.\n\nflatow: now, the lsu people, i understand, there are lsu scientists, dr. d'elia, who have signed that confidentiality agreement, correct?\n\ndr. d'elia: the may be a couple, but i'm not really aware of a lot of lsu people having signed on. i don't have all the information on who lsu has or has not signed on, but the scuttlebutt around has been most people really want to be independent, as linda does. they value scientific interchange. the way we make progress is not by just hoarding our data and keeping it all quiet. we talk to each other. we try to interact, and we try to advance knowledge in a collective way. and this is sort of antithetical...\n\nflatow: mm-hmm.\n\ndr. d'elia: ...to that approach.\n\nflatow: all right. we're going to have...\n\nprof. nelson: my impression is that (unintelligible)...\n\nflatow: hang in there. hang in there, cary. we're going to - we have to take a break. we'll come back with your comments first, okay? stay with us. we're talking about doing science - doing scientific research in the gulf, which has basically been roped off between two parties, bp and the u.s. government, which are going to be fighting it out in court over how much damage to pay - how much to pay for the damages of the oil.\n\nso stay with us. 1-800-989-8255. you can tweet us @scifri, @s-c-i-f-r-i. maybe you're a scientist who has been turned away. we'd like to hear from you. we'll be right back after this break.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nflatow: i'm ira flatow. this is science friday, from npr.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nflatow: you're listening to science friday, from npr. i'm ira flatow. we're talking about doing scientific - doing research in the gulf of mexico and the legal problems in trying to do that independently, with my guests, linda hooper-bui, associate professor at louisiana state university agricultural center, christopher d'elia, professor and dean of the school of the coast and environment - also at lsu - cary nelson, president of the american association of university professors. our number: 1-800-989-8255.\n\ncary, you wanted to say something before the break?\n\nprof. nelson: yeah, ira. i mean, there's another - a couple of other issues that are worth raising. one is that - one of the principles that we argue is that when a scientist signs a research contract with a corporation, that contract should not include either restrictions on testimony in court or a commitment to testify on behalf of the corporation. i mean, to keep science clean, those really should be separate documents, and someone who signs a research contract should not have to also sign a separate document...\n\nflatow: mm-hmm.\n\nprof. nelson: ...that leaves the corporation free to decide whether or not that person testifies.\n\nflatow: but how is this different from pharmaceutical companies who are signing up university scientists to do the work and going into work with the universities themselves? they sign non-disclosure forms and secrecy agreements all the time, don't they?\n\nprof. nelson: well, you know, the - there are two major industries that have long compromised the freedom of science inquiry, and that's the tobacco industry and the pharmaceutical industry. i mean, they have the longest histories of essentially, sometimes, suborning whole departments and limiting the research that they do and purchasing testimony.\n\nso, you know, you're perfectly apt in citing those examples, but they aren't examples that are cheerful or really proper. i mean, they are industries that have damaged scientific integrity. i mean, if you look at the number of faculty members over the years who testified in congress that smoking wasn't harmful to your health, well, i have to think that some of them knew better. you can see what happens, what money can do to people. it can be very damaging.\n\nflatow: i'd like to note that we invited bp to send a spokesperson to the program, but they didn't take us up on our offer.\n\n1-800-989-8255 is our number. you can also tweet us at @scifri, @s-c-i f-r-i, if you'd like to get us going. i want to hear you. let's go to matthew, in west philadelphia. hi, matthew.\n\nmatthew (caller): hey, ira. love your show.\n\nflatow: thank you.\n\nmatthew: my question is (technical difficulties) of the spill. you all have kind of touched on it a little bit, but, you know, from the early onset, there were scientists that you just spoke about who saw these huge plumes. so it's proven scientific fact. so who do we trust? like, these scientists, or the government? and does that mean it's a spill that's probably a lot worse...\n\nflatow: mm-hmm.\n\nmatthew: ...than we think it is?\n\nflatow: let me go to dr. d'elia.\n\ndr. d'elia: well, i think that the dimension of the spill is pretty much agreed to at this stage, and i believe those estimates are probably pretty well known. the real issue is what happened to the oil.\n\nmatthew: mm-hmm.\n\ndr. d'elia: and the debate between the government, which is saying roughly three-quarters of it is just - is gone for one reason or another, and people on the other side, such as the university of georgia at woods hole oceanographic institution, are saying, well, wait a minute. you really don't have enough information to make such a claim. and i would tend to suspect that a lot of the oil has been gone, given the nature of the oil. but on the other hand, i would like to see it confirmed a little bit more substantially than in a...\n\nflatow: well...\n\ndr. d'elia: ...essentially a five-page (unintelligible).\n\nflatow: isn't that what we define science as? as being able to - you know, to go back and do the same investigation and come up with the same answer or something different? the ability to - you know, to do the experiment over and over again. and it doesn't seem like - here what you're saying is that we don't have that ability to do that.\n\ndr. d'elia: absolutely, because the government held all the cards, essentially.\n\nflatow: mm-hmm. do you see any of this changing, or do we just have to wait for the litigation to take its course?\n\ndr. d'elia: well, i really think that the law is going to have to change. i - this is due for reauthorization in the near term. and i think we're going to need to find some real way to provide for independent scientific research.\n\nthere has been, for years, a very difficult relationship within the regulatory agencies like noaa, that have regulatory functions, like epa that have regulatory functions, of what happens to research. they've got an inherent conflict of interest. they're both regulators, and they have to perform the research in an unbiased way that's going to support their regulation. that's a real challenge. and i think we're going to have to take a look at all of these kinds of agencies in a more close fashion than we have in the past.\n\nflatow: all right. let me - i've got time for one more caller.\n\nprof. nelson: one other thing would be that it's quite possible that the agencies that fund research should not themselves be involved in the litigation.\n\nflatow: ah, we've heard that before.\n\nprof. nelson: yes.\n\ndr. d'elia: i'd agree.\n\nflatow: let's go to charles wohlforth in anchorage. hi, charles.\n\nmr. charles wohlforth (author, the fate of nature): hi.\n\nflatow: hi. you were a past guest on our program, talking about exxon valdez. you see a parallel here?\n\nmr. wohlforth: yeah. the parallel is they're really quite distressing, you know, in what we can see from the exxon valdez, which is what i wrote about in my book - you interviewed me about the fate of nature -is that the result of getting the lawyers in charge of the science program is you don't get the answers you need. so 20 years after the exxon valdez, we still don't know what happened to the herring. we still really don't know how much oil was released. you know, we still don't know the major ecosystem effect, and that's after spending $500 million on science. and the reason for that failure is because of the secrecy that's been mentioned, and also because lawyers are not scientists. and when they design a science program, they get it wrong.\n\nflatow: okay. well, we've run out of time. i think that's a good perspective to end with. thanks for joining us, charles. thanks for the call. also, i want to thank the rest of my guests today: linda hooper-bui is associate professor at louisiana state university agricultural center and at lsu a&m; christopher d'elia, professor and dean of the school of the coast and environment at louisiana state university; cary nelson, president of the american association of university professors. thank you all for taking your time to be with us.\n\nprof. nelson: thanks a lot.\n\ndr. d'elia: thank you very much.\n\nprof. hooper-bui: thank you.\n\nflatow: you're all welcome.\n\ncopyright © 2010 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website

gun owners grapple with shifting conversations around firearms\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption george frey/getty images george frey/getty images\n\nthese past few days saw changes to our gun regulations on both the national and the local level after an emotional couple of weeks following the mass shooting at a florida high school.\n\nin florida, gov. rick scott signed a package of new gun regulations into law. they include age limits and a new three-day waiting period on certain kinds of powerful guns. nationally, the department of justice began the process to ban bump stocks, as well, submitting that legislation saturday morning.\n\nwith roughly 300 million guns in america today, many gun owners have been thinking deeply about the role of firearms in american life.\n\nnpr's renee montagne spoke to a few listeners about how the shifting conversation around guns has affected how they view their own firearms.\n\nwe're not able to have an evidence-informed debate because, effectively, the centers for disease control and the national institute of health are not allowed to study the issue, elis, a listener from a small town in rio arriba county, n.m., says. elis is a gun owner, but has not joined the nra.\n\ni was very much against guns, she told npr, but i live rurally where hunting guns and guns to protect yourself are pretty commonplace.\n\nthe county i live in is the size of connecticut. at any given time, we only have two sheriff deputies patrolling the entire county. and my life was being threatened by a violent stalker. and i got really clear really fast ... i couldn't count on the police. i don't have close neighbors. and i got very comfortable with using my gun.\n\nelis owns small .38, which she says she took a lot of time getting comfortable with shooting on public lands. she says the rural-urban divide might prevent people from understanding why she owns a gun.\n\ni think if someone understood the circumstances i live in, the reality, they would understand that my thinking about guns really had to change by that life experience and will forever remain changed, she says.\n\njt, a listener from terre haute, ind., understands elis' circumstances very well. he has viewed gun ownership differently since 2012, when two people tried to break into his home.\n\nand it escalated pretty quickly, he says. and i realized at that moment that i was going to have to take care of myself.\n\nhe owned a single-shot break action hunting shotgun at the time, but kept it stored in his basement.\n\nand to think if they would've gotten through the door that i could've shot one, reloaded and then shot another one if they're trying to do me harm really went against every bit of training i ever had, he says. so i did move to a semiautomatic firearm after that.\n\njt says he became a member of the nra after the shooting in parkland, fla. joining the organization is the most effective way for me to combat soft bans on certain types of firearms, he says.\n\nthey're not going to take them away, but they are going to deny their ownership to our kids and grandkids, jt says. you know, when you've got big, big money coming out from foundations and donors to advocate for those soft bans, the nra counters that. and though i don't agree with every piece of their message, they are effective at doing that. and i do think that that's very important that i participate in that.\n\nmidwestern listener scott disagrees. scott was born and raised essentially around firearms, he says. he grew up participating in shooting sports, hunted, trapped fish, and spent eight years in the military. he was a lifelong nra member. but, after the parkland shooting he says he left the nra.\n\nyou know, as more and more mass shootings happened, the political rhetoric from the nra really started to change, he says. you know, when i was younger, the organization seemed to be primarily focused on gun safety and hunters' rights. and they did themselves promote safe gun regulation and sensible, in my opinion, gun regulations. but as time went on, they changed, in my opinion.\n\nscott says he is glad that there are efforts to pass gun regulation on a local level, but would like to see that done on a national level, with gun laws that are consistent from state to state, from county to county.\n\ni'm a concealed carry holder in multiple states, and the laws are different everywhere you go, he says. so i would like to see sensible regulation. i would like to see consistent laws across the country versus the patchwork quilt of laws that we have now.\n\nnpr's hiba ahmad, samantha balaban and barrie hardymon produced and edited this story for broadcast.
can we change the past?\n\nenlarge this image getty images/tetra images rf getty images/tetra images rf\n\nwho has no regrets about things done in the past? wouldn't it be nice if, somehow, we could go back to tweak a couple of bad decisions?\n\nthis sounds (and as we will see, is, to a certain extent) like science fiction.\n\nthe laws of physics prohibit traveling backwards in time for many reasons. if we did travel backwards in time and changed the course of events, we would be altering the course of history. an example often cited is the grandfather's paradox: if you traveled back in time and killed your grandfather when he was still a high school student, he wouldn't have met your grandmother and your father and you wouldn't exist.\n\na popular example of traveling back in time is the fascinating canadian tv series travelers: in a distant future, the earth is in shambles; humans are controlled by a benevolent artificial intelligence that finds a way to project the consciousness of people into unaware hosts in the 21st century. the idea is that travelers from the future take over the minds of people in the 21st century right before they are about to die. there is some obscure talk about quantum entanglement of consciousness between traveler and host, but this is secondary. the point of the show is that the travelers go back to try to change the course of history — so that the future looks better.\n\nputting humans or consciousness traveling back in time aside for the moment, is there anything in science even remotely similar? surprisingly, yes. at the level of quantum particles (we are talking individual photons, elementary particles or individual atoms), there is something called wheeler's delayed-choice experiments that show that actions in the present can influence the past.\n\nthe experiments use something called the wave-particle duality of light and of matter, the fact that the physical nature of quantum objects is undetermined until it is measured. in other words, this means that a particle of light, or of matter, can behave either as a wave (spreading out in space, showing interference) or as a particle (staying together as a small bundle) depending on the measuring apparatus. long and ongoing discussions about the nature of quantum physics are still trying to work out what this actually means. do our minds determine the nature of physical reality? the interested reader can see what i wrote about this in more detail in the island of knowledge: the limits of science and the search for meaning.\n\nbut experiments measure — they don't ask questions of meaning. john wheeler, the physicist who proposed such experiments in the 1970s, would have been amazed if he had seen the current results. it does seem that the present can influence the past, at least at the level of quantum objects.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of marcelo gleiser courtesy of marcelo gleiser\n\nthe picture to the right explains the story. imagine that there is a source of photons (or other small quantum particle). the photons can pass through a double slit. behind the double slit, there is a screen. if the photons hit the screen, those conducting the experiment observe an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes, typical of waves. if the screen is not there, and there are photon counters aligned with the slits, the photons will hit either one or the other, behaving like little bullets (or particles). so far, this is the typical setup for a double-slit experiment.\n\nthe mystery which cannot go away (as physicist richard feynman famously remarked) of the double-slit experiment, is that the person performing the experiment determines the physical nature of the particle — i.e., whether it is a wave or a particle. and, with wheeler, the mystery deepens.\n\nimagine that the setup — having or not having the screen — is decided after the photon goes through the slits. that is what the arrows in the diagram represent, the possibility that the screen is there — or is not. in 2007, a group in france did exactly that, letting a single photon pass through a double slit and then, after it passed through, having a random number generator choose whether the screen would be there or not to detect it. as wheeler wrote, thus one decides the photon shall have come by one route or by both routes after it has already done its travel. since then, many other groups (for example, here) have performed refined versions of the experiment, confirming wheeler's intuition.\n\nan important detail is that the switching over of detecting apparatus must be faster than the time the photon has to travel to the detectors. this way, there is no way the photon could know what to do. (if a photon knows anything, anyway.) experiments presented in october extended the range of the photon's trip to about 2,200 miles, and still the photon seems to always choose the path consistent with the delayed choice. it is as if — mike mcrae wrote in this science alert piece — that even after the horse has bolted 2,200 miles out of the gate, it can still wait until the finish line to decide which race it ran. that is, which path to the finish line it took.\n\nof course, photons are not people, and to sustain a quantum superposition is very difficult, especially as the size of the object increases. still, there is something quite amazing and mysterious about this behavior, where the path in space taken by an object seems to be impervious to time; it is as if the two choices (particle or wave; one slit or two) are suspended in time and are only enacted once the spatial arrangement is decided upon. no wonder wheeler liked to called such ideas as being indicative of a participatory universe, that is, of a universe where our minds are somehow deeply connected with the very fabric of space and time. after all, the choices of the apparatus may be made by a random number generator, but the apparatus and the interpretation of the data require our intent and design.\n\nfood for thought for the future. or maybe the past?\n\nunfortunately, these experiments say very little about how we could interfere with the past in events relevant to the human scale. better to think carefully about decisions than to try to fix them backwards.\n\nmarcelo gleiser is a theoretical physicist and writer — and a professor of natural philosophy, physics and astronomy at dartmouth college. he is the director of the institute for cross-disciplinary engagement at dartmouth, co-founder of 13.7 and an active promoter of science to the general public. his latest book is the simple beauty of the unexpected: a natural philosopher's quest for trout and the meaning of everything. you can keep up with marcelo on facebook and twitter: @mgleiser

i mean, i don't get this body by abusing it.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: all right, here, lila, is your last limerick.\n\nrosenthal: ok.\n\nkurtis: though kanye might think himself regal, his actions are weird but still legal. he would keep drones at bay with some grand birds of prey. as guards, he'll trade dogs for an...\n\nrosenthal: seagull.\n\n(laughter)\n\nrosenthal: sagal.\n\nburke: the confidence.\n\nkurtis: good for you.\n\n(applause)\n\ngoldthwait: do you know - do you know how - do you know how close...\n\n(laughter)\n\ngoldthwait: do you know how close the american bald seagull was our...\n\nsagal: yeah, no.\n\ngoldthwait: ...national bird?\n\nrosenthal: oh, man. it's eagle?\n\nsagal: it is eagle, yeah.\n\n(soundbite of bell, laughter, applause)\n\nsagal: although i was excited because of course, the american bald seagull is my second cousin.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: say what you - it's eagle - say what you will about rapper kanye west - he's narcissistic, he's thin-skinned, he's the biggest [expletive] in the kardashian family.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: but he's a brilliant innovator in all things. and so when kanye has been thinking about protecting his family, especially from paparazzi, he went right to mercenary-trained in eagles. kanye west is reportedly trying to hire these eagles that danish police have trained to attack drones. he's tired of these paparazzi drones sent to take pictures of himself and his family. but he can't help himself. eagle tries to do its job, eagle's attacking the drone, kanye would drop in and say i'm going to let you finish but a falcon is the best raptor of all time.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: bill, how did lila do on our quiz?\n\nkurtis: well, lila was a winter before she tried to change the national bird. but congratulations anyway, lila from boulder.\n\nsagal: thank you so much, lila.\n\nrosenthal: thank you.\n\nsagal: bye-bye.\n\n(soundbite of kanye west song, touch the sky)\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
stabenow is among senators calling for trump's removal from office\n\nnoel king, host:\n\ndemocratic senator debbie stabenow of michigan is one of the lawmakers who's calling for president trump's removal. she's on the line with me now. good morning, senator.\n\ndebbie stabenow: good morning. good to be with you.\n\nking: good to have you. you have said, as i understand it, do whatever it takes to get him out of office, whether that is impeachment, whether that is invoking the 25th amendment, whatever it takes. what specifically do you hold the president responsible for in this case?\n\nstabenow: well, there are numerous things. and certainly, the mobs, you know, the riots - really, domestic terrorism that we saw and experienced at the capitol a couple of days ago didn't just happen. i mean, this has been something building for a long time and which is extremely concerning to me, as well, as we go forward and try to bring people back together and try to heal this country when we have so many people now that are believing these conspiracy theories and qanon theories and, you know, all of this.\n\nand so right now, we have a situation where this president incited riots, incited people to basically attack our united states capitol. we have at least one police officer who lost his life. we've had four others who lost their lives as well. and this is very serious. if other people were doing this, they would be held accountable. so i'm not naive, noel. i know that this would take the vice president to initiate the 25th amendment. it would take bipartisan support to be able to move forward on impeachment. but i will support whatever we can get support for that holds him accountable, including what happens when he leaves office.\n\nking: a question that will be on many people's minds - the president has 12 days left in office. so both of the things that you're proposing, as you've noted, impeachment and 25th amendment, these are largely symbolic. why pursue it with 12 days left? why not just get through the next 12 days?\n\nstabenow: i think the seriousness of this, the loss of life, the destruction of the united states capitol - i mean, what we saw, what we experienced in the u.s. senate is not acceptable. it's not tolerable. and so to say, well, we'll just move on - there's only 12 days or 11 days - you know, we have to certainly at least speak out and take a stand. we know that there's only limited time left, thank goodness. but we also know that he can do a lot of damage in one day.\n\nking: let's talk about the damage. twelve days left in office, you seem to be suggesting you think it's unsafe for president trump to stay in office. what specifically are you concerned about?\n\nstabenow: at this point, we don't know. you know, this is someone who makes national security decisions. this is someone who, you know, is extremely erratic, as we know, and making decisions that are based on emotion and what he views as vindicating himself, you know, for all his - the grievances against him. and so we don't know. we don't know. and so - and i do believe that we don't need all the cabinet leaving right now. what we need are people that are going to stay and provide some guardrails around him because i don't think he has any personal limits on what he might do. so there have to be people around him that provide that.\n\nking: and you're pointing out that two members of his cabinet have resigned or said they will resign. i wonder, senator, what, if any, conversations you were having with your republican colleagues in the senate and whether there has been any change in the past few days in terms of how they view president trump's time in office.\n\nstabenow: well, they're counting the days, hoping it goes very quickly.\n\nking: they are?\n\nstabenow: i mean, i don't know anyone that thinks that this is a good idea for him to remain. but i also think it's difficult for us to assume that people will step forward at this point and join us. but certainly, behind the scenes, when we were spending the hours and hours on wednesday together, you know, waiting to go back in the senate chambers after the terrorism, i don't think there was anybody - not very many people there thought it was a good idea for him to remain president.\n\nking: but then shouldn't your republican colleagues step forward and join you? i mean, as you pointed out, you were all under attack this week. that's a big deal.\n\nstabenow: sure. but i also believe that they should've joined us to remove him a year ago during the impeachment process. so they have to be accountable and answer the questions on their own, you know, behavior - but certainly would welcome them joining us.\n\nking: fair enough. democratic senator debbie stabenow of michigan. thanks so much for your time this morning.\n\nstabenow: my pleasure. take care.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
senate to vote on impeachment articles wednesday\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption drew angerer/getty images drew angerer/getty images\n\nupdated at 8:00 p.m. et\n\nthe senate impeachment trial adjourned friday evening, with a plan to return monday morning to continue. closing arguments will be presented monday, after which senators will be permitted to speak on the floor. a final vote, during which president trump is expected to be acquitted, is expected next wednesday around 4 p.m. et.\n\non friday. the senate voted not to call witnesses in the trial. the vote was 51 to 49 against witnesses. democrats had pleaded for two weeks to hear testimony from, among others, former national security adviser john bolton. but most republicans resisted. just two republicans — sens. mitt romney of utah and susan collins of maine — voted with the democratic caucus.\n\nthe president faces two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of congress related to accusations that he held up military aid to ukraine until the country announced investigations into potential political rival former vice president joe biden and his son hunter.\n\nfriday night's vote result was not a surprise following announcements from key republican senators that they would not be supporting witnesses. sens. lisa murkowski of alaska and lamar alexander of tennessee said they do not need to hear testimony, which would have prolonged the trial.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., said in a statement friday evening that there was no need for witnesses.\n\nnever in senate history has this body paused an impeachment trial to pursue additional witnesses with unresolved questions of executive privilege that would require protracted litigation, he said. we have no interest in establishing such a new precedent, particularly for individuals whom the house expressly chose not to pursue.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mandel ngan/afp via getty images mandel ngan/afp via getty images\n\nsenate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., pushed back immediately after the vote. he called the decision a perfidy. it's a grand tragedy. he said that if trump is finally acquitted now, the acquittal will have no value.\n\nthe no votes\n\ndemocratic house managers' hopes of calling witnesses who could have proved damaging to trump were dashed even before a vote on the motion.\n\nalexander announced his decision not to join the democrats' effort on thursday; murkowski's statement came friday before the senate trial resumed.\n\nthe looming acquittal for the president was long anticipated, but the roadblock on witnesses still marks a striking setback for democrats, who at times appeared hopeful that they would be able to persuade enough republicans to join them in voting to call witnesses, thereby prolonging the trial if not the altering its outcome.\n\nmurkowski made clear on friday that she did not want an extended trial.\n\ngiven the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, i have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the senate, murkowski said in a statement. i don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. it is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the congress has failed.\n\nalexander gave a different rationale: he argued that he had enough evidence that trump acted inappropriately — but he does not think the president's actions are impeachable. if you've got eight witnesses saying that you left the scene of an accident, you don't need nine, he told npr on friday.\n\nloading...\n\nthe yes votes\n\nthe democratic caucus needed four republicans to defy their party in order to succeed, but it ultimately only got two.\n\ncollins on thursday announced that she planned to vote for hearing witnesses.\n\ni believe hearing from certain witnesses would give each side the opportunity to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities, and provide additional clarity, she said in a statement.\n\na spokeswoman for romney said on twitter friday morning that the senator wanted to hear from bolton.\n\nbolton became a central figure in the fight over witnesses after reports describing portions of his forthcoming book in which he purportedly verifies accusations that trump directly tied military aid to ukraine with a demand for investigations into his political rivals.\n\nwhen the senate trial resumed friday, schiff immediately read into the record a new york times story that reported on a new revelation in bolton's manuscript.\n\naccording to the times, bolton says trump told him in early may to call ukraine's president to set up a meeting with trump lawyer rudy giuliani to discuss an investigation into the bidens. bolton says that among those in the oval office meeting with trump and bolton was white house counsel pat cipollone. cipollone is now leading trump's defense team.\n\nyou will recall mr. cipollone suggesting that the house managers were concealing facts from this body. he said all the facts should come out, schiff told senators. well, there is a new fact which indicates that mr. cipollone was among those who are in the loop. yet another reason why we ought to hear from witnesses.\n\ntrump denied the account in a statement provided by the white house.\n\ni never instructed john bolton to set up a meeting for rudy giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in america and by far the greatest mayor in the history of nyc, to meet with president zelenskiy. that meeting never happened, he said.\n\nnpr has not reviewed the manuscript.
opinion: npr's evolving coverage of live white house coronavirus briefings\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption al drago/bloomberg via getty images al drago/bloomberg via getty images\n\nkuow, an npr member station in seattle, said earlier this week that it will no longer air the daily white house coronavirus task force briefings live. the announcement was both praised and condemned by listeners who contacted the public editor's office.\n\noverwhelmingly, the listeners who have reached out to my office have asked that npr itself cease airing the briefings as a routine practice, echoing calls elsewhere for the live coverage to stop. but some managers at member stations report the opposite; their listeners want to hear the full briefings live. we've heard that from listeners, too, particularly in response to kuow's announcement.\n\nthe public radio debate, at least that which i have heard, is heated, but the arguments are also as thoughtful as you'd expect, coming from station employees who take their public service role seriously, and listeners who are seeking out trustworthy information sources.\n\nthe debate breaks down into three broad threads. one is that the briefings have become less newsworthy over time. while the briefings do in part provide important updates from officials as the nation attempts to conquer a raging pandemic, they can be meandering and contradictory, and the president has at times also used them to spread falsehoods and air personal grievances. kuow, in making its announcement, cited a pattern of false or misleading information provided that cannot be fact checked in real time as its reason for discontinuing the live broadcasts. (it also said the decision was not politically based and that it would revisit this decision daily.)\n\nan alternative view is that npr's role is to bear witness, no matter what the news is. live airing of the full briefing allows citizens to hear directly how their federal government is handling this crisis. listeners get to decide for themselves the value of the information shared, perhaps by listening to npr's later analysis.\n\na third argument i've heard from listeners is that by not airing the briefings live, npr would be censoring the administration.\n\nfirst some background\n\nthis may be pedantic, but it's important context: when i talk about npr, i am referring to the decisions that are ultimately made in the d.c. newsroom. those decisions mostly play out in what is heard on the weekday and weekend versions of morning edition or all things considered, the midday here and now, on npr.org, the hourly newscasts, or in so-called special coverage, when npr goes live for breaking news.\n\nbut npr is also something else. it is a constellation of more than 1,000 public radio stations around the country, such as kuow, that are licensed to local communities or community organizations such as universities. they contract with npr to provide national and international news coverage, but fundamentally, they make local decisions, responding to the needs of their communities. that's per their mandate from the federal communications commission, which has the power to take away those licenses to use the public airwaves. not every community has the same wants or needs.\n\nan ethical approach\n\nit's a specious argument that not airing the briefings is tantamount to censorship. it's not as if npr would be refusing to report any news coming out of the briefings if it did not carry them live. the daily news shows and hourly newscasts have reported extensively on what the president and others have said during the briefings, and continue to do so.\n\none listener wrote to us equating the covid-19 briefings to president franklin d. roosevelt's world war ii fireside chats. but the two situations are not equal, nor is the media environment the same. unlike in the 1940s, when newspapers and radio were the only major news sources, we are now in an era of abundant media outlets; the briefings can be seen or heard on npr.org or myriad other places. they can be watched live, or after the fact. (that said, there are indeed some media consumers in rural areas who do not have cable or broadband connections and who rely on public radio airwaves to receive news. that's where local community station decisions come in.)\n\nboth of the other arguments have merits, and the good news is that technology makes it easier to satisfy both camps. it's important to see the government at work. but increasingly, the briefings are being held around 5:30 p.m. et, which is the heart of the first airing of all things considered. by cutting away to carry the live feed from the white house, npr has had to jettison other valuable reports on how the country is responding to this crisis, as well as other important news. (and as an aside, i think npr has been doing an excellent job covering this wide-ranging story, from the science to the financial ramifications to the very personal impacts on people's lives.)\n\nmoreover, there is that question of misinformation. if npr runs a 90-minute briefing live, how many listeners are sticking around for the analysis, context and fact-checking afterwards? the npr newsroom's self-defined mission is, among other elements, to serve the public and democracy. i take that to mean that it should provide facts to help listeners make decisions in their lives, not spin, particularly at a time when public health is at stake. that means having its reporters listen to the briefing and immediately share important updates in the newscasts and newsmagazines, without giving a platform for falsehoods, or speculative comments on as-yet-untested treatments or campaign rally-style rants. those who want to can watch the full briefing at npr.org (albeit without that all-important context) and npr has made the link easy to find, sending out breaking news alerts, among other things.\n\nearlier this week, npr was taking a middle road on air: preempting all things considered to air the first minutes of the daily white house briefing, which are generally the most news-filled, and then cutting back to the newsmagazine partway through the briefing, to provide analysis of what was said. that is better than running the entire briefing live, but a better public service would be to simply stop the live broadcasts and report on what is said later, using the same news judgment as for any story. of course, npr could still do what it always has done: break into its regular programming if the briefing warrants.\n\nthose are my opinions, and mine alone. here's what the newsroom told me yesterday, via an official statement:\n\nwe make our editorial coverage decisions based on the news environment in any given hour, on any given day; our decision regarding providing live coverage of the white house daily covid-19 briefings is no different. today, we have decided to lean into our original reporting and analysis on our daily programs like morning edition and all things considered while offering our member stations a live stream of the white house briefings on a separate channel, but our coverage decisions will continue to evolve daily.\n\nhere's my translation: no live coverage of the briefing last evening, but that could change in coming days, depending on the circumstances. stations that want to can run the live coverage on air or online. i approve.
jane and bernie sanders feel the heat over investigation into shuttered college\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption john minchillo/ap john minchillo/ap\n\na federal investigation of jane sanders is quickly becoming a political problem for her husband, sen. bernie sanders. officials are looking into whether jane sanders lied on a loan application when she was president of burlington college, a small liberal arts school along the shore of lake champlain in vermont.\n\nquestions about jane sanders' time at the college are putting bernie sanders on the defensive at a time when national speaking tours and regular appearances on cable talk shows have some of his supporters predicting a 2020 presidential run.\n\ninvestigators have not formally accused jane sanders of any wrongdoing, but at least one donor has publicly said that sanders mischaracterized the financial gift she had promised to the college. sanders allegedly claimed in loan documents that corinne bove maietta, a member of a prominent burlington family, promised a series of donations to the college, but maietta has since said that the money was actually promised as a bequest, not recurring gifts.\n\njane sanders is one of her husband's closest political advisers. on the campaign trail last year, she took the stage with him regularly, from rallies in rural iowa to his victory speech after the new hampshire primary. in hotels on the campaign trail, she could be seen in the lobby working with campaign staff.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption wilson ring/ap wilson ring/ap\n\na spokesman for the sanders family says the investigation is part of a politically motivated attack designed to hurt the vermont senator's political career, but that hasn't stopped investigators from requesting documents and conducting interviews with former burlington college officials.\n\nhere's what we know — and what we still don't know — about the burlington college investigation:\n\njane sanders took over as president of burlington college in 2004 with plans to grow the small liberal arts school (enrollment was below 200 in the college's final academic year). by 2010, that plan included expanding the college into a new campus.\n\nin 2010, the college got a loan in order to buy a $10 million headquarters building on more than 30 acres of waterfront land just a mile north of where bernie sanders would launch his presidential campaign more than five years later.\n\npeople's united bank provided the money. the college bought the property. six years later, after burlington college's accreditation came into question over financial woes, and just months after federal agents began asking questions about jane sanders' loan application, the college closed.\n\nwhile the investigation began just as the college was collapsing, sanders and his supporters say the event that brought jane sanders under scrutiny has nothing to do with jane sanders or burlington college. sanders says this whole situation is a political play by republicans to hurt his reputation. whether the investigation reveals wrongdoing or not, republican operatives are working to bring this issue into the spotlight.\n\nin january 2016, more than five years after the loan to burlington college was approved, and eight months after bernie sanders announced his presidential run, brady toensing wrote a letter to the department of justice calling for an investigation into the statements jane sanders made on the loan application. toensing served as the vermont campaign chairman for donald trump's 2016 campaign and is the co-chairman of the vermont republican party.\n\nwithin a few weeks of toensing's letter, former college officials said, they heard from federal investigators who were asking questions about what jane sanders told lenders. the washington post reported this week that prosecutors have subpoenaed college records for a grand jury.\n\nthe federal investigation hadn't been publicly reported when burlington college shut down in the spring of 2016, but the local nonprofit news site vtdigger revealed emails this spring from vermont's agency of education that showed officials discussing the investigation.\n\nsince vtdigger revealed the federal investigation, republican party staff have been working to generate press coverage about the investigation and implicate bernie sanders himself, but there's no public evidence to suggest sanders was in any way involved with the burlington college property deal and no public evidence that he is under investigation.\n\njane and bernie sanders hired a lawyer this spring, after news of the investigation was public. sanders' detractors say the move shows that there is something the couple is trying to hide. family spokesman jeff weaver told the post that there is no truth in that argument. he says the couple brought lawyers on because of fears that trump or sanders' other political adversaries would improperly use the justice department to damage the senator's reputation.\n\nthe investigation leaves sanders sharing a small piece of common ground with trump: both men say political enemies are making up stories about them and their families to hurt their reputations and distract from the substance of their policies.\n\nas with trump, the investigation the sanders family faces could change the political landscape of the next election; for sanders, that could come as soon as 2018, when he faces reelection in vermont. sanders hasn't yet declared his candidacy, but his would-be opponents have already announced runs and they're already using burlington college to call sanders' character into question.
fulton county elections director on 2 georgia runoffs\n\nnpr's mary louise kelly speaks with rick barron, elections director in fulton county, ga., about the state's runoff elections for the u.s. senate on tuesday.\n\nmary louise kelly, host:\n\nif you happen to listen all the way through that phone call where president trump asked georgia to change its election results, you would have heard him mention one particular county more than a dozen times - fulton county. now, the bulk of the city of atlanta sits in fulton. this morning, when we stopped by the fulton county elections office, phones were ringing.\n\nrichard barron: these are just hate calls coming in...\n\nkelly: wow.\n\nbarron: ...just nonstop.\n\nkelly: richard barron is the director of elections in fulton county. he told us those calls started ramping up on christmas day.\n\nwhat do they say?\n\nbarron: usually, they want me to go to jail and, you know, that i've committed fraud. i got a death threat last thursday. we got a bomb threat on wednesday for our polling places tomorrow.\n\nkelly: tomorrow being the senate runoffs here; runoffs which will determine control of the u.s. senate. i asked barron for his top-line reaction to the president's call.\n\nbarron: it's surreal. and, you know, my staff and i come to work every day, and we've been doing it this whole year. we have had 34 covid infections throughout that time. the only thing we're interested in is trying to conduct elections as well as possible and making sure that the way we do it is in accordance with the law and the procedures set out by the state election board. so to have everything put into question is, you know, i guess disconcerting and disappointing.\n\nkelly: let me, if i may - there were, as you will have noted, several moments where the president went after fulton county explicitly. and i want to read you just a couple of them and let you respond to them if that's all right. i will read the direct quote. we have at least two or three...\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npresident donald trump: anywhere from 250- to 300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. much of that had to do with fulton county, which hasn't been checked. we think that if you check the signatures - a real check of the signatures going back in fulton county, you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures.\n\nbarron: we only processed 148,000 absentee by-mail ballots in fulton county, so i'm unsure where that figure's coming from. and...\n\nkelly: you're saying if every single one of them had been forged - and there's no evidence of that - that you wouldn't...\n\nbarron: right.\n\nkelly: ...have had that many ballots in the first place.\n\nbarron: correct. and in addition, signature verification is done by comparing the signatures on the outer envelope to the signatures that people put on their driver's licenses. so all of our signatures are checked according to the official documents from the voters.\n\nkelly: so bottom line to that charge from the president about the integrity of elections in fulton county - you're in charge of elections in fulton county. you're saying it's not true.\n\nbarron: correct.\n\nkelly: another point he made - and i'll read this one - these are - he made a bunch of allegations about shredding ballots, about dumping ballots. here's one moment. in fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find...\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\ntrump: you will find that you have many that aren't even signed, and you have many that are forgeries. ok. you know that. you know that. you have no doubt about that. and you will find - you will be at 11,779 within minutes because fulton county is totally corrupt.\n\nkelly: this has to do, as far as i can tell, with this video that purported to show containers of ballots being secretly counted after poll workers had gone home. this is a debunked claim that - the republican secretary of state of georgia had his office look into that. they found no problems. is that correct?\n\nbarron: that's - as far as i know, that's correct. they've interviewed the people that worked that day. with regard to dumping ballots, i don't even know how to respond to that because i'm not sure what he means by dumping ballots and hundreds of thousands of them. i don't know what that means. and shredding ballots - we haven't shredded any ballots. if there are unused ballots, we can do that. but we haven't done that for the november election.\n\nkelly: bottom line, given how many questions there have been in this election cycle about the integrity of our elections in this country and how many specific questions there have been about georgia raised by the president and his allies and others, what do you want to say to people about the integrity of the election that you are overseeing?\n\nbarron: i think that our elections are without reproach. i mean, we come to work every day just to do this job because it means something to us. and what it's turned into this year is something that i don't think i ever anticipated seeing in my lifetime. it's concerning to me that we've got to this point and that a lot of things are put out in social media and the twittersphere that just have no basis in fact. and i think there has to be some sort of education for the public that just breaks down and simplifies what goes on behind the scenes in elections because it is really just a set of processes that you go through, and you do it time and time again. and they're the same things we've been doing for years and years.\n\nkelly: well, mr. barron, thank you. good luck tomorrow.\n\nbarron: thank you.\n\nkelly: that is richard barron. he is the director of elections here in fulton county, ga.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

in pakistan, one girl's death could lead to changes in country's culture\n\nthe rape and murder of a little girl has led to much soul searching in pakistan and might actually lead to changes in the country.\n\nmary louise kelly, host:\n\nto pakistan next, where people are clamoring for the public hanging of an alleged serial killer. a warning - there are details coming over these next four minutes or so that could disturb some listeners. this story begins with a little girl. she was found in a trash heap after being raped and killed. it is an awful story. and among the many questions it's raising is whether her death might lead to changes in pakistan. npr's diaa hadid visited her hometown today, and diaa joins me now. hi.\n\ndiaa hadid, byline: hey there, mary louise.\n\nkelly: tell us what this little girl's name was and what you found when you visited her town.\n\nhadid: so this little girl - her name was zainab amin. she was 7 years old. and she was from a provincial cotton mill town called kasur. it's about an hour from where i am. and it could be anywhere in pakistan except for this. just about every kid i saw was escorted. and when i asked their parents, their grandparents and their older siblings why these kids weren't running around freely like they are anywhere else in pakistan, they said it was because they were afraid of letting them out alone. one of the people i spoke to is a human rights lawyer called waqas abid, and here's what he had to say. he really echoes what residents were feeling.\n\nwaqas abid: this is very painful for me. whenever they go to the school, i try to drop them myself. and we - all family members are very much careful. it's very painful when i think that - what happened with the innocent children in our city.\n\nhadid: so when he says the innocent children in our city, what he's talking about is that activists count here that 13 children were raped and killed over the past two years here. the 13th child was zainab.\n\nkelly: now, police believe they have found the alleged killer. he's been arrested. is that right?\n\nhadid: that's right. he's a 23-year-old construction worker, and he lived about a minute's walk from where zainab lived. and i spoke to his neighbors today, and they said he'd like to go to the roof of their building to watch the girls in the pink-painted primary school that's just across the narrow alleyway.\n\nkelly: to look down at the girls school - it's awful. it sends chills up your spine.\n\nhadid: yeah.\n\nkelly: let me ask you this. he's been caught, but you said people are still scared of letting their children out to run around freely. why?\n\nhadid: because people worry that there might be another murderer. and it really just - it just gets to the heart of the problem in kasur and generally in pakistan - is that people don't trust the police. they don't trust the government. they see their officials as corrupt, inept, inefficient. and they see them as being subservient to the rich and contemptuous of the poor. and most of the families whose children were killed here are quite poor.\n\nkelly: so diaa, people are furious, i gather. there have been riots. there have been calls for this suspect to be hanged if he's found guilty. people have attacked the police station where he was being held. do we know yet what the lasting impact might be, what changes this might result in going forward?\n\nhadid: so when i was in kasur today, i went to the police station which still reeks of smoke from when residents tried to burn it down. and there was still smashed cars in the yard. and police said that the furor around this case really changed things, and it forced the state government to throw more resources and money at this case, which is why they were able to solve it. and so that's one important change that we might see looking forward - is that the government will be reluctant to let these cases drag on like they did in the past.\n\nkelly: i also wonder, diaa. is it significant just that this is - we are talking about this girl by name. her family has come forward. the national press is all over this story. are there more cases coming to light as a result of what happened to her?\n\nhadid: yeah, there are. i spoke to one ngo worker who said that he counted 100 more cases that had come forward after zainab's death created this...\n\nkelly: one hundred - wow.\n\nhadid: ...enormous response in the media. one hundred - and those aren't cases that happened after she was killed. they're families who were reluctant to say what had happened to their children, who found the courage to come forward. that in itself is a pretty big deal here.\n\nkelly: that's npr's diaa hadid reporting from lahore. diaa, thank you.\n\nhadid: thank you, mary louise.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
section 230: a key legal shield for facebook, google is about to change\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption oivind hovland/getty images/ikon images oivind hovland/getty images/ikon images\n\nupdated at 5:17 p.m. et\n\nit's 1995, and chris cox is on a plane reading a newspaper. one article about a recent court decision catches his eye. this moment, in a way, ends up changing his life — and, to this day, it continues to change ours.\n\nthe case that caught the congressman's attention involved some posts on a bulletin board — the early-internet precursor to today's social media. the ruling led to a new law, co-authored by cox and often called simply section 230.\n\nthis 1996 statute became known as a core pillar of internet freedom and the law that gave us modern internet — a critical component of free speech online. but the journey of section 230 runs through some of the darkest corners of the web. most egregiously, the law has been used to defend backpage.com, a website featuring ads for sex with children forced into prostitution.\n\ntoday, this law still sits at the heart of a major question about the modern internet: how much responsibility do online platforms have for how their users behave or get treated?\n\nin the first major change to section 230 in years, congress voted this week to make internet companies take a little more responsibility than they have for content on their sites.\n\nlibrary or newspaper?\n\nthe court decision that started it all had to do with some online posts about a company called stratton oakmont. on one finance-themed bulletin board, someone had accused the investment firm of fraud.\n\nyears later, stratton oakmont's crimes would be turned into a hollywood film, the wolf of wall street. but in 1994, the firm called the accusations libel and wanted to sue. but because it was the internet, the posts were anonymous. so instead, the firm sued prodigy, the online service that hosted the bulletin board.\n\nprodigy argued it couldn't be responsible for a user's post — like a library, it could not liable for what's inside its books. or, in now-familiar terms: it's a platform, not a publisher.\n\npolitics congress passes legislation to curb online sex trafficking of children congress passes legislation to curb online sex trafficking of children listen · 4:12 4:12\n\nthe court disagreed, but for an unexpected reason: prodigy moderated posts, cleaning up foul language. and because of that, the court treated prodigy like a newspaper liable for its articles.\n\nas cox read about this ruling, he thought this was exactly the wrong result: how was this amazing new thing — the internet — going to blossom, if companies got punished for trying to keep things clean? this struck me as a way to make the internet a cesspool, he says.\n\nat this moment, cox was flying from his home in california to return to congress. back at work, cox, a republican, teamed up with his friend, oregon democrat ron wyden, to rectify the court precedent.\n\ntogether, they produced section 230 — perhaps the only 20-year-old statute to be claimed by internet companies and advocates as technologically prescient.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption douglas graham/congressional quarterly/getty images douglas graham/congressional quarterly/getty images\n\nthe original purpose\n\nsection 230 lives inside the communications decency act of 1996, and it gives websites broad legal immunity: with some exceptions, online platforms can't be sued for something posted by a user — and that remains true even if they act a little like publishers, by moderating posts or setting specific standards.\n\nsection 230 is as important as the first amendment to protecting free speech online, certainly here in the u.s., says emma llanso, a free expression advocate at the center for democracy and technology.\n\nno provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\n\nthe argument goes that without section 230, we would never have platforms like youtube, facebook, twitter, yelp or reddit — sites that allow ordinary people to post opinions or write reviews.\n\nit's the one line of federal code that has created more economic value in this country than any other, says michael beckerman, who runs the internet association, which represents many of silicon valley's largest companies.\n\nbut section 230 is also tied to some of the worst stuff on the internet, protecting sites when they host revenge porn, extremely gruesome videos or violent death threats. the broad leeway given to internet companies represents power without responsibility, georgetown university law professor rebecca tushnet wrote in an oft-cited paper.\n\ncox says, the original purpose of this law was to help clean up the internet, not to facilitate people doing bad things on the internet.\n\na teflon shield\n\nthe original purpose hasn't always prevailed in court. and one specific example has prompted congress to vote to amend section 230 — the first cutback to websites' protections in years.\n\nit's the case of backpage.com, a site ostensibly for classifieds, but one well known for its adult-services ads. among them — if you know what to look for — are sex ads featuring children forced into prostitution.\n\nall of those terms were indicative of an underage child — lolita, fresh, new to town, says mary mazzio, a filmmaker whose documentary i am jane doe tells the story of several young girls sold for sex on backpage.\n\nover the years, victims and their families brought case after case against backpage — and lost. the website kept convincing judges across the country that section 230 shielded it from liability for the posts of its users. major digital-rights groups, including the center for democracy and technology, argued that holding backpage liable could have chilling effects for social media and other websites.\n\nthis bewildered mazzio: how is it possibly legal that a website that makes millions and millions of dollars has no accountability for this crime? she says. section 230 has turned into a teflon shield, not to protect free speech but to protect business revenue.\n\nthe supreme court last year declined to hear victims' appeal in the case of backpage and section 230.\n\ntoggle caption cliff owen/ap\n\nthe judge-made law\n\neventually, mounting evidence showed that backpage was actively involved in the sex ads. that means the site is a publisher liable for its content. backpage and its founders are now facing a federal grand jury in arizona.\n\nto sen. ron wyden, co-author of the law, the department of justice missed the mark for not going after backpage earlier, since section 230 does not preclude federal criminal investigations.\n\nbeyond backpage, similar concerns continue to play out with sites that solicit revenge porn, publicly acknowledge potential risks to users or ignore harassment complaints.\n\ni'm afraid ... the judge-made law has drifted away from the original purpose of the statute, says cox, who is now president of morgan lewis consulting. he says he was shocked to learn how many section 230 rulings have cited other rulings instead of the actual statute, stretching the law.\n\ncox argues that websites that are involved in soliciting unlawful materials or connected to unlawful activity should not be immune under section 230. congress should revisit the law, he says, and make the statute longer and make it crystal clear.\n\ntoggle caption cliff owen/ap\n\nresponsibility\n\ncox draws this distinction of websites like backpage — involved or connected with their content — and sites that are pure intermediaries. he wouldn't say whether that term applied to facebook or google.\n\ninterestingly, the internet giants themselves — as well as wyden — talk about the law as being rooted in responsibility.\n\nthe real key to section 230, wyden says, was making sure that companies in return for that protection — that they wouldn't be sued indiscriminately — were being responsible in terms of policing their platforms.\n\nbeckerman of the internet association describes section 230 as not a blanket amnesty but a call for responsible policing of platforms. the internet companies say that on sex trafficking, they actively help investigate cases — and that generally, without section 230, websites would resort to more censorship or decide to know as little as possible about what happens on their platforms.\n\nbut danielle citron, a university of maryland law professor who authored the book hate crimes in cyberspace, argues that responsibility is exactly what is missing from the law.\n\nyes, let's think about the consequences for speech, she says, pointing to the flip side of the freewheeling internet. there are countless individuals who are chased offline as a result of cyber mobs and harassment.\n\ntoggle caption rachel la corte/ap\n\na rift among companies\n\npolitically, the story of section 230 has recently taken a surprising turn.\n\nthe backpage saga has galvanized lawmakers to act on bills amending section 230 with the goal of stemming online sex trafficking. the legislation allows more state and civil lawsuits against websites related to online sex trafficking, for knowingly assisting, supporting or facilitating crimes.\n\nthe senate passed the bill wednesday, sending it to president trump for his signature. the white house has supported the legislation.\n\nand for the first time, after years of staunch defiance, the internet association came out in support of legislation to change section 230, shocking smaller internet companies and digital-rights groups by breaking ranks.\n\nthe industry giants are narrowly threading the needle. after the bill passed the house, the internet association said the industry not only is committed to ending trafficking online but also will defend against attempts to weaken these crucial protections of section 230.\n\nwe all share the same goal, the association's beckerman told npr, and that's to ensure that victims are able to have justice they need, but also enable our companies to stop this practice.\n\npolitics house passes bill to crack down on online sex trafficking house passes bill to crack down on online sex trafficking listen · 2:46 2:46\n\nengine, a group advocating on behalf of smaller internet companies, argues that silicon valley behemoths like google, facebook and twitter can handle more lawsuits and the legal uncertainty that would smother a startup.\n\nnot the last challenge\n\nwyden points out that these are the very same platforms facing massive scrutiny for being manipulated by russian operatives during the 2016 election, making it a politically touchy moment for the companies to fight over sex-trafficking legislation.\n\nthe big companies have a lot of egg on their face over the election, and nobody wants to be seen as being soft on sex trafficking, he says.\n\nwyden and cox have opposed the legislation to amend section 230, along with groups including engine and the center for democracy and technology. opponents of the bill say it could lead to crimes moving deeper into the dark web and to websites resorting to more censorship or ignorance of what happens on their platforms to avoid liability.\n\nsen. rob portman, r-ohio, author of the senate bill, says the tech community overreacted to amending section 230 to the point that they weren't willing to look at the obvious problem, which is that it's been abused to sell people online.\n\nwyden says all this should be a wake-up call for silicon valley:\n\nif the technology companies do not wake up to their responsibilities — and use the power 230 gives them — to better protect the public against sex trafficking and countries that try to hack our political system, you bet that companies can expect (this legislation) will not be the last challenge for them.\n\nnpr researcher will chase and business desk intern ian wren contributed to this report.
oregonians aren't pumped about new law allowing self-service gas stations\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption rick bowmer/ap rick bowmer/ap\n\nmany oregonians were outraged this week when a new law took effect allowing motorists in rural counties to pump their own gas, representing a shift in the state's decades-long history of requiring an attendant to pump gas for drivers.\n\nas of jan. 1, gas stations in counties with a population of less than 40,000 are permitted to offer self-service. while the change in the law is expected to affect a small number of people, oregonians took to social media to express their discontent – and were subsequently mocked by residents of the other 48 states that allow self-service. new jersey is the only other state that prohibits drivers from pumping their own gas.\n\nit makes sense for these rural counties to allow self-service because there are so few motorists on the road, especially at night, lizzy acker, a reporter for the oregonian, tells here & now's meghna chakrabarti.\n\nwe're talking about really rural counties, she says. if you live in one of these places, it doesn't make sense to have someone working at a gas station all night when there might not be anyone showing up.\n\nsince 1951, oregon law has required all gas stations to have attendants; but for the past two years, stations in certain rural counties have been permitted to offer self-service from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.\n\ni think a lot of people are still going to just keep it going the way it is because oregonians, for better or for worse, we are traditional people, acker says. we stand by our traditions since 1951 when this law passed.\n\nbut much of the outcry on social media didn't call on tradition. the responses to a now-viral facebook post by a local tv station ranged from concerns about smelling like gasoline to being attacked by drifters lurking around stations. some said they didn't even know how to pump gas.\n\ni don't even know how to pump gas and i am 62, native oregonian ... i say no thanks! i don't like to smell like gasoline! one woman commented on the post.\n\nno! disabled, seniors, people with young children in the car need help, another woman wrote. not to mention getting out of your car with transients around and not feeling safe too. this is a very bad idea. grr.\n\nacker says she filmed a video to help her fellow oregonians learn how to pump gas, noting the danger in wildly spraying it in the air like in the movie zoolander.\n\nsome of the concerns weren't completely dramatic. in fact, disability rights oregon pointed out that the americans with disabilities act requires self-service gas stations to assist customers with disabilities.\n\nwhile many respondents claimed they were joking, the sarcasm was lost on many who criticized oregonians for not wanting to or not knowing how to pump their own gas.\n\nman. it's like those people in infomercials who can't perform menial tasks, one man wrote on the facebook post.  'do you have trouble pumping your own gas?' *guy grabs pump handle and sprays himself in the face* 'then do we have a state for you!' \n\nproponents of the bill argue it won't cost the state jobs because stations with convenience stores are still required to employ attendants during business hours. only a handful of gas station owners surveyed by the bend bulletin said they plan to offer self-service. many owners said they would have to install new pumps in order to allow it.\n\ni think that we are getting tarnished in social media, acker says, and i think most oregonians are self-sufficient enough to figure out how to pump their own gas.\n\nluckily, most of them won't have to learn.
uganda's young people view upcoming presidential election as a chance for change\n\nmary louise kelly, host:\n\nlet's head overseas for a moment now to the african nation of uganda. with an average age of 17, the country has one of the youngest populations in the world. that means most voters who'll go to the polls tomorrow to elect a leader have only known one president - yoweri museveni, who's been in power for 35 years. his rival, a singer-turned-politician who is half his age, has electrified young people, as npr's eyder peralta reports.\n\neyder peralta, byline: the capital of uganda is known for its boda bodas, motorcycle taxis that crowd at intersections and weave through traffic.\n\n(soundbite of car horns)\n\nperalta: they are mostly driven by young men. vincent kizito, who is 24, lounges on his motorcycle in downtown kampala. over the past few years, he says security forces have made his life impossible. they look for every violation to arrest him or impound his motorcycle to squeeze a bribe out of him.\n\nvincent kizito: (non-english language spoken).\n\nperalta: the little money he gets, he says, goes to the cops. but kizito says he is hopeful right now, and it is all because of the singer-turned-presidential-candidate bobi wine. he says bobi wine rose from the ghetto, so he knows the struggle. bobi wine's run for president, he says, makes him believe that change is possible.\n\ndid you used to care about politics?\n\nkizito: (through interpreter) no, i never did. i never thought that i had got a candidate who would show me the beauty about uganda, what i can be and what i can do for my country.\n\nperalta: sarah bireete of the center for constitutional governance says young people in uganda represent the largest part of the electorate, but they are left at the margins of society with few jobs or opportunities. she says that's the way it's been for decades. and so in the previous two elections, young people stayed home. but five years ago, bobi wine was elected to parliament. he led a rebellion against the social media tax and against changing the constitution to allow president museveni to run again. both efforts failed but...\n\nsarah bireete: bobi wine reenergized young people, and they are now interested in the affairs of their country.\n\nperalta: bireete says they are also sophisticated. they grew up on the internet, carefully studying mature democracies. and they know what museveni calls a democracy - one full of crackdowns on opposition and free speech - is not that.\n\nbireete: they cannot take an excuse of democracy, and that's why they're on the streets fighting.\n\nperalta: on the outskirts of kampala, ronnie mwange, who is 28, shows me his house.\n\nronnie mwange: this supposed to be a dining.\n\nperalta: he built this house with money from his motorcycle taxi. it was never his dream to drive a motorcycle, but he was orphaned. he couldn't afford school. and with a motorcycle, he could hustle 24/7. he says he survived on soft drinks to save enough to build this two-bedroom house.\n\nmwange: this is supposed to be a garage.\n\nperalta: oh, i see.\n\nmwange: supposedly if i get a vehicle.\n\nperalta: you can still dream in uganda.\n\nmwange: yeah, we can still dream in uganda. but if i tell you at my age and the way i work, i wouldn't be only having this.\n\nperalta: he deserves better, he says. uganda deserves better. he says in the past, he didn't care much for politics. but this time, he made sure to stop by his polling station to pick up his registration.\n\nwhy?\n\nmwange: because i still have hope that maybe this time around, things might change.\n\nperalta: maybe this time, he says, young people can change uganda.\n\neyder peralta, npr news, kampala.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

transcript: full transcript with fda commissioner stephen hahn\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrew harrer/bloomberg via getty images andrew harrer/bloomberg via getty images\n\nfood and drug administration commissioner stephen hahn speaks with npr's david greene about the development of a vaccine and the use of existing drugs to treat covid-19. here, a transcript of their full interview.\n\nmorning edition host david greene: so obviously a vaccine against this virus offers the best public health defense. what is your agency doing to speed up the process of getting a vaccine tested and deployed?\n\nfda commissioner stephen hahn: so as you probably know, david, a vaccine candidate vaccine was put into a phase one trial, and that's the earliest of phases of trials to safety trial on monday. so really record speed there, david, in terms of getting a vaccine to a virus and as you know, it's — the safety is really critical here, which is why we have to be careful about the development. but very quick development, as i mentioned yesterday, realistically, we're looking at a year to get a vaccine up and running and available. so you may ask why is safety so important? it's always important, of course, with any therapy or prevention, such as a vaccine. but remember, the vaccines are given to people who don't have the disease, who are otherwise healthy. so the safety consideration is very significant. after the safety phase of this, then it gets moved to can the vaccine elicit an immune response? which of course, we would consider to be protective against the virus. so multiple steps that have to take place, they have to be done under controlled conditions, so that we can make sure that we have the right answer.\n\nwe're still looking more than a year, though. is that is that safe to say?\n\ni think it's realistic to talk about a year. it could be longer. but, yes, i think it's reasonable to say that. the folks at the fda, i mentioned yesterday, 17,000 strong, working around the clock to try to expedite all of these things.\n\nandto get it going as quickly as possible. while that vaccine is in the works, you've also been talking about using existing drugs that could help treat covid-19. how soon could people expect to be able to use these kinds of drugs if, you know, if at least one of them is already approved for other uses?\n\nhealth food and drug administration seeks to expand treatment for coronavirus food and drug administration seeks to expand treatment for coronavirus listen · 11:00 11:00\n\nright. and, david, thank you for commenting on that. we're looking at repurpose drugs. so as i mentioned yesterday, innovators around the world, the country, are coming forward with potential ideas and we're looking at all of them. and what we'll do — what we can do — is if there is an already approved drug, the good news about that is that we have an understanding of its safety profile.\n\nthis would be like chloroquine, which is approved for — to treat malaria, right?\n\nchloroquine. that's right. there are other drugs that have some effect on the immune system that are being looked at with respect to reducing inflammation related to this virus, because, as you know, in the more latter stages of the disease, there's inflammation in the lungs.\n\nbut so — could doctors prescribe chloroquine soon? i mean, are we talking about days? if if this is something that that has already been approved to treat malaria, it's presumably safe. i mean, why not — why not now?\n\nso a doctor could write a prescription. i'm a doctor.\n\nright.\n\nand you could write a prescription for a drug that's an off label. fda does not regulate the practice of medicine, the doctor's got to make that decision based upon individual patient situation. you know, i'm going to put my doctor hat on, not my fda hat, david, if that's ok. so i'm a doctor and i'm seeing a patient and i'm thinking about this. you know, what i want to know is what are the data behind this? and i mentioned this yesterday because it's such an important thing for a doctor — right drug, right patient, right dose, right time. and the problem with the current situation is that we don't have all the facts. we don't have all of the data per say now. some of the reports are encouraging and we're gathering all those data. and what we'd like to do is to make this particular drug available to what's called expanded access. we're going to have the ability to do what's called a pragmatic trial. doctors can prescribe and use it. and then we'll collect those data. but i mentioned yesterday, and david i think this is so important — i'm a cancer doctor and you always want to provide hope. and i do very much believe there's hope here from a therapeutic point of view. but you don't want to promote false hope.\n\nbut that kind of that kind of process you're talking about, i mean, i know obviously safety is so important. but when it comes — we're in a health crisis where people are describing having a shortage of hospital beds. i mean, if we're going to get to a point really soon where there are that many sick people, doesn't the risk assessment change? i mean, can't you speed up the kind of things you're talking about to get these kind of drugs to people right now?\n\nyes, david, you're right. the risk calculus changes. and this is an individual doctor decision. we'll be providing — not we fda — but the cdc will be providing some guidance about that with respect to potential therapeutic options. but you're right. i mean, absolutely. and this is a drug that's available to physicians to prescribe now.\n\nsoshould they? i mean, are you telling them that they should if they have a patient who is really suffering?\n\ni am not saying that. what i'm saying is an individual doctor has to incorporate the data to make the decision for their individual patients. and one of the ways we're going to try to make this available on a more widespread basis is through this expanded access approach.\n\nand when does that start?\n\nso we're working on that now where obviously supply and availability of a drug is an issue. but there is an all-of-government approach on this.\n\nwell, i guess i just wonder, i mean, president trump said yesterday he's clearing red tape like no one before has ever done. what's an example of that? i mean, you say it's an all-of-government approach, but if you can't say like we're gonna get this process that could get this drug out there much faster going — like why not — why not today?\n\nso, david, an example of this is the rapidity with which a vaccine has been developed and has started in phase one trials. that's a very rapid timetable that's taken place. and with respect to the other issue, again, we really can't speculate, we have to have facts. and when you ask me a question, i have to be certain of my answer. and that doesn't mean that people aren't working on this. that doesn't mean that around the clock efforts aren't being made. what i can't do, what's one of the worst things that you can do in a medical situation that's urgent is to provide information that isn't accurate. so i'm not going to do that because i don't think that that's right for the american people. but i want to assure the american people that the fda and this all-of-government approach, frankly, all-of-america approach, really working hard 24/7. lots of scientists and researchers and doctors and nurses and pharmacists are on this effort.\n\ncan i just ask dr. hahn, i mean, the president talked about clearing red tape yesterday. what is one specific example of some red tape that he has cleared for your agency?\n\nso he has asked us to stick to science and data, but at the same time, remove barriers. so there are some regulations around waiting periods for certain types of therapies that have been put in place in the past that we can consider waiving and have considered and will consider waiving to actually expedite approval as long as we think it does not pose excess risk. because you have articulated it very well, david, and that is in an urgent situation, the risk-benefit calculus changes. so if we feel like a particular approach, like i just described, sort of a holding of something for 60 days, is not going to provide great benefit to the american people and still going to ensure safety, we're going to get rid of that one.\n\ni want to just ask them in a similar vein about testing. i mean, your boss, the secretary of health and human services, declared coronavirus a public health emergency in january. and then there were a lot of confusion, some missteps by the cdc, it took your agency till the end of february, i believe, to give qualified hospitals and academic labs the latitude they needed to start testing for coronavirus. how did this happen?\n\nso i think a couple of things are really important for the american public to understand about this. one is the fda started working with cdc on january 9. that's a fact. the cdc obtained the viral sequence. then they subsequently obtained patient samples, all of which are important and necessary for developing a diagnostic test. and cdc developed that test in a very short period of time. so, you know, we had been working since january, january 22nd, to be precise, with developers of tests and have done so throughout this period of time. and, you know, this is a rapidly evolving situation. we have responded to stakeholders when we got feedback about the necessity to provide more regulatory flexibility. the end of february guidance we provided, we did that, that was directly in response to requests from developers so that it could ease the pathway for the development of diagnostic tests.\n\ni mean, hospitals and labs needed that decision from the fda, which you made at the end of february. why couldn't that same decision have been made in january if you knew that this was such a crisis?\n\nwe were working with over 100 developers of tests during that period of time, including commercial laboratories. and david, it's really important understand getting an accurate and reliable test on the market's important. our team can provide you with an abstract that was recently published in the literature about a test that was performed in another country that demonstrated a 47% false positive rate. now, think about that, david. what that means is that if you had a positive test, it was pretty close to a flip of a coin as to whether it was real or not. and that's not to beat up that one test. it's just to point out to you that this is not as simple as folks might think. our manufacturers that we've been working with throughout these last couple of months have told us that it normally takes them six months to develop a test and they've done it in four to six weeks in collaboration with the fda.\n\ndo you regret not being able to make that decision sooner? that gave labs and hospitals around the country the latitude they needed to develop these tests?\n\nthat decision is a relatively small segment of the diagnostic testing world. we had been working with all of those folks over this period of time and continue to do that. and again, as i said, when we had feedback from the stakeholders that they would like that flexibility, that that would help them, we did that.\n\nwhy did other countries beat us?\n\ni ... can't comment on what's happened in other countries, david.\n\ni mean, they've been doing more testing than we've been able to do.\n\ni don't have access to those data. i mentioned to you that one abstract which our people can give you, with respect to that. so i don't want to speculate on what the tests that they've done are and how they've performed. what i can tell you is that we've been focused on making sure the most reliable, accurate and reproducible tests are available to the american people.\n\nwas more leadership needed here from the white house?\n\nwe have worked very closely with the coronavirus task force. vice president pence has done a terrific job. i've been personally involved in those meetings and i have been very impressed with the leadership from vice president pence and from the entire white house. david, i've been involved in situations in medicine before that were crises that were significant situations. it isn't the first time that that's happened to me, although not, certainly not of this magnitude or scale. and i can tell you that i've been very impressed with the leadership and with the great approach that vice president pence has taken with the task force.\n\nbut in retrospect, i mean, could there have been a more coherent strategy that might have avoided some of the some of the delays?\n\ni can speak to that from an fda point of view. and i can tell you this: we are learning organization. we are always and i mean always looking for ways to improve. and we have responded to feedback from stakeholders on the therapeutic, the vaccine and the test development side. we will always incorporate that. and when there's an opportunity to do a look back, we will do that because we always want to do what's best for the american people. but i have to tell you, 17,000 strong, incredible scientists, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, are working around the clock on this effort.\n\nwith all due respect to all of that great work that you're talking about, i mean, can you understand why americans who are very scared right now don't necessarily want to hear, you know, we're learning as we go?\n\nwhat i can understand is that this is a rapidly evolving situation, and americans are sharing a lot of information from different directions. we have a framework that we use and have used for many years in response to outbreaks like this. we have followed that, but we have adapted as this has changed. i think what the american people understand from what i'm hearing on the ground is that this is a very different outbreak than we have seen in the past and that evolving our approach to this is really important.
in reversal, fema says it won't end puerto rico food and water distribution wednesday\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mario tama/getty images mario tama/getty images\n\nupdated 12:46 p.m. et\n\na spokesman for the federal emergency management agency said wednesday that the agency's plan to end its distribution of emergency food and water in puerto rico and turn that responsibility over to the puerto rican government would not take effect on jan. 31.\n\nprovision of those commodities will continue, spokesman william booher said. a different spokesperson, delyris aquino-santiago, had earlier told npr that it would officially shut off its food and water mission on the island on jan. 31 and hand its remaining food and water supplies over to the puerto rican government to finish distributing. but on wednesday, booher said that date was mistakenly provided.\n\nthe agency has been working on that transition but has not finalized it, he said, adding that in the meantime, fema will continue providing food and water to communities on the island that need them.\n\nthe turnabout came after politicians from both political parties reacted angrily to news of fema's plan and after the puerto rican government released a statement saying it had not been informed of the impending change. on tuesday, lawmakers from both parties had called on the agency to reverse its decision.\n\nspeaking on the senate floor, florida democratic sen. bill nelson said he was absolutely shocked by fema's decision. i urge the administration to reverse this disastrous decision immediately and to continue providing the people of puerto rico with the help that they need as they are trying to recover from two disastrous hurricanes.\n\nhis concerns were echoed by democrats and republicans alike, including democratic rep. nydia velazquez of new york and republican sen. marco rubio of florida.\n\nthere are still a lot of people that wonder why we are giving foreign aid to puerto rico, rubio told usa today. you have to remind them, puerto rico is a u.s. territory and its residents are u.s. citizens.\n\nbut perhaps the most surprising reaction came from the government of puerto rico itself. in a statement, the island's public security secretary, hector pesquera, said that while he was aware that fema would eventually transfer responsibility for distributing food and water supplies over to the island's government, this has not happened yet and we were not informed that supplies would stop arriving.\n\nhis statement contradicted information that fema sent npr in an email last week. an agency spokeswoman wrote that fema will continue to provide commodities to the state [puerto rico] until january 31st.\n\nbut as public concerns mounted over fema's plans following npr's report, the agency released a new statement. while reiterating its belief that emergency food and water supplies were no longer needed on the island, it said that fema would continue to support the government of puerto rico to meet the needs they identify.\n\nspokesman booher said one thing that had not changed was fema's plan to end the shipment of new food and water supplies to puerto rico. he said the agency is confident it has enough of a stockpile there already to meet the need that remains. if supplies run out, he said fema would reconsider purchasing more. he did not say when the agency would finalize its plan to hand the remaining supplies over to the puerto rican government.
hollywood's a big business, and la's mayor wants more latinos involved\n\nnpr's lulu garcia-navarro talks with eric garcetti about a new jobs program aimed at doubling the employment of latinos — more than half the city's population — in the film industry there.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\ntonight is the oscars, when hollywood gathers to celebrate and reward the best movies and the people who make them. despite the fact that latinos make up almost half the population of the la area, only a tiny fraction of them are employed behind and in front of the camera. there is now a new jobs program to change that with the aim of doubling latino representation in hollywood over the next decade. it's called la collab, and it was co-founded by the mayor of la, eric garcetti. welcome.\n\neric garcetti: hi - great to be with you, lulu.\n\ngarcia-navarro: you are the mayor of la. ultimately, hollywood is a big employer in your city. is this a simple jobs program?\n\ngarcetti: no, it's much more. this is about making sure that our economy thrives for everybody and that we all have opportunities, especially here in los angeles in our trademark industry - that it shouldn't matter your zip code, your cultural background when it comes to telling your story and having access to the industry that greenlights or doesn't the stories of this country and, in many cases, this world. while latinos are more than a quarter of u.s. box office, we're between 1 and 6% of the folks that are making decisions and making the movies and television shows here in hollywood. and so what can we do not just to give lip service or a few unpaid internships that go nowhere, but really steadily get latinos into hollywood in positions where they can tell the stories of america through their eyes?\n\ngarcia-navarro: why, in your view, aren't we seeing movies about latinos? and why aren't latinos being employed?\n\ngarcetti: well, i think it's, you know, a kind of vicious circle. i think people who aren't making those decisions, who come from our community - they're not going to have the opportunity to tell those stories. and those stories, when they're not told, just confirm folks who don't greenlight those sorts of stories that they either don't exist or that nobody wants to see them. we know that there are amazing american stories in every community. eva longoria, who's helped us launch this, will become a director soon telling the story of the man who invented flamin' hot cheetos, the number one snack in the world now, you know, something that people know all over. and i think also, too, in hollywood sometimes and we're so proud of folks in latin america who have won awards, especially directors from mexico recently. but that is a different experience than latinos in the united states of america.\n\ngarcia-navarro: i was about to say most of the artists and directors that the academy is honored might be spanish-speaking. but they're either from latin america or spain.\n\ngarcetti: exactly. i mean, somebody came up and said, well, you know, at least we got antonio banderas this year. but...\n\ngarcia-navarro: (laughter).\n\ngarcetti: banderas is an amazing actor and a friend.\n\ngarcia-navarro: but he's a white european from spain.\n\ngarcetti: exactly. and so i think, you know, we have so many incredible stories. and because los angeles is half latino now, we have, i think, the opportunity to really make that sort of impact.\n\ngarcia-navarro: lots of people have signed on - j.j. abrams, as you mentioned, eva longoria, the agency caa. how will this work - quotas?\n\ngarcetti: no. i mean, we'd love to see people making commitments to numerical goals and art. we certainly have one, which is to double the number of latinos that are in hollywood as creators and developers. but we have our first five deals. we didn't want to just say, hey, go do this and pound people over the head. there's a finance development deal of a feature script with endeavor content. warner media's 150 has a scripted proof concept deal. shine global, a company here, has a development deal that they committed to for a documentary. and we will just continue making deals. hollywood's all about making deals. we felt that by collaborating and convening and cajoling that government could play a really positive role in making this industry even stronger and, of course, more representative.\n\ngarcia-navarro: you know, at the crux of this, of course, is the persistent, difficult issue of who has power. and in hollywood, that's still white men. what is your pitch about why they need to do something different? i mean, it's not like disney's hurting at the box office.\n\ngarcetti: no. but if you're not looking at what's coming, you're going to be swept away and left behind. and it's not even anymore that our community is growing and coming. it's here. imagine at a time when some people are not going to movie theaters - but latinos are in record numbers - how this can help save the box office. imagine what this could mean for your streaming service if you carve out, you know, a niche that not only speaks to this community but speaks from this community to everybody else. you know, this is an economic decision. you are losing money if you leave people behind.\n\ngarcia-navarro: since we have you on the line, i'd like to ask you this past week, as i'm sure you know, the department of homeland security kicked residents of an entire state, new york, off its global entry program because of new york's so-called immigrant sanctuary laws. president trump is threatening to expand that list. la is a sanctuary city. are you worried?\n\ngarcetti: yeah, it's kind of a crazy time we live in. i remind the white house this is all our country. the president, these are all of your constituents. no matter how they vote every four years, you can't carve states out. i always say come and learn something instead of, you know, weaponizing all of this. but we know it's an old playbook. we know it's a way to speak to a base. but new york is a huge engine of this country. california is as well, just as the, quote, unquote, heartland is. we certainly would never cut out the heart of this country. but it seems like some days the president wants to do that to us.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that was la mayor eric garcetti. thank you very much.\n\ngarcetti: great pleasure to be with you - thanks, lulu.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
terry gross, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm terry gross. one of the most audacious exercises in education reform is how journalist dale russakoff describes the plan to fix the schools in newark, n.j., a city beset by poverty and violence. in 2010, cory booker, who was then mayor of newark and is now a u.s. senator, wanted to create a series of reforms in the newark schools that could serve as a model for other cities.\n\nhe enlisted the support of new jersey governor chris christie and facebook founder mark zuckerberg. zuckerberg donated $100 million with the understanding it would be matched by another 100 million from other sources. the optics were perfect - an african-american democratic mayor, a white republican governor and the cofounder of a social media giant come together to rescue the schools.\n\nrussakoff writes that almost everyone on all sides was well-intentioned, and that makes the failures, as well as the successes, of this five-year experiment important to wrestle with. russakoff chronicles this experiment in school reform in her new book the prize: who's in charge of america's schools. dale russakoff was a reporter for the washington post for 28 years, covering politics, education and social policy.\n\ndale russakoff, welcome to fresh air. can you give us a sense of where you think the newark story fits into the larger story about the education reform movement in america?\n\ndale russakoff: yes. i think this is one city where the ideas of the education reform movement were tried all in one place. cory booker, the mayor of newark, had the idea that just to bring of these ideas to one city and use the extraordinary powers of a governor who controlled that school district and the money from mark zuckerberg of a hundred million dollars to try everything that - as he said, what was working in the school reform movement. so in that view, it was dramatically expanding charter schools, getting rid of teachers whose evaluations found them to be weak, judging other teachers by their test scores and rewarding them and streamlining the management of the school district so that it ran more like a business.\n\ngross: so right from the start, there's a problem. booker and zuckerberg announce this gift of a hundred million dollars to reform the newark schools. they announce it on oprah.\n\nrussakoff: yes.\n\ngross: which is great, but they hadn't told the community yet. so parents and teachers learn about this big reform movement that's about to hit them from oprah's show. how did that play in the community?\n\nrussakoff: well, it played disastrously in the community because, immediately, nobody understood why do we have to turn on oprah at 4 o'clock to find out what's going on in our own city? and if you want to save the schools for the benefit of our children, why weren't we told? and, by the way, there's a very large consensus on the ground in newark at this time that the schools really need change, that the schools are failing in unacceptable ways. and so there wasn't really, you know, a roadmap for how to do that, but there were a lot of people, including some very skilled, experienced teachers, who deeply understood the needs of the children in newark who would have been eager to be part of that conversation. and not only were they insulted that they were left out, there was an agenda that was crafted that didn't have the benefit of their really important insights into what was needed in newark.\n\ngross: so cory booker takes the zuckerberg money and creates a local foundation to handle the zuckerberg gift and the matching donations. it's called foundation for newark's future. but you're right that the seats on this foundation went only to donors who gave $10 million or more. that was later reduced to $5 million or more, which meant that virtually no one from newark could afford to serve on this foundation that was trying to change the newark schools. how did that play in the community?\n\nrussakoff: well, that was again totally alienating of the community because there were a number of local foundations in newark that had been involved for years in education. and, you know, $5 million as an annual gift just was not in their budget. and so they were excluded from having any say, but more importantly, there was no way for the parents, the teachers, the principals, the community leaders - just, you know, really, really intelligence, smart, committed people who had been in the fray for years in the lives of children in education - to be part of this. and so basically, the board decided to spend the money the way the wealthy donors wanted it spent. and the priorities were not about getting money to the classroom or to the children. the priorities were to have to this kind of business model, top-down reform that had become very popular in the reform movement.\n\ngross: one of the criticisms of how the money was handled was that $20 million went to consultants, and a lot of the consultants were paid, like, a thousand dollars a day. and you compare that to what teachers make in a year, and that what was their response to that?\n\nrussakoff: well, that was another case of, like, you know, this enormous gap between the people who have come to save the newark children and the people who actually cared for and taught the newark children. and it became a huge flashpoint because mark zuckerberg had indicated that he wanted to give teachers enormous bonuses if they were the top teachers in the district. and that wasn't possible because the district just didn't have the money to pay those bonuses beyond the time that they would have the zuckerberg money. so there were some merit bonuses put into the contract, but they were relatively small. and the new contract that came out of this reform effort also required teachers in quite a few schools to work longer hours, longer years and to work some weekends for a pretty small stipend that was added to their annual pay. it was $3,000, which they calculated came to about $10 an hour. and they were just - you know, they felt they had been kind of conscripted into working these extra hours and extra days while the people who were in the district, you know, scripting these plans as consultants were getting a thousand dollars a day. and it really became something that turned the teachers - even teachers who wanted - very much wanted change - it turned them against the reform effort.\n\ngross: if you're just joining us my guest is journalist dale russakoff, a former washington post reporter who's written a new book called the prize: who's in charge of america's schools? and it's about the attempts to reform the schools in newark, n.j.\n\nso let's talk about what the plan actually was for reform - the plan that was put into effect by the then-superintendent of schools. and this plan was called one newark. you want to give us an overview of what the plan was?\n\nrussakoff: yes. cami anderson, the superintendent, saw this plan as a way to expand charter schools and stabilize the school district at the same time. this is one of the great challenges of, you know, urban districts where charter schools are expanding rapidly - is, you know, that when children leave the school district and go to charters, the money goes with them, and the school district ends up under tremendous stress. the other huge thing that she did in this was that she created something called universal enrollment.\n\nnewark, throughout all time, had been a city where kids walked to school. there were many small neighborhood schools, and there was no bus system that took kids to school, except in the case of kids with special needs who had to go to special schools. but the average child in newark just walked to a neighborhood school. and the feeling that she had - and this is a strong feeling in the reform movement - is that children and families should have choice. they should be able to choose to leave a failing neighborhood school if they want to.\n\nand so from one newark onward, which started in the fall of 2013, no family automatically was sending a child to a neighborhood school. they had to go online and pick one of 60-something schools in the city - some charter, some district - and then algorithm would sort whether they got into that school. in theory, it's a great idea because everybody wants to be able to choose the right school for their kid, but it was a huge upheaval in the way people had always lived in newark. and at the same time, she was closing, consolidating and rearranging the district schools to make way for the charter school growth and to basically downsize the district, which already had lost a lot of kids to charter schools.\n\nand it turned into a massive upheaval in just the way school was experienced by children and families in newark. and it was done, again, without a process of vetting with the community to see, well, how if, you know - will this new system work for these children and families? when a school is closed, children had to walk through very dangerous territory, you know, sometimes through gang territory, through drug dealing neighborhoods. and none of that was kind of vetted in advance to see what can we do for these kids to make sure they're safe?\n\ngross: something else that didn't work out as planned - mark zuckerberg was hoping to use his hundred million dollars to, in part, negotiate different contracts with teachers to have more flexibility in who got hired and who got fired and who got placed in what school. and then he found out something he didn't know initially, which was the seniority thing was controlled by new jersey law.\n\nrussakoff: yes.\n\ngross: and not by anything you could negotiate with the school district.\n\nrussakoff: yes. he put up - half his money, he said, he wanted to go to reforming teachers' contracts to create this new flexibility and to be able to reward the best teachers and eliminate the worst teachers. but he had - i guess cory booker never made clear to him that seniority protections for the most senior teachers - the way it work is that when there's a downsizing or a layoff, the most senior teachers are protected, and those who have the least seniority go first, regardless of whether the senior teachers are better than the junior teachers who are being left off.\n\nand so those were provisions of state law - the state tenure law in new jersey. that was something that could be controlled by contract. and so the process of trying to get rid of the seniority protections, which was one of his number one priorities, had to go through the new jersey legislature. and the legislature in new jersey is controlled by the teachers' union. the new jersey education association's by far the biggest contributor to members of the legislature.\n\ngross: right. ok. so zuckerberg had no idea what he was getting himself into in terms of that aspect of his - of his goal. so...\n\nrussakoff: yes. i want to point out, though, that chris cerf, who was the - at the time, the state commissioner of education, did negotiate with the legislature a new tenure law that won a lot of new accountability measures from the teachers' union. and the one thing that the teachers' union insisted on was that they would make all these compromises, but they had to leave the seniority protections absolutely intact. and so that was the compromise that christie made. and so the seniority protections became automatically a part of this new contract in newark, which was supposed to be, you know, in the words that the reformers were using, a transformational contract that would become a model for how to reform school districts all across the country, and it was not.\n\ngross: so how far did the newark model get in terms of shutting down failing schools, consolidating schools, starting new charter schools?\n\nrussakoff: well, i think that the most visible thing they did was that they doubled the number of children going to charter schools in newark in just a short period of time. twenty percent of kids were in charters at the time this effort started, and within a year or two, 40 percent of children will be in charters. and in newark, that's an improvement for kids because the charter schools in newark dramatically outperform the district schools, even though statewide, that's not true of charter schools, and nationally, it's not. but newark has, you know, a very superior group of charter schools that are doing, you know, a lot of good work with kids.\n\ngross: so were the charter schools public schools?\n\nrussakoff: yes, yes, these were public schools. and they're just - they're charter schools, so they're not part of the school district. they're independent.\n\ngross: so from what you observed, why is it that the charter schools in newark perform better than the public schools?\n\nrussakoff: well, i think a key reason is that the charter schools get a lot of more money to the classroom and to the school building than the district schools do. district schools, although they get $19,000 to $20,000 per pupil in public funds to spend, get fewer than $10,000 to the district schools for the principals and teachers to spend on educating the kids.\n\nthe charter schools, while starting out with less money, get more of it to the classroom. so they get, like, $12,000 to $13,000 per student. and what they do with that money is really critical because they actually use the resources to support kids who would otherwise have a lot of trouble learning because of the issues that growing up in poverty cause for them. so, you know, there are children who literally - and it's not unusual. children suffer trauma in newark from having grown up amid violence, family strife and constant instability in their homes.\n\nand so when you go into these charter schools - the one that i spent a lot of time in was a kipp elementary school called spark academy. there were two certified teachers in every grade from kindergarten through third. there was also a learning specialist or a tutor for every grade so that children who couldn't learn in the small groups that these two teachers set up for those who were academically behind or just struggling - there would be a learning specialist who would push in and do extra work with them.\n\nthe charter school had three social workers for 520 kids, and they actually had - the school had their time organized so they did therapy. at this particular school, 70 children had therapy every week for different kinds of emotional issues that were interfering with their learning. in the district school, there's one social worker for over 600 kids. and they don't have time to do any therapy because they're just juggling so much, and they have tons of paperwork they're responsible for.\n\nand in addition to that, the charter school had created a position called the dean of student and family engagement, whose job it was to work with children whose issues outside the classroom were making it virtually impossible for them to learn effectively. so this particular dean would find someone in each child's family to be responsible for their learning. if it wasn't a parent or a grandparent, it would be a neighbor. one time, there was a stepfather who had just come out of prison and wanted to have a relationship with his stepson, and they engaged him to be the sort of chief learning officer for that child. and all of these people were there to be present and to support kids who otherwise wouldn't have been able to learn.\n\ngross: if you're just joining us, my guest is journalist dale russakoff, a former washington post reporter who's written a new book called the prize: who's in charge of america's schools? and it's about the attempts to reform the schools in newark, n. j. let's take a short break, and then we'll talk about how this plan worked out. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. and if you're just joining us, my guest is former washington post reporter dale russakoff, who's written a new book, the prize: who's in charge of america's schools? and it's the plan that was put into effect by then-newark mayor cory booker, governor chris christie of new jersey and mark zuckerberg, the founder of facebook, who donated a hundred million dollars to help reform newark's schools. and that was supposed to be matched by a hundred million dollars from other sources.\n\nwhy is it that the charter schools are able to get more money directly to the students and teachers than the district schools are?\n\nrussakoff: i think it's almost like the difference between fedex and the post office. the district schools have a lot of legacy costs, and some of those are just extra jobs and incredibly sweet, fat contracts that, you know, people who were friends of politicians over the years have gotten. and there needs to be some kind of - almost a forensic accounting of where the money in the central office of the school district is going so that more of it gets to the classroom. and i think that charter schools are just an illustration of what that money could be doing if it were spent differently. the problem is, of course, that, you know, you run up into, you know, union protections and civil service protections and political organizations that have a real stake in keeping things the way they are. so it probably sounds naive to say that that needs to happen, but if it doesn't happen, i don't see what the future of school districts is in cities like newark.\n\ngross: so the education reform movement that we've been discussing in newark was initiated by then-mayor cory booker who brought in governor chris christie. and then booker enlisted mark zuckerberg, the founder of facebook, to donate a hundred million dollars. and then the two politicians kind of moved on to other things. cory booker becomes a senator. and you say he hasn't really spoken about the newark reform initiative since becoming a senator. i don't know if that's changed since you completed the book.\n\nrussakoff: no, he hasn't.\n\ngross: ok. governor chris christie got kind of sidetracked by the bridge scandal and then by his campaign for the presidency. so what does that say about politicians' involvement in education reform?\n\nrussakoff: well, it basically shows you that politicians do have their own agendas, and educational reform may be one of them, but other things can supersede. and i think it shows why this really has to be a process that is rooted in the community and has its strong advocates who aren't going anywhere, who are going to stay there and believe in it, year after year, and work for it. it's not something that's going to happen in five years or in, you know - within the term of a mayor or a governor. it's something that's going to take generations and has to be worked at continually.\n\ngross: did you talk to mark zuckerberg about what his takeaway was his first big investment in a philanthropic cause?\n\nrussakoff: you know, he didn't want to say anything critical about what happened. he said that he feels that he learned that change comes more slowly in school districts than he thought it did. he found that charters are a much faster way to change the situation on the ground for children and that districts are slower and take a lot more work and a lot more politics.\n\nbut what's interesting is that he initially had thought that, you know - this is what cory booker had told him and what he banked on - was that in five years, they would have a model for how to turn around a failing school district, how - as booker said, how to flip a city and take it from very, very poor schools and poor performance of children to what he called a model of educational excellence.\n\nand then mark zuckerberg's intent was to go to more and more cities with this model and use his philanthropy to basically solve the urban education crisis. he's not trying to do that anymore, and he's not looking for far away cities with kind of star quality politicians leading them. he's already committed another $120 million, but he's committed it to schools and school districts around the bay area, where he is located, so that he and his staff can know the communities where they're going to be working and, as he said, know the desires of the communities and listen to the parents and the teachers and the educators and the community leaders to understand the complex needs of children. so it's a very, very different and much more humble approach to trying to change education.\n\ngross: my guest is dale russakoff, author of the prize: who's in charge of america's schools? after a short break, we'll talk about the growing education industrial complex. then david bianculli will review last night's emmy award telecast and look ahead to the fall tv season, and kevin whitehead will review the new complete edition of erroll garner's 1955 concert by the sea. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross, back with journalist dale russakoff, author of the prize: who's in charge of america's schools? it's about the five-year experiment to reform the schools in newark, n.j., a city beset by poverty and violence. the experiment was initiated by then-newark mayor cory booker, who enlisted the support of new jersey gov. chris christie and facebook co-founder mark zuckerberg. zuckerberg donated $100 million to the project, which was to be matched by 100 million from other donors. there's, like, a whole new network of, you know, funders, foundations, philanthropic groups and education consultants who are leaders of one part of the education reform movement. you actually use the word education industrial complex to describe some of them. now, i'd like you to talk a little bit about - as you describe it - education industrial complex.\n\nrussakoff: well, you know, interestingly, there's always been an education industrial complex. the education industry is over $600 billion a year in terms of the amount of money that is spent by all the school districts in the country on private contracts and consultants and textbooks and testing. and, you know, it's just - it's a huge, huge business. but what - what i've found interesting about the education reform movement is that they also have their own education industrial complex. so when somebody who's very friendly to the education reform movement becomes a leader of a school district or when a governor, like gov. christie, who's friendly to the education reform movement, is running school districts in the state of new jersey, all of these consultants just suddenly appear. and they're available to do work on, you know, how to help them develop the best, you know, and most reform-oriented teacher evaluation system, the most reform-oriented teacher and principal contracts, the best data system because the data has to be incredibly cleaned in order to use the data to judge everyone in the system and hold them accountable. and so there's all of these consulting firms and businesses, a lot of them founded or staffed by people who started off, say, in teach for america, who worked for some of the more famous reform-oriented superintendents and chancellors like joel klein, michelle rhee. in fact, one of the leaders of this organization called brick, which was kind of the bottom-up group of district teachers who were trying to reform schools just by improving the teaching force - he said that he got so many queries from this group of people that he started calling them the school failure industry, which was, you know, just people who showed up when you had failing schools that were the target of, you know, the education reformers or some of the federal grants that were available for failing schools. there was money in failing schools. and he said there was a school failure industry that was trying to compete for it.\n\ngross: so i'm sure you've been following this, but laurene powell jobs, who was steve jobs' widow, is funding a lot of education reform right now. and what she's trying to do is a kind of crowdsourced education reform. so she's asking teams to submit ideas to her, and then she and a team of judges will pick the best education reform ideas and finance those ideas in the public schools. what do you know about that effort?\n\nrussakoff: you know, i don't know about it in detail. but it sounds like the kind of thing that might be very exciting in the business world to figure out the next big thing. i don't know that, you know, those kinds of ideas are going to actually transcend into real changes in education because there seems to be a sense that everybody knows as much about how to fix schools as teachers do and as educators do. and a lot of these ideas sound to those of us in the layman's world, like, gee, that's fascinating. that's what's wrong. but if you're really close to the ground and you're inside a school, you know that it's not like there is one thing wrong when a school is failing. there's usually, like, 50 to 100, maybe 500 things wrong. and you have to fix all of them, and it's really tedious work. it's not like a big idea and a new thing. it's something that you have to just do slowly and patiently and often tediously.\n\ngross: so with the main part of this experiment ended just in terms of the funding of it, how did the charter schools measure up to the district schools in terms of performance?\n\nrussakoff: well, the newark charter schools dramatically outperformed the district schools, unlike charter schools across the country, which are more on a par with the district schools and in some cases not as good. the newark charter schools do much better for kids, and that is one of the things that they're very proud of that they feel they've done for children in newark.\n\ngross: and do you think that that's largely because their charter schools have more resources?\n\nrussakoff: i think that's a big reason. i mean, the charter schools also do not have as needy a population as the school district, but they still have a very, you know, high percentage of kids with - who get free and reduced-price lunch. and they have more kids now who have special needs, so they are serving a broader population than they used to, although still not the same need level as the district schools.\n\ngross: i'm just wondering this whole accountability movement of, like, testing and collecting data and analyzing data and holding teachers accountable, is that adding a whole new layer of expensive bureaucracy?\n\nrussakoff: yes, it has. i mean, they spent millions - literally millions of dollars on a human resources consulting firm to, you know, get a new teachers evaluation system and teach everybody in the district - you know, principals, department heads, senior teachers - how to use it and how to use it to hold teachers accountable. and the state, which - and, you know, this was an initiative that came straight from the federal government. the race to the top that president obama and arne duncan, the education secretary, put in place encouraged states to change their laws so the teacher evaluations were based increasingly on the student test scores - how students - whether students grew or not on their annual tests would determine whether teachers were rated effective or ineffective. and interestingly, i spent some time interviewing the measurement scientist who developed the system in new jersey for measuring whether students grew or not from year to year on their standardized tests. and the state is using that measure of growth to say whether a teacher is effective or ineffective to some degree. and this measurement scientist said that the system was never intended to judge teachers. it was only intended to measure whether children are growing or not because it doesn't tell you why they're growing or who caused them to grow or why they're failing and who caused them to fail. all it tells you is whether they are progressing or regressing. and the teacher is a factor in that, but there are so many other factors that he said, you know, this is just not the way this data should have been used.\n\ngross: that's especially interesting coming from the guy who created the system...\n\nrussakoff: yes, and he...\n\ngross: ...to collect the data ...\n\nrussakoff: ...and his system\n\ngross: yeah.\n\nrussakoff: yes, and his system is being used in 35 states, i think.\n\ngross: being used to evaluate teachers, right?\n\nrussakoff: yes. yes, it's the growth measurement, how - you know, it measures whether students have grown from year to year on their standardized tests. and this is now the data that's being used to evaluate teachers in more than half the states.\n\ngross: i'm wondering what your takeaway is from the newark education reform attempts in terms of what seems to work and what doesn't. what are some of the lessons learned as far as you're concerned?\n\nrussakoff: you know, the main thing that i am struck by was just by witnessing what this particular charter school was able to do with the extra resources that came into the building and the classroom. the principal of the charter school, who is very proud of their student results because they - you know, they do far outperform the school district - said unequivocally she never would have these results if she didn't have these extra resources. in other words, if she only had the resources to work with that the school district schools had, she couldn't have done this, and her students couldn't have done this. so to me, the biggest takeaway - and again, as i said, it's a huge political enterprise that can't be done easily - but it's to figure out how to get resources to individual schools within school districts to meet the needs of children because they really don't have the resources to meet them now in cities like newark.\n\ngross: so listen, cory booker really made himself available to you. you spent a lot of time talking to him. you spent a lot of time in his suv driving around newark back when he was mayor and was one of the people - people pushing through this education reform plan in the newark schools that we've been discussing. do you think he's sorry that he talked to you? because you've pointed out so many things that didn't work out right, you know, so much conflict that ended up as a result of this plan. he left while it was being implemented 'cause he was elected to the senate.\n\nrussakoff: i - i'm sure that he wishes that he hadn't made himself as available. but i don't think it would've really changed. in fact, i think that the book's helped. and he's helped by, you know, seeing the passion and the - the ability that he has to bring national attention to issues, often issues that other people aren't focusing on, like, you know, inner-city schools and currently, you know, the issue of mass incarceration. i think that what he has an incredible talent for is that - is framing issues and getting the nation to pay attention to them or at least getting a wide audience of people to pay attention to them and to pay attention to him in the process. but what he wasn't strong on was in the patient, tedious, kind of unglamorous work of taking those promises and hammering them out into a different reality. he tended to have -

coronavirus crisis: still dividing americans more than uniting them?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption david goldman/ap david goldman/ap\n\nas the coronavirus shuts down their daily routines, some americans have expressed the hope that the crisis would at last bring us together – or at least restore some sense of a shared national fate.\n\nthat is profoundly to be hoped. public trust is essential in a public health crisis. beyond that, there would be much to be gained by restoring a sense of national purpose.\n\nas president trump himself said monday: if everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we're going to have a big celebration altogether.\n\nbut in this moment, in this crisis, the portents are not good for such unity. so far, the sudden emergence of a killer disease rampaging coast to coast has served less to unite us than to emphasize what divides us.\n\nthis stands in marked contrast to the iconic moments of crisis and national response in our past. the japanese attack on pearl harbor in 1941 transformed the country overnight, converting a predominantly isolationist mood to one of implacable wartime resolve. the achievements that followed made the u.s. the preeminent military, economic and political force in the world for the next 75 years.\n\nthe terror attacks on new york city and near washington, d.c., on sept. 11, 2001, ended years of popular complacency about world affairs and did it in real time as the twin towers of the world trade center melted to the ground on live tv. within hours, members of congress from both parties were standing together on the steps of the capitol singing god bless america. the nation mobilized immediately to meet the foe, even though that foe was hard to see or define.\n\nin between those traumatic touchstones of history, there were other major shocks such as the cuban missile crisis of october 1962. suddenly, americans were on the brink of nuclear confrontation with the soviet union, which was delivering the means to launch nuclear weapons from bases 90 miles from florida. the white house responded, the nation united, and the soviets pulled back.\n\nbut in 2020, confronted by the coronavirus, our national spirit of shared challenge and commitment has been uneven, at best. to be sure, many responsible leaders in the public sector have been stepping up, closing schools and other government functions. many in the private sector are also voluntarily taking steps to mitigate risk. this includes many businesses and the major professional sports and the collegiate athletic programs as well. it includes many private colleges and universities, theaters and churches, and civic groups of various kinds.\n\npolling reveals divisions\n\nbut is everyone on the same page? far from it. among the surprising revelations in recent days is the persistence of popular denial regarding the crisis itself. as of march 15, the latest nbc/wall street journal poll found only a bare majority of americans (53%) are worried the virus could infect someone in their family.\n\nthe npr/pbs newshour/marist poll this week found the percentage of those taking the threat of coronavirus seriously had actually declined since february among republicans and political independents.\n\nin the nbc-wall street journal poll, only about one quarter of republicans say they think the virus will affect their lives in a major way. only about 30% said they would stop attending large public gatherings, despite frequent warnings.\n\n(the nbc-wsj poll was taken before the centers for disease control and prevention asked for a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people for eight weeks, and the npr/pbs/marist poll was completed before trump said people should avoid gatherings of 10 or more for 15 days.)\n\nwhen talking to conservatives and those generally who lean to the right, we often hear that the threat is being exaggerated by the mainstream news media. on tuesday, the morning after the new guidelines were issued from the white house, the website conservative hq ran the headline fake news kills over a post by adam guillette, president of accuracy in media.\n\nthe mainstream media is desperate to turn the coronavirus scare into president donald trump's hurricane katrina, wrote guillette. it means they're motivated to overhype this story.\n\npresident george w. bush's response to the 2005 storm has been widely criticized.\n\nan echo chamber\n\nto some degree, this reflects what the nation was hearing in february and early march from the president. initially, he cast it as china's problem and added the chinese were handling it well. as recently as feb. 28, he was telling a rally crowd in south carolina that the media were over-dramatizing the danger, calling that treatment the latest liberal media hoax. (the next day, he explained that he had not meant to call the virus itself a hoax.)\n\nthose themes have been echoed and amplified on countless media platforms that regularly support the president. on fox and friends last friday, viewers saw jerry falwell jr., the president of the evangelical liberty university founded by his televangelist father, explaining why his school would stay open when so many others were sending students home. falwell wondered whether it was all a conspiracy between china and north korea, then he turned his fire on the media, saying: it's just strange to me how many are overreacting. it makes you wonder if there's a political reason ... their next attempt to get trump.\n\nwith trump himself having joined the health professionals in his administration in acknowledging the reality of the crisis (it could be really bad), a sea change may be coming among his followers. on tuesday, falwell decided that liberty would close after all.\n\nbut the long resistance to the facts, and scope, and the insistence on blaming others has so far prevented this president from turning the crisis into a consensus-building opportunity for himself. pearl harbor carried president franklin delano roosevelt to new heights of national support, despite his controversial pursuit of a third term. in the cuban missile crisis, john f. kennedy found the zenith of his brief presidency. and in 2001, george w. bush saw his gallup poll approval soar above 90% in the days after the horrors of sept. 11.\n\na political football\n\ntrump's performance in the latest crisis has, by contrast, inflamed his critics and once again tested the loyalty of his supporters. to date, the latter have held firm. that was why many evangelical leaders over the weekend rallied to his side and generally continued their church services even as many in other denominations were moving theirs online.\n\nthat viewpoint suggests that the populist inclination to cast certain kinds of experts as an elite and to regard science as a challenge to tradition and belief is insulating or even isolating many americans. millions seem unconvinced that this disease is as widespread or as virulent as reported – even when those reports from respected government officials such as dr. anthony fauci of the national institutes of health.\n\nas a result, the presence of a new and deadly pathogen in our midst was for many days downgraded to the status of a political football. it was subjected to partisan interpretation and polarized reaction, much like any other controversial issue or personality. it has spurred the latest surge of hyperpartisan charges and countercharges on cable tv news shows and in the tar pits of twitter and other social media.\n\nwhy is this so? as in the past, the threat clearly comes from outside our own borders. but this attack is not military, and because it has manifested itself around the world, it can hardly be said to be targeting the u.s. in particular. the usual sense of us vs. them is missing.\n\nthe attacker in this case, a virus, is not great and imposing but small, microscopic – indeed, invisible. we don't know which way to strike back, which may be one reason many are reluctant to believe the attack itself is real.\n\nbeyond that, the changes that have overtaken our communications, our social interactions and our political conversation have greatly complicated the process of information sharing. in the time of the 1918 spanish flu epidemic, the fundamental difficulty was getting even a basic message to a population that had no general system of electronic communication at all. roughly half of all americans still lived in rural areas a century ago, and the idea of hourly or even daily bulletins was utterly unknown.\n\ninformation overload\n\ntoday our problem may well be the opposite. we have bulletins every minute. we have near-constant communication on 24-hour news outlets and endless torrents of individual observation on social media. in this welter of competing sources, who is to say which source can be trusted?\n\nmost people have long since constructed their own method for sorting through it all, and they are most likely to rely on that highly personal mechanism when deciding what to think and how to react to a crisis.\n\nit does not help, of course, that 2020 is also a political year in which we have elections for president, congress, and other offices. political awareness is everywhere; political antennae are extended to the max. everything that happens is instantly interpreted for its prospective election impact.\n\nthat said, the key factor in the division between attitudes over coronavirus would still appear to be the attitude of the president. in similar moments in the past, the role of the president has been regarded as reflecting a national consensus.\n\nthat is not to say the actions of past presidents have been without controversy. there were those who questioned roosevelt's handling of the japanese prior to pearl harbor, even suggesting he lured them into an attack so as to precipitate american entry into world war ii. this viewpoint still has its adherents today.\n\nsimilarly, there were those who faulted bush's reaction to the sept. 11 attacks, especially his channeling of the resulting political anger toward iraq, which he invaded 18 months later. some also questioned whether the sept. 11 attacks had even happened as reported, suggesting the damage was far greater than three airplanes could have caused. this fringe group of dissenters, known as truthers, never gained much traction in the national conversation.\n\nbut what trump faces today is a far more generalized sense that the government has been slow to respond even in the face of an obvious danger. indeed, the npr/pbs/marist poll found more americans disapprove of the president's handling of the pandemic than approve by a 49%-44% margin.\n\nthe simple truth in this instance is clearer now than ever: the danger of coronavirus was never a creation of the president's critics, nor had it been imagined by the current and former members of the administration who had been sounding the alarm. it was real all along, and remains so today.
u.s. supreme court decides 3 cases involving race\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption uncredited/ap uncredited/ap\n\nthe u.s. supreme court has ruled that a georgia man sentenced to death is entitled to a new trial because prosecutors deliberately excluded all african americans from the jury based on their race. the 7-to-1 ruling was one of three high court decisions issued monday involving racial discrimination.\n\nin announcing the jury selection decision, chief justice john roberts used unusually harsh words to describe the prosecutors' conduct. he labelled their proffered non-racial justifications for excluding all the black prospective jurors nonsense, and not true.\n\nthe decision came in the case of timothy foster, a black man sentenced to death for murdering an elderly white woman. the trial was nearly 30 years ago and just a year after the supreme court had dealt for the first time with one of the key elements of the american jury system — the practice of allowing each side to eliminate a set number of prospective jurors without giving any reason.\n\nthese are called peremptory strikes, and in 1986, the court faced up to the fact that they can sometimes mask racial discrimination. the justices ruled that if minorities are disproportionately excluded from a jury panel, the prosecution has to justify its peremptory strikes with non-racial explanations.\n\nin foster's case, the trial judge and every appellate court thereafter accepted those explanations but the supreme court said monday they were, in effect, a charade.\n\nthe prosecution's jury file, which the defense finally obtained in 2006, showed that the name of every black prospective juror was labelled with a b, and highlighted in green. the black jurors were rated against each other in case it comes down to having to pick one.\n\nas to the reasons prosecutors gave for striking black jurors, the court said they cannot be credited, because white jurors with the same characteristics were accepted for the jury.\n\nfor example, the prosecution claimed that it struck marilyn garrett because she was divorced, and at age 34 was too young to serve in a case involving an 18-year-old defendant. but three out of four divorced white prospective jurors were allowed to serve, as were eight white jurors under the age of 36.\n\nsimilarly, the prosecution struck prospective juror eddie hood because his son was the same age as the defendant. but the prosecution allowed white jurors with teenage sons to serve. when called on that, the prosecution shifted its focus to hood's son, claiming he had been convicted of a similar crime — a claim the chief justice scoffed at, noting that hood's son had been convicted five years earlier of stealing four hub caps.\n\nin the end, the court concluded that the shifting explanations, misrepresentations of the record, and the persistent focus on race . . . in the prosecution's file demonstrated an unconstitutional and concerted effort to keep black prospective jurors off the jury.\n\nthe decision was a relief to defense lawyers and some prosecutors, among them larry thompson, who served as deputy attorney general in the george w. bush administration, and before that as the chief federal prosecutor in atlanta.\n\nwhat makes this case so important is that the supreme court clearly decided not to weaken the [current] standard, thompson said. and i think it will make it more difficult for prosecutors to engage in the kind of blatant and purposeful racial discrimination as the prosecutors did in this case.\n\nbut the court's decision did nothing to plow new ground to prevent more subtle or covert racial discrimination in jury selection. indeed, the chief justice noted in his opinion announcement that it is rare to have such explicit evidence of race discrimination as existed in the foster case.\n\nfederal judge mark bennett, who has written and lectured widely about implicit bias among juries, said he had hoped the court would take more affirmative steps to prevent biased jury selection — such as requiring prosecutors to prove by clear and convincing proof that there were legitimate non-racial reasons for striking qualified minority jurors. the current system, is not very helpful in the real world, he said in a telephone interview with npr, because the judge has to call the prosecutor a liar in order to force any change. bennett, like others, also said he believes that there are inherent problems with the whole system of peremptory strikes.\n\nharvard law professor charles nesson, an expert on jury selection, says peremptory strikes invite discrimination.\n\nstriking a qualified juror by saying sorry, you're gone, is an insult, and yet, it's perfectly tolerated, nesson said.\n\nindeed, studies have shown that exclusion of black citizens from juries is still a problem.\n\na study of death penalty juries in houston county, ala., showed that 80 percent of qualified black jurors were struck; the result was that in a 27 percent black county, half the death penalty juries were all white. another study in north carolina found that from 1990 to 2010, prosecutors excluded black jurors twice as often a non-black jurors.\n\njury reform advocates note that conversely, studies have shown that interracial juries make fewer factual errors and deliberate longer.\n\nthere was just one dissenter in monday's jury selection decision: clarence thomas, the court's only african american justice. he said that in his view, the reasons given for the peremptory strikes were credible.\n\nthe two other decisions released by the court on monday also had racial components, but the decisions focused on adjacent issues.\n\nin one case, the court dealt with the charge of racial gerrymandering in virginia. minority voters claimed that the redistricting initially enacted by the republican-controlled state legislature had diluted their votes by packing them into one district. they won in the lower court; the state of virginia declined to appeal, so three members of the u.s. house of representatives appealed to the supreme court instead. the court, however, threw out the challenge, ruling unanimously that the house members had no legal standing to sue. in an opinion written by justice stephen breyer, the court said there was no evidence that the house members had suffered any injury.\n\nthe decision leaves in place the lower court ruling and a redistricting map that spreads minority voters over more congressional districts, allowing these voters greater influence in more areas.\n\nfinally, in an employment discrimination case, the court made it easier for federal employees to file employment discrimination claims. the postmaster of englewood, colo., filed a lawsuit claiming that he was the victim of illegal retaliation after he complained about being denied a promotion based on his race. he claimed that he was transferred to wyoming as punishment for his discrimination complaint. because the new job was 300 miles away and paid less, he retired.\n\nhe claimed, in essence, that the reassignment was so severe that it left him little choice and that he had been, in legalese, constructively discharged. the postal service said he had waited too long to sue, but the supreme court ruled in his favor by a 7-to-1 vote, declaring that his suit was filed in a timely fashion. the court said the clock on such lawsuits does not start ticking until the employee resigns. again, justice thomas was the lone dissenter.
president maduro under pressure as several countries back venezuela's opposition leader\n\nvenezuelans came out by the hundreds of thousands to ask for a change of leadership. but since the opposition leader has named himself interim president, president maduro remains in power. what now?\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\none thing's clear about the political crisis in venezuela. nicolas maduro is still in power despite a multipronged campaign, led by the u.s., to drive him out. yesterday, secretary of state mike pompeo addressed the u.n. security council, asking them to act.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nmike pompeo: time is now to support the venezuelan people, to recognize the new democratic government led by interim president guaido, and end this nightmare. no excuses.\n\ngarcia-navarro: several european countries yesterday gave maduro an ultimatum - call new elections within a week, or we'll recognize the opposition leader juan guaido as president. maduro, in an interview broadcast this morning, rejected that demand. it's been four days since guaido declared himself venezuela's interim president before a vast crowd of supporters. yet the actual levers of power remain with maduro and the ruling socialist party. joining me now is npr's philip reeves, who is in caracas. good morning.\n\nphilip reeves, byline: good morning.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so, phil, are cracks beginning to appear?\n\nreeves: yes, a few. one, his military attache in washington, d.c., has defected to juan guaido. secondly, maduro's climbed down from his decision to expel u.s. diplomats after severing diplomatic ties with d.c. he had given them until this weekend to go. he's now suspended that order for 30 days for both sides to work out what the future relationship is going to be. and three, he's talking about negotiations, although the opposition don't appear to be at all interested in that because they don't recognize him. and they want him to leave.\n\ngarcia-navarro: well, what does the man at the center of this, juan guaido, do next?\n\nreeves: he's piling on the pressure, taking his campaign to the streets, promising a week of mass demonstrations next week. he's doing so at the risk of arrest. and he's appeared in person at a couple of rallies since that huge gathering in caracas on wednesday where he swore himself in as interim president. yesterday, he showed up at quite a small gathering - a couple of thousand people, mostly middle-class - and didn't stay long. he repeated his offer of amnesty to security forces and the - and to civil servants who want to abandon maduro. and when you talk to his supporters, they do seem convinced that he will eventually win this battle. this is jose carvajal.\n\njose carvajal: i think this is our time. change comes from leadership. and at this moment, we are gifted with some guys - very young guys that are bringing wisdom to our leadership. after a long time, we are having that.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so a voice of hope there. but you've been out on the streets. what are other people saying?\n\nreeves: well, to get a sense of that, i dropped into a market in east caracas. it's an upscale part of town where they actually have food, unlike much of this country. and i started talking to people there about what they think is now actually happening in their nation after years of hyperinflation and hunger and medical shortages and economic collapse. and i met maria sanchez, who was doing her family shopping.\n\nmaria sanchez: for the first time, people from the east and from the west know that this is a correct time.\n\nreeves: of this city, you mean?\n\nsanchez: yes, of this country.\n\nreeves: what's changed things? is it juan guaido? is it...\n\nsanchez: yes.\n\nreeves: ...international support?\n\nsanchez: he's a new politician. he's fresh. he's not polluted. i think he's very honest on what he's doing.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so what about maduro's supporters, of which he has a few?\n\nreeves: indeed. and if you drive around caracas, you still see groups of chavistas - that's his supporters and the supporters of the socialist party - in their red baseball hats and t-shirts. maduro's main platform is state-run tv. and yesterday, the tv was flooded with propaganda about the - that u.n. security council meeting that you mentioned in new york where secretary of state mike pompeo urged nations to turn against maduro and to financially disconnect themselves from the maduro government, a remark aimed at china and turkey and also russia, which, at that meeting, accused washington of attempting a coup. now, that meeting has been seized upon by maduro, who appeared on tv yesterday at a rather eccentric performance in which he sang at one point. and he portrayed yesterday's u.n. security council meeting as a triumph for venezuela.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npresident nicolas maduro: (speaking spanish).\n\nreeves: so as you can see, maduro's still very defiant.\n\ngarcia-navarro: phil reeves in caracas, venezuela. and we'll be following this story throughout the day. thank you so much.\n\nreeves: you're welcome.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
npr's interim news chief looks ahead at 2018\n\nnpr's news operation is a team effort. but a newsroom can't abruptly lose its leader — as npr did in november when michael oreskes resigned under pressure amid allegations of sexual harassment — and expect to bounce back quickly or easily. more disruption could be on the way, as well, given that npr has announced internally that it will search for a new newsroom head, who — unless she or he is already at npr — will likely come with his or her own priorities and vision.\n\nchristopher turpin is in the challenging position of overseeing this interlude period. a 17-year npr veteran, he has been there before, as interim head of npr's newsroom for a stint in 2014-15. when oreskes, formerly of the associated press, was named to the top post, turpin was named his deputy. he took the top spot again after oreskes was pushed out. i have been impressed at how quickly he and his colleagues have moved to regroup, even as uncertainty looms.\n\ni asked turpin to walk me (as a proxy for listeners) through his priorities for the year ahead. he started with reporting priorities: we want to focus on trying to do more high-impact reporting, more unduplicated reporting. in other words, break stories and commit resources to journalistic endeavors such as investigative and enterprise reporting. the latter involves a broad range of reporting, including digging beneath the surface of the daily news and looking for developments and trends that deserve greater public attention.\n\nthat idea has been discussed internally for some time; i (and others) wished for more such reporting during the 2016 presidential campaign, since npr certainly has the reporting and editing capability to do high-impact work. but it's an ambitious goal, as turpin quickly acknowledged; the newsroom, like others, continues to maintain a punishing schedule just keeping up with the relentless number of stories coming out of washington.\n\nturpin called the newsroom staff of about 375 people (that compares to approximately 1,300 at the new york times) overstretched and arguably under-resourced for what we're doing. it's a little miracle every day that we put out the coverage that we put out. the natural response is, where's the time and space to do that, when we're also having to focus on this firestorm of breaking news every single day that i also believe we have to keep pushing on. we can't let that go in order to do enterprise reporting.\n\nthe shift has already proven doable, he said. last week, npr put forth, among other stories, a major investigative series on sexual assault of people with intellectual disabilities, a report on why states are worried about changes to 529 college savings plans, and a thoughtful piece on if and how sexual harassers find redemption. all that while covering the fight over the daca program, the revocation of temporary protective status for el salvador, and the uproar over reports of the president's profanity when discussing which immigrants should be allowed to enter the u.s.\n\nnpr is already bulking up on staff to cover washington. it announced just after the new year that asma khalid would return to npr to cover the political impact of america's changing demographics, and tim mak, formerly of the daily beast, would join npr to cover movement conservatism, among other topics.\n\nnpr is also in the process of hiring a fourth white house correspondent, which is twice as many as the company assigned to cover most previous presidents. the team investigating russia's alleged interference in u.s. elections will remain in place at least through the first quarter and most likely beyond, depending on the news.\n\none particular area of focus will be election security. it's an area that plays to our strengths, and the strengths of member stations, and we have people in states who can look at this and cover it, turpin said, adding, that it feels very true to our mission to be looking at the safety and security of our election process. that has a kind of public service mission to it.\n\nbut to make room for the enterprise reporting, he said, we're also going to have to make some smart decisions about what we stop doing. he did not elaborate, partly because those newsroom conversations are just starting.\n\nbut he did say: it's about every desk, every show, every platform thinking about what are the really essential stories that they need to be telling, what are the stories we need to be focusing on and what editorially can we leave behind and not do. where do we want to be more efficient about aggregating and using material from other people and other organizations that will save our own reporters time that could be more valuably spent doing the kind of original work we want to put more value on. that could mean, for example, interviewing reporters from other news organizations when they break a big story rather than trying to match that story in-house.\n\nas an aside, listeners will also likely hear more about it when npr does produce work that deserves attention, he said, as it focuses on better promotion. in the past, he said, npr would, say, put something out on morning edition, it goes out into the world and then it's gone. going forward, he said, npr wants to make sure reporting it is proud of reaches the widest possible audience.\n\na second priority, turpin said, is to continue work that began in earnest last year to make greater use of the public radio network by more closely tying local stations to the national newsroom through a series of regional reporting hubs. the first is expected to launch in march, with another two coming later in the year. if it works, he said, the initiative will improve local, regional and national journalism. (there are major challenges to this work, as npr and the stations work on common editorial standards to guide their work. i'll have more on that initiative in an upcoming column, but turpin acknowledged, it's not going to be easy.)\n\nthe coming year will also be one of further evolution in npr's tone, with the early january retirement of robert siegel, one of the baby boomers who built npr. robert's retirement puts the point that we're at a moment of generational transition at npr, turpin said. we live in a less formal age and we need to reflect that, while still maintaining journalistic quality. specifically, he has been working to infuse the newsmagazines with some of the energy and dynamism that's come out of podcasting, but without changing them so fundamentally that they are unrecognizable to people.\n\none specific change that could be coming: npr is talking to its member stations about making another round of changes to the morning edition clock, the minute-by-minute formatting that determines how long stories run, the timing of newscasts and promotions and when local stations can add their own news. the last change to the clock in november 2014 led to many listener complaints that stories are now too short, and that the hosts must constantly cut off live interviews. at the moment, he said, npr is soliciting feedback from stations about possible changes, but i am encouraged that clock changes might be forthcoming.\n\nfinally, in a reference to the internal conversations that were convened following the ouster of oreskes, turpin said, we need to make sure that the newsroom comes out stronger from the mishegoss of the last few months. we need to really re-evaluate the culture. we need to think about what that means for the newsroom. and what that looks like.\n\nspecifically, he said, announcements are coming soon about npr's use of temporary employees, who have been a mainstay of the newsroom for years. he said, a) there were too many of them and b) we weren't doing a very good job of looking after them and making sure they were integrated into the organization. we're going to announce some steps very soon around that which will include better training, and possibly evaluation systems so they know where they stand and what they need to work on so they don't feel that they're just wandering around the building without ever getting any feedback. additionally, npr is looking at whether it should make some of the temporary positions into full-time staff jobs, he said.\n\nmore broadly, turpin said, discussions that started around sexual harassment in the newsroom also turned up wider questions about how we treat each other. it's about civility, it's about what's acceptable behavior in the newsroom. i think we want to make sure we have a civil and respectful work place, and i think we need to work out what our baselines are and what's acceptable and what's not. i think it's clear that we don't have as strong a sense of shared values around civility and around what's acceptable as i think we might have thought that we did, and we clearly need to work at that.\n\nhe added, i'll be blunt about this as a longtime manager: we need to be a better managed company. all of us who are managers need to better understand what our responsibilities are and we're committed to working at that. it would be a terrible tragedy if we get to the end of next year and we don't feel universally in every corner of the newsroom and every strata of the newsroom and beyond that we don't feel we are collectively better, healthier, happier place.\n\nall that said, turpin clarified that he didn't want to overstate the discord. we have a wonderful culture; people come here and they stay. i joke that i've been here 17 years and i'm still regarded as a newcomer. but i think this has been a wake-up call that we can't take it for granted.\n\nwhy do those issues matter to listeners and readers? they speak to npr's ability to recruit and retain the best employees, and to reduce staff turnover. stability, it seems to me, is one key to maintaining high journalistic standards. turpin said: we want to make sure this is a place people really want to work at, we want to retain really great talent, and we want to be seen as a model workplace.\n\nturpin also shared some thoughts about a related issue, newsroom diversity, which i will include in an upcoming column on the topic.
at n.h. rally ahead of iowa, biden makes appeal to voters' morality\n\non the campaign trail in iowa, many voters seem to care more about the former vice president's one-on-one interactions than the content of his speeches.\n\ndavid folkenflik, host:\n\njoe biden has been campaigning for one political office or another for decades. the former vice president is, perhaps, the most seasoned politician running for president this year, and that's obvious at his rallies. npr's asma khalid has been following biden on his campaign trail and shares this report.\n\nasma khalid, byline: joe biden's events don't have the electric vibe of a rock concert you might see from some of his progressive rivals. the crowds are more orderly and elderly.\n\nunidentified person #1: oh, pardon me, folks. you guys all signed in?\n\nunidentified person #2: we're following her.\n\nunidentified person #1: oh, beautiful. ok. no, you're good to go. how's it going, sir?\n\nkhalid: but his supporters are still excited to see him. before heading to iowa for the final sprint, he was here in salem, n.h. dozens of people are lined up in the cold - voters from new hampshire and quite a few from just across the state line in massachusetts, some with their dunkin' donuts coffee in hand as they waited to enter a local elementary school gym. one of them was maryann bradley from neighboring massachusetts.\n\nmaryann bradley: i think he wants to unite the country, and i think we need that right now. i think we need someone who can bring everybody together. and i think he has a tremendous amount of experience, more than anybody else.\n\nkhalid: maryann and her husband tom are fans of their home state senator, elizabeth warren. but their decision is not just about who they like.\n\nbradley: i think that joe biden has a better chance of beating trump. i really do. i don't think people will vote for her.\n\nkhalid: it's about pragmatism. and that's a common theme at biden rallies. i bypass the clipboards and stickers and the line of voters signing up for biden campaign updates, and i make my way inside.\n\nunidentified person #3: you're with the press, then? ok. come on in. come on in here.\n\nkhalid: ok. thank you.\n\nunidentified person #3: just - ok. we have some of the press coming through.\n\nunidentified person #4: ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the pledge of allegiance.\n\nkhalid: one common ritual at biden rallies is the pledge. it's not a tradition for all democrats.\n\nunidentified group: i pledge allegiance to the flag...\n\nkhalid: after the pledge, supporters of biden, people who are well-known in new hampshire politics, get up to talk about why they support the former vice president. and then it's time for the candidate.\n\n(soundbite of song, we take care of our own)\n\nbruce springsteen: (singing) we take care of our own.\n\nkhalid: biden strolls through an overflow crowd, shaking hands and flashing smiles as bruce springsteen's song we take care of our own plays on loudspeakers. it's a song barack obama used during his 2012 reelection.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\njoe biden: hello. hello. hello.\n\nkhalid: biden takes the mic out of the podium stand so he can roam around the room as he talks. there's no stage. he's in the middle - people on chairs all around him. it's one of the more intimate setups you see on the campaign trail. biden warns the crowd that there has never been a more consequential election in recent history.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbiden: four years of donald trump, as my grandfather finnegan would say - the grace of god and the goodwill of neighbors - can go down in history as a aberration in political history of america. but eight years...\n\n(applause)\n\nbiden: but eight years of donald trump, i honest to god believe will change the character of the nation.\n\nkhalid: biden often quotes his grandpa. it's one of his so-called bidenisms (ph). you might not hear them all in every speech, but they are his trademark way of conveying earnestness.\n\n(soundbite of montage)\n\nbiden: my lord.\n\nhere's the deal.\n\nbut all kidding aside...\n\nnot a joke, not a joke.\n\ni promise you. i promise you.\n\nkhalid: biden's campaign speech is about character, country and unity. it's about aspiring to a better time. he doesn't mention his democratic rivals by name. biden mostly talks about president trump as if he's the only opponent. he is the former vice president. and he readily mentions barack obama's name, plus his own experience on health care, foreign policy and gun control. but more than policy, his speech is an appeal to morality.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbiden: i understand this new republican party. they've gone after me, telling lies about me, my surviving son. they've gone after him. they've gone after my whole family. so i get them. i understand them. but guess what? a president has to be willing to fight but also has to be willing to unite. he has to be able to heal.\n\nkhalid: biden spoke for about a half an hour. he doesn't always stick to the script and meanders around. he took no questions from the crowd and no questions from the press. a major part of his appeal to voters, though, is not actually what he says in his speeches but the one-on-one interactions he has with them afterwards - the hugs, photos and the bits of conversation.\n\nbiden: what's your name?\n\nbruce: bruce, with my daughter gabrielle.\n\ngabrielle: hi.\n\nbiden: hi, gabrielle. how are you?\n\njoan mercier: he's just so believable. i love him.\n\nkhalid: that last voice is joan mercier.\n\nwas there anybody else you had been considering?\n\nmercier: well, i did like buttigieg. i'm not - i'm more towards joe biden, though, because of his age and his wisdom and his - the fact that he's been a vice president.\n\nkhalid: she says the country needs someone who can quickly clean up trump's mess and doesn't need on-the-job training. biden's age, she feels, could be an asset. but there are plenty of democrats who worry that age is his liability. some say his events are underwhelming and remind them of hillary clinton, which worries them.\n\nfor jim battis, this was his second time hearing joe biden in person.\n\njim battis: to be quite honest, i had seen him once before, and he looked old.\n\nkhalid: battis said biden impressed him more this time.\n\nbattis: here, he seems invigorated and has a reason to run, not just, i'm here because everybody expects me to be here.\n\nkhalid: what gives you any hesitation with biden?\n\nbattis: it's still his age. i don't know. maybe that's age bias on my part.\n\nkhalid: battis is 72, and he's not sure someone in their 70s has the energy to be president.\n\nasma khalid, npr news.\n\n(soundbite of huntertones' fara)\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
former energy secretary weighs in on green new deal legislation\n\nnpr's ari shapiro speaks with ernest moniz, president and ceo of energy futures initiative, about the green new deal, and his goal of limiting global temperature increases to two degrees celsius.\n\nari shapiro, host:\n\nwell, to talk about the future of clean energy in the u.s., we're joined now by ernest moniz. he was president obama's energy secretary, and today he testified before a senate committee. welcome to all things considered.\n\nernest moniz: pleasure to be back here.\n\nshapiro: let's start with that green new deal that we were just hearing about. it calls for eliminating the u.s. carbon footprint by 2030, just over 10 years from now. does that goal seem attainable to you?\n\nmoniz: well, let me first preface my response by saying that a green new deal, which to me means both pursuing very low carbon and social equity, is exactly what we have to do. now, when we come to the green new deal, i'm afraid i just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in the 10-year timeframe. it's just impractical. and if we start putting out impractical targets, we may lose a lot of key constituencies who we need to bring along to have a real low-carbon solution on the most rapid timeframe that we can achieve.\n\nshapiro: what are those constituencies that you're afraid might be driven away by this?\n\nmoniz: well, the labor unions who i think are very much aligned with the idea of low carbon but also understand we cannot strand too many assets and, frankly, strand too many workers with impractical, unrealizable objectives. we will jeopardize what has been, i think, the very significant movement of the large energy companies towards developing their new business models to function in a low-carbon world.\n\nshapiro: you know, you and i spoke at the paris climate summit more than three years ago when you were energy secretary. and back then, this is what you told me.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nmoniz: overwhelmingly the countries of the world and the u.s. population is moving towards a clear commitment to the idea that we need to act.\n\nshapiro: that was a real moment of optimism, and now the u.s. is pulling out of the paris climate accords. american carbon emissions rose last year after a three-year decline. the trends that made you so optimistic when we spoke in paris really no longer seem to be true.\n\nmoniz: well, actually, first of all, let me say i stand by that paris statement. i believe it's true, and the recent polls show that there is increasing understanding and acceptance in the public both about the realities of climate change and about the need to address it. now, in reality, you're absolutely right. but i think the trend remains and will remain going towards lower carbon. the problem is that we were not then and we are not now working on a sufficiently accelerated path to low carbon to meet the 2 degrees, let alone the substantially less-than-2-degree, goal.\n\nshapiro: you're talking about limiting global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees celsius.\n\nmoniz: exactly. and of course we are already about 1 degree on the path to that 2 degrees. so there's no doubt we have to pick up the pace. and there are some elements of optimism here. first is that the states which have been the leaders in driving low carbon continue to do so - and in fact cities as well. secondly, starting right after president trump's announcement on the paris agreement, the reality is an enormous part of the business community came forward and said, we're staying the course. and we've seen, if anything, a pickup in that commitment in the last years. we are seeing the oil companies, the big utilities all going in this direction.\n\nshapiro: is all of that enough to fill the hole left behind when the federal government says, this is no longer a priority for us?\n\nmoniz: the federal government not doing its full share of the effort obviously is an issue. the reality is in this administration, the united states is not exercising the global leadership that we need to bring the whole world along. but we continue to make progress despite the increase last year with leadership from the states and the business community taking us at least in the direction we want to go.\n\nshapiro: you know, often when congress holds hearings about renewables or clean energy, we hear republicans question the premise that cutting carbon emissions is important or questioning the science of climate change. how much of that did you experience in your testimony on the hill today?\n\nmoniz: none. there were members from each party, and the entire hearing was about everybody buying in, if you like, to the idea that we are going to low carbon. how do we get there in ways that are economic and also that do not cause unnecessary, at least, disruptions in a variety of communities?\n\nshapiro: former energy secretary ernest moniz, now president and ceo of the energy futures initiative, thanks for speaking with us today.\n\nmoniz: thank you, ari.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
with economy stuck in the mud, farmers sink deeper into debt\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption grant gerlock/harvest public media grant gerlock/harvest public media\n\nat the lee valley consignment sale near tekamah, neb., dozens of used tractors, planters and other equipment were on the auction block for farmers trying to save a few extra dollars. it was a muddy day, with trucks and four-wheelers leaving deep black ruts — fitting conditions for an industry wallowing in bad news.\n\namanda johnson is hoping to buy some used fence posts. she and her husband, matt, raise cattle and crops near scribner, neb. making money looks tough for them this year. it really depends on markets, johnson says. i'd say even if you can break even, that's doing pretty good.\n\nthe u.s. department of agriculture expects farm income to fall for the third year in a row. at the same time, farmers are borrowing billions from banks to get by. to make ends meet, some farmers are giving up leases on farmland they can't afford and selling equipment they don't need.\n\nthe change in farm fortune follows a drop in prices for corn and soybeans, the top midwest crops. supply and demand are both working against the commodity markets. farmers have raised an oversupply of grain, while at the same time, the slow global economy has brought down demand.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption grant gerlock/harvest public media grant gerlock/harvest public media\n\ncolten josoff, 23, is supplementing his income with a full-time, off-farm job.\n\ni would love to farm full time, but you still got to pay your bills, josoff says. if you got to go get a job at mcdonald's to pay 'em, that's just what you've got to do.\n\nonly 44 percent of farmers called agriculture their primary occupation in the most recent census by the usda. small producers, especially, rely on outside income. but economists expect farmers of larger operations to look for extra work in order to stay in the black.\n\nand with less income coming from the land, kansas city federal reserve economist nathan kauffman says farmers are borrowing more to keep their farms afloat.\n\nwe're continuing to see pretty strong demand for farm loans, kauffman says. that's primarily reflecting strong demand for short-term cash flow.\n\nfarmers are burning through the cash they stashed away during the good times, kauffman says. now, they're forced to borrow to pay for essentials like seed and fertilizer.\n\nas a result, farm debt is projected to pass $372 billion this year. adjusting for inflation, that's the most farm debt since the late 1970s, when the rural economy began to melt down. but kauffman says today's numbers are not a sign of history repeating.\n\none big difference is interest rates, which remain near historic lows, rather than at the historic highs of the 1970s. that makes it less expensive for farmers to take on debt.\n\nalso, land prices have not collapsed. the latest reports from federal reserve offices in the midwest show most land values declined by a few percentage points during the final months of 2015, but some ranchland is actually gaining value.\n\nthe fact that farmland values are holding up pretty well — and farmland as an asset is by far the biggest portion of the balance sheet — means debt-to-asset ratios aren't rising too much, kauffman says. those values have stayed strong.\n\nthe debt-to-asset ratio is a kind of barometer for farm finances. if a farmer's land is still valuable, parts of it can be sold to pay off debts, and the default risk is low. right now, the debt-to-asset ratio in farm country is about 13.2 percent — up a few percentage points from recent years, but low compared with 22 percent during the '80s.\n\nso while some farms might fail, that doesn't necessarily make it a farm crisis.\n\nthat's partially thanks to taxpayers. government farm payments are expected to be about 30 percent more this year than last year.\n\nit may be enough to keep some farms from going under, but nebraska auctioneer and farmer scott olson isn't counting on farm payment programs to earn a living. with planting season coming up, he says there will be a fine line between making money and losing it.\n\nbut, you know, you can't just quit for a year. you've still got taxes to pay, and a family to feed, olson says. you've got to work and try to make it work.\n\nlike other farmers across the region, he'll plant his corn and beans and hope for the best. if you're not optimistic, he says, you're not a farmer.\n\nthis story comes to us from harvest public media, a public radio reporting collaboration that focuses on agriculture and food production.
saturday sports: nfl playoffs, remembering david stern\n\nthe nfl playoffs are here. is the super bowl a realistic goal for the teams that kick off the postseason this weekend? and we remember the man who ruled the nba with an iron fist and compassion.\n\nleila fadel, host:\n\nit's time now for sports.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nfadel: well, the nfl playoffs are here. is the super bowl a realistic goal for the teams that kick off the postseason this weekend? and we remember the man who ruled the nba with an iron fist and compassion. npr sports correspondent tom goldman joins me now. good morning, tom.\n\ntom goldman, byline: happy new year, leila.\n\nfadel: happy new year. ok, so we're excited. the playoffs are starting, but the teams that play this opening weekend aren't ones we'll likely see later on in this season, is that right?\n\ngoldman: i want to make sure you really are excited.\n\nfadel: very excited (laughter).\n\ngoldman: (laughter) you know, in recent years that has been the case, that the teams playing this opening weekend aren't the ones we'll see later on. since the 2013 season, the two teams that played in the super bowl did not play on this first weekend, the so-called wildcard weekend. and all those super bowl teams had byes the first week.\n\nnow there, of course, were exceptions. the last team that played on wildcard weekend and made it to the super bowl, the baltimore ravens in the 2012 season. in fact, the the ravens won that super bowl, too.\n\nfadel: so do any of this weekend's teams have a chance to run the table like the ravens did?\n\ngoldman: well, you know, all of them believe they do. but realistically, one or two. i would say the new orleans saints. they're playing very well. they're a team to keep an eye on. and, of course, you can never rule out the new england patriots...\n\nfadel: right.\n\ngoldman: ...winners of six super bowls since 2002, including last season, although the patriots have looked a little less than a dynasty in the last month or so.\n\nfadel: the patriots. so we can't talk about the patriots without talking about tom brady. might this be it for him?\n\ngoldman: well, you know, the patriots host tennessee tonight. this is the first time in a decade new england is playing on a wild card weekend, an indication the pats haven't been as mighty this season. if they are truly vulnerable and they lose to tennessee, it could be tom brady's last home game, and that would be a big deal. he's 42, although he's said he wants to keep playing past this season. he could be a free agent at seasons end. and if the patriots don't resign him and decide to go younger at quarterback and start a new era, then brady could sign with another team.\n\nnow that said, new england's favored tonight. the patriots would love nothing more than to quiet the doubters and start the march to yet another super bowl. but, you know, it's a game people may want to watch just in case.\n\nfadel: so let's pivot and take a minute to talk about nba commissioner david stern. he passed away on new year's day. what are your thoughts on his legacy?\n\ngoldman: oh, well, it was a vast legacy. his impact was profound in 30 years as commissioner, which ended in 2014. you know, i think it's worth recalling 1991 when the great lakers player magic johnson told the world he was hiv positive. stern embraced magic at a time when the world wondered whether it was safe to even touch people who were hiv positive or had aids.\n\nthe public and nba sponsors were wary, but stern supported magic. he paved the way for him to play in the 1992 all-star game and the '92 olympics, where magic was a star in that star-studded dream team. stern educated himself and teams and players about the disease. and, you know, leila, this whole process helped change the conversation and attitudes about hiv and aids.\n\nfadel: that's npr sports correspondent tom goldman. thanks, tom.\n\ngoldman: you're welcome.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
can businesses turn away lgbt customers? court battles bubbling back up\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption allison sherry/cpr allison sherry/cpr\n\nthe original story behind the masterpiece cakeshop case is both undisputed and well known: a gay couple in colorado walked into the bakery in 2012 and asked for wedding cake. the owner and master baker jack phillips declined to make a custom cake for their party because he said their union violated his religious beliefs.\n\nthe couple filed a complaint with the state's civil rights commission, which found phillips was violating the state's anti-discrimination laws that prohibit businesses from discriminating against lgbtq people.\n\nthe battle between the two sides, the state and phillips, eventually landed in the high court.\n\nlast summer, the court narrowly sided with phillips — and admonished the state's commission for showing animus against religion.\n\nbut because it didn't settle the looming question on whether the first amendment guarantees of religious freedom are more important than a state or city's anti-discrimination laws, similar cases are again simmering in lower courts — including arizona and colorado.\n\namong the questions: when does an invitation or a cake qualify as free speech?\n\nthe main question is do you get to object to that kind of anti-discrimination law because it's forcing you to convey a message? said ilya shapiro with the cato institute, a conservative think tank that has supported some businesses that have turned customers away.\n\nonly two justices would have held that the baking of a custom wedding cake is protected as speech by the first amendment, said kaipo matsumura, who teaches law at arizona state university.the other justices refrained from commenting on the issue and just reserved that question for future decisions in other cases.\n\nin arizona, brendan mahoney was one of the lawyers in town who people would call when they were fired from a job or refused a room because they were gay.\n\nit really happened all the time, mahoney said.\n\nmahoney, who was openly gay, would explain the reality of the law in arizona.\n\nthere are no federal protections, no state or city protections, mahoney said. your best solution is to get involved and change the law.\n\nmahoney eventually took his own advice.\n\nhe went to work for the city and advocated for a phoenix law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. the ordinance would apply to housing, employment and other public accommodations — just as the law already did for categories like race, sex, marital status and religion.\n\nthe measure did ultimately prevail. more than five years later, mahoney said the law has made a huge difference in the lives of lgbtq people.\n\ni think the impact was profound, he said.\n\nbut one phoenix business argues it cannot in good conscience follow that law — because they say it violates their freedom of speech and religion.\n\nbrush & nib studio designs custom invitations for events like weddings. the shop owners say making an invitation for a same-sex wedding would violate their christian belief that marriage is only between a man and a woman.\n\nthe government shouldn't be telling artists what they can and can't say, breanna koski, a co-owner of brush & nib, said. we're challenging this law not just for us, but for all artists to be able to create freely.\n\nthe owners are asking the arizona supreme court to excuse them from the city's anti-discrimination law. those who break it face thousands of dollars in penalties — and even possible jail time.\n\nlast year, the arizona court of appeals ruled against the duo, which is represented by the scottsdale-based alliance defending freedom.\n\nthe influential christian law firm also has offices in washington, d.c. and has become nationally known for challenging nondiscrimination protections. the alliance has logged nine high court wins in just seven years.\n\nthey also represent colorado's baker jack phillips, who is again suing colorado's commission on civil rights for harassment.\n\nback in 2017, the day the supreme court announced it was taking up the first masterpiece case, phillips declined to bake another cake. the cake was requested to be pink on the inside and blue on the outside, celebrating a gender transition.\n\nphillips said the message about sex and gender identity conflicted with his christian religious beliefs.\n\ni believe that god made male and female and we don't get to choose that and we don't get to change that, he said. and it's wrong for the state to force me to create artistic products.\n\nthe state found phillips had violated the state's anti-discrimination law and filed an administrative complaint against him. phillips' attorneys are seeking an injunction to halt the state from moving forward on that complaint.\n\nthe pending case is an obvious attempt to harass the baker, said jim campbell, phillips' attorney from the alliance defending freedom.\n\nwhile both cases make their way through lower courts, both sides anticipate the high court taking the issue up again — for the sake of clarity.\n\nit may very well might end up at the nation's highest court again, campbell said.\n\nalready, powerful forces are divided.\n\nin arizona, the state's attorney general and republican leadership are siding with the business, while major companies are backing the city of phoenix. arizona has no statewide protections for lgbtq people.\n\nit's a much different political reality in colorado where the state's new democratic attorney general phil weiser will defend the state against phillips.\n\nweiser was elected in a giant blue wave that swept the state last year, along with a new, and openly gay, gov. jared polis. weiser says the high court, in its opinion, never challenged the state's anti-discrimination laws.\n\nequality for all is something that we here in colorado are committed to, the laws will be enforced, weiser said. we will just have to play a few more innings before we win this game.
the call-in: rural life\n\non this week's the call-in we explore what it's like to live in rural america. a retired teacher talks about the challenges of education, and we hear about a broadband internet cooperative.\n\nlourdes garcia-navarro, host:\n\nand this is the call-in. today, we're hearing from our listeners who live in rural communities.\n\nunidentified woman #1: hi.\n\nunidentified man #1: hi.\n\nlisa lindsay: hi, this is lisa lindsay (ph) calling from wilton, maine.\n\nunidentified man #2: i'm calling from sturgis, s.d.\n\nunidentified woman #2: i live in the ozarks in southwest missouri.\n\nunidentified man #3: in beautiful nelson county, va.\n\ngarcia-navarro: we asked you what you love about where you live.\n\nunidentified man #2: i live in one of the most beautiful areas in america, i think.\n\nunidentified man #3: i never tire of the arrival of spring, the trees and the flowers just bursting with color.\n\nlindsay: people help each other out and don't pretend that they don't know each other.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and we also heard about the challenges you face. a few themes came up again and again - lack of internet connection, trouble accessing health care, and several people brought up education.\n\ncheryl sebrell: we have trouble attracting and keeping good teachers. sometimes we have substitutes keeping a class for half of the year.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's retired teacher cheryl sebrell, who left us a message from littleton, n.c. we called her back to find out more about her community.\n\nsebrell: it's very small, has one stop light, three or four restaurants.\n\ngarcia-navarro: only a few hundred people live in her little farming town, and sebrell loves it.\n\nsebrell: you know everybody. there's no traffic. i go down to the post office if i've got a package, and they don't have to ask my box number. they just - oh, yeah, you've got a package.\n\ngarcia-navarro: sebrell spent 40 years teaching k through 12. and over those many years, she watched as things got harder for teachers and for students.\n\nsebrell: in the '80s and the early '90s, there was a big focus on education in north carolina, and we were a leader in the country. it's all about cost cutting and budgets and things now. and it's tough to be in a rural area when that is happening.\n\ngarcia-navarro: well, let me ask you, what were some of the challenges in a rural area that are different from the city?\n\nsebrell: well, one of the things is it's very hard to find qualified teachers who will stay. there's not always a lot to offer to people who are coming in to teach. housing sometimes can be a problem. living in a home in the country, you're going to deal with leaking roofs and mice, and sometimes that can be a problem, finding a place that you want to live in, just a house, so that you're not driving back and forth. so a lot of our teachers do come in from the triangle area - raleigh, durham - and they drive, you know, an hour in the morning or an hour and a half in the morning and again in the afternoon. and when you have long hours, that makes it really tough as well.\n\ngarcia-navarro: i'm curious. you mentioned funding. give us an example of some of the challenges of funding when you were a teacher.\n\nsebrell: the school gets a budget, but it just meets very basic, bare-minimum needs. i used different grants to get novels and other literature that i wanted to use in the classroom.\n\ngarcia-navarro: you had to write those grants yourself.\n\nsebrell: i did. i actually wrote about $50,000 worth of grants.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and you used your own money to buy some of the supplies, i...\n\nsebrell: (laughter) that too.\n\ngarcia-navarro: ...i was told.\n\nsebrell: that too. i actually make a lot more money now that i'm retired (laughter). you know, i was glad to do it at the time, but it shouldn't be that way.\n\ngarcia-navarro: you mentioned it's hard to encourage new teachers to move down to where you live. but teach for america is a program that's been trying to fill that gap. is that helping?\n\nsebrell: absolutely, it helps. they're very active in our school, and that has really saved us. obviously, they're not there for the long haul all the time, but we've had a lot that have stayed three or four, maybe even five years. and they build relationships with students, and that's really the most important thing.\n\ngarcia-navarro: i'm curious. have you seen a lot of the young people move away after they leave school? is there something to keep them or bring them back to your community?\n\nsebrell: i have seen a lot move away. but one thing that's been really rewarding this year was seeing some of our first graduating class come back to teach in the community. i think it's powerful to see the students' response to people who come back and teach. but of course, a lot of students, once they go out, they've lived in the big wide world, they don't necessarily want to come back.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that was cheryl sebrell, a longtime teacher in rural north carolina.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngarcia-navarro: as we heard, it can be hard to hold on to people in rural places when there's a lack of infrastructure to support them. the absence of a fast and reliable internet connection is one major problem. mark erickson has been trying to solve that. he's the head of the economic development agency in winthrop, minn. and he told us how, until recently, a lack of broadband was affecting his neighbors.\n\nmark erickson: a third of our students in our school districts live in the country, and they were unable to do their homework when they got home. most of them had dial-up, which is just archaic. some used satellite connections, which were good when the weather was fine, and some had poor dsl from their phone companies.\n\ngarcia-navarro: erickson is running a project that will build a fiber-optic network across 10 communities.\n\nerickson: we formed a cooperative, and the subscribers to our network are the owners. so let me give you an example. to build a fiber-optic network and connect people in towns, the cost per home or per business is about $2,500. to build that network and connect the farms, it's about $10,000, about the cost of a used pickup.\n\nnow, the people in this area felt that those kinds of per home, per farm investments are ok because what the internet can do for education and health care is amazing. we just feel it's an investment that the phone companies and cable companies are unable to make. so the folks in this very conservative part of minnesota decided that they wanted to put their tax dollars on the line and enable this network.\n\ngarcia-navarro: the companies aren't willing to make those investments because they have to have a higher return for their shareholders.\n\nerickson: correct. these are very small towns. our largest town is 2,300 people, and our smallest town is 400. some people say its a market failure, you know. and here's this new technology that people want and they need, but the business plans of the incumbents just don't allow them to make that necessary investment.\n\ngarcia-navarro: how has fixing something as fundamental as internet connection had an effect on other things?\n\nerickson: well, it helps the present businesses. we've had several here say that hooking up to the fiber network has increased their ability to do business greatly. but we also saw this as something for the future, like you allude to. we expect our children to leave our communities when they graduate from high school and go to college and learn about life. but they have to have a reason to return. and the millennials today, and those who follow, will find it difficult to come back to a community that doesn't offer the kind of internet connection that they want. what we have our fingers crossed for, and it looks pretty good, we believe we've attracted a four-year medical school to our area, which will change the face of our communities in a very positive way for a long, long time, if it happens. and that was a direct result of the fiber network.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that was mark erickson of winthrop, minn. we also heard from cheryl sebrell in littleton, n.c.\n\nand next week on the call-in, we want to hear about your shopping habits. the retail industry is scrambling to keep up as we change how and where we shop. it's shed tens of thousands of jobs. do you get your groceries delivered? do you still go to the mall? what do you buy online? call in at 202-216-9217. leave us a voicemail with your full name, where you're from and your experience, and we may use it on the air. that number again - 202-216-9217.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
the u.k. has left the eu. what's next for britain?\n\nthe u.k. has officially left the european union. but little will change for the rest of 2020 while a new relationship is negotiated between britain and the eu.\n\nrenee montagne, host:\n\nlate last night, thousands of people poured into parliament square in london to count down to brexit.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified crowd: four, three, two, one.\n\n(cheering)\n\nmontagne: after decades of economic integration with europe, the u.k. is on its own - sort of. for more to explain what comes next, we turn to npr's frank langfitt in london. good morning.\n\nfrank langfitt, byline: hey. good morning, renee.\n\nmontagne: and describe for us the celebration last night. we heard a bit of it. what did you see?\n\nlangfitt: well, there were thousands of people in parliament square, people wearing union jack flags as capes. there were fireworks, lots of smoke. then a totally different kind of scene in other parts of the city, where a lot of people wanted to remain in the eu. there was candlelight vigils. it felt almost funereal.\n\nand then up in scotland, something very different and a sense of what could be on the horizon. nicola sturgeon - she's the head of the scottish national party - she's pushing for a second referendum for scotland independence. she wants to secede from the united kingdom and rejoin the european union.\n\nand, frankly, the most interesting image last night for me, renee, was in brussels. it was at the eu commission building. and they had an image of europe and scotland, those two words intersecting. and the message seemed to be, come back to europe, scotland.\n\nmontagne: ok. well, the u.k.'s been out of the eu for a few hours now. and what has changed?\n\nlangfitt: not much. basically, they've gone into an 11-month transition period. so free trade and free movement will be the way it has always been. and what they now have is a very short window to work out a new free trade deal by the end of this year. and then there's the risk if they can't - i certainly hope this doesn't happen - the u.k. could still crash out of the eu with no deal at all.\n\nmontagne: well, british politics have been chaotic over these past three years - i mean, dramatically so. what kind of tone is prime minister boris johnson striking now that the country is looking forward?\n\nlangfitt: well, i think johnson wants to try to turn the page, reunify the country and kind of infuse britain with a sense of optimism, which has been totally lacking, as you're pointing out. and he gave a taped speech last night. and this is a little of what he said.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nprime minister boris johnson: it is potentially a moment of real national renewal and change. this is the dawn of a new era in which we no longer accept that your life chances, your family's life chances should depend on which part of the country you grow up.\n\nlangfitt: and so the key points here is what boris johnson is focusing on, renee, is really the domestic situation, the economy. and the argument he's making is, well, when we're free from the european union, we can build a better economy, a fairer economy for other parts of england, for instance, that are post-industrial that haven't been doing very well. the one word he never mentioned was the word brexit because it's totally toxic.\n\nmontagne: so wondering, do many people in the u.k. share the prime minister's optimism?\n\nlangfitt: well, you know, i mean, some brexiteers do. most economists absolutely don't. they think this is going to be bad, certainly in the short term and probably, even from their perspective, in the long term, for the u.k. economy. and also, many young people are very disappointed. they're not going to be able to live and work freely in europe, which created great opportunities for them. there's a woman named charlotte reynolds. she's a university student here. she studies french, spanish and german. and last night, she struck a totally different tone from the prime minister.\n\ncharlotte reynolds: we just need to prepare ourselves for the worst, whatever that may be, i guess, because everything is all in the air at the moment, and it has been for the past three years. so it's just going to be more difficult and more stressful to kind of get around and be free in europe as you were before.\n\nmontagne: npr's frank langfitt speaking to us from london. thanks very much.\n\nlangfitt: you're very welcome, renee.\n\n(soundbite of dj mitsu the beats' a little piano)\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
wh: kelly, attorney flood didn't stay for secret portions of russia briefings\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrew harnik/ap andrew harnik/ap\n\nupdated at 5:46 p.m. et\n\nthe white house acknowledged that chief of staff john kelly and a top lawyer for president trump in the russia matter had been present for two secret briefings about the investigation on thursday but hadn't stayed for the substance.\n\nkelly and newcomer attorney emmet flood went to the justice department for a meeting with two important house republican chairmen and then went to the capitol for the meeting with the leaders of the house, the senate and the chambers' two intelligence committees.\n\nneither chief kelly nor mr. flood actually attended the meetings but did make brief remarks before the meetings started to relay the president's desire for as much openness as possible under the law, the white house said in an official statement.\n\nit continued: they also conveyed the president's understanding of the need to protect human intelligence services and the importance of communication between the branches of government. after making their brief comments they departed before the meetings officially started.\n\na white house official had told npr earlier in the day the administration didn't understand why it might be a problem for kelly to be present at the meetings, at which top law enforcement and intelligence officials were to present secret information about the department of justice russia probe.\n\ni don't see what the issue is, the official told npr.\n\nkelly and the white house have been brokering the conversations since trump said on twitter last weekend that he wanted to learn more about the fbi's use of confidential informants to interview campaign aides in 2016.\n\nflood's presence was unexpected.\n\npress secretary sarah sanders had said earlier that no one from the white house would attend the resulting conferences, but those arrangements have changed after the back-and-forth up and down pennsylvania avenue.\n\ncritics charge that trump has violated the long-standing independence of the justice department to pursue investigations without political interference and called it inappropriate for administration officials to join briefings about an investigation that bears so heavily on the president and his aides.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption evan vucci/ap evan vucci/ap\n\ncongress already has a process by which members can keep themselves informed about the work of the justice department and the fbi, said sen. mark warner, d-va., the ranking member on the senate intelligence committee.\n\nso there was no need, he said, for the briefing at the justice department for house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes, r-calif., and house oversight committee chairman trey gowdy, r-s.c., separate from one at the capitol for the leaders of the house and senate and the leaders of the intelligence committees.\n\nthe white house's plan to provide a separate briefing for their political allies demonstrates that their interest is not in informing congress but in undermining an ongoing criminal investigation, warner said.\n\nif they insist upon carrying out this farce, the white house and its republican allies in the house will do permanent, long-standing damage to the practice of bipartisan congressional oversight of intelligence, warner also said.\n\nhouse speaker paul ryan, r-wis., said nunes and the other members of the intelligence committees are simply doing their work as appropriate.\n\ni appreciate the [justice] department arranging today's briefing, ryan said. as always, i cannot and will not comment on a classified session. i look forward to the prompt completion of the intelligence committee's oversight work in this area now that they are getting the cooperation necessary for them to complete their work while protecting sources and methods.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., told npr separately on thursday that he wouldn't discuss the classified briefing but that he retains confidence in special counsel robert mueller and in justice department inspector general michael horowitz.\n\nat least one source and one method have already been compromised: press reports revealed that cambridge professor stefan halper met with three trump campaign aides in 2016 as a confidential informant for the fbi. investigators wanted to know about the overtures that people on trump's campaign were receiving from russian agents.\n\ntrump denounced the fbi's use of a secret informant and said that had been tantamount to government-sponsored political snooping for democrats.\n\na lot of people are saying they had spies in my campaign, trump told reporters on tuesday. if so, that would be a disgrace to this country. i hope there weren't, frankly ... but some man got paid based on what i read in the newspapers.\n\nthe democrats who took part in the meetings on thursday — house and senate minority leaders nancy pelosi and chuck schumer and the top democrats on the house and senate intelligence committees, adam schiff and warner — released a collective statement rejecting trump's claim.\n\nnothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the fbi or any intelligence agency placed a 'spy' in the trump campaign, or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures and protocols.\n\nformer fbi director james comey, who was fired by the president last year, responded via twitter, denouncing attacks on the agency and defending its use of confidential informants as tightly regulated and essential to protecting the country.\n\nhe said the president's attacks on the fbi will do lasting damage to our country.\n\nnunes and gowdy had been requesting secret information from deputy attorney general rod rosenstein for months about the russia investigation, and he had resisted. nunes threatened to try to impeach rosenstein or hold him in contempt of congress. the deputy attorney general relented after trump's demand that the justice department comply.\n\nnpr correspondents susan

drought-stricken cape town braces for water to run out in april\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption rodger bosch /afp/getty images rodger bosch /afp/getty images\n\ncape town officials are tightening water restrictions amid claims the city could run out of water by april 21. after three years of intensive drought, officials say residents are bracing for day zero, the day water could stop flowing.\n\nsouth africa's second-largest city would be the first major city in the developed world to run out of water, if residents do not heed new stricter water measures. the region is experiencing its worst drought in a century, which experts say has been exacerbated by climate change and in cape town, rapid population growth.\n\nstarting feb. 1, cape town will force residents to cut their water consumption to 13.2 gallons per day, down from 23 gallons. the city has already banned filling swimming pools and washing cars. also in an october mandate, people were asked to take two-minute showers and limit use of appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, pumza fihlani, a bbc correspondent in johannesburg, tells here & now's robin young.\n\nfor people that are used to the luxury that cape town promises, this has come across as a rather drastic measure, she says. people are reusing some of the water that they've used in other areas and finding other uses for it around the household. this means limiting the amount of water you drink, limiting the showers that you take.\n\ncity officials are blaming residents for ignoring previous water restrictions. mayor patricia de lille said last week that more than 60 percent of residents are using too much water and threatened them with fines.\n\nwe can no longer ask people to stop wasting water. we must force them, the mayor told reporters. the mayor also announced the city moved day zero up a day because of the overuse of water.\n\nwhen cape town reaches day zero, residents in the popular tourist city of 3.7 million will have to line up to collect 6.5 gallons of drinking water per person per day at some 200 distribution stations. those restrictions adhere to the world health organization's guidelines for the minimum amount of water needed in emergencies.\n\nbut other experts say city planners failed to anticipate that the city's six dams, which are sourced by rainfall, would run out of water as drought worsened and the population grew, fihlani says. dam levels have dropped to 15.2 percent capacity of usable water, down from 77 percent in sept. 2015, according to the los angeles times.\n\nnot enough dams have been built over the time that the population has grown and infrastructure has remained the same and that's why the city now finds itself in the position that it's in, she says.\n\ndespite warnings since 2004, local government officials are criticizing south africa's national government for its slow response to the crisis. as the los angeles times notes:\n\nwestern cape premier helen zille and provincial authorities have accused the national african national congress government of failing to build and maintain new infrastructure and send adequate emergency drought relief. it was not until august that the national government allocated the city $1.5 million to deal with the crisis.\n\nprior to tightening water measures, the city attempted to shame residents into using less water by posting an online map tracking water consumption across the city.\n\ncape town has also tried to reduce water usage by weakening the water pressure and installing water management devices, according to reuters. desalination projects and new efforts to extract groundwater are still in the early stages, fihlani says.\n\na number of these projects need money, she says, and it's not clear that the city will have enough time to raise the money that they need to fund these rather ambitious projects.
as the total number of women in congress reaches an all-time high, gop numbers drop\n\nthe number of republican women in congress is dropping as democrats seat even more female members. republican women say their party hasn't done enough to recruit strong candidates and support them.\n\nmary louise kelly, host:\n\ntwenty-one republican women will be in congress this coming session, 21 out of 535 members. that is a drop, even though the total number of women lawmakers will hit an all-time high. as npr's danielle kurtzleben reports, some in the gop are sounding the alarm.\n\ndanielle kurtzleben, byline: ashley nickloes is a busy woman. she's working towards her master's degree. she's a mother of four. and when i caught her, she was on the road for one of her other roles.\n\nashley nickloes: i'm a military pilot. and we have to do our simulator recurrency twice a year. so i'm here now (laughter) and in st. louis. yes, ma'am.\n\nkurtzleben: on top of all that, she also ran for congress in tennessee last year but lost in the primary. she knows any number of factors played into that. for example, she was deployed for part of the campaign. but she thinks the gop needs to do more to get women like her elected.\n\nnickloes: with only - what? - 13 seats now in the house of representatives as republican women, that is not at all indicative of who the republican party is.\n\nkurtzleben: nickloes is one of many frustrated with the republican party's track record with electing women. retiring florida representative ileana ros-lehtinen is another, as she recently told npr.\n\nileana ros-lehtinen: it is unbelievable. it is astounding. it is eye-popping. and i hope that our republican leaders see this as a challenge and a problem that we need to fix.\n\nkurtzleben: to be clear, women are underrepresented on both sides of the aisle in congress. just under 1 in 4 members will be women next session. but less than 1 in 10 republican members will be women.\n\none reason republican women are poorly represented at the national level is that they're also scarce in state legislatures. that's a traditional training ground for congress. and at both levels, their numbers will decline this year. here's debbie walsh, director of rutgers university's center for american women and politics.\n\ndebbie walsh: it's significant that of the one new republican woman who was elected in this cycle, she came out of the state legislature - carol miller.\n\nkurtzleben: both parties also have different ideas about how important diversity is. one in 3 republicans believe there are too few women in political office. in comparison, 8 in 10 democrats think so, according to the pew research center. and then there's money. here's walsh again.\n\nwalsh: women just are usually running for office from less moneyed professions, less moneyed networks.\n\nkurtzleben: that brings us back to nickloes. she says her lack of connections hurt her fundraising.\n\nnickloes: because the other gentleman had a lot of political influence already, i heard the word retribution continuously. i had a lot of people who were like, i'll give you $175. but these were people who were able to give thousands. and so they didn't want their name coming up on a report so that my competitors could see.\n\nkurtzleben: to boost their women candidates, democrats have a campaign money juggernaut in emily's list. the equivalent groups on the right have much less money. a chief critic of the party's approach to electing women is new york representative elise stefanik. she spoke about her frustration at a december politico event.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nelise stefanik: i am tired of having this issue within our conference. so i think it's time to roll up our sleeves and try to change the types of candidates we have.\n\nkurtzleben: stefanik recently stepped down from recruitment at the national republican congressional committee to build up her own group to support women in gop primaries. and when nrcc chair tom emmer seemed to call that a mistake, she swiped back.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nstefanik: i said, news flash. i didn't ask for permission.\n\n(applause)\n\nstefanik: and i will not ask for permission.\n\nkurtzleben: emmer later clarified that he thinks it would be a mistake for the party to get involved in primaries. but for her part, nickloes, the pilot from tennessee, believes the party should do more for women in primary elections. as for whether she'll run again, she's still deciding. danielle kurtzleben, npr news.\n\n(soundbite of jazz at lincoln center orchestra with wynton marsalis feat. bobby carcasses' como fue (live))\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
executive order or memorandum? let's call the whole thing an 'action'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mandel ngan/afp/getty images mandel ngan/afp/getty images\n\nit's been a busy week for president trump's pen.\n\nsince taking the oath of office on jan. 20, trump has signed more than a dozen executive orders and memorandums in an effort to jump-start his policy agenda and begin to deliver on some of the promises he made during the campaign.\n\nbut why is the president's directive to build a wall considered an executive order, whereas greenlighting the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines are memorandums? and how is all of that different from issuing an executive action?\n\nthe authority to issue executive orders and memorandums doesn't appear in the constitution, and that's partly why the definitions are a little hazy, according to the congressional research service. nevertheless, the authority to issue both is considered an inherent aspect of presidential power.\n\nan order is a call for the executive branch to take a specific action or to change an existing practice, explains phillip j. cooper, a professor of public administration in the hatfield school of government at portland state university in portland, ore.\n\nif the president has the authority to issue that directive, whether from the constitution or statute, then it becomes legally binding. however, cooper says, if there's a clear piece of legislation that says, 'no you can't do this,' a president can't pick up a pen and get around it. in essence, a president can't sign an executive order that violates existing law.\n\nonce a president signs an executive order, it's sent to the federal register for an identifying number, and then published.\n\nthat's a key step that isn't legally required with executive memorandums.\n\nthere are no legal processes required for issuing a memorandum, cooper says. a president doesn't have to do anything, doesn't even have to publish it if he or she doesn't want to. with an executive order, presidents must publish. the obama administration started publishing public memorandums on the white house website, and the trump administration has followed suit. but, cooper says, that is something they choose to do, and what's available on the website now may not include all of the new administration's memorandums.\n\nplanet money how a law is implemented depends on a president's rules how a law is implemented depends on a president's rules listen · 4:19 4:19\n\nexecutive orders and memorandums are often conflated. in the last few administrations, particularly since the clinton years, presidents started using the two interchangeably, says cooper.\n\nin a january 2000 memo to then-president bill clinton, the justice department wrote, it is our opinion that there is no substantive difference in the legal effectiveness of an executive order and a presidential directive that is not styled as an executive order.\n\nwhile presidents have treated executive memorandums as just as binding as executive orders, cooper says, there really is not a clear body of case law or statutes on that.\n\nas for executive actions, cooper says the phrase is very generic. he explains that executive actions are merely a category of different policy tools that presidents often use — including executive orders and memorandums — that has no separate legal meaning itself.\n\nregardless of the word appearing after executive, if his first week in office is any indication, it seems president trump's pen won't be getting a rest any time soon.

saturday sports: nba semifinals, kentucky derby\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nit's time for sports.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nsimon: what a no-hitter last night. walker buehler, the los angeles dodgers rookie, threw six innings of no-hit ball against the san diego padres. and three relief pitchers followed. a no-hitter but with four pitchers - only the 12th combined no-hitter in major league history. npr's tom goldman joins us. morning, tom.\n\ntom goldman, byline: good morning, scott.\n\nsimon: so why did dave roberts, the able dodgers manager, lift a guy in the middle of a no-hitter?\n\ngoldman: name of the game, mr. scott simon - protect your pitchers. some argue managers - teams are too protective. mr. buehler was only 23 - is only 23. but he had tommy john surgery a couple of years ago. so when he reached his allotted pitch count, that was it - possible no-hitter or not. buehler didn't like the decision. but he said - and i'm quoting - it's above my paygrade, and they made the choice. and these guys finished it out. it was pretty cool.\n\nsimon: it really was. i would have left the kid in. and maybe there's a reason why i'm not the manager of any ball club. but another event last night - albert pujols of the los angeles angels of anaheim-fullerton in yorba linda got the 3,000th hit of his career. now he's slowed in recent years - but, boy, what a career he's had.\n\ngoldman: we knew he was a great hitter. now the numbers prove it. he's the 32nd player to be on the hallowed 3,000-hit list - also only the fourth to have 3,000 hits and 600 homeruns - so a hitter with power too. so for one night at least, shohei ohtani wasn't the talk of the angels of anaheim-fullerton in yorba linda.\n\nsimon: (laughter) you see? that is their name.\n\ngoldman: it's catchy.\n\nsimon: new orleans pelicans beat golden state last night - 119 to 100. warriors are just ahead by a game now in that series. is steve kerr shaking like a leaf?\n\ngoldman: no, cool as ever. he attributed last night's thumping to the ebbs and flows of the postseason. the pelicans' defense was great. they brought the energy and the aggressiveness, and golden state didn't didn't. kerr says it'll get better. when steve kerr talks warriors, listen. so we will see tomorrow.\n\nsimon: and same split in houston-utah series now - houston won last night - 113 to 92. by the way, one of my new favorite players is the stifle tower on utah.\n\ngoldman: (laughter) yeah, but he wasn't very stifling...\n\nsimon: he didn't stifle last night, yeah.\n\ngoldman: rudy gobert - not last night. you know, to pick up on kerr's ebbs and flows comments, it's hard to have a consistent narrative once the playoffs get past the first round. all the remaining teams are very good. they're well-coached. and things change game to game because teams adjust game to game. and the home court can play a big part as it did in new orleans last night. so the narrative that a talented cohesive utah team might upset the number one seat houston after utah won game two and stole the rockets' home-court advantage - that narrative changed in a big way by halftime last night when houston led by 30 and ended up cruising to victory in utah and stealing back the home-court advantage.\n\nsimon: i've been holding myself back, tom, obviously.\n\ngoldman: i can tell.\n\nsimon: the cavs have been a mediocre team all year with the greatest player of all time. but right now, (singing) all this energy calling me back to where it all comes from - cleveland is rocky. what more can we say about lebron james?\n\ngoldman: this series is the one current narrative that may play out - the narrative being that even though they've played only two games, the raptors are done. cleveland won the first two games in toronto. lebron was breathtaking again. the thing that should really worry the raptors - this team that was mediocre, as you say, remade with big trades in february. it's finally jelling. that's trouble for toronto.\n\nsimon: well, i can't help but - just the opportunity to see lebron james at this point in his career - absolutely extraordinary. i hope everybody tunes in whatever the result is. it's very good to talk to you again. npr's tom goldman, thanks so much.\n\ngoldman: you're welcome.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
not my job: we quiz 'shape of water' star doug jones on frozen sculptures\n\njones starred as the sexy sea creature in the shape of water, so we've invited him to play a game called hey, check out the shape of this water! originally broadcast oct. 24, 2020.\n\nbill kurtis: from npr and wbez chicago, this is wait wait... don't tell me - the npr news quiz. i'm bill kurtis. and here's your host, a man who believes 2021 is the year he starts wearing bow ties - peter sagal.\n\n(soundbite of applause sound effect)\n\npeter sagal, host:\n\nthank you, bill. so it really was a great year - really, at least in one-hour weekly increments or, to be strictly accurate, in certain parts of one-hour weekly increments - usually when we got to talk to somebody cool.\n\nkurtis: for example, doug jones is one of the most successful actors in hollywood, but you'd never recognize him. that's because he plays most of his roles buried under 20 pounds of latex.\n\nsagal: he's played monsters and creatures in movies like hellboy and the shape of water and an alien crew member in the latest star trek series. so i asked him if he grew up dreaming of becoming the go-to guy for anything with claws or fins.\n\n(soundbite of archived npr broadcast)\n\ndoug jones: no, actually, i started as a mime back at ball state university in indiana. and being 6-foot-3 and 140 pounds and having a mime background, it's like, oh, the creature-effects people were just all over me the minute i got to la.\n\nmaeve higgins: (laughter).\n\nsagal: all right, we skipped a bit. why, out of all things, did you decide to become a mime?\n\njones: oh, right. no one chooses that, do they?\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: yeah, it seems like - i assume people were just...\n\npeter grosz: no, it chooses you.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: i assume people were just born into, like, the mime cast.\n\njones: right?\n\nsagal: and they had no choice.\n\njones: no. at my dorm that i lived in at ball state, i was a freshman, and a senior is the one who ran the mine troupe. the mime troupe was called mime over matter. get it?\n\neugene cordero: whoa.\n\n(laughter)\n\nsagal: oh, my god.\n\njones: and so he saw how i talked with my hands and how lanky i was and said, you know, you should come see one of our shows and think about auditioning for our troupe. and that's how the mime thing started with me.\n\nsagal: wow. and did you...\n\ngrosz: the same way a drug dealer likes to get on the street, you know, and, like, ropes him in.\n\njones: exactly.\n\nsagal: the first fake elevator is free.\n\njones: (laughter).\n\nsagal: but were you that kind of mime? were you out on the sidewalk doing, like, oh, there's a wind, there's a wall - that kind of stuff? (laughter).\n\njones: right. my first job out of college was working at kings island, a theme park in cincinnati, ohio. you know, cincinnati, ohio, is kind of, like, on the cusp of indiana, kentucky, and so there's not a whole lot of people in that area that knew what a mine was. so it's like, oh, honey, look at the clown. look at the clown. why isn't he talking? i don't know.\n\n(laughter)\n\njones: so it was like - oh, it was sad.\n\nsagal: i know this is a very weird question to ask you. but can you think of, like, the weirdest thing you were asked to play? and i say this to somebody who has literally played the angel of death.\n\njones: yeah (laughter). i think a giant cockroach-y (ph) bug thing. i did a movie, a horrible movie called bug buster.\n\nsagal: (laughter).\n\njones: and i had a huge fight scene with randy quaid. but i was a giant insect that was guarding my pile of eggs, and he was coming to kill us. so we had a big knockdown drag-out in a cave. he came in there with weapons.\n\nsagal: right.\n\njones: bullets didn't kill me. he - then he pulled out, like, a flamethrower. i don't burn. then he pulled out a co2 gun. i don't freeze. so he threw all of his weapons down and said, come on, man, you and me - mano y mano. so that's when it got weird, right?\n\n(laughter)\n\ngrosz: that's when it got weird.\n\njones: we have a knockdown drag-out, choreographed fight around this cave, bouncing off walls and rolling around on the ground.\n\ncordero: wow.\n\njones: and i got up from that. and i asked my handler - i said, can you go check on randy? i didn't see him get up after that fight, that last take.\n\n(laughter)\n\njones: so across to the cave, i hear - doug, buddy, can you hear me? randy quaid. yeah? he said, do what you're doing. it's great. we can go again. i'm fine. you're doing great. the next voice that i heard was a young pa, a production assistant, going - can i get some ice over here?

a, her majesty did not appreciate being represented by a sculpture titled ice queen; b, after boris johnson refused to participate in a debate on climate change, they had a melting ice sculpture take his place; or, c, to counterprogram a theresa may speech on the bbc, they showed an ice sculpture of her for an hour with the caption - which seems more human?\n\njones: can i go with a again? because i do love queen elizabeth, and i would want to think of her as an ice queen, either.\n\nsagal: you can go with a again.\n\ncordero: but...\n\nsagal: i mean, it's possible.\n\ngrosz: he seems to be dissuading.\n\nhiggins: he seems to b dissuading.\n\n(laughter)\n\njones: or it could be the answer b.\n\nsagal: yes, it's b. very good. yes.\n\n(soundbite of applause sound effect)\n\nsagal: the...\n\njones: good instincts i had there.\n\ncordero: yeah.\n\nsagal: although the melting ice sculpture of the planet did hold its own in many fine points of debate. all right, last chance - if you get this, you win it. a local news reporter in california went viral when he knocked over the carving of the ice sculptor he was interviewing on live tv at the state fair. but there was another twist to the story. what was it - a, the reporter had faked the accident because he was bored of doing stupid human interest stories all the time; b, he was carried away by rage when he realized the ice sculpture was of his ex; or, c, the ice sculpture was his childhood enemy, and he had planned this vengeance for decades.\n\njones: ok, i'm going to go with a one more time.\n\nsagal: and this time it paid off, doug.\n\n(soundbite of bell)\n\njones: yeah. ok, good. ok, good. yeah.\n\nsagal: yes, that's true. it was an elaborate stunt. he didn't want to do the stories anymore. and it worked. now he has his own news channel on youtube.\n\n(laughter)\n\njones: that worked out well.\n\nsagal: it did. bill, how did doug jones do on our quiz?\n\nkurtis: he loved a so much, he turned out a winner.\n\n(soundbite of applause sound effect)\n\nsagal: congratulations. yay. doug jones is an actor. you can see him now as commander saru on star trek: discovery. season 3 is streaming on cbs all access now. doug jones, thank you so much for joining us on wait wait... don't tell me. what a joy to talk to you.\n\njones: oh, the joy has been mine. thank you all so very much for having me.\n\nsagal: bye-bye.\n\n(soundbite of alexandre desplat's the shape of water)\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
as grizzlies come back, frustration builds over continued protections\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\ntrina jo bradley squints down at a plate-sized paw print, pressed into a sheet of shallow snow.\n\nshe reaches down with fingers outstretched, hovering her palm over a sun-softened edge. her hand barely covers a third of the track.\n\nthat's a big old foot right there, she says, with a chuckle. that's the one where you don't want to be like: 'oh! there he is right there!\n\nbradley, like many ranchers, applies a wry sense of humor to things that feel out of her control.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nathan rott/npr nathan rott/npr\n\ngrowing up here on the rocky mountain front, where prairie meets mountain, she rarely saw grizzlies. now, she sees them all of the time. some nights, her family watches the massive carnivores lumber by outside their living room window. bradley says they're majestic.\n\nas long as they mind their own business and stay out of my cows, i could really care less if they're here, she says. i enjoy having them here and i think most ranchers do.\n\nlike most ranchers, bradley and her husband have been largely accommodating of grizzly bears as their population has rebounded and they've spread from the mountains into the more-populated plains. they've started storing food for their cattle in a raised, bear-proof container. neighbors have lined entire pastures with electric fencing. bradley's daughter now knows not to leave the yard.\n\nbut frustration is growing.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\nsince being listed as threatened under the endangered species act in 1975, grizzly bear populations in northwest montana and the greater yellowstone area have more than tripled in size, thanks, in no small part to a hard-earned tolerance and efforts from people like bradley to reduce conflict between human and bear.\n\nthat tolerance, scientists and wildlife officials say, is key to the grizzly bears' future as the effects of climate change harden, the west gets more crowded, and bears spreads into areas they haven't been in more than 100 years.\n\nbradley's tolerance is waning.\n\nthe bears have nothing to do with it.\n\nthe source of her frustration is a feeling that her opinion doesn't matter and that the landmark law that brought grizzly bears back is being misused.\n\ni would like to see the endangered species act do exactly what it was written for, she says. and when a species is recovered, it's done. and then it goes to the state to manage it.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\nbetter than expected recovery\n\nwhen chris servheen was named the nation's first grizzly bear recovery coordinator, tasked with saving and restoring the iconic species, he wasn't optimistic.\n\nthere were just a few hundred of the mammoth mammals left in the lower 48 u.s. states, holed up in the confines of yellowstone national park and a few wilderness areas along the canadian border. people were encroaching on most sides, many of them not keen to be cohabiting with an animal that the department of interior aptly described as being highly intolerant of man.\n\nsix years earlier, the u.s. fish and wildlife service had intervened, placing strict federal protections on grizzly bears in the contiguous u.s.\n\nit was servheen's job to bring the bears back to the point where those federal protections weren't needed.\n\nquietly, he thought he'd be presiding over their demise.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\ngrizzly bears are slow to reproduce. they require massive amounts of habitat. and they kill people, servheen says, in the matter-of-fact tone that earned him admirers and enemies during a 35-year career.\n\nwhat followed, though, exceeded his and most people's expectations.\n\nwith federal protections in place, wildlife officials and conservation groups set out to change attitudes and build tolerance for the bears. they started programs to reimburse ranchers for livestock that bears killed. they closed roads in bear habitats and fenced in landfills.\n\ngrizzly populations in the yellowstone region and northwest montana flourished. today, there are an estimated 1,400 to 1,700 grizzly bears in the contiguous u.s.\n\nthe endangered species act works,says servheen, now retired. we proved it with grizzly bears.\n\nloading...\n\nin 2007, the u.s. fish and wildlife service declared success, removing endangered species protections for yellowstone-area grizzlies. lawsuits from wildlife groups and tribal governments quickly followed and two years later federal protections were put back in place, after a federal judge decided that the agency hadn't adequately considered the impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources.\n\nin 2016, as servheen was retiring, his agency tried to delist the bears again. again, it failed.\n\na federal judge restored endangered species protections to yellowstone-area grizzlies last fall, just hours before a highly-controversial hunt of the bears was scheduled to start in wyoming and idaho. an effort to delist grizzlies in northwest montana was paused as well.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\nthe u.s. fish and wildlife service filed a notice to appeal the latest court decision last december, but a resolution could take years.\n\nto some who support delisting, the back-and-forth doesn't seem like that big of a deal.\n\ni don't doubt that some people are very frustrated, but the consequence of not delisting grizzly bears is the continuation of good and effective programs, says tom france, a long-time conservationist with the national wildlife federation's northern rockies, prairies and pacific regional center.\n\nmany people who live in grizzly bear country, he points out, are continuing to work with conservation groups and wildlife agencies to protect the bears.\n\nto servheen, the danger seems more acute. he worries that the delay will erode public support for the endangered species act and, more importantly, for the bears themselves.\n\nthe future of grizzly bears is in the hands of the people who live, work and recreate in bear habitat, he says. and if those people feel that no matter what they do, nothing's ever going to change, nothing's ever good enough, then they won't invest the time in helping with recovery.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\npeople ... feel that their rights are being infringed upon\n\nwesley sarmento always keeps his cell phone on him, even though he's often out of cellular service.\n\nas a bear management specialist for montana fish, wildlife and parks, stationed in the rural, agriculture-rich rocky mountain front, he gets calls all the time.\n\ni've gotten calls at four in the morning. i've gotten calls at 8pm on a friday night, sarmento says. usually bears in people's yards, eating apples, dog food — finding food mainly.\n\nconflicts between humans and bears have been on the rise in recent years. grizzlies, almost always, end up on the losing end.\n\nlast year, scientists counted 51 grizzly bear mortalities in northwest montana, making it the deadliest year since they started keeping track.\n\nsarmento's job is to try and reduce those conflicts and deal with the ones that occur. he speaks at town meetings and teaches bear safety at public schools, preaching tolerance and listening to complaints. he removes livestock carcasses from ranches.\n\nwhen a conflict arises, sarmento is the person who responds, but he doesn't always get final say.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\nbecause grizzly bears are still federally protected here, sarmento has to call federal wildlife officials before he takes certain actions, like relocating a bear or setting up a trap. it can be annoying at times, he says, but he usually doesn't mind.\n\nthe power dynamic doesn't go unnoticed by ranchers though, many of whom are already suspicious of the federal government.\n\nbradley thinks it's ridiculous that sarmento has to check in with his federal counterparts, and believes that state biologists — free of federal oversight — would be better able to respond to problem bears.\n\nsarmento and others say that little would change. things would be streamlined, he says.\n\ncritics of delisting grizzly bears worry that state management would mean more dead bears, and they're right, in that state management would undoubtedly include hunting.\n\nwyoming and idaho had issued permits to hunt 23 grizzlies last fall, before the federal judge's decision restored federal protections for the bears. montana held off on granting a hunting season, but few doubt that the state would soon do the same.\n\nstate wildlife managers say that hunting is an important part of wildlife management and that it would be carried out in a responsible, highly-regulated way. if bear populations fell below a certain threshold, they'd be relisted.\n\nbradley could care less about hunting. her frustration is more about what she sees as a broken promise, and a feeling that she has no say in how bears are managed.\n\nsarmento hears that frustration from a lot of the locals he interacts with. some, he says, have even stopped collaborating with him on projects.\n\ni certainly hear some animosity to the endangered species act, because people that are living with endangered species feel that their rights are being infringed upon, he says. that recovery goals are going beyond what was originally agreed to.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\ndisagreement over what recovery means\n\nthe question of what constitutes recovery — how many bears there needs to be and where — is at the heart of the grizzly bear delisting debate and it's a difficult thing to answer, because it involves much more than just science.\n\nthe endangered species act says a species is recovered when it is no longer in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, and when it's unlikely to become so within the foreseeable future.\n\nthat leaves a lot of room for interpretation.\n\nand interpretations vary widely.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\nin 1993, a panel of federal, state, tribal and local biologists and stakeholders, called the interagency grizzly bear committee, put out a recovery plan for grizzly bears in the lower 48 states. it set population targets for each of the five populations of grizzlies still living south of canada.\n\nfor yellowstone-area bears, the goal was 500 bears. when they were listed as threatened in 1975, there were as few as 136 bears left. today, scientists estimate there are more than 700 bears in the ecosystem.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\nsome wildlife groups and grizzly advocates question those numbers and the federal government's population counting methodology. others believe the initial recovery goals were set too low.\n\ni think the people that are litigating this, for the conservation groups, it's about what recovery means and what your vision of that is going to be in the future, says jeremy bruskotter, a professor at the school of environment & natural resources at ohio state university. is it curating populations in isolated wilderness areas, or restoring them to wide areas of their historic range?\n\ngrizzly bears used to live from alaska to central mexico, ranging from the pacific coast to missouri. today, they only inhabit 2 percent of that historic range, living in isolated pockets.\n\nthe lack of connectivity between populations was a main reason the federal judge restored endangered species protections for the bears late last year. isolated populations don't have much genetic diversity and there are concerns that a hunt of the animal would prevent them from linking together.\n\nwildlife officials believe those connections will happen naturally, over time. grizzly bears are venturing further afield, they point out, entering places they haven't been for generations.\n\nthe greater yellowstone ecosystem has reached its carrying capacity for bears. it's exporting bears, says dan ashe, director of the u.s. fish and wildlife service under president barack obama. the question this point around, about whether they should be delisted, is more of a values-based question.\n\nit's less a question about the endangered species act, he says, and more a question about the ethics of trophy hunting, or what a person views as an acceptable number of bears.\n\nthat's a perfectly legitimate conversation to have, ashe says. but having that discussion around the delisting process feeds this dialogue that the endangered species act is broken, and that once a species goes on the list it is difficult to impossible to get it off. and, in the long run, that doesn't help the bear, or the prospect of conservation of threatened and endangered species.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\nlegislative attacks, public support\n\nthe narrative that ashe is referring to — that the endangered species act is flawed because animals don't come off it — is a popular one with congressional republicans and others opposed to the law.\n\nin part, because there's some truth to the argument.\n\nin the 45-year history of the endangered species act, fewer than 2 percent of species that have been listed have been recovered and removed.\n\nas a doctor, if i admit 100 patients to the hospital and only three recover enough under my treatment to be discharged, i would deserve to lose my medical license, said sen. john barrasso, r-wyo., chairman of the senate committee on environment and public works, during a hearing on the endangered species act last year.\n\nthe criticism ignores some other relevant information, though.\n\nconservation takes a long time. it took hundreds of years for grizzly bears to be hunted, trapped and driven to the brink of extirpation from the lower 48 states. scientists and conservationists say it's unreasonable to expect that they'd recover in a few decades.\n\nit also ignores the fact that the endangered species act has been incredibly successful at accomplishing its main goal: preventing extinction. ninety-nine percent of the animals that have been listed under the act still exist today.\n\nstill, in the last congress, there were 116 attacks against the endangered species act, according to the center for biological diversity. bills and riders added to them were proposed to delist specific species, limit habitat protections, and to block funding for species like the new mexico meadow jumping mouse. none passed into law.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\nall of these riders and all of these standalone bills keep failing and i think that's because public support for the endangered species act is actually very, very high, says bethany cotton, wildlife program director for wildearth guardians, an environmental group that sued to keep grizzly bears listed.\n\na recent study found that the vast majority of americans, regardless of region or political ideology, support the landmark environmental law. the legal back-and-forth on grizzly bear delisting seemed to have no discernible impact, the study found.\n\nthat concern [that not delisting species hurts the endangered species act] has been sort of a threat that has been leveled for more than a decade and we haven't seen it been proven true, cotton says.\n\nthere is one notable exception though.\n\nin 2011, following a years' long, highly-contentious back-and-forth on the delisting of grey wolves — similar to what's happening now with grizzlies — congress took an unprecedented step.\n\na bipartisan measure, proposed by sen. jon tester, d-mont., and rep. mike simpson, r-idaho, was attached to a budget rider that stripped endangered species protections from grey wolves in their home states.\n\nit was an extraordinary step that some worried would set a dangerous precedent.\n\ndespite loud opposition, the measure passed.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption claire harbage/npr claire harbage/npr\n\nit was the first and only time congress sidestepped the endangered species act, delisting a species on its own. others have since tried to follow suit.\n\nin the last congress, lawmakers proposed to delist a species of jumping mouse, mexican wolves, the american burying beetle, freshwater mussels and grizzly bears.\n\nthe grizzly bear proposal, by rep. liz cheney, r-wyo., would have directed the interior department to delist the bears in the great yellowstone ecosystem and prohibit future judicial review.\n\nwe don't want to have congress becoming the arbiters over the fate of species, ashe says. the longer this lingers, the more likely it is that people will try to find a political solution.\n\nyou're wasting your time\n\ntrina jo bradley stands up in the back of a crowded conference room and squints down at a set of scribbled notes.\n\nhi, my name is trina bradley and i'm the vice president of the marias river livestock association, she begins. we have our share of bears.\n\nbradley drove more than 220

his neighbors don't even call bear biologists anymore when they need to, bradley says. they don't see the point.\n\nthey're so far past the end of their rope, she says, they can't even see it anymore.\n\nbradley isn't there yet. she still comes to these meetings and works with local biologists, representing her neighbors and others who've long since given up.\n\nshe looks back down at her

there will be reprisals.\n\none key concern driving the split between republicans and democrats is outlook: it appears the white house only alerted certain republicans on capitol hill of the attack ahead of time. senior democratic members of congress, including house speaker nancy pelosi, say they were largely left in the dark ahead of the strike.\n\npelosi, who said thursday that the strike risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence, didn't gather details of the operation until afterward, a congressional aide told npr. the house speaker spoke to defense secretary mike esper for 13 minutes, around 9:40 p.m. washington time after the airstrike, the aide said.\n\nin the past, members of the gang of eight, the leaders of both the house and the senate and the chair and ranking members of their respective intelligence committees, had been briefed on such operations. that was not the case this time, senate minority leader chuck schumer said on the senate floor friday.\n\nthis action may well have brought our nation closer to another endless war, exactly the kind of endless war the president promised he would not drag us into, schumer, d-n.y., said.\n\nmoments earlier on the senate floor, majority leader mitch mcconnell said he spoke to esper on details of the attack on iran's master terrorist, adding he is working to coordinate a classified briefing for senators early next week.\n\nalthough i anticipate and welcome a debate about america's interest in foreign policy in the middle east, i recommend that all senators wait to review the facts and hear from the administration before passing much public judgment on this operation and its potential consequences, he said.\n\nearlier friday, south carolina republican sen. lindsey graham told fox & friends that he was told about the planned attack during a recent golf outing with the president. graham was spotted at the president's course in west palm beach, fla., on monday.\n\nfox news via youtube\n\nwhen it comes to the death of general soleimani, there is no one to blame but himself, graham tweeted friday morning. he effectively signed his own death warrant by planning massive attacks against u.s. personnel in iraq and throughout the middle east.\n\nother republican lawmakers lauded the attacks in statements overnight, saying that soleimani was a ruthless leader who directed the deaths of many americans and others. he got what he richly deserved, and all those american soldiers who died by his hand also got what they deserved: justice, arkansas republican sen. tom cotton said shortly following news of the attack.\n\nu.s. officials estimate soleimani, his militia and their iraqi proxies are behind the deaths of scores of american service members during the war in iraq.\n\ndemocrats' criticism of the white house's failure to brief congress ahead of the operation touches on a years-long debate that the president's war powers are woefully outdated. democrats are leading calls for a new legislation addressing the president's authorization for use of military force, or aumf.\n\ncongress last issued these war power directives in 2001 and 2002 in the wake of the sept. 11 attacks, and there has been a push to address iran in a potential aumf.\n\nin june, a measure to ban unauthorized attacks on iran or its officials failed in the republican-controlled senate by a vote of 50 to 40. on friday, virginia democratic sen. tim kaine said he had introduced a new war powers resolution to prevent further escalation of hostilities with iran. we're now at a boiling point, and congress must step in before trump puts even more of our troops in harm's way, he said.\n\nmichigan rep. elissa slotkin, a former cia analyst who specialized in threats in the region, said the administration's next steps are critical.\n\nshe noted that a new war power resolution is needed if further military actions against iran were to continue.\n\nwhat always kept both democratic and republican presidents from targeting soleimani himself was the simple question: was the strike worth the likely retaliation and the potential to pull us into protracted conflict?

are they serious jobs?\n\nabdulaziz: definitely no. definitely no. you should be seen in the office like once every 40 days.\n\nsmith: for some people that never go to work?\n\nabdulaziz: yeah, and no one can fire you. they could just transfer you to other departments.\n\nsmith: that is starting to change. david ottaway is with the wilson center in washington, d.c. he says the saudi economy has slowed to a crawl.\n\ndavid ottaway: you see construction halting. you see the cranes no longer swinging in the air.\n\nsmith: saudi arabia doesn't really have other industries. ottaway says the country's economy is addicted to oil.\n\nottaway: it is so abundant and so easily available, the tendency, unfortunately, is to continue to depend on it.\n\nsmith: all of the country's money comes from one company - saudi aramco. it is almost unimaginably enormous. estimates put it at around $4 trillion. to give you an idea of how big that is, take apple, google, exxon, walmart, citibank and ge. add them all together, and you are halfway there. and we know almost nothing about aramco. it's controlled by the royal family, and it's notoriously secretive. but now that saudi arabia is desperate for new sources of money, it's floating the idea of selling shares of aramco. david ottaway says that would be tricky. if aramco starts taking shareholders' money, those shareholders will start wanting to know things.\n\nottaway: transparency would be a real shock for aramco. if they had to explain to the public how much money they're spending on building palaces and providing to princes - you know, there are probably 5,000, 6,000 princes.\n\nsmith: there are 6,000 princes? that's a lot of princes.\n\nottaway: yeah.\n\nsmith: in the meantime, the government has done something kind of amazing. a few weeks ago, it announced that it would be rolling back subsidies on electricity, water and gas. and for the first time, saudis would pay taxes - a sales tax on some items. abdulaziz, the tech worker in riyadh, says it was shocking.\n\nwhat did you think when he told you that?\n\nabdulaziz: i was a little bit scared.\n\nsmith: why were you scared?\n\nabdulaziz: we don't have taxes anymore in saudi arabia.\n\nsmith: abdulaziz was worried people would freak out. he says it's been ok, but everybody's nervous. everything is getting more expensive, and their whole way of life is changing. ultimately though, abdulaziz thinks that could be a good thing. when the saudi government was paying for everything, many people didn't feel like they had a right to weigh in on what the government did.\n\nabdulaziz: because it's not their money the government's spending on us, so when they start paying, they will understand, like, we deserve this. this is our money.\n\nsmith: now, the people are contributing money to the government. abdulaziz thinks they might feel more entitled to contribute their opinion, too. stacy vanek smith, npr news.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

the tag king steez (ph) was graffitied onto the entrance to mahoning county high school in youngstown, ohio. the mystery of who did it was quickly solved as a tiktok video of 17-year-old nathaniel rogers (ph) spraying the words on the wall went viral. but then a second tiktok video of a different 17-year-old by the name of cole yang (ph) also spray painting the exact same words on the blank door also went viral. obviously, i'm king steez, rogers stated in a follow up video, calling yang a loser and a poser. yang responded with a video in which he says he is the rightful king steez and is willing to take rogers to court to prove it if, quote, that's even a thing. police solved the crime by seizing the students' phones and examining the videos they found there. in one, rogers spray paints the words on the door. in another, yang gives the door a fresh, clean coat of paint and then spray paints the same words himself. in a third, rogers paints over cole's work and then paints the same words for the third time. at this point, the police gave up looking at the video, saying it was like watching paint dry. for now, both students have been charged with cleaning up the vandalism that they each have already cleaned up at least once in what officials are calling a reverse king solomon kind of deal.\n\ndickinson: (laughter).\n\nsagal: two taggers, as they say, claiming the same tag in a graffitied school - your next story of a dibs dilemma comes from amy dickinson.\n\ndickinson: in the 1930s and '40s, authors j.r.r. tolkien and c.s. lewis were members of a literary society called the inklings. the two fantasy writers were friends and rivals. this week, we find out just how petty their rivalry really was. scholars at the british museum have released correspondence between the two men fighting not over a woman or a cricket score but a pixie named tinkle (ph). tinkle was pink with a rosebud mouth, gossamer wings and a puckish air. and both men claimed her as a character in their novels. she is my tinkle, my pickled, tinky (ph) wink, lewis fumed in a letter. tolkien replied, i conjured her. i brought her forth from the midst of my own fertile brain grapes, you moss-covered carbuncle. and lo, it came to pass. neither author wrote of tinkle the pixie. however, the letters have solved an enduring mystery. the origins of an early draft of the lewis novel titled the lion, the witch and the foul-mouthed jackass.\n\nsagal: all right. a feud between the famous authors of fantasy j.r.r. tolkien and c.s. lewis over tinkle the pixie - your last story of people staking the same claim comes from maeve higgins.\n\nmaeve higgins: (singing) oh, baby, i love it - name every day. yeah, yeah. i want to tell you i love (speaking) a lovely name for a lovely new person - baby. two different instagram influencers have named their child baby, and it has torn their influenceship (ph) apart. sasha benz and jessica hart both claimed the name baby for their baby. hart says she chose the name because of dirty dancing and plans to raise baby exclusively in round rooms, so nobody can put baby in a corner. benz named her baby baybi years ago, though she spells it b-a-y-b-i. it is pronounced baby. benz is reportedly outraged that hart copied her baby baybi's name for her baby baby. as an influencer, the last thing she would ever want to do is to influence somebody. it is not yet clear if either mother will change baby's name as baby grows to a more mature name - for example, old baby. we'll see.\n\nkim booster: (laughter).\n\nsagal: so here are your stories, each of which involve two people fighting over one thing. was it from joel kim booster, two graffiti artists arguing that they were the ones who tagged their school king steez? was it from amy dickinson, the two great authors j.r.r. tolkien and c.s. lewis arguing over which of them could use the character tinkle the pixie? or from maeve higgins, two well-known influencers who each claim the idea to name their baby baby? which of these is the real story of a rivalry we found in the week's news?\n\neric: i'm going to have to go with the graffiti story.\n\nsagal: you're really - you're going to go with joel's story of the graffiti of the one kid painting king steez, the other kid coming over, painting it over, making it all clean and then doing king steez, and then the first kid coming back and saying, i'm not going to have that, painting it over again and tagging it king steez. that's your choice?\n\neric: yeah, my wife's probably going to kill me.\n\nsagal: all right. even though your wife is going to kill you, i understand that your choice is joel's story. well, we spoke to someone who is familiar with the real story.\n\nlindsey weber: so there are two australian influencers, and they're in a feud after both of them named their babies baby.\n\nsagal: so that was lindsey weber from the podcast who? weekly. unfortunately, as you heard, you did not get the question right. disappointing your wife, no doubt. but you did win a point for joel for his convincing lie.\n\neric: it's all right. i just couldn't imagine that somebody was going to name their baby baby, but...\n\nsagal: totally understand.\n\neric: all right, well, thanks for letting me play.\n\nsagal: thank you for playing. take care.\n\n(soundbite of song, baby)\n\njustin bieber: (singing) like, baby, baby, baby, oh. like, baby, baby, baby, no. like, baby, baby...\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
are we flattening the curve? states keep watch on coronavirus 'doubling times'\n\nas coronavirus numbers have ticked steadily upwards in some u.s. states and cities, officials have watched one specific figure to see whether they're facing a flattening curve or runaway outbreak: the doubling rate.\n\nsimply put, it's how many days it takes for the number of coronavirus cases, hospitalizations or deaths to double. the shorter the time frame, the steeper the curve and the faster the growth.\n\nin an encouraging sign, health officials in several states are starting to see doubling rates slow, which means the curve is flattening. hospitalizations and deaths are still growing, but not as quickly.\n\nas new york's outbreak has heated up, gov. andrew cuomo often refers to doubling times to signal how things are going. we had a doubling of cases every two days, he told the public on march 30. we now have a doubling of cases every six days. so while the overall number is going up, the rate of doubling is actually going down.\n\nthis past week, new york city's doubling rate for new cases has fallen to approximately every eight days, as of thursday. though deaths continued to rise, cuomo says new hospitalizations may have reached a plateau.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above? click here.\n\nwhile a day or two difference in doubling time may not seem like much, it can have a massive effect on how many patients are flooding into hospitals, potentially overwhelming medical systems.\n\nfor constant exponential growth, you would expect cases to double consistently over a three- or four-day period, says nick jewell, a biostatistician at the university of california, berkeley. the whole point of social distancing is to make that doubling time longer and longer.\n\nthough other communities across the country are tracking slower doubling rates than new york, these are still a cause for concern.\n\nif we can slow doubling time to 10 days, we might have enough hospital beds to handle the surge and get fully through the surge, said chris farnitano, health officer for contra costa county in the san francisco bay area on march 31. currently, we're at about eight days on our doubling time for our hospital cases.\n\nas of this week, that county is in better shape than it expected. for the past seven days, the number of coronavirus patients in costa costa's hospitals has remained flat.\n\nexperts say no matter what a community's doubling time is, the key is seeing it get longer.\n\nthe slowing of the rate is enormously important, says jewell. ultimately, you will end up with a smaller fraction of the population infected if you lower the rate. and you buy a lot of time by slowing it and that gives an opportunity for preparation by hospitals and health care workers.\n\nwhile many officials are watching new coronavirus cases, epidemiologists warn that case counts may not be the most reliable indicator of how the outbreak is spreading. testing has been rolled out inconsistently across states because of lack of available tests, swabs or capacity at laboratories, so in many places, the true number of positive cases is unknown.\n\ncalifornia saw a spike in new coronavirus cases over the weekend of april 4-5, but over the same time period, labs finally processed the bulk of a 50,000 test backlog, some of which were collected from patients as long as a week earlier.\n\nhospitalizations and deaths are more concrete numbers, but they're delayed. so trends aren't seen for weeks since it takes more time for patients to develop serious symptoms. hospitals and public health officials have also been unable or have refused to release hospitalization data.\n\nlonger doubling times produce a smaller, flatter surge, but they also mean the public must continue social distancing to maintain that trajectory.\n\nthe trade-off is that we have to be doing the intervention for a longer period of time, says jewell. but that's over having a catastrophic number of infections and a high number of deaths.\n\nultimately, officials are watching for the peak of the curve, when coronavirus cases and deaths begin steadily decreasing day after day. but even that can be elusive if people change their behavior.\n\nif you say 'the peak is going to be tomorrow' and people start rushing around again, then the peak won't be tomorrow because people start causing transmission, jewell says.
some employers are rethinking telework, citing a need for better collaboration\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption dean mitchell/getty images/istock dean mitchell/getty images/istock\n\nthe speed of digital technology has allowed workers to be mobile and flexible, and more employers continue to embrace remote work policies.\n\nbut it has also created demand for continuous updates and real-time collaboration. and that change has driven some companies — including ibm, best buy and yahoo — to recall some of their remote workforces back into the office.\n\nin the 1970s, ibm was one of the pioneers of telework, and over time, 20 percent of its employees worked remotely. last year, it decided to recall some remote-work employees, a move that seemed to go against decades of policies aimed at supporting telework.\n\ndiane gherson, senior vice president of human resources for ibm, says that is not the case. the shift in work policy affects about 2 percent of its 380,000 workers, she says, and reflects changing workplace demands.\n\nmillennial employees say they want to work with and learn from their older peers, and ibm's own employee surveys showed those who worked remotely were less engaged or motivated.\n\nbut most importantly, gherson says, there has been a shift in how work itself gets done: this is a real tidal wave, and that is the need for continuous innovation.\n\ngherson says customers expect speedy fixes and updates. to achieve that, software developers started working together in rooms without walls, so they could talk through changes in real time.\n\nibm isn't alone; reddit and bank of america, among others, have also recalled some remote-work employees. gherson says employers in many industries, not just in software, are seeing the same shift.\n\nloading...\n\nit's bleeding into other forms of work — so you're seeing that in marketing, as an example, where you see campaigns that are continuously getting feedback from the market on an hourly basis, she says.\n\nrobert martin, a software consultant and early advocate of what is known as the agile work method, says collocation is a key part of collaboration.\n\nthe collaborative nature of being agile means that people need to be close to each other, they need to be in the same room. because we're making many rapid changes in sequence, we have to be able to communicate those changes quickly, he says.\n\nmartin was among 17 software developers who, in 2001, created and signed a document called the agile manifesto. the simple premise was that building software needs to take into account the very nature of the product — incorporating and welcoming change at every stage.\n\nthe word 'software' means, you know, flexible product, martin says.\n\nhe and his fellow developers didn't think the manifesto would gain traction, but they posted it online and tens of thousands of engineers signed the document. agile became a movement that other industries modeled.\n\nof course, not everyone thinks remote work hurts collaboration. in fact, overall, telework continues to increase. according to the society for human resource management, 40 percent of employers allow employees to regularly work from home.\n\njay friedman, chief operating officer for the goodway group, a digital marketing firm, says working from home is important to his company; only a handful of its workers on any given day head into the office.\n\nwe found that the talent was not necessarily all in philadelphia, where headquarters is, or all in dallas, where i am, he says.\n\nfriedman says some things are challenging, like having to terminate an employee over video conference. but overall, he says, the company's setup actually improved communication and coordination.\n\nbeing remote forced us to document more — so document decisions, document learning, training, etc. — and that actually reduced the amount of time and back-and-forth, keeping everyone on the same page and on task, friedman says.
facing slumping sales, coke hopes to catch a wave of fans with new flavors\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of the coca-cola co. via ap/ap courtesy of the coca-cola co. via ap/ap\n\ncoca-cola introduced four new fruit-flavored versions of diet coke this week in an effort to entice former soda drinkers and lacroix-guzzling seltzer lovers.\n\nthe new flavors — feisty cherry, twisted mango, ginger lime and zesty blood orange — are sold in slimmer, redesigned cans. they were launched as part of the beverage company's endeavor to offset slumping diet coke sales, which have steadily declined since the height of soft-drink consumption in the mid-2000s.\n\naccording to beverage digest, while diet coke is still the second most popular soda in the u.s. (coke tops the list), sales of the drink have fallen every year since 2006. derek thompson, a senior editor for the atlantic, told wbur's here & now that the decline is part of a broad shift toward bottled water, flavored seltzer and energy drinks. thompson calls this latest rebranding a moment of panic for the beverage company.\n\neverything that people wanted out of diet coke up till say 2000 [to] 2005 has essentially just been outsourced to other beverages that seem to be doing the same thing better, he says, in reference to the hydration, energy and fizzy aspects of soft drinks.\n\nthe abandonment of diet coke highlights a change in american drinking tastes, thompson says. the amount of bottled water consumed in the u.s. surpassed soda for the first time ever in 2016, according to data from beverage marketing corporation.\n\nsoda consumption has also dropped because more people are now looking to coffee for a caffeine fix. at the peak of soda's popularity, soft drinks outsold coffee by a three-to-one margin in the u.s. by the 2020s, industry analysts predict coffee sales will outpace soda.\n\ncoca-cola says the new fruit flavors are also an attempt to capture the tastes of young people, who have boosted sales of flavored sparking water, such as lacroix, polar and sparkling ice, by more than 10 percent each year.\n\nwe're modernizing what has made diet coke so special for a new generation, rafael acevedo, coca-cola north america's group director for diet coke, said in a statement. millennials are now thirstier than ever for adventures and new experiences, and we want to be right by their side.\n\nthe issue may also be less about diet coke and more about the health risks of soda in general and artificial sweeteners, thompson says. research has shown drinking diet soda every day can put people at a higher risk of stroke and other vascular problems.\n\nthere is a growing consumer focus on health that has hurt soda's domination, he says. in many ways, the 'diet' in diet soda used to be an attractor. you drank this because you wanted to be thin. but now the concept of a diet cola seems paradoxical and wrong to a lot of today's drinkers.\n\ncoca-cola is also likely to face challenges in getting current diet coke drinkers to try to the new flavors. the company, which alienated customers in 1985 with a reformulated version of coke, said it tested more than 30 flavor combinations before introducing the new products.\n\ni am very much a coke product purist, especially when it comes to diet coke, ayana lage, a 24-year-old writer from fort lauderdale, fla., told the wall street journal. the chances of me branching out are slim to none.
saturday sports: wimbledon, milwaukee brewers\n\nscott simon talks about wimbledon with howard bryant of espn.com. they also talk about the second half of the 2017 major league baseball season and the dominance of the milwaukee brewers.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nand now it's time for sports.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nsimon: an upset at wimbledon, second half of the baseball season's starting. who's going to be upset in the second half? and what about those rampaging milwaukee brewers? we're joined now by howard bryant of espn and espn the magazine. good morning, howard.\n\nhoward bryant: good morning, scott. how are you?\n\nsimon: i'm fine. thank you and maybe better at the moment than venus williams. garbine muguruza of spain defeated her 7-5, 6-0 at wimbledon today.\n\nbryant: absolute, total destruction on the part of garbine muguruza - fantastic win for her. she is the first woman to ever defeat both serena and venus williams in a final - in a major final...\n\nsimon: wow.\n\nbryant: ...because she beat serena in the french open final - i'm sorry - yes, yes, in the french open final. and it just feels like you're looking at a player who has everything it takes to be one of the great players in the game right now. obviously, for venus williams, very disappointing. she had her opportunities in the first set. she was up 5-4, had two set points and did not convert, ended up not winning another game. she lost 7-5, 6-0, had an opportunity at the beginning of the second set. but muguruza was just too good. and, sometimes, we want the results. we want the results more than we want the game itself. and it really is a fantastic effort by muguruza because she did not let venus back into this match. she saw a championship in front of her, and she took it.\n\nsimon: what about the guys tomorrow?\n\nbryant: well, obviously, you've got roger federer going for his 19th - the ageless roger federer. you've got roger federer, of course. he's pretty good, as well. and he is going up against a player who beat him in 2014 at the u.s. open, the semifinals, marin cilic. cilic is a big hitter. cilic is 6-foot-6, hits the ball about 130, 133 miles an hour on serve. this is his first wimbledon final. but i think everyone is looking for roger federer to win his second major this year and 19th overall in his 8th wimbledon. there's nothing he can't do, and he's playing great tennis. it would be a big upset for roger to lose tomorrow. but, once again, you look at a guy like cilic. in boxing, we say he's got a puncher's chance because he hits the ball very hard.\n\nsimon: second half of the baseball season's beginning. yankees, red sox seem to be back. dodgers are way out in the west. the rampaging milwaukee brewers are really an unexpected bright spot in...\n\nbryant: well, absolutely. absolutely. and i think that, again, this goes back to something that you and i talk about quite often on this show - is that the game is hard. and i think you have to appreciate the game is. and i think after the last couple years, people look at the chicago cubs, and they started using the d word. d for dynasty. and it doesn't work that way. i think that once the cubs won that championship last year, everything was going to change for them.\n\nand you still had to come out and play. and there were going to be other teams out there that were going to go out and do their thing. nobody was going to expect that it was going to be the brewers who were going to do this second half - the first half - and go into the second half as well as they've been playing. they've got a half dozen players that are making the major league minimum. they've got ryan braun and a bunch of guys no one's ever heard of.\n\nbut the question when you have a team like milwaukee is, are they built for 162, or are they built for 81 and 100? in other words, somewhere in there in those dog days of august, are they going to realize, oh, we're tired, and, oh, we're not supposed to be that good. and, suddenly, the moment begins to overtake them. if not, could be a very exciting year. the milwaukee brewers have not been to the world series since when, scott? 1982. a good year, wasn't it?\n\nsimon: yeah. it's still last century. howard bryant, thanks so much.\n\nbryant: my pleasure.\n\n(soundbite of reggie young's exit 209)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
evangelicals rally for trump\n\nevangelicals supporting president trump rallied in miami friday. it comes after a major evangelical publication called for trump to be removed from office.\n\nleila fadel, host:\n\npresident trump shared the news of soleimani's killing before an especially friendly audience. he was at an evangelicals for trump rally in miami last night. many evangelical christians see president trump as their protector, and he used soleimani's assassination to drive home that message.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npresident donald trump: he was plotting attacks against americans, but now we've ensured that his atrocities have been stopped for good. they are stopped for good. i don't know if you know what was happening, but he was planning a very major attack. and we got him.\n\nfadel: npr's tom gjelten was at the rally and joins us now.\n\ntom gjelten, byline: hi, leila.\n\nfadel: so we've heard a lot of concerns raised about what might follow now in the aftermath of that attack. did president trump have anything to say about those concerns?\n\ngjelten: nothing at all, actually. he didn't dwell on the attack all that much. he said the killing of soleimani is a warning that if anyone values their own life, they'd better not threaten american lives. but that was about it. he moved on pretty quickly to focus on the things he sees evangelicals as caring about - social issues, abortion, gun rights. this was a campaign rally. it was billed as the launch of an evangelicals for trump coalition for the 2020 election.\n\nfadel: so as i understand it, this rally was announced very quickly after the evangelical magazine christianity today came out with an editorial calling for trump to be removed from office because of his grossly immoral character. did he mention that?\n\ngjelten: he did not, but there is no question he was stung by that attack. christianity today is an important evangelical publication, and it's pretty clear trump felt some need to show there are still a lot of evangelicals sticking by him - that christianity today does not speak for them. in fact, a lot of big pro-trump evangelical leaders were at this rally enthusiastically praising him - people like paula white, who leads a megachurch here in florida, and pastor robert jeffress, who leads a big baptist congregation in dallas.\n\ntrump made no mention of those evangelicals who are critical of his moral failings. instead, he cited what he regards as his accomplishments, like appointing conservative judges or moving the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem. he made just this one cryptic comment about his own character.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\ntrump: pastor jeffress can tell you i'm good at getting things done. i may not be perfect, but i get things done, right? right, robert?\n\ngjelten: so there you go, leila. he admits he's not perfect, but that's as far as he goes. but i'll tell you something. with evangelicals, that's actually a good thing to say because evangelical christians emphasize that we're all sinners. they focus on the importance of redemption. so when trump admits to not being perfect, that can actually resonate.\n\nfadel: now, this rally was at a church that serves a lot of latino evangelicals. is outreach part of the reason the trump campaign chose it?\n\ngjelten: and it is true, leila, they did choose this church. it's rey jesus church, the king jesus church. the pastor here, guillermo maldonado - apostle maldonado, as he likes to be called - is himself from honduras. many of his parishioners are latino. in fact, i'd say at least half the people at this rally were hispanic. and that's a change from other trump rallies where it's been largely a white audience. many hispanic evangelicals are fairly conservative on social issues, and the trump campaign would like their support. florida is a swing state, and hispanic evangelicals are swing voters.\n\nfadel: npr's tom gjelten, thank you so much.\n\ngjelten: you bet.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
comic roy wood jr. taps into america's psyche on 'the daily show'\n\nin 2018, wood explained how the years he spent performing in comedy clubs in the south and midwest — sometimes in places where he felt unsafe as a black man — prepared him for the daily show.\n\ndavid bianculli, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm david bianculli, editor of the website tv worth watching, sitting in for terry gross. today's first guest, comic roy wood jr., is a correspondent for the daily show. his first appearance on that show was the same day trevor noah took over as host. wood also is the current host of the network's this is not happening series and stars in his own standup comedy specials. the new one premiering tonight on comedy central is called no one loves you and tackles such controversial subjects as standing at sporting events for the national anthem. the new york times just said of wood that he might be the closest thing we have now to dick gregory.\n\n(soundbite of comedy special, no one loves you)\n\nroy wood jr: if you want more people to stand for the anthem, change the song.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: that's half the problem right there. it's just the lyrics to the anthem - we can stand to any song. patriotism is a feeling. let's not forget that. patriotism ain't no one song. for as long as we stand and agree that people died for us to kick it, we can do that to any song. you can do that to bruno mars. what's more american than bruno mars?\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: they say america is a melting pot. well, damn it, i want to stand to bruno mars. he literally looks like every race at the same time.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: what's better than that? what's more american than us standing with the hawaiian, mexican, white, lesbian, jewish man...\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: ...to honor the troops?\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: you're mad about the damn anthem. man, please, let's be real about the anthem. first and foremost, the beat is whack. it don't go hard.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: you love america, but you ain't downloaded the national anthem to your phone.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: if you was at the club and the dj started playing the national anthem, you'd be like, what the [expletive] is wrong with this dj?\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: you ain't at the dj booth, hey, man, play some of that patriotism [expletive]; that's what i like; that's the jam.\n\nbianculli: terry gross spoke with roy wood jr. last year and started by playing a clip from the year before, a segment from wood's 2017 comedy central special father figure. in that one, wood, who is southern and african-american, kicked things off by walking to the mic and instantly approaching yet another sensitive topic - the confederate flag.\n\n(soundbite of comedy special, father figure)\n\nwood jr: but if we get rid of the confederate flag...\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: ...how am i going to know who the dangerous white people are?\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: i'm just saying the flag had a couple of upsides. let's just be real about it.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: i ain't saying keep it around, but i grew up in the south. i can't tell you how many times the confederate flag came in handy.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: you're stopping for gas at a strange place at 2 in the morning. you see that flag hanging from the window. you know this is not the place to get gas.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: and you keep it moving.\n\n(applause)\n\nwood jr: what's the rush to get rid of the flag, especially if you're white? if you're white, you should want to keep the flag for a little while longer so at least black folks will know you're cool.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: because if you're white and you're not an [expletive], that's the one thing that helps us identify you. you get rid of that flag, we'll be (vocalizing).\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: we've got to figure out a way to know who the cool white people - cool white people, we just got to start giving y'all wristbands or handstamps.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: just something you can show in a dark alley. let us know you're down with the struggle. that'd be cool.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: give me your money, white dude - like, whoa, ah-ah-ah (ph).\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: i'm so sorry. come on through. come on through. no, they got the wristbands. they good. listen, put this wristband on - this one over here now. in case it go down, you're going to have that wristband on.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nterry gross, byline: roy wood jr., welcome to fresh air. so that bit sounds like it has a lot of truth behind it. did you feel, when you were growing up in alabama, like confederate flags warned you away from places and people that spell trouble?\n\nwood jr: yeah. i think the difference between southern racism and northern racism is that in the south, you know where you stand. and there's - i don't want to say a freedom in that. but when you know where the boundaries are, then you kind of know how to play the game a little bit more. so if someone's going to openly say, i don't like you people, and i'm going to hang a flag over my door to remind you i don't like you people, then i know not to eat at that business. how much cleaner is that than me sitting there and getting bad service for an hour and a half, complaining to the manager and nothing happening? which one is more tormenting? it's more - the confederate flag is literally more convenient. you saved me 90 minutes.\n\ngross: you say you performed at strange places. did you ever perform at a bar or a club that had a confederate flag?\n\nwood jr: absolutely. i've been called the n-word from the stage by somebody in the crowd, and the club owner did nothing to defend me. so there's definitely been questionable situations. but at the end of the day, give me my $50 that i drove nine hours to get paid (laughter), so i can be on my way back to birmingham. cities like that - traditionally, my protocol was to never stay at the hotel that the venue provided. so i'd either sleep in my car, or i would stay at a - you know, i would drive three or four hours out of town. like, i would split the drive that night and just drive halfway back to birmingham and then sleep somewhere else because i just felt like in those towns - if i'm one of the few black people, and i'm here telling the jokes and, you know, ha-ha-ha (ph), it's all fun and games. but to some people there, it isn't a game.\n\nyou know, there's a level of respect you have to have for someone who's bold enough to say that they don't like you and that they'll call you one of the most hated words in the history of this country. somebody like that might be motivated to come find you after the show. and i'm the only person in town with alabama plates. so yeah, get the hell out of there. and, you know, thankfully, every gig wasn't like that. but i'm thankful for those gigs. so, you know, it's - if nothing more, my first nine, 10 years of comedy were just a very, very bitter education on the psyche of the middle of the country.\n\ngross: why were you even booked in places that had such a kind of racist audience?\n\nwood jr: 'cause they had a microphone. i didn't care. why should i care? nine times out of...\n\ngross: did they know that you were african-american when they booked you?\n\nwood jr: yeah, yeah, but they figured black people are funny. but you just better not date my daughter (laughter) or hang around town too late. like, i did a show in johnson city, tenn., which is a eastern tennessee mountain town. and people would come up after the show. and there's some town - there's some neighboring town over. and supposedly, there's a sign that says, don't let the sun set on your black ass here in this town, where you basically had sundown warnings where you had to leave by the time lights were out. and this is 2002, 2003. this is recent.\n\nso when you're booked in a weird city and the booker calls you and goes, hey, man, i need you to go do blah, blah, blah, arkansas and you look at it on a map and you can see that it's - i call it the blue line. it's the freeway. you know, the freeways on, like, the atlases are blue. they're denoted by the color blue. so i could look into about how far off the blue line a city was whether or not i was going to have problems. and it looks like a problem city. ok, i'm going to go into town late. i'm going to pull up right to the venue. i'm going to do my gig, get my money. and then i'm leaving.\n\ngross: so i want to play another clip from your comedy special father figure. and in this, you know, you're talking about how we live in two different americas and that when white people don't understand what african-americans experience, it doesn't necessarily mean that the white people are racist. sometimes it's just that the white people are uninformed. and then as an example, you talk about going to a best buy where you had to educate a white salesclerk. you had just bought a cellphone case.\n\nwood jr: correct.\n\ngross: and the salesclerk told you that you didn't need a bag for it, so you had to explain why you needed the bag.\n\n(soundbite of comedy special, father figure)\n\nwood jr: dude at best buy going to decide i don't need a bag with my purchase.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: you just have an iphone case. i figured you could just pop that open. no, i ain't popping [expletive]. you put it in the bag.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: i need that in a bag. what do you need a bag for? i don't understand why you need a bag. it's wasteful. recycle. don't you care about the earth? i go, sir, this has nothing to do with the earth. i'm a black man in america. i've got to leave this store with a bag, bro.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: it's about safety. i'm black. i don't get the luxury of just walking out with [expletive] in my hand. that is a roll of the dice. that is a horrifying day if i - no, not only do i need that bag. i need that receipt.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: and staple it to the outside. i don't want a receipt in my hand. you staple my receipt to the outside like chinese carryout. and i'll hold it up in the air. i'll lion king - i'll hukana matata an iphone case out of best buy. and it's not his fault. he just didn't understand. he thought he was saving the earth, but he was saving a life. that's what was doing.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: that's my guest roy wood jr...\n\nwood jr: (laughter).\n\ngross: ...on his recent comedy special father figure. so is that a true story? did that really happen to you?\n\nwood jr: yeah, that happened in seattle. and it wasn't as flagrant as i made the salesclerk out to be in the joke. but it was me very politely explaining to this guy, i don't want to walk out of here without a bag. i just don't. like, you're cool, but the yellow shirt up there at the door - he doesn't know, or he's not going to assume. i have no bag, no receipt. i'm just walking out with something in my hand. that concept is so foreign to me as a minority and having been harassed and followed around stores before and suspected of shoplifting. why would i give someone invitation to question whether or not i'm operating within the boundaries of the law?\n\ngross: i thought it was so interesting that you chose somebody to tell a story about who perceives himself as doing the right thing, as being very environmental-minded and therefore trying to not give you a plastic bag but not getting what it would mean for you to walk out without the bag and the receipt.\n\nwood jr: yeah. and in that regard...\n\ngross: i mean, you have the receipt, but it would probably be in your pocket. and then if you reach for it, who knows how that would be interpreted?\n\nwood jr: yeah, it's just - no, it's - if - i don't care if i bought a tic tac. i want a bag.\n\n(laughter)\n\nwood jr: i want the biggest bag you have just to make sure. and you know - and that's where when it comes to educating people about issues of race and just - here's a snippet of black life you might not have considered, something as simple about a bag. like, for me, i enjoy being able to find material that specific in that regard because it gives me an opportunity to just show a little bit more of my world and what i believe african-americans go through. and it's not to vilify this man because i can't say that he's racist because he didn't know that a bag could get me harassed. if he doesn't have a black friend that's ever explained that to him, when was he ever going to learn it? here's a joke for me to explain it to all of y'all.\n\nbianculli: roy wood jr. speaking to terry gross in 2018. more after a break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of sonny rollins song, toot, toot, tootsie)\n\nbianculli: this is fresh air. let's get back to terry's 2018 interview with comic roy wood jr. the daily show correspondent's latest comedy special, no one loves you, premieres tonight.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: can i ask you about the neighborhood you grew up in and if your parents worked, what they did for a living?\n\nwood jr: so i grew up in birmingham, ala., on the west side. the neighborhood is called west end, zip code 35211, one of the worst zip codes in the city in terms of crime statistics at the time. i haven't checked the crime census data (laughter) since i left in '96 for college, but - pretty rough neighborhood on the backside of the crack era, backside of - we moved into west end on the back end of white flight. so in the '80s, we had a couple of white neighbors.\n\nbut you know, by the early '90s and, you know - crack had really taken over. it was pretty much an all-black neighborhood. the one thing that i've kind of joked about sometimes - but it's actually true - is that if you're going to live in gang territory, it behooves you to live deep in gang territory because where i lived in birmingham, most of the shootings were happening where territories met - like on border lines, almost, if you will. so there were a lot of bad people, but a lot of the bad stuff that happened in the hood happened more so on the outskirt areas of - in relation to where i lived.\n\nthe saving grace for me and my neighborhood was that my parents bought me a really nice basketball goal. and there was a park up the street from my house called powderly park. and powderly park had all the - you know, it was a municipal city park, and they had all the hoops. and you know, it would be bangers out there. and powderly park sat on the edge of gangster disciple and vice lord territory, so sometimes it would go down at powderly park. so my mom didn't really want me around that element. so i - and i've never talked with her about this, but my guess is that her ideology was if the boy likes shooting basketball, let's put a basketball hoop in the yard, and that way, he won't be at powderly park if something goes down.\n\nand we had - it's just - i don't know if it's fate or what, man. but we had a house, one of the few houses in the neighborhood with a two-car garage - a very wide two-car garage - which meant the way the goal was set up, you could play almost half court if you played off into the dirt off of the driveway. so we basically had half court, and we had the best basketball goal with a breakaway rim because the city park - the goals always break because they're rusted and crusty, and they replace them with other rusty and crusty rims. so all the gang bangers came to our house to shoot hoops, so i met everybody in the hood.\n\ngross: all the gangbangers came.\n\nwood jr: yeah. bangers would come. regular kids would come.\n\ngross: but the goal was to keep you out of trouble, and all the...\n\nwood jr: yeah, but...\n\ngross: ...troublemakers are coming to play basketball.\n\nwood jr: but - so then you asked me what my father did, and here's how it ties in.\n\ngross: ok.\n\nwood jr: my father was a radio personality in the city.\n\ngross: oh.\n\nwood jr: and he was highly respected. my dad was a civil rights journalist back in the '60s and '70s. he was embedded - any march you can find any footage of, i'm sure my dad is no more than two or three steps behind dr. king covering the march. and so when it comes to black political talk and when it comes to black political commentary and playing the blues and - my dad did morning news on the radio. my father was the voice of the city of birmingham for a very long time. his name rang out. and out of respect to my father, guys would leave guns around the corner. they would leave their liquor up the street. and when they came to our house, it was switzerland. so you might see a vice lord and a gangster disciple. it's plausible right there in our driveway.\n\nand there's no drama out of respect to my father and my mom because my mom also didn't take no smack off of anybody. and i think there's something to that, you know, it takes a village mindset of showing kids, you know? and my mom would bring ice water out. like, she was nice. so i grew up in a bad neighborhood, but i had a lot of good - i had a lot of circumstances in my favor that kept me on the good side of the wrong people.\n\ngross: what kind of show did your father do?\n\nwood jr: my father did - he did a jazz show. he did a political commentary show. but he also did morning news as well. so he was - like, on your way to work - and in these days in the '80s, you have to remember that black radio was very consolidated. so a black station in the '80s and '90s, before the, you know, corporate split of the genres of music - you would get r&b and upbeat '70s black music during the day. you would get current pop hits - black pop hits in the middle of the day. and then at night was rap, so all black people listened to the same black station at a different time of day to hear their favorite genre of music. so no matter your age, you knew who my father was.\n\ngross: wow, that's (laughter) - that must've been amazing. now, you started out as a journalism student in college. did your father inspire you to head in a journalism...\n\nwood jr: (laughter).\n\ngross: ...to a journalism career? - a goal that you did not (laughter) exactly fulfill. but...\n\nwood jr: no, not really.\n\ngross: ...kind of close - i mean, you're doing the daily show. so there's a lot of news in that. it's just a comedy take on real news.\n\nwood jr: i did everything in my power to not be like my father...\n\ngross: why?\n\nwood jr: ...you know? and - because it's all journalism and radio. and it was cool. but i was an adrenaline junkie. i wanted to be a firefighter. and up until my father's death in my senior year of high school, that - when my father died, i was still hanging onto being a firefighter. and coming around into the spring of my high school senior year, i started noticing this guy stuart scott on espn. and stuart scott spoke like me but talked about sports. and he'd crack jokes. and i go, hell, that's the same thing we do every day at baseball practice. i talk about sports. i crack jokes. i could do that.\n\nand it wasn't out of disrespect to stuart scott. it was just he does it so effortless. i thought, hell, so do i. if - and that was the first time i saw a version of myself doing something. and so i go, what does stuart - what do i need to major in to do that? journalism - cool, sign me up. and that's how i found the path to journalism. and then ironically, here we are 20 years later. and i'm a black man giving commentary to people about the state of the black condition, which is exactly what my father did only with no punch lines.\n\ngross: so you carry his name. you're roy wood jr. and in birmingham, where you grew up, your father's name really meant something. after he died, what was the significance of the name? did people remember him for a long time? were you still seen as his son for a long time while you lived in birmingham?\n\nwood jr: in birmingham, i'll always be my father's son. that's just what it is. and there's nothing i can do to change that. you know, he was first. he was first, and he was impactful. and to be fair, he said a hell of a lot more things that mattered than i did. you know, and even when i came back to birmingham after college - i came back in '01. and i ended up hosting a morning show at the same station that my father used to work. at this point, the station was dedicated hip-hop. and there had been a split in the genres and all of that. but, you know, there were a lot of people in the building, a lot of the engineers. and, you know, some of the people in sales who worked with my father. there are people in radio in birmingham to this day as we speak, who - the only reason they have a job is because my father gave them an internship back in the '90s.\n\ngross: it's really been such a pleasure talking with you. thank you so much for joining us.\n\nwood jr: oh, thank you.\n\nbianculli: roy wood jr. speaking to terry gross last year. his latest comedy central special no one loves you premieres tonight.\n\n(soundbite of christian mcbride's who's making love)\n\nbianculli: after a break, we hear from actor alan alda. jazz critic kevin whitehead reviews a reissue of studio sessions from 1963 by eric dolphy. and i review the new tnt mini series i am the night. i'm david bianculli. and this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of christian mcbride's who's making love)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
queens, n.y., residents fight 3rd homeless shelter in their neighborhood\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mark lennihan/ap mark lennihan/ap\n\nthe new york city department of homeless services is moving forward with plans to convert a hotel into a shelter for homeless families in blissville, queens.\n\nthe new shelter at the fairfield inn will be the third to open in the tiny long island city neighborhood over the past few months. residents are protesting the new shelter, which is one of 90 that mayor bill de blasio plans to open in the city over the next few years.\n\nblissville residents insist their opposition to the new shelter is not because they don't want people who are homeless in their backyard. instead, they fear that the homeless will outnumber permanent residents in an area that already lacks basic resources, says maria davis, vice president of the blissville civic association.\n\ni think it's a great place if you own a home. for the homeless, the most vulnerable people, it's not a good place because there's nothing there for them, she tells here & now's jeremy hobson. to come to blissville in the middle of nowhere – for them to be warehoused in an environment of warehouses – it just makes it worse for them.\n\nblissville is small community of 450 nestled between a 365-acre cemetery, the long island expressway and newtown creek. the neighborhood lacks critical services, including grocery stores, laundromats, urgent care centers and hospitals, davis says. the closest subway station is almost a mile away.\n\nresidents are also aggrieved because the neighborhood already has two new homeless shelters, one that houses about 100 single men and another for 150 adults and children. with the addition of 154 families at the fairfield inn, people who are homeless will soon outnumber residents.\n\nthe mayor's office says it wants every neighborhood to do its fair share in the city's effort to phase out the use of cluster housing and commercial hotel facilities to house the homeless. for years, the city has relied on run-down apartment buildings in order to meet its legal requirement to provide shelter to those who qualify.\n\nthis expensive strategy was a haphazard approach to deal with rising homelessness in new york city, which has reached the highest levels since the great depression. according to the coalition for the homeless, there were nearly 63,000 people sleeping in the city's shelter system each night in march of this year.\n\nour plan distributes resources and responsibility in a fair way for the first time in our city's history, said jaclyn rothenberg, a spokesperson for de blasio. this decades-old challenge wasn't created overnight, and it won't be solved overnight, but we are headed in the right direction.\n\nblissville residents argue they have done their fair share. but the city department of homeless services says those two shelters will be phased out when the new permanent shelter at the fairfield inn is up and running.\n\nthis quote, unquote permanent shelter is just a fairfield inn being repurposed once again. and that's not what we should be doing with the homeless is continuing to warehouse them in commercial hotels, said city councilman jimmy van bramer, who represents long island city.\n\nlawmakers from all levels of government are skeptical of the city's plan to deal with the homeless crisis, which has been exacerbated by a lack of affordable housing. nearly one-third of new yorkers in shelters are employed but remain homeless.\n\naccording to the turning the tide of homelessness in nyc plan, all neighborhoods in the city would be equally responsible for hosting homeless shelters, a letter from local lawmakers to de blasio states. this is not the case in blissville. the request for a third shelter in such close proximity to two existing ones oversteps reasonable limits.\n\nthroughout the city, residents are mounting opposition to shelters. in rapidly gentrifying crown heights, brooklyn, residents were outraged by plans to open three new shelters. in midtown manhattan, people are fighting plans to repurpose a shuttered west 58th street hotel into a men's shelter.\n\nfor many residents across new york, this is personal. davis says she is concerned the influx of people who are homeless will change her quiet, working-class neighborhood.\n\none of the things that 'turning the tide' talks about is that in placing the homeless shelter — which really they're hotels, they're not shelters — they take a look at making sure that the neighborhood's character isn't changed, she says. now if you're doubling the population, what does that tell you?
iran's president hassan rouhani wins re-election\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption behrouz mehri/afp/getty images behrouz mehri/afp/getty images\n\nupdated at 10:21 a.m. et\n\niranian president hassan rouhani has won re-election by a large margin.\n\naccording to iran's interior ministry as reported by press tv, rouhani won about 57% of the vote with more than 23.5 million votes against his main challenger ebrahim raisi's 15.7 million. rouhani appeared to have benefited from a large turnout that forced polls to stay open until midnight, npr's peter kenyon reports. more than 40 million out of 56 million eligible voters cast their ballots.\n\nin a live speech carried by state tv, rouhani said saturday that the vote showed iran's willingness to work with the international community, and a rejection of hardliners, according to the ap.\n\nfirst elected in 2013, rouhani is seen as a reformer in iran's largely conservative society. he is best known abroad as the president who made a nuclear deal with the west in 2015, in which the country agreed to certain limits on nuclear development in return for the lifting of some sanctions.\n\nhis conservative opponent raisi attacked the weak state of the economy under rouhani. raisi lambasted rouhani for seeking foreign investment and appealed to religious conservatives, the guardian noted.\n\nmassoud asheri, a 29-year-old engineer for a mining company, told peter that he was always confident rouhani would prevail, and believes it's a sign that popular pressure for change is mounting.\n\nit's about 10 or 20 years that people in iran want to change the condition in iran, asheri said. the people now are growing, and the new generation wants new things.\n\nbut asheri also says iranians urgently need economic improvements.\n\nso i think in the next four years, mr. rouhani [...] must respond to the people who voted for him for the second time.\n\nrouhani voter narges sha'eri, 30, agrees that the economy tops the to-do list for rouhani, but adds that a steady hand in dealing with the international community is also needed. she says a good deal of rouhani's support was motivated by fear of what might happen if the hard liners regained control of the executive branch.\n\nprecisely that, she told peter. we also knew very well that should raisi win, he would bring the same people that were of the (hard line) principalist camp, which would drive the country backward.\n\nthe lifting of sanctions did benefit the economy by increasing oil production. iran is one of the top oil-producing countries in the world; the cia ranked it at no. 7 in 2015. rouhani had promised during the campaign to further undo international sanctions in a second term, kenyon says.\n\nbut the economy is still sluggish. in mid-2016, unemployment stood at 12.7 percent, a three-year high, according to the world bank. npr's steve inskeep reports that rouhani brought down inflation, but he slowed the economy while doing so.\n\nrouhani's reforms have been modest and gradual, as inskeep notes. reformist newspapers have begun publishing again and imprisoned journalists have been freed. rouhani presided over an expansion of the country's 3g and 4g networks, used by smartphones.\n\nbut ultimate power in the country rests with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei, who has held the title since 1989. khamenei controls the country's security forces and can veto any presidential policies.\n\nmeanwhile, u.s. president trump arrived in saudi arabia saturday morning, for a visit with the country's royal leaders. the saudis are a strong u.s. ally and arch-enemy of iran; the largely sunni saudis strongly opposed president obama's outreach and nuclear deal with the persian shia power.\n\ndespite president trump's pledges to rip up the iran deal, the trump administration's state department allowed the deal to continue this past week by continuing to waive sanctions on iran.\n\nrelations between the u.s. and iran are likely to be remain hostile, according to karim sadjadpour of the carnegie endowment for international peace. he told npr's morning edition that leaders in the u.s.-allied countries of israel and saudi arabia are likely to advocate a policy which goes back to status quo ante on iran which is pushing iran back in the middle east.\n\nnpr's peter kenyon contributed to this report.
benzodiazepines: america's 'other prescription drug problem'\n\nenlarge this image nicole xu for npr nicole xu for npr\n\ndrew was in his early 30s. his medical history included alcohol abuse, but he had been sober for several months when he became my patient.\n\nhis previous doctor had given him a prescription for ativan, or lorazepam, which is frequently used to allay tremors and seizures from alcohol withdrawal.\n\nmy first inclination was to wean him off the medication by lowering the dose and telling him to take it less frequently. but inertia is strong in medical care, and drew prevailed upon me to continue providing lorazepam at his regular dose for another month while he solidified his situation with a new job.\n\nthe next time i heard about him was a couple of weeks later when a colleague read me drew's obituary in the local paper. there was no cause of death listed. but i knew he could have run into serious trouble if he had mixed alcohol or other drugs with his lorazepam.\n\nlorazepam is a benzodiazepine, a class of medicines known as sedative-hypnotics. they're used frequently in the u.s. to treat anxiety and insomnia. other drugs in the same category include valium and xanax.\n\nthe problem with benzos, as they're also known, is that they're highly addictive medications, both physically and psychologically. abruptly stopping them can lead to withdrawal symptoms like the ones drew hoped to avoid when he kicked alcohol.\n\nmoreover, with long-term use, our metabolism adjusts to benzos. we need higher doses to achieve the same effects.\n\nwhen taken regularly, benzos can have the unintended effect of impairing your ability to sleep without them. when used for anxiety, their disruption or withdrawal can lead to a wicked return of the symptoms they are intended to treat.\n\nbecause of their addictive potential, benzos are controlled substances, whose use is regulated and monitored by the drug enforcement administration.\n\nwith so much of our attention now understandably directed at the nation's insatiable appetite for those other controlled substances — opioids — it's no wonder that the dangers of benzodiazepine overuse haven't drawn as much scrutiny.\n\nbut that is starting to change.\n\na recent essay in the new england journal of medicine titled our other prescription drug problem highlights massive growth in the use and abuse of benzos in the u.s., including the fact that the number of deaths attributed to benzodiazepine overdose has risen sevenfold over the past two decades.\n\nthat's not altogether surprising when you consider that the number of prescriptions written for benzodiazepines increased 67 percent to 13.5 million per year in 2013 from 8.1 million in 1999.\n\nwhile death rates and prescriptions for opioids still substantially outnumber those for benzos, it's combinations of the two types of drugs that are particularly fatal.\n\nthree-quarters of deaths attributed to benzodiazepines also involve an opioid, resulting in a stern warning from the food and drug administration in 2016 about the danger of combining the medicines.\n\nstanford psychiatrist anna lembke, lead author of the new england journal of medicine essay, calls our overprescribing and overconsumption of benzos a hidden epidemic, because it remains underpublicized in the glare of the opioid crisis. even if we get the opioid problem under control, the benzodiazepines will still be there, she told me in an interview.\n\nher essay also mentions the growing problem of synthetic benzos manufactured in clandestine laboratories and sold on the internet without fda approval, doctors' prescriptions or pharmacy oversight.\n\none such designer drug is called clonazolam: a chemical combination of clonazepam (brand name klonopin) and alprazolam (brand name xanax).\n\nclonazolam serves no medical purpose. it's a chemical devised for recreational use and profit. but it's a hundred to a thousand times more potent than our standard array of benzos, according to lembke. this means its potential for overdose is substantially higher, too.\n\nin another recent piece about benzos, author maia szalavitz points out that these medicines have exhibited explosive growth in use even without the marketing that brought opioids to the fore in the 1990s and early 2000s. most benzos were already available as generics then and still are today — yet the numbers of prescriptions continue to grow.\n\njournalist paula span, who writes regularly about aging for the new york times, published a recent feature about the widespread use and risks of benzos in the elderly, for whom they pose a particular danger.\n\nthe american geriatrics society lists benzos as inappropriate for use in the elderly, because of their potential for adverse drug interactions. in older people, benzos also heighten the risk of falls and can hamper memory.\n\nunfortunately, since the quality of sleep diminishes as we age, many americans are prescribed benzos to help them doze.\n\nas with drew, i've had many other patients come to me already taking benzos prescribed by another doctor.\n\nwith the growing awareness of our nation's opioid problem, many patients ask me to help them taper off opioids or not to start them in the first place.\n\ni wish the same could be said for benzodiazepines.\n\njohn henning schumann is an internal medicine doctor and serves as president of the university of oklahoma's tulsa campus. he also hosts studio tulsa: medical monday on kwgs public radio tulsa, and is on twitter @glasshospital.
sunday politics recap: nevada results, looking ahead to the next democratic debate\n\nwe look at the results coming out of the nevada caucuses, russia's attempts to interfere in sen. bernie sanders' campaign and what to expect from tuesday's democratic debate.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nbernie sanders was the winner in the nevada caucus, and his chief challengers wasted no time in warning democrats that sanders would be a reckless choice for nominee.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npete buttigieg: senator sanders believes in an inflexible ideological revolution that leaves out most democrats, not to mention most americans.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that was pete buttigieg speaking last night. he went on to say that sanders wouldn't change the toxic tone of u.s. politics.\n\njoining us now to talk about the race is npr national political correspondent mara liasson. hi, mara.\n\nmara liasson, byline: hi, lulu.\n\ngarcia-navarro: all right. so sanders won big, but he's still seen as a huge risk by moderates in the party. we heard buttigieg saying so. others took indirect swipes at sanders. biden, for instance, said that he personally ain't a socialist. will these attacks have any impact on sanders' momentum?\n\nliasson: that is the big question. up until now, really only mike bloomberg and pete buttigieg have been willing to go after sanders. for the most part, the center-left candidates have been in a circular firing squad attacking mike bloomberg. will that change now? there are already attack ads. pete buttigieg has one in south carolina running against bernie sanders.\n\nbut the problem is that the leading center-left alternatives to bernie sanders - mike bloomberg and joe biden - have failed to perform at a level high enough to clear the field. and the center-left candidates now have what you could call a collective action problem. they all believe it's better if there's one alternative to sanders, but none - no one of them is willing to drop out to make that happen. so the bottom line is bernie sanders has the clearest path to come into the milwaukee convention with a plurality of delegates. even one-third might be enough to get the nomination if the opposition to him is split many ways.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so, mara, this brings up the issue of tensions inside the democratic party. sanders himself has said he's running against the democratic establishment. how are these tensions kind of playing out in real time?\n\nliasson: well, i've been racking my brains. who is the democratic establishment these days?\n\ngarcia-navarro: yeah. where's this...\n\nliasson: now - yeah, because there's no dnc with their thumb on the scale this time. bernie sanders has been in elected office for about 40 years. maybe he means the democratic establishment are people who don't agree with him. i'm not sure. but the difference is that bernie sanders has a different mission from the other candidates. as he says, every day, he is running to lead a political revolution. he wants to move american politics to the left. he's not running to lead a political party.\n\nand as pete buttigieg said - yesterday, he said the only true way to deliver on any of the progressive changes we care about is to be a nominee who actually gives a damn about the effect you're having from the top of the ticket on frontline democrats. and what you hear from those frontline democrats - incumbent democrats in the house and senate - are candidates who want to flip a senate seat. they're worried that with sanders on the top of the ticket, they could possibly lose the house and lose the chance to pick up the senate seats in colorado, arizona, maine or hang on to one in michigan.\n\ngarcia-navarro: ok. we don't know a lot about this, but i do want to bring up this other thing. the intelligence community apparently briefed bernie sanders that russia is interfering to try and help his campaign. there are many questions here that are still unanswered. why was this leaked now? what is this intelligence? how robust is it? but let's look at how sanders reacted.\n\nliasson: that's right. he was briefed about a month ago. he didn't make it public until the story broke. he was asked on friday why he thought the story broke now, a month after he was briefed, and here's what he said.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbernie sanders: i'll let you guess - about one day before the nevada caucus. why do you think it came out? it was the washington post? good friends.\n\nliasson: the washington post said they broke the story when they had the story. bernie sanders didn't call the post fake news or enemy of the people, but he sounded a lot like president trump. to his credit, sanders says he doesn't want russian interference. putin isn't a friend of his. he's making it clear that he is reacting to this news in a completely different way than donald trump, who denies russian interference, pretends it isn't happening. but from what we know about the intelligence briefings, the intelligence community thinks that russia seems to want sanders to win the primary and donald trump to win the general election. and coincidentally or not, donald trump also wants bernie sanders to win the primary.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's npr national political correspondent mara liasson. thank you so much.\n\nliasson: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
venezuelan president maduro faces intensified pressure to step down\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\nfor the leader of venezuela's opposition, time is growing short. juan guaido says he is the interim president of venezuela. an opposition-led legislature says guaido is to replace nicolas maduro, who kept power in a disputed election. president maduro, though, has shown no sign of stepping down or allowing a new election. and instead, the chief justice of venezuela's supreme court, who is aligned with maduro, has begun what he calls a preliminary investigation of the opposition leader. things are getting tense as the opposition prepares big protests. and npr's philip reeves is on the line to tell us about it. hi there, philip.\n\nphilip reeves, byline: oh, hi, steve, yeah.\n\ninskeep: what has it been like to walk around caracas the last few days?\n\nreeves: it's strange. it's subdued. it's very tense. people who support the opposition - and there are a very large number of people who deeply loathe maduro - are clearly very happy and hoping that this is the moment after a very long time when they're actually going to get the change that they have wished for for so long. but at the same time, the - they've had many previous disappointments. and you see also just genuine fear in people's eyes. and when they talk to you, they talk about how worried they are, about the safety of their family and whether this whole thing is going to melt down into violence.\n\ninskeep: well, let's talk about that because obviously the opposition leader hasn't been arrested yet. he's still walking free. but if the supreme court is beginning motions against him, it clearly leans in that direction. what is the plan of juan guaido, the opposition leader, to actually take power having claimed it?\n\nreeves: well, he's piling on the pressure. he's calling for people to walk out today, out of their homes and offices, for a two-hour nonviolent protest. and then he's also called for a mass demonstration nationwide on saturday. remember; he successfully summoned hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets last week. so i expect today's event to be large. and the big question is, how will maduro's security forces react? forty people have been killed since this crisis erupted just over a week ago, mostly by venezuela's security services, according to the u.n. human rights office. and, you know, the worry is that there'll be more bloodshed. but he is piling on pressure.\n\ninskeep: and can you describe president maduro's approach to staying in power? forty people killed sounds devastating, but we have not reached that moment of the military killing hundreds or thousands at tiananmen square kind of incident yet. we have not reached the moment of the opposition leader being in chains. what is maduro doing?\n\nreeves: well, i think he is faced with a very, very serious challenge to his position. and he's having to feel his way forward. it's true the supreme court has now frozen guaido's bank accounts and that he's been banned from leaving the country. but this is a man who maduro says is attempting a coup with the collaboration of the united states. so you can see that those measures, when you consider that, are carefully calibrated by maduro.\n\nas for what he's doing, i mean, turn on the tv here, the state-run tv, which the government entirely controls and uses as a channel for propaganda, and you see these days maduro in front of his army troops, you know, attending parades and urging them to fight to the end and to be loyal and so on. so that is how he is proceeding in this crisis that he faces. it's got a lot worse now that the u.s. has cut his oil money. so he has to deal with how he's going to, you know, handle that, too.\n\ninskeep: let's remember, the united states is not just supporting the opposition leader. they've formally recognized him as the president, the interim president, of venezuela, in addition to cutting the oil money and taking other steps. i'm curious, philip. as you talk with people on the streets of caracas, do you have any sense of people hoping for or expecting bigger u.s. intervention?\n\nreeves: yes. i mean, one of the things that's quite interesting here is that you often meet people who lean to the left but who rather apologetically explain to you that they are very much in favor of the trump administration because they're very glad to see this happening in venezuela after so long. and they appreciate the intervention. but at the same time, this concern exists about what's going to happen. you know, if maduro goes, steve, it's unlikely to be a clean break with his military and security apparatus all transferring their allegiance to a new interim government.\n\nthere are hard-line elements here. in the national guard, there are these colectivos who've got - who are basically armed pro-government militias with a reputation for committing atrocities. there are elements in the police and intelligence services who've tortured and kill. and they know that the amnesty that's being offered at the moment by the opposition may not apply to them. and there are numerous criminal gangs, steve, dealing in drugs and gold who flourish out in the countryside where the government grip is very weak. and add all that together, and you have an alarming picture.\n\ninskeep: ok. that's npr's philip reeves. philip, thanks very much.\n\nreeves: you're welcome.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
ocasio-cortez to unveil ambitious plan to combat climate change\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\nalexandria ocasio-cortez is among the most famous members of congress. and for now, among the less-influential, a freshman in a house where seniority counts. her status is reflected in her new office, down a distant corridor of an office building on capitol hill.\n\nalexandria ocasio-cortez: i picked the office that was arguably the furthest walk from the capitol.\n\ninskeep: which allowed her staff a bit more space. so you're, like, effectively living in the suburbs to get a bigger house?\n\nocasio-cortez: exactly. that's exactly the choice i made. (laughter).\n\ninskeep: we met ocasio-cortez inside that office. sunlight fell through the oversized window onto her fuchsia suit. her office is still a fraction of the size of the committee chairmen who hold real power in congress, though she has something they do not. the 29-year-old is a media star. she has been since she upset a leading democrat in a new york city primary last year. her surprise victory cast her as a party insurgent. her label as a democratic socialist also alarmed conservatives, who now see her face constantly on fox news.\n\ntoday, she tries to leverage her fame. she joins dozens of other lawmakers proposing an environmental and economic plan, called the green new deal.\n\nocasio-cortez: even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us, to our country and to the world.\n\ninskeep: you can find the green new deal resolution on our website today. npr is the first to publish this call to transform the economy. it's a resolution calling for massive increases in renewable energy production, like wind and solar. it would have the united states set a goal to become carbon neutral in 10 years, which is a very ambitious timeline. this resolution says what should be done but offers few specifics on how to do it. that would have to come in later legislation. instead, the congresswoman aims to promote big goals.\n\nwhy, in this resolution, do you make a point of saying the united states bears disproportionate responsibility for the problem?\n\nocasio-cortez: because i think we do. and if we want the united states to continue to be a global leader then that means we have to lead on the solution of this issue. and i think that it is completely wrong to point fingers at other developing nations and to say, well, china's doing this and india's doing that and russia is doing this, when we can just choose to lead and we don't have to hold ourselves to a lower bar.\n\ninskeep: you're talking about things that obviously would cost a lot of money. i know you'd rather think of it as an investment rather than a cost, but it is just certainly a lot of money. you don't specify where it's going to come from, other than saying it will all pay for itself.\n\nocasio-cortez: yeah. i think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for a hundred percent of government expenditure. it's just not how government expenditure works. we can recoup costs, but oftentimes you look at, for example, the gop tax cut, which i think was an irresponsible use of government expenditure. but government projects are often financed by a combination of taxes, deficit spending and other kinds of investments - you know, bonds and so on.\n\ninskeep: well, i get that. but deficit spending is borrowing money that has to be paid back eventually through taxes.\n\nocasio-cortez: yeah. and i think it - i think that is always the crux of it. so when we decide to go into the realm of deficit spending, we have to do so responsibly. we ask, is this an investment or is this actually going to pay for itself?\n\ninskeep: so you're saying borrow the money, make the investment. the economy will grow. it will pay off the debt.\n\nocasio-cortez: absolutely. because we're creating jobs.\n\ninskeep: although, i do have to say, you mentioned the republican tax cut. they said the same thing about the tax cut - let's do this tax cut. the economy will grow. it's going to be great. it's going to pay for itself. hasn't turned out to be true at all.\n\nocasio-cortez: absolutely. and i think that that is an important distinction to make because when they were advancing that cause, they had no evidence to say that these things were going to happen. but we actually do have the evidence. for every $1 invested in infrastructure, we get $6 back.\n\ninskeep: as you know, congresswoman, one reason that people who are politically conservative are skeptical of efforts to combat climate change is that it sounds to them like it requires massive government intervention, which they just don't like. are you prepared to put on the table that, yes, actually, they're right, what this requires is massive government intervention?\n\nocasio-cortez: it does. it does. yeah. i have no problem saying that. why? because we have tried their approach for 40 years. for 40 years, we tried to let the private sector take care of it. they said, we got this, we can do this, the forces of the market are going to force us to innovate. except for the fact that there's a little thing in economics called externalities, and what that means is that a corporation can dump pollution in the river and they don't have to pay for it, and taxpayers have to pay for cleaning up our air, cleaning up our water and saving the planet.\n\nand so we've already been paying the costs, except we have not been getting any of the benefit. and so what we're here to say is that government is not just for cleaning up other people's mess, but it's also for building solutions in places where the private sector will not.\n\ninskeep: so if you get this resolution passed, of course, it's a framework, it's an idea, it's a proposal and then you would need specific legislation to encourage wind power, to encourage solar, to do any number of things - efficiency, on and on. those proposals, just mechanically, would need to move through various house committees, like the energy and commerce committee, on its way to becoming law, committees that are chaired by democrats who you have questioned or criticized because they take, for example, energy money. frank pallone of the energy and commerce committee comes to mind. do you have confidence in your fellow, more senior, democrats that they would move the legislation that is necessary to do what you think needs to be done?\n\nocasio-cortez: i think this is where our style and where our organizing comes in, when everyday people begin to organize, when they make their presence known and their opinions known to their officials. it's the same way that we were able to save the aca in a republican majority. it's the same way that we're able to overcome some of those challenges of private industry and the role of money in politics.\n\ninskeep: are you saying you kind of don't trust some of your fellow democrats, but they'll need to be publicly pressured?\n\nocasio-cortez: i think that - well, i don't think trust is the right word for it. but i do think that when there's a wide spectrum of debate on an issue, that is where the public plays a role. and i do have trust is in my colleagues' capacity to change and evolve and be adaptable and listen to their constituents.\n\ninskeep: do you feel that you know how to take the great fame that you have won over the last several months and turn that fame into power?\n\nocasio-cortez: no. (laughter). i think that a part of where i am right now is that i'm learning. i think that really what i hope we're able to do as a party and as a nation is rediscover the power of public imagination. i think that this is a very special moment. and, frankly, that is something that i think the president did do, in that he was able to take his profile and say, here's this hugely impossible thing that seems ridiculous, but i'm going to seriously push for it. and for him, that's his wall. and obviously, i'm diametrically opposed to it. but i think that the reason he's so attached to this thing, despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the american people want, is that it's the only vision he has. he has no other picture of america, except an america with a huge wall on the southern border.\n\nand i think that what we have a responsibility to do is show what another america looks like. ok. let's take all of that political energy, all of that resource that would go into building a massive second medieval wall on our southern border. and what if we actually took all that concrete and poured it into roads? what if we took all of that engineering and dedicated it to new energy? what if we took all of that but actually invested in something that will have payback and a return on our investment for the american people?\n\ninskeep: congresswoman, thanks so much.\n\nocasio-cortez: of course. thank you.\n\ninskeep: alexandria ocasio-cortez, democrat representing the bronx and queens, was in her office across the street from the capitol here in washington.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
how one woman's story helped set #metoo in motion in russia\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jolie myers/npr jolie myers/npr\n\na scandal involving a high-profile russian politician has sparked media outrage there, putting at the forefront an issue that's long been swept under the carpet in russia: sexual harassment.\n\nin february, three female journalists accused russian politician leonid slutsky of sexual harassment. slutsky heads the powerful foreign affairs committee in the duma, russia's lower house of parliament.\n\nearlier this month, the duma's ethics commission opened an investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment. this week, the commission cleared slutsky of any wrongdoing in the case. the head of the commission said that there were no signs of inappropriate behavior.\n\nas a result, more than a dozen news organizations have withdrawn their correspondents from the duma. and the speaker of the duma announced that those news outlets have been stripped of their accreditation and will no longer be allowed to enter the duma.\n\nthe results of the investigation are an example of how the #metoo movement has had little traction in russia so far. russians often dismiss sexual harassment allegations as political correctness run wild.\n\nbut that there even are women speaking out — and some attempts by the government to address the issue — mark a small, if notable change.\n\ndarya zhuk helped set this in motion. she is one of the journalists accusing slutsky, and the first to speak on the record. zhuk, 27, is a journalist for the independent news network, tv dozhd, or tv rain.\n\nin a video message, which her network broadcast nationwide last month, she asked slutsky for accountability. i have only one question, she said are you still going to deny this? aren't you ashamed to be working in the parliament and behave this way?\n\nearlier this year, the speaker of the duma fired back at the harassment allegations with this statement: do you feel in danger working at the duma? if so, then get another job.\n\nin a facebook post on march 8 — international women's day — slutsky addressed the allegations, writing: i would like to ask forgiveness from those of you who i have ever, voluntarily or involuntarily, caused any discomfort. believe me, it was not done with ill intent.\n\nnpr invited slutsky to comment; he declined.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alexander zemlianichenko/ap alexander zemlianichenko/ap\n\nin 2014, when zhuk was 24, she worked as a producer on an evening talk show called hard day's night. she was assigned to book slutsky for a political panel. it was her first direct interaction with the politician, and it almost immediately raised red flags.\n\nwhen i was trying to book him, he was jokingly saying that he would only come on the show if i would go out with him to a restaurant, she explained during an interview with npr at dozhd's moscow headquarters.\n\nzhuk said she immediately showed the messages to the program's anchor, who told her slutsky's inappropriate behavior toward women was well-known. her colleague, however, discouraged her from reacting, as the politician was an important get for the show.\n\nthe program went on air at 10 p.m., so when slutsky came to their offices, the newsroom was almost empty, she told npr. zhuk showed him to a waiting room and told him she'd be right back.\n\nas soon as i turned, he touched my butt. i just froze, zhuk said. so then he tried to get closer to me; he approached me and tried to kiss me with his mouth open. i was shocked.\n\nzhuk said she told two male colleagues about the incident, but took no other action. her company, like many russian companies, did not have a human resources department to deal with complaints of this nature.\n\nearlier this year, zhuk read an article by dozhd's parliament correspondent. in the report, two women — who remained anonymous — accused slutsky of sexually harassing them. zhuk said she immediately contacted her colleague to describe her own experience.\n\nzhuk was added to the story as a third anonymous source. but when the duma's press office threatened to revoke her colleague's accreditation if she did not reveal the names of her sources, zhuk decided to go on the record.\n\nwomen spoke out in support of zhuk, but the overall reaction nationwide was a mixed bag. most russians get their news from government-controlled channels and not independent media outlets.\n\nthose channels broadcast an absolutely clear message, zhuk said. 'americans have lost their minds. will americans stop having sex? will they stop having romantic relationships? they have pushed this to the point of absurdity!'\n\nstill, zhuk believes the #metoo movement in the united states has paved the way for women in russia.\n\nthe women in america showed us how we can protect ourselves, zhuk said.\n\naccording to zhuk, the #metoo movement in russia can only be possible if it is spearheaded by artists and journalists from independent media because the majority of women work in state-owned companies. if they speak up, zhuk said, they might lose their jobs and face severe repercussions.\n\nand despite pressure from her own family to remain silent, zhuk believes she did the right thing.\n\ni would have been ashamed of myself if i did not take this step, she said. i believe my actions could help transform russians' mentality and attitudes.\n\nfreelance journalist anna shpakova contributed to this report.

#memeoftheweek: the racial politics of nikki haley\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrew burton/getty images andrew burton/getty images\n\ndepending on whom you ask, south carolina gov. nikki haley's state of the union response this week was either going to save the modern republican party or kill conservatism.\n\nthis week, those differing responses evoked two different hashtags. both, in some ways, were about haley's heritage, and they bring to light the tricky way she'll have to navigate race should she take on a more prominent role in the 2016 election.\n\n#deportnikkihaley\n\nafter haley gave the republican response to president obama's seventh and final state of the union address this week, some conservatives were not impressed. haley said in her speech that fixing immigration means welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion. just like we have for centuries. she offered a tacit rebuke of donald trump when she said, during anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. we must resist that temptation.\n\n(she confirmed on nbc's today show the next day that she was, in fact, referring to trump.)\n\nthe response to those lines, and other conciliatory notes in haley's speech, was swift. and some of it was brutal. conservative firebrand ann coulter probably went the farthest, writing, donald trump should deport nikki haley.\n\nnikki haley says welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of religion. translation: let in all the muslims. — ann coulter (@anncoulter) january 13, 2016\n\ntrump should deport nikki haley. — ann coulter (@anncoulter) january 13, 2016\n\nshe was not alone. conservative talk show host laura ingraham tweeted that haley missed an opportunity to stand with working ppl who want borders enforced, and criticizing the gop candidates dominating polls.\n\non his radio show, rush limbaugh said:\n\n...it's almost absolute proof of what i have been saying for last couple years now, that the republican party's trying to drive conservatives out of the party. but i think it's more than that. it's certainly that, but her speech last night sort of expanded the theme of who is and who isn't qualified to be a republican, and the republican party is still anti-conservative.\n\nbut coulter's statement was the one that became a hashtag: #deportnikkihaley.\n\nthis presents a problem for haley, and perhaps the republican party. haley is already on some vice-presidential shortlists. that's because, as some political watchers see it, haley, as an indian-american woman, could help the gop begin shaking its image as a party that is older and whiter. (see this gallup table for the differences in racial make up in party identification.)\n\nbut it might be hard for haley to become that standard-bearer if she can't shore up conservative republican support.\n\nsome of the critique of haley's response from conservatives online seemed to have a racial tint: haley wasn't just wrong because of what she said; she was more wrong, for some on twitter, because she is indian-american.\n\n#indianamericansoutherngovernorname\n\nsoon after haley's state of the union response, writer anand giridharadas started the hashtag #indianamericansoutherngovernorname. it was focusing on the fact that the name haley uses now, nikki, was not the one given to her at birth. (she was born nimrata randhawa) anand tweeted, do figures like @nikkihaley & @bobbyjindal help to euthanize or medicate the dying idea of america-as-whiteness?\n\ndo figures like @nikkihaley & @bobbyjindal help to euthanize or medicate the dying idea of america-as-whiteness? https://t.co/us8wnto7wd — anand giridharadas (@anandwrites) january 14, 2016\n\nindian americans used the #indianamericansoutherngovernorname to highlight the way figures like jindal and haley, in their eyes, change who they are to be more appealing to white and conservative voters. (although for more than a century, american immigrants have been changing their names to assimilate.)\n\njust call me shane dilbert. #indianamericansoutherngovernorname — shiv divanji (@shivdivanji) january 13, 2016\n\nin some ways, haley seems to face the same conundrum former louisiana gov. and failed republican presidential candidate bobby jindal did — not seeming brown enough for some voters of color, while being too brown for others. (we won't bore you with the details, or subject you to some of the graphic tweets, but just take a look at the #jindalsowhite hashtag to see what we're talking about.)\n\nof course, twitter is not exactly or entirely representative of the real world, and even thousands of tweets for or against nikki haley might not accurately depict actual support or disapproval of her.\n\na september 2015 winthrop poll found haley's approval rating among south carolina voters was 55 percent. that number was similar before haley gained praise for helping bring down the confederate battle flag from the grounds of the south carolina statehouse in the aftermath of a charleston church shooting that killed nine black parishioners. but she did drop 10 points with republicans. (by december, she was back up to 81 percent with republicans.)\n\ngiridharadas in his new york times article wasn't just critical of haley; he said it was thrilling to see haley attempt to create a broader, two-party consensus on the simple, exceptional idea that an american is defined by shared hope, not shared blood.\n\nbut wherever you stand on haley, her story speaks to a certain truth in politics: race is tricky — and there's always going to be someone unhappy with how you talk about it.\n\nwith haley, we see a multi-dimensional (and, in fact, multicultural) tilt to america's ongoing struggle with race. a dichotomy of just black and white isn't big enough to comprehend or explain a sikh indian-american daughter of immigrants, who helped bring down what is, for many, a longstanding symbol of the enslavement of africans and their descendants in america.\n\nhaley's story has layers. it is nuanced. it is not simple. and maybe that's how it should be.
president trump's supporters insist that they are not going away\n\nsome in the pro-trump crowd that gathered outside the u.s. capitol wednesday night said they had little hope of overturning the election results, but that they were determined to send a message.\n\nnoel king, host:\n\nthe insurrectionists had been cleared from inside the capitol last night, but some supporters of president trump lingered around outside. police allowed them to stay until night fell, when a curfew went into effect. here's npr's scott horsley.\n\nscott horsley, byline: hours after the deadly confrontation inside the capitol, trump supporters outside faced a line of police. that didn't discourage john (ph) who, like all the demonstrators we spoke to, refused to give his last name. after all, he'd made the trip from connecticut to attend this protest at the president's own urging.\n\njohn: and i know how it's going to be twisted - ok? - by the media - that he's responsible for what happened, that he provoked it, that he was encouraging violence. the fact of the matter is the president never encouraged violence. we came here on our own accord at his invitation to support him.\n\nhorsley: john didn't take part in storming the capitol, but he was quick to excuse the people who did.\n\njohn: when emotions are high the way they obviously were, it was inevitable that that was going to happen.\n\nhorsley: this was john's third demonstration in washington since trump's defeat in november. he didn't really expect coming to the capitol would change the tally of electoral votes, but he still felt it was important to show up and make a statement.\n\njohn: this is actually a spiritual battle, as far as i'm concerned. it was a battle of good against evil. and i think there couldn't be a more clear example of evil than what we see in that building and in what we see protecting that building.\n\nhorsley: nearby, kyle (ph) carried a sign that read stop the steal. kyle, who is from florida, is convinced many of the votes cast for president-elect joe biden were unlawful, a claim that's been repeatedly debunked and rejected by dozens of courts.\n\nkyle: we simply marched to the capitol to tell congress that we wanted legal votes to count and to overturn the fraudulent votes. and we're being surrounded by police.\n\nunidentified person #1: they're getting ready to arrest everybody that they corral in that circle.\n\nkyle: oh, that's cute. so, yeah, free speech is over.\n\nhorsley: as we're talking, a line of police wearing face shields and tactical vests begin to push forward, moving the trump supporters back. mike (ph), who's from new hampshire, says he felt betrayed by law enforcement. when police came under criticism last year, he'd rallied in their support.\n\nmike: it's sad what this has come down to because the blue were doing their job, so we stuck up for them and we fought for these guys. but obviously, they don't want to be on our side.\n\nhorsley: the trump supporters eventually disperse under steady pressure from police. some promise to return with weapons.\n\nunidentified person #2: next time, we come back with rifles.\n\nhorsley: the grounds outside the capitol grew quiet as lawmakers inside resumed their work. as trump supporters filtered away, john from connecticut insisted they're not leaving for good.\n\njohn: there's a total lack of confidence in the political system. and it's not going to end pretty. i've been around a long time. it's not going to end pretty.\n\nhorsley: scott horsley, npr news, washington.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump administration cuts back federal protections for streams and wetlands\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption brynn anderson/ap brynn anderson/ap\n\nupdated at 3:20 p.m. et\n\nthe environmental protection agency is dramatically reducing the amount of u.s. waterways that get federal protection under the clean water act — a move that is welcomed by many farmers, builders and mining companies but is opposed even by the agency's own science advisers.\n\nepa administrator andrew wheeler, who announced the repeal of an earlier obama-era water rule in september, chose to make the long-anticipated announcement thursday in las vegas, at the national association of home builders international builders' show.\n\nall states have their own protections for waters within their borders, and many regulate more broadly than the federal government, wheeler told reporters on a conference call before the announcement.\n\nour new rule recognizes this relationship and strikes the proper balance between washington, d.c., and the states, he added. and it clearly details which waters are subject to federal control under the clean water act and, importantly, which waters falls solely under the states' jurisdiction.\n\nthe biggest change is a controversial move to roll back federal limits on pollution in wetlands and smaller waterways that were introduced less than five years ago by president barack obama.\n\nthe obama executive action, which broadened the definition of waters of the united states, applied to about 60% of u.s. waterways. it aimed to bring clarity to decades of political and legal debate over which waters should qualify.\n\nhowever, various business interests painted the regulation as a massive federal overreach. within weeks after the change was announced in may 2015, 27 states sued to block it. at the time, texas attorney general ken paxton, a leading critic, called the new rule so broad and open to interpretation that everything from ditches and dry creek beds to gullies to isolated ponds formed after a big rain could be considered a 'water of the united states.' \n\nthe revised rule announced thursday states that ephemeral bodies of water — those that form only after rainfall or that flow only part of the year and dry up at other times — are among those that are not subject to federal control. this exception also applies to waste treatment systems, groundwater, prior converted cropland and farm watering ponds.\n\nit also identifies four categories that are federally regulated under the clean water act: large navigable waters such as the mississippi river, tributaries, lakes and ponds, and major wetlands.\n\nthis isn't about what is an important water body. all water is important. this is about what waters congress intended for the agencies to regulate, dave ross, assistant administrator of the epa's office of water, told reporters on the conference call. and we have clearly established those lines.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption patrick semansky/ap patrick semansky/ap\n\nhowever, the revision has also encountered broad criticism. as the proposed rollback was taking shape last year, 14 states sued the epa over the impending rule change, saying it ignores science and the law and strips our waters of basic protections under the clean water act.\n\nin a draft letter posted online late last month, the 41-member epa science advisory board, which is made up largely of trump administration appointees, said the revised definition rule decreases protection for our nation's waters and does not support the objective of restoring and maintaining 'the chemical, physical and biological integrity' of these waters. the letter is signed by the board's chair, michael honeycutt.\n\ngina mccarthy, the epa administrator under obama who implemented the 2015 regulation, is among the revision's most vocal critics. now president and ceo of the nonprofit natural resources defense council, mccarthy slammed thursday's announcement.\n\nso much for the 'crystal clear' water president trump promised. you don't make america great by polluting our drinking water supplies, making our beaches unfit for swimming, and increasing flood risk, mccarthy said in a statement.\n\nthis effort neglects established science and poses substantial new risks to people's health and the environment. we will do all we can to fight this attack on clean water. we will not let it stand.\n\nin a speech on sunday at the american farm bureau federation's annual gathering in austin, texas, trump hinted at the change, calling the 2015 obama rule one of the most ridiculous regulations of all.\n\nthat was a rule that basically took your property away from you, he said. as long as i'm president, government will never micromanage america's farmers.\n\nhe said the new regulations would allow states to manage their water resources based on their own needs and what their farmers and ranchers want.\n\nwhen trump first proposed the new rule in late 2018, randy noel, then chairman of the national association of home builders, told npr that i'm pretty excited about it because we hadn't had any lots to build on.\n\nnoel lives in south louisiana, an area with a lot of wetlands. he said developers were running scared because it wasn't ever clear which wetlands were federally regulated and which weren't. hopefully, this redefinition will fix that, he said.\n\nbut janette brimmer, with the legal advocacy group earthjustice, said in a statement that under the new rule, few protections will remain to stop polluters from dumping toxic byproducts into our waters.\n\nthe kinds of ephemeral waterways now excluded from federal regulation under the revamped rule make up a large part of the waterways in the arid southwest and states such as new mexico.\n\nrachel conn, the project director with amigos bravos, a new mexico-based conservation group that focuses on water issues, says those ephemeral streams are important to bigger water systems though, like the rio grande.\n\nand it is from these bigger systems that close to 300,000 new mexicans receive their drinking water, she says.\n\ntrump ordered a review of the nation's waterways barely a month after taking office. he said at the time that while clean water was in the national interest, it must be balanced against promoting economic growth, minimizing regulatory uncertainty, and showing due regard for the roles of the congress and the states under the constitution.\n\nsince taking office, trump has aggressively sought to roll back environmental regulations, particularly those seen as an obstacle to business. according to an analysis by the new york times that was updated a month ago, the administration has revised or eliminated more than 90 environmental rules in the past three years, although several were reinstated following legal challenges and several others are still in the courts.
to keep drivers from leaving, uber tries to treat them better\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption liam james doyle/npr liam james doyle/npr\n\nupdated at 3:26 p.m. et\n\nuber's leadership already has a lot on its plate, starting with finding a new ceo after former chief travis kalanick resigned abruptly last month. but that's not all the tech giant has to do. for the business to survive, uber also has to repair its relationship with drivers, which leaders at the company say is broken.\n\non tuesday, in an ongoing effort dubbed the 180 days of change, the company is announcing reforms to its harsh termination policies and launching a hotline so that drivers in distress can reach a person at corporate headquarters.\n\njanelle sallenave is in charge of improving the way uber responds to drivers' and riders' needs, disputes and accidents. it's clear to her that drivers, the lifeblood of the transportation platform, are choosing to leave because of poor treatment. this is an existential threat to the business, valued at $70 billion, and it needs to be tackled, she says.\n\nsallenave persuaded the executive leadership team, which is steering the ship while the uber board looks for a new ceo, to approve the creation of a hotline. until now, uber has not had a phone number for drivers to call, even in emergencies — such as an accident on the road or a violent passenger.\n\nin june, npr reported on the difficulties this omission has created for drivers, in a series called the faceless boss. sallenave agrees with the characterization. as we've grown into a global, scalable company, she says, we need to move away from the facelessness of what the company has inadvertently become.\n\nin earlier days, sallenave says, each city had a local team to oversee uber operations and drivers might have the cell number of the general manager. but once uber centralized its system, in an effort to aggressively scale up, we were so focused on the rocket ship of growth that corporate leaders let communication systems fall apart.\n\nit evolved in a very organic way unfortunately to something that almost feels like a chatbot, she says. that is not a compliment. drivers were forced to communicate with uber via text messaging — six exchanges on average. now, under the new system, they would be able to make one phone call instead.\n\nuber is also reforming its three-strikes law. previously, a driver with three complaints would be terminated from the platform. it would not matter whether the driver had completed 10 rides or 10,000. the policy was adversarial, and assumed drivers did not have positive intent.\n\nnow the company will consider a number of factors: how long a person has been driving, overall ratings, who are the people filing complaints. the decision to terminate, or in uber lingo deactivate, a driver will still be made by software, but using a far more complex formula that sallenave hopes is holistic.\n\nuber is also working to replicate an appeals panel that the company piloted in seattle, for drivers who believe they've been unfairly terminated.\n\nmore than half a million people a month in the u.s. drive for uber. the company has not disclosed how many choose to leave the platform. but as sallenave acknowledges, in the gig economy it's easy to leave one job for another, to switch from uber to competitor lyft or a food delivery service.\n\ndrivers have welcomed uber's recent overtures — such as the move to allow in-app tipping — but it's not yet clear whether this effort will inspire loyalty, or if other changes by uber will undermine these efforts.\n\ndawn gearhart, policy coordinator with the teamsters local 117 in seattle, says uber is feeling pressure on every front — not just from competitors, but also from efforts to organize drivers into labor unions such as hers.\n\nwhen a company feels threatened by organizing, she says, it's standard practice to dole out small wins to workers, such as vacation or a slight raise.\n\nthese things are not happening because somebody at the company woke up and they decided they were feeling better about the workers, gearhart says. they just want to make sure that they maintain the balance of power.\n\nshe also points out that in recent weeks, many uber drivers are earning less per ride because the company changed its fare structure.\n\na study commissioned by uber indicates that even when fares go down, drivers' earnings remain stable because demand for rides is up.
slovakia's migrants keep a low profile in a country wary of outsiders\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of claudia tran courtesy of claudia tran\n\nthe small eastern european nation of slovakia has not exactly welcomed migrants.\n\nthe prime minister, robert fico, opposes refugees under a european relocation plan and has even linked migration to terrorism. in one town, gabcikovo, 97 percent of residents voted against accepting refugees.\n\nbut a tiny migrant community has quietly lived and worked in slovakia for decades, largely by staying under the radar.\n\nwe keep to ourselves, says nguyen kien trung, 32, who was born in vietnam and now lives in bratislava. we don't talk about our businesses. we don't talk about ourselves, our traditions.\n\nwe're driving along a street in a warehouse district of the slovak capital, bratislava, that's lined with vietnamese businesses and an unpretentious restaurant that specializes in the vietnamese noodle soup called pho.\n\nhe helps run the family textile business that's on this street. his family has imported and sold vietnamese-made clothes in slovakia for 18 years.\n\nwe pull up at the family warehouse on a sunday. his aunt and uncle are working and greet us in vietnamese. inside, the warehouse is filled with colorful sweaters and pajamas, mostly for women and children.\n\nthe slovak people perceive us as very, very hardworking people, he says. we practically don't have holidays.\n\nfew immigrants\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption joanna kakissis for npr joanna kakissis for npr\n\nhis parents came to slovakia about 30 years ago, when it was still part of czechoslovakia. like others from north vietnam, they found opportunities in communist eastern europe. they did face racism and violence in some countries. but some established themselves as successful market vendors who especially flourished after the fall of communism.\n\nabout 300,000 vietnamese, most of them from the north, now live in various eastern european countries, mainly russia and the czech republic.\n\nonly 3,000 to 5,000 live in slovakia, which gained independence in 1993 and where just a little over 1 percent of the population is foreign born.\n\ni meet claudia tran, a 21-year-old university student who also manages a nonprofit, at a hipster cafe in a cobblestoned section of old bratislava. she was born and raised in slovakia to vietnamese parents who came to eastern europe as top-notch students on university scholarships.\n\nand that's why my dad ended up in poland and my mom ended up in slovakia, she said. they're both engineers.\n\nthey couldn't find work in their field in slovakia, where they settled. they sell clothing for children, tran says.\n\nsecond-generation vietnamese have better job opportunities, especially in bratislava.\n\neveryone in bratislava has seen at least one asian in the city, she says. but if i compare it to vienna, which is a short train ride away and a huge multicultural city, there's a big difference.\n\nin bratislava, many slovaks speak to her in english or assume she's a tourist. and they stare.\n\ni don't know if they stare because i'm a woman or is it because i'm an asian, she says. but still, they stare.\n\nshe's having hot chocolate with lani willmar, a 22-year-old university student from corona, calif. willmar's parents fled south vietnam by boat and came as refugees to the u.s.\n\nwillmar is in slovakia on a fulbright, teaching english to slovaks. one recent lesson was about multiculturalism, which every student in her class opposed.\n\nand i talked about how the u.s. is a multicultural society, she says. and, yes, there are problems, yes there's racism, but it doesn't mean that you should write off multiculturalism completely. because if that were the case, i wouldn't be (in the united states), and my family wouldn't be there, and life would be very different.\n\n'quiet' migrants\n\nretired embryologist eva kellerova, like many slovaks, is quick to point out that slovakia — and europe — are not like america. she's aware of the vietnamese community in slovakia but says they came quietly, unlike the migrants now arriving in europe.\n\nshe says her heart breaks watching tv footage of what looks like miles of exhausted families trudging through the mud and cold.\n\nbut the situation is chaotic, she says. i don't think so many people can ever fit in here.\n\nher granddaughter, daniela kellerova, 23, translates. slovakia recently allowed a small group of iraqi christians to resettle here but remains opposed to muslim refugees.\n\nslovaks are having an existential crisis, she says. they worry that people will come here and build mosques and change life as they know it.\n\ndaniela, like many bright young slovaks, is studying abroad, in scotland, and does not plan to come home anytime soon.\n\nshe's part of the brain drain that's turning slovakia into an aging society — a society that might benefit from an infusion of immigrants.
was your seafood caught with slave labor? new database helps retailers combat abuse\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption paula bronstein/getty images paula bronstein/getty images\n\nthe monterey bay aquarium's seafood watch program, known best for its red, yellow and green sustainable seafood-rating scheme, is unveiling its first seafood slavery risk tool on thursday. it's a database designed to help corporate seafood buyers assess the risk of forced labor, human trafficking and hazardous child labor in the seafood they purchase.\n\nthe tool's release comes on the heels of a new report that confirms forced labor and human rights abuses remain embedded in thailand's fishing industry, years after global media outlets first documented the practice.\n\nthe 134-page report by human rights watch shows horrific conditions continue. that's despite promises from the thai government to crack down on abuses suffered by mostly migrants from countries like myanmar and cambodia — and despite pressure from the u.s. and european countries that purchase much of thailand's seafood exports. (thailand is the fourth-largest seafood exporter in the world).\n\nfor u.s. retailers and seafood importers, ferreting slavery out of the supply chain has proved exceedingly difficult. fishing occurs far from shore, often out of sight, while exploitation and abuse on vessels stem from very complex social and economic dynamics.\n\ncompanies didn't know how to navigate solving the problem, says sara mcdonald, seafood watch project manager for the slavery risk tool.\n\nthe new seafood watch database, which took two years to design, assigns slavery risk ratings to specific fisheries and was developed in collaboration with liberty asia and the sustainable fisheries partnership. like seafood watch's color-coded ratings, the seafood slavery risk tool aims to keep it simple — a set criteria determines whether a fishery will earn a critical, high, moderate or low risk rating.\n\na critical risk rating, for example, means credible evidence of forced labor or child labor has been found within the fishery itself. albacore, skipjack and yellowfin tuna caught by the taiwanese fleet gets a critical risk rating. a low risk fishery, like patagonian toothfish in chile (also known as chilean seabass), is one with good regulatory protections and enforcement, with no evidence of abuses in related industries.\n\nuntil recently, environmental concerns dominated most of the conversation around sustainable seafood. issues like overfishing, mangrove destruction, pollution and illegal fishing determined whether a seafood item was deemed one to enjoy or avoid.\n\nbut when reports began to surface in 2014 and 2015 that seafood harvested or processed by forced labor was making it into the supply chains of major u.s. retailers like walmart, kroger, safeway and restaurants like red lobster, corporations were quick to make public commitments and include stronger language in their supplier guidelines in hopes of addressing the problem. delivering on those promises, however, has proved harder. traceability alone hasn't been enough. until now, retailers have had few tools to make it easier to identify which fisheries are actually at higher risk for human rights abuses.\n\nit's a lament heard by seafood watch and others.\n\nthe companies knew their supply chains weren't transparent. they were obviously embarrassed and humiliated by being called out, says duncan jepson, founder of liberty asia, a nongovernmental organization that focuses on preventing human trafficking. he adds that the incentive for businesses to use the new seafood watch tool is obvious. from our perspective, the question now is, do you want to be involved or exposed to people earning their profits from these types of environments?\n\nmaisie ganzler is chief strategy and brand officer at bon appétit management company and oversees the food service company's supply chain and purchasing standards. she says it's difficult for any company to get assurances that the product it's buying was produced without slave labor. distance, language and cultural barriers, murky supply chains where seafood changes hands multiple times — all make the problem harder. she says america's country-of-origin labeling system, which labels where a tuna is canned but not where it is caught, also muddies the waters.\n\nand then you have the high prevalence of fraud, and i don't mean species fraud, says ganzler. if you're willing to enslave another human being or throw a worker overboard, are you willing to also falsify the papers that come with the fish? probably. these are the most hidden issues in the farthest reaches of the world. it's super hard.\n\nmcdonald of seafood watch says the data behind the new risk tool come from reliable government and media reports of known abuses; incidences of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; the number of days a fishing vessel is at sea; and more. the tool also considers other indicators, like whether there is evidence of forced labor, human trafficking and child labor in a country's other sectors — such as forestry, agriculture and aquaculture. that increases the likelihood that these abuses could be happening in fisheries as well, she says.\n\nunlike the aquarium's seafood watch app, the new seafood slavery risk tool will not advise retailers to purchase one species over another. instead, we say: stay, engage and create change in the industry by working with suppliers to change their practices, says mcdonald. with seafood watch, we have a lot of advice on what to purchase and what not, but it's very different with human rights abuses. if you boycott or avoid or stop purchasing, it drives it underground. every human rights expert we talked with says you can't boycott, you have to keep it out in the sunshine. that's the only way to make a difference.\n\nbut many retailers are already skittish about talking openly about slavery in the seafood industry, and it's unclear how they'll address these issues with their own customers. kroger, safeway, whole foods, hy-vee, walmart and red lobster did not respond or declined our requests for an interview for this story.\n\nno retailer is going to go out and talk much about the fact that there are labor rights issues in the supply chain, but it's critical that retailers stay in the game and continue to be involved, says dick jones, ceo of ocean outcomes, an international ngo focused on improving fisheries and fish farms in northeast asia. he likens it to the routine testing that retailers do for e. coli in ground beef. they don't tell their customers there's a risk. they just do it because it's the right thing to do, he says.\n\nother groups are also working on tools to help businesses avoid human rights abuses in their supply chains. the slavery and trafficking risk template is an open-source project by the social responsibility alliance to help companies build socially responsible supply chains. labor safe screen, developed by the sustainability incubator, is focused specifically on seafood products.\n\nthe reality is that no company right now can be 100 percent sure there's no slavery in the supply chain, says ganzler. all companies need to band together to work on the issue, along with the government. it really is an issue that governments are going to have to take action on.\n\nclare leschin-hoar is a journalist based in san diego who covers food policy and sustainability issues.\n\nthis story was produced in collaboration with the food & environment reporting network (fern), a nonprofit investigative journalism organization.
california health care workers overwhelmed amid covid-19 surge\n\nanother holiday surge of covid-19 patients is overwhelming california hospitals. healthcare workers are not only exhausted but also feeling betrayed and angry.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nright now, another holiday surge of covid-19 is crushing california's hospitals. every day, the virus is killing an average of 360 people across the state. doctors and nurses continue to push up against a breaking point. and as lesley mcclurg from member station kqed found, they're not only exhausted; they're feeling betrayed and angry.\n\nlesley mcclurg, byline: at her hospital in orange county, dr. dinora chinchilla says they don't have enough beds, so they've had to change the criteria for who qualifies for critical care. in other words, you have to be sicker to be admitted to the icu now.\n\ndinora chinchilla: all i see is sick, sick, sick, sick, sick and a lot of death.\n\nmcclurg: recently, chinchilla called me, crying on her drive home after losing so many patients in just a few days.\n\nchinchilla: i have never lost that many patients in a short period of time.\n\nmcclurg: here's what she faces daily - ambulances lined up around the block, patients in large white pop-up tents, halls overflowing. chinchilla tries to hold back tears when she gets home and her little kids run towards her after a long day.\n\nchinchilla: because i don't want them to see me sad. they give me a big hug, and they say, mommy, i'm a hero, too.\n\nmcclurg: back in the spring, chinchilla felt supported as a hero in her community. but now she feels betrayed.\n\nchinchilla: every time i see people on social media, like, having parties or gatherings, i literally say, unfriend, unfriend, unfriend. i just can't take it anymore - the selfishness.\n\nmcclurg: another doctor in orange county recently urged folks to stay home over the holidays in an instagram post. dr. victor cisneros says it was met by an assault of profane pandemic denial. he likens that to denying a soldier's experience on the battlefield.\n\nvictor cisneros: where he's getting shot at and fired at, you know, in - maybe in iraq and then people that are not there on the ground saying, this isn't real. you're not being shot at. this is fake.\n\nmcclurg: he's floored that people refuse to wear masks and continue to believe things that are untrue.\n\ncisneros: but they think there's, like, microchips in the vaccines, or they think that there's, you know, really bad side effects. and so i think that's very demoralizing sometimes as a health care provider where you're doing everything - you're putting so much work. and then there's a stronghold on the other side increasing the spread.\n\ndawn harris: i would say anger. i would say sadness.\n\nmcclurg: dr. dawn harris is the chief of medicine at sierra nevada memorial hospital, an overwhelmed facility in a small town northeast of sacramento.\n\nharris: you spend a shift taking care of people in your own community. and then you leave, and you're seeing people protesting having to wear a mask. and you're thinking, ok, but if you get sick, i'm going to be here for you. and that's hard. that is the thing that hurts me the most inside.\n\nmcclurg: she knows she can't afford to catch the virus.\n\nharris: we don't have that many doctors. if i get sick, you lose me.\n\nmcclurg: these health care workers describe a glaring disconnect between the reality inside the hospital and how the general public is acting. brittney watson is an emergency room nurse in oakland.\n\nbrittney watson: they don't see the people who are being rushed to the hospital who are like fishes out of water, who can't breathe.\n\nmcclurg: watson remembers the first time she was alone with a patient who died of covid-19. it makes her sad that under normal circumstances...\n\nwatson: there would be a whole family and group of friends that would be standing here, surrounding this person as they leave this world. and instead, they're left with me.\n\nmcclurg: a nurse covered in plastic from head to toe. visitors aren't allowed inside most hospitals right now. the patient couldn't even see the care in watson's face.\n\nwatson: they can only see this 2- to 3-inch window, my eyes and eyebrows. and that's the last person who's going to be with them.\n\nmcclurg: currently, a tidal wave is toppling her hospital. watson says it feels like the virus saturates every crevice.\n\nwatson: when i'm at work, it feels like the walls are coming in.\n\nmcclurg: the facility is in the midst of its second internal outbreak. health care workers themselves are getting sick. doctors like dawn harris at sierra nevada hospital sincerely want these holiday surges to be the last. the vaccine offers a glimmer of light.\n\nharris: it's the first time that we've used the word hope.\n\nmcclurg: but the christmas wave is just beginning to hit. a new year's surge is still a few weeks away, and many cold months lie ahead before the vaccine slows the virus.\n\nfor npr news, i'm lesley mcclurg in oakland.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

in fact, it is the largest number of projects led by women in the top 10 since the annual poll began 14 years ago, surpassing 2018, when women comprised a third of those rankings.\n\nthat would seem to be good news for a musical community that has been frustratingly slow to embrace women musicians. women in jazz have traditionally been singers, a role that allows them to be dismissed as entertainers who are not fundamental to jazz as serious art. few female instrumentalists — or, for that matter, composers, arrangers and bandleaders — have become part of the music's story, one that stretches back to the late 19th century.\n\nbut with the results of the 2020 npr music jazz critics poll only days away from publication, it is an opportune moment in which to revisit — and question — claims of women's progress. any of the optimistic assessments occasioned by this poll, and in the wake of jazz's #me too stirrings in recent years, are likely to be premature. only when women's participation in the music has been clearly defined, documented and measured can we be certain of any improvement in their collective status — or lack thereof.\n\nto that end, npr music commissioned lara pellegrinelli and a team of independent reporters to analyze the npr music jazz critics poll and see what concrete data could reveal about the role of gender in this particular critics' year-end list and the status of women jazz artists generally speaking. although the findings are currently limited to a gender binary, dividing artists into unequivocal categories for women and men, we acknowledge the presence of a broader spectrum of identities than our project was able to capture, including cisgender women and men, transgender women and men and those with non-binary, gender non-conforming and gender queer identities.\n\nby definition, lists are hierarchical. the politics of the communities who create them can be found embedded within them. the issues raised by this poll have relevance well beyond jazz for all sorts of critics' year-end lists. like npr music's turning the tables, a feminist intervention in the popular music canon, our inquiry also offers an opportunity to challenge list-making as a means of arriving at critical consensus that results in new musical histories and potentially perpetuates the conditions that enable the erasure of women musicians.\n\nhistorian sherrie tucker writes that jazz history is typically told as the history of records, the residue of living, breathing musical creation — an observation that could be extended to all kinds of music histories in the 20th and 21st centuries. but recordings are also made and circulated within a male-dominated industry and media. so the year-end polls that rank those projects — and empower experts to anoint or dismiss the artists who make them — warrant our skepticism and scrutiny.\n\nand we well know that year-end lists have additional lives as listening lists, shopping lists, booking lists and hiring lists. artists inevitably benefit from the prestige that the polls confer, creating a feedback loop that validates and fosters the visibility of their future labors. it is therefore important to understand whether or not they are reproducing and reinscribing gender bias.\n\nthe npr music jazz critics poll is particularly well-suited to close study. founded by francis davis in 2006 and published by npr music since 2013, it is the largest annual jazz critics poll, drawing the participation of up to nearly 150 critics who contribute to a range of media outlets. as such, it arguably provides the broadest picture of jazz criticism in a given year. although the published results on npr music highlight the top ten new releases, interested readers can access a complete list of the hundreds of albums for which critics cast votes, as well as their individual ballots, via a separate website.\n\naside from clarifying voting categories and the particulars of ballot submission, davis is hands-off in his management of the poll, not wishing to influence the results. he defines the activity simply: it's the way a critic takes a stand and says this is what is best, he explained in a recent interview by phone.\n\nhow the poll works: participants in the npr music jazz critics poll are instructed to pay tribute to the performers who created the best recorded jazz in the past calendar year. they submit their choices for the top 10 new releases, which are assigned points via a weighted system: 10 points for first place, nine for second, etc. if a participant files an unranked list, albums receive 5.5 points each. voters also provide single choices for vocal, debut and latin jazz albums, as well as three rara avis selections, a category that includes reissues, historical recordings, and vault discoveries. the system is modeled on rock critic robert christgau's pazz & jop poll, which began at the village voice in 1971 and was a successor to polls published by jazz & pop magazine in the late 1960s.\n\n***\n\nrather than steady progress, this wealth of data indicates that women's critical recognition through the poll has remained static over the years. the percentage of projects led or co-led by women in the top ten has ranged from 0% to 50%, but has not made consistent gains.\n\nthis is, however, a narrow sample. broadening the base for analysis to the top 50 new releases offers a clearer picture. the percentage of projects led or co-led by women over the life of the poll has ranged from 8% to 20% — until 2019, when it jumped to 34%, perhaps the result of recent #metoo consciousness raising or the happenstance of a particularly strong year for recordings by women musicians. it is not possible to say whether or not last year's poll represents a significant difference in the status of women or is an outlier until the 2020 poll data is available.\n\nfor the poll's three most recent years (2017, 2018, 2019), the team analyzed every new recording that received a vote, as many as 500 recordings per year. the total number of projects led and co-led by women artists represented in the poll over that time span was between 18% and 22%, in keeping with the representation of women in multiyear analysis of the top 50. although the number of women in the top 10 in 2019 was 50%, and higher than it had ever been before, the number of projects led or co-led by women overall actually declined slightly from 22% in 2018 to 21% in 2019.\n\nthis information does not suggest a jazz landscape where women and men participate equally, but where a small, selective group of women sometimes receive attention as exceptional talents. the names of female artists who frequent the top of the poll would likely be familiar to jazz fans: big band leader maria schneider, saxophonist jane ira bloom, pianists myra melford and carla bley, clarinetist anat cohen, drummer terri lyne carrington, vocalist cécile mclorin salvant, flutist nicole mitchell and the late pianist geri allen prominent among them. they appear in the poll time and time again. (it is also worth noting the labels that these women record for: although a handful appear on jazz stalwarts like verve, concord and ecm, and some self-release their projects, more of them record for prominent indies favored by critics such as intakt, motema, greenleaf, clean feed and firehouse 12.)\n\ncase in point: the 2018 npr music jazz critics poll had a total of four projects led or co-led by women in its top ten. at closer inspection, that is less than it appears: two are the same person, guitarist mary halvorson, who received recognition for her recording code girl (firehouse 12) and as a co-leader of the trio thumbscrew with bassist michael formanek and drummer tomas fujiwara for ours/theirs (cuneiform). halvorson has appeared as a leader or co-leader in the top 50 of the poll 10 times. some of the women who play in halvorson's bands appear in the poll as leaders of their own projects, most prominently pianist kris davis, whose diatom ribbons (pyroclastic) was no. 1 in 2019; this was her fourth appearance in the poll's top 50.\n\nindividual musicians can be exceptional, but that can actually reinforce inequities, says npr music's critic ann powers, co-creator of turning the tables and a veteran of the village voice's pazz and jop polls during her tenure there as music editor. you need to have a woman not just at no. 1, but at no. 8, and no. 10 and no. 25. you need an equal distribution, otherwise the women at the top are forever an exception.\n\nvocalists vs. instrumentalists: recordings led or co-led by female instrumentalists earned more spots in the critic's poll than those led or co-led by female vocalists: 13% vs. 5% in 2017, 15% vs. 5% in 2018, and 14% vs. 7% in 2019. this quantifies the greater critical acceptance of instrumentalists over singers, although vocalists do appear in the poll more often than those performing on any other single instrument. the data does not indicate any further preferences among critics between instruments played by women in jazz.\n\nthe hypothesis that critical recognition is disproportionately limited to a small group of exceptional women is supported by a deeper analysis of the data for 2017, 2018 and 2019. the team researched the full personnel on every album that received a vote through publicly available information online (via individual artist and record label websites, discogs and allmusic.com). we documented whenever a recording included women as sidemen, essential members of an ensemble other than its leader; we will refer to them as core band members. we distinguished between these musicians, who are essential to a band, and others we who might be considered additional or ancillary personnel: those who performed as guests limited to a few album tracks or took on non-improvising roles, typically on non-traditional jazz instruments (such as background vocalists, and string and wind players employed on large ensemble arrangements).\n\nloading...\n\nloading...\n\nduring those three years, the majority of jazz recordings ranked in the poll included no women musicians at all among their core personnel: 67% in 2017, 65% in 2018 and 58% in 2019. we can also slice the data a different way, by totaling the core band members for each project and counting the number of women among them: women comprised only 11% of all core personnel in 2017, 13% in 2018 and 16% in 2019.\n\nevaluating the numbers: if projects led and co-led by women are 18% to 22% of all albums that received votes in the poll in 2017, 2018 and 2019, is that number high or low relative to all of the projects released by women during those years? likewise, is the number of women core band members, 11% to 16% of total personnel for those years, high or low relative to the number of women performing professionally? unfortunately, there are no ready-made statistics for direct comparison. we can, however, look to other sources for context. for example, the membership of the jazz education network (jen), an organization that connects musicians, educators, students and fans, is 31% female based on their most recent data. the membership of the american federation of musicians local #802 in new york city, which includes a broad stylistic range of musicians from jazz to broadway to classical orchestras, is 26% female, a number based on those who voluntarily report gender on their membership forms. both of these statistics suggest that the representation of women in the npr music jazz critics' poll is low, indicating a gap between the numbers of women working in the field and their critical recognition.\n\nalthough these statistics may indicate some positive change in the representation of women, they paint a very different picture of that progress than an analysis of the top 10 or even top 50. they suggest that the majority of band leaders, both male and female, fail to hire women for their recording projects, though women hire other women musicians at a higher rate than men do (24% vs. 18% in 2017; 28% vs. 17% in 2018; and 42% vs. 24% in 2019).\n\nthe musicians with whom band leaders choose to record are often a reflection of who they work with in live performance. together, these streams of income are significant if jazz musicians are meant to earn some semblance of a living performing, especially when studies show that their overall income is declining. in a profession that has traditionally employed an apprentice system, where up-and-coming musicians work as sidemen in the service of more experienced leaders before going out on their own, women do not have equal access to these rungs on the professional ladder, which impacts not only their musical development but also their critical recognition. ready or not, they may have no choice but to lead their own projects if they wish to succeed.\n\n***\n\nin his introductory email to participants last year, founder francis davis stated that the poll's purpose is to provide an annual snapshot of critical consensus regarding jazz, while acknowledging diversity of opinion via the online posting of individual ballots. the poll data itself, however, challenges ideas about the meaning and value of that consensus.\n\nthe outcome of the poll depends in part on who votes in it. women and men exhibit different voting preferences along gender lines; an analysis of the individual ballots from 2017, 2018 and 2019 shows that women critics were approximately one and a half times more likely to vote for projects led or co-led by women musicians than their male counterparts. in addition, researching individual ballots revealed that, on average, 12% of male critics ranked no projects led or co-led by women musicians at all, even during years when a substantial number of women made recordings compelling enough to land in the top 10 and top 50.\n\nit's worth considering, then, the low number of women critics who participate in the poll. in its first year, there were none among the 40 participants; in 2019, women critics comprised 10 out of 141 critics total, or 7%, the highest number in the poll's history. by comparison, women are 19% of the voting members of the jazz journalists association, and 16% of those within the organization who specifically identify themselves as jazz writers.\n\nof course, gender parity among voters would be unlikely to result in the equal representation of women musicians in the poll. being female doesn't render women critics immune to implicit bias. and women jazz musicians are fewer in numbers than their male counterparts. but, if all of the critics who voted in 2019 had been female, we can project that the number of recordings led or co-led by women musicians would be 32% of the total ranked albums — a number consistent with the 30% female membership of jen. in other words, if everyone had voted the way that female critics did, the representation of women musicians in the poll would be in keeping with the number we estimate to be working as professional performers.\n\nbut some structural factors in this poll mean that the addition of even a single female critic — someone more likely to vote for projects led by women — could be consequential in terms of increasing women's representation, even at the very top of the rankings. in voting, each critic ranks their choices from one to 10, with a first-place nomination equaling ten points, second place equaling nine and so on in a weighted system. because so many different albums receive votes across all the ballots — some years, as many as 500 albums — comparatively small point totals are needed for high rankings in the poll. sometimes the top albums are only separated by a handful of points.\n\nthis is what the numbers looked like in 2019: 86 different recordings received first-place nominations from 141 critics. kris davis landed in the top spot with a total of 260 points; she appeared on just a quarter of the ballots. a project needed only 105 points to earn a place in the top 10 (a minimum of 11 ballots), and a mere 33 points to place in the top 50 (a minimum of four ballots).\n\nclearly, every participant matters. angel bat dawid's debut the oracle (international anthem) landed in the no. 30 spot with 59 points, 19 of which came from shannon effinger and jordannah elizabeth, who are also members of this team of reporters. effinger joined the poll in 2017. elizabeth joined in 2018.\n\nthe outcome of the poll has a direct impact on individual musicians' careers and, ultimately, the formation of new musical canons, a point at which women may face erasure. so without a majority of votes to determine a winner, should the poll results carry the weight of a unified critical ruling? it's as close as we can come, says davis, citing the difficulties that stem from an abundance of releases and competing stylistic branches of the jazz tradition, not to mention a group of voters one might characterize as stubbornly individualistic.\n\nin reality, consensus may be an illusion, one that mirrors the systemic problems responsible for marginalizing women in jazz in the first place. journalist and scholar chris robinson, whose academic work focuses on jazz criticism and critics' polls in particular, explains that its basis lies in something social rather than numerical.\n\nit's almost self-fulfilling, he says. if you're putting in the work, you're going to be getting the albums. if you're getting the albums, you're going to know what's out there. if you know what's out there, you're going to be voting with the same other people who are pretty much just like you because who else could the publicists be reaching out to but the same 130 white guys and ten women, or whatever it is.\n\nit perpetuates the myth of the american meritocracy: that if musicians are good, they'll succeed, without allowing us to actually look and see what's happening. we have the same community engaged in the same activities under a guy who decides who's an expert and who's doing the work— and where critics face the same peer pressures that can shape how they vote, compelling them to consider what is currently trendy, who their peers voted for in the previous poll and how projects have been already covered by certain esteemed critics and publications in a pre-existing professional hierarchy.\n\nrobinson goes further to say that who is voting produces a notion of consensus because they're more or less the same demographic in terms of race and gender. that allows them to think of themselves as a unified group. in other words, a feeling of a unity is derived from the shared values and identity of those participating — mostly seasoned white male critics — rather than the process or outcome. adding additional women critics might then have another, larger impact on the poll by challenging that claim of unity.\n\n***\n\nwhen i first started listening to jazz and they'd have a critics poll, says davis, i'd read them to see who don heckman, nat hentoff, martin williams and amiri baraka thought was the best. and i'd make an effort to hear those records. i first heard of albert ayler because he was on baraka and williams' ballots. it wasn't like you could turn on the radio and hear him.\n\nthey formed my taste, he adds.\n\npolls can call attention to deserving talents, and they can also influence a community of critics, the reason davis insists on publishing the individual ballots. he acknowledges that bias can be reproduced in this quest for identifying the best, and that sexism is part of the music industry that determines so much of the jazz landscape in which the poll operates. in fact, he's flagged that outsized influence, and celebrated women's victories in the top 10, in his annual editorials accompanying the poll results. as the sole arbiter of who participates in the poll, he's made efforts to recruit more women, as well as people of color and younger critics, who are also in short supply among the poll's current participants.\n\nbut asked if the poll itself bears some responsibility for these systemic gender issues, and whether or not they require intervention, his answer is noncommittal. i don't know, he says. that's a good question. you're asking it about the poll. you could be asking it about criticism and jazz journalism in general. is it part of the industry or is it standing off to the side pointing? martin williams called his downbeat column 'bystander.' i like to think of myself more as a bystander. (incidentally, williams helped establish the idea that jazz could be judged objectively as an intellectual exercise by critics who were experts.)\n\nyes, you have an ethical obligation to intervene, counters ann powers. one gradual change you could make is to look at who gets to be in your critics' circle. do you have room for deejays who aren't necessarily considered critics? do you have room for educators? for a certain kind of player? why wouldn't a musician be as much of an expert about music as a critic? these are some of the hard questions we need to ask ourselves to challenge our ideas of what expertise is.\n\nand to challenge us to think through the ways that expertise is gendered. many of the women who davis invites to contribute to the npr music jazz critics poll decline to participate, some explaining that they hadn't listened to enough new recordings to feel confident in choosing the year's best, davis writes in his editorial note accompanying the 2018 results. a male colleague suggested this was 'a gendered response,' but i don't buy it. male invitees voted at approximately the same rate, many declining for the same reason. besides, pauline kael, susan sontag, ellen willis and valerie wilmer never had to be coaxed to share their opinions. they couldn't stop themselves, and neither could anyone else.\n\nthat's a collection of extraordinary critics, each of whom faced her own unique challenges, the full costs of which we'll never know. in any case, does a woman really need to be susan sontag to have an opinion worth voting on?\n\nthe reasons women don't participate may be more complex. they certainly face barriers to fully participating in jazz criticism as a male-dominated field, to getting work where male editors are gatekeepers and establishing themselves as experts. they may be more reluctant to express their authority, to be seen as taking up valuable space, or to subject themselves to public scrutiny for championing artists who matter to them, specifically female artists — factors that all six of the authors of this study would like to acknowledge. women may also feel disinclined to operate in spaces where their male colleagues' criticism of women's work as musicians seems so clearly gendered: in which women musicians may receive less press coverage; they are objectified by physical descriptions and their music is evaluated on traits that are thought of as gendered (where playing harder, faster, louder and more sophisticated music is gendered male).\n\nalthough there is not yet any formal research on gendered language in jazz criticism, a 2014 study by kieran snyder that collects performance reviews of employees in the tech industry provides some parallels.\n\nshowing early inequalities in who received promotions, she found that women received significantly more critical feedback than men, much of it on the basis of personality traits that were contradictory. for example, women's behaviors were described as bossy, abrasive, strident and aggressive, whereas men were considered confident and assertive. men were also perceived as being naturally more competent at technical work than women. it is not difficult to extrapolate how similar biases might impact female jazz musicians in critical appraisals of their work, a professional realm in which there is no hr department to whom one can complain.\n\nin other words, women critics may be reluctant to express their own authority — or to believe in such authority in the first place. to do so would be to ignore their own gendered experiences in jazz. it would also mean embracing false ideals of merit that have historically been used to justify women's low performance and exclusion.\n\nif consensus is even possible, we must imagine a better way to get there. it could begin with a shared mission understood by all, a large and diverse body of voters, people willing to engage in conversation and a culture of respect that allows all the participants to feel that their opinions are valid.\n\nin contrast to the npr music jazz critics poll, bandcamp recently announced a decision to stop ranking its year-end list, presenting albums thematically as an alternative that prioritizes storytelling. time magazine has also published unranked lists including all-time 100 novels and all-time 100 movies, offering its critics' choices for the best of these forms since the magazine was founded in 1923. the zora canon, the 100 greatest books ever written by african american women, published last january, offers an alternative canon to those like time's, selected by a panel of experts with whom the editors worked to vet and shape the final list.\n\nother npr year-end lists, including those for turning the tables, are composed not through independent voting, but a nominations process, the sharing of listening lists before any voting takes place, messages over slack channels and face-to-face discussions. even interns have a say. decisions are made collectively in dialogue rather than mathematically. the process is collaborative rather than independent and positivistic.\n\na couple of generations of younger women writers, what i'd call cohorts, have emerged in non-jazz music criticism, powers observes. many of the best music writers are now women. there's a lot of support for each other. what's interesting is that with that shift, with that critical mass, there's a comfort and sense of their own authority. i've also seen a re-emergence and interest in participating in legacy-making spearheaded by women. some younger women that i know in the pop world actually love to make lists. i think that's great — but i don't know. is jazz there yet?

probably looked familiar to many people in phoenix: tens of thousands massing outside chase field on a bright thursday afternoon in april, clad in red and rippling with anticipation. but that scene, if it were typical, would feature fans of the arizona diamondbacks — not the teachers who gathered near the baseball stadium with quite another event in mind.\n\neducators across arizona walked out of their classrooms thursday with a series of demands in hand, foremost among them a raise and a return to the school funding levels of a decade ago. and many of those walking out have descended on downtown phoenix, where they are marching from chase field to a rally outside the state capitol. organizers expected from 30,000 to 50,000 teachers and their supporters to attend.\n\nmeanwhile, scores of public school districts and charter schools closed for the day for lack of staff. according to an analysis by the arizona republic, more than 840,000 of 1.1 million students — or about 75 percent statewide — have been affected by the closures.\n\ni think our students understand that we need a change and enough is enough, noah karvelis, a teacher and organizer of arizona educators united, said at a news conference wednesday ahead of the rally. the grass-roots group is behind #redfored, the movement calling on teachers and their supporters to wear red in solidarity.\n\nwe simply can't take it any longer, karvelis said.\n\nat the protest's heart are escalating frustrations with pay and financial support for schools — similar to those that have motivated teachers in several other states to walk out since a showdown in west virginia ended with a salary bump for educators there. in colorado, teachers are also mounting protests thursday and friday, which have already resulted in the closure of a handful of that state's large school districts.\n\nin arizona, the aeu has announced five central demands — among which are 20 percent raises for teachers and certified staff in the next school year, smaller class sizes, and yearly bumps in pay until the state reaches the national average salary, which hovers at nearly $59,000 per year for public school teachers.\n\ncurrently, arizona's average stands at just over $47,000, according to the national center for education statistics.\n\nthe state's governor, doug ducey, has proposed a 20 percent pay raise for arizona teachers by 2020, saying, this raise is earned, and it is deserved.\n\nto parents, i understand the pain and pressure caused by today's strike. i want you to know, i am working to get this 20 percent raise passed at the legislature. but we need your help to make it a reality, he said in a statement thursday, encouraging parents to contact their legislators over the matter.\n\nyet the protesting teachers have already rejected this proposal, calling it unsustainable as it is currently drawn up. teachers groups, including the arizona parent teacher association, argue that under the plan the raise would simply cause woes for others in the state's educational system.\n\ni believe that the people are with us, and that provides the public pressure to get the governor to move, arizona education association president joe thomas said wednesday, according to the republic newspaper.\n\nin this respect, an npr/ipsos poll released thursday appears to back him up. nearly two-thirds of respondents approved of national teachers unions, and three-quarters said teachers have the right to strike.\n\nin phoenix, meanwhile, the protesters plan to ensure their demands are heard thursday — literally, in fact. the demonstrators are wrapping up their march outside the state's legislative buildings, where they are holding a rally right outside lawmakers' offices.\n\nmeanwhile, in colorado, teachers gathered outside the state's capitol in denver, where thousands of demonstrators have kicked off two days of planned rallies. they are also pushing for more school funding — but an amendment to the colorado constitution some 25 years ago makes their fight a little different from others.\n\nthe voter-approved amendment, known as the taxpayer's bill of rights, required that voters, not lawmakers, have the final say on tax increases, and it capped tax revenue, jenny brundin of colorado public radio explained in 2016. anything the state raised over that cap — typically in boom years — would be refunded to taxpayers.\n\nso rather than aiming their protests directly at legislators, teachers are seeking the approval of a proposed 2018 ballot initiative that would raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy to increase funds for public education.\n\nthey are also warily eyeing pension negotiations underway between state lawmakers, which may significantly alter the structure of state employee pensions. a similar alteration in kentucky, which passed the state's legislature in a surprise move last month, has prompted widespread protests in that state, as well.\n\nschools in four colorado counties closed thursday, saying there would be too many teacher absences to properly provide classes. and denver public schools, one of the state's biggest districts, has canceled friday's classes, citing the number of teachers planning to take the entire day off and adding: this is the case with most of our surrounding districts as well.
residents of east austin, once a bustling black enclave, make a suburban exodus\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jorge sanhueza-lyon/kut jorge sanhueza-lyon/kut\n\non a sunday in late april, pastor clarence jones asked his congregation to join him.\n\noh magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together. congregation? he said, his voice booming from the front of the church. roughly 40 congregants seated in the pews responded: i saw the lord and he heard me...\n\nfor 30 years, jones has led the greater st. john's baptist church in east austin, the city's historically black neighborhood. the church has been here for more than 75 years.\n\nback in 1944-45, somewhere in there, the members moved here, pitched a tent, said jones. and they worshiped in the tent until they was able to build this 'little port' right here.\n\nthis 'little port' is a small church on a corner lot in a residential neighborhood. the exterior white paint is chipped, and a steeple rises above the gabled roof. around the time this church was built, single-story homes were cropping up around it. people like choir director lisa spearman have spent many sundays in the area.\n\ni have belonged to this church since i was a little girl, said spearman, who took over the job of choir director from her mother. maybe four years old.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jorge sanhueza-lyon/kut jorge sanhueza-lyon/kut\n\nbut as the neighborhood around the church has begun to change — with two- and three-story homes replacing the older, ranch-style houses — spearman and others have moved to surrounding suburbs. spearman had been living in her grandmother's house when the family decided to sell.\n\nthe taxes were too high – sky high, said spearman, who three years ago moved to manor, texas, a small town about 15 miles east of austin. houses around us were getting remodeled and sold for double, triple of what they paid for back in the day.\n\nten years ago, pastor jones also left austin for manor. after renting in east austin, jones and his wife went looking for a house to buy. but they couldn't afford anything in the neighborhood they had lived in for most of their lives. so, like spearman, they bought a home in manor.\n\nwe thank god that we found a beautiful home out there, said jones.\n\npushed out\n\naustin's e. 11th street was once a business and entertainment corridor for the city's black residents. back in the 1950s and 60s, nightclubs on the street hosted major music acts. shops also served residents during the day.\n\nyou had hillside pharmacy, which was the main pharmacy for african-american residents on the eastside, said university of texas professor eric tang, as he walked down the street.\n\nand residents had few options of where to shop — or where to live. in 1928, the city of austin approved a plan to cut off basic services to black residents unless they lived in east austin. so, this area became a bustling black neighborhood, and remained that way for the next 60 years.\n\nbut recently, the businesses have changed. tang pointed out what the pharmacy on e. 11th street is now.\n\nhillside pharmacy, by name, still exists, and it's rather controversial, said tang. it is now a restaurant and pharm, p-h-a-r-m has been replaced by farm f-a-r-m to highlight the farm-to-table service that this restaurant provides to its customers.\n\nmany longtime residents told tang the the new businesses aren't catering to them — an anecdote indicating a larger shift. in 2014, tang published a report detailing how among the fastest growing u.s. cities between 2000 and 2010, austin was the only city to see a decline in its black population.\n\nin the years since that report, tang has published follow-up research, including a paper called those who left. using the information collected from 100 interviews, tang found that the majority of people left austin because of unaffordable housing, while nearly one-fourth said they left in search of better schools for their kids. many felt they had been pushed out.\n\nand where were they going? tang found that black residents left austin for suburbs to the north and east of the city. places such as manor, elgin and round rock. but these aren't suburbs as we often think of them.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption gabriel cristóver pérez/kut gabriel cristóver pérez/kut\n\nthese are areas which are largely isolated from the urban core where there are poor transportation options, said tang. they're known as food deserts. people feel like they have less access to health care and other amenities. so, these are suburbs to the extent that they're outside the urban core. but they are not a move up for people. they're simply a move out.\n\nthat's pretty sad for me\n\nleslie perkins moved to manor, texas roughly 12 years ago. the town has a population of fewer than 10,000 residents.\n\nperkins stands on the town's main street, pointing to manor grocery, a convenience store that once served as one of the town's few grocery options.\n\nthis is the grocery store that i used to go to when i first moved here, said perkins, who's a former teacher and now works for an education non-profit. it's very small, not very much fresh produce.\n\nbut while austin has lost black residents, manor's black population has increased by 10 percent since 2000, according to census figures. perkins left austin for manor when she began hunting for a home to buy.\n\neven though i was a teacher, i could not afford to live in austin, said perkins. so the closest and most direct to my job was manor.\n\nsoon, she transitioned jobs too, and began teaching in a manor school. when she did, perkins witnessed the migration of black families like her own.\n\nmy students followed, said perkins. so, i would be teaching a new group of students, but i'd be like 'oh, i know your cousin. or you're the younger sibling of the student i already taught.'\n\nperkins' family still drives into the city for things manor can't offer: a museum or a dip in a pool. she misses living in austin. but asked if she would move back, she said no.\n\nmoving back would not be an option because it doesn't feel as welcoming as it would, said perkins. i went to church in the area and i lived there. i was a part of the community. it doesn't really exist anymore as it did. and that's pretty sad for me.\n\nthe church's future\n\nback at greater st. john's baptist church in east austin, the service is winding down. congregants form a line along the pews, singing to and shaking the hands of fellow churchgoers as they walk to the door.\n\nas people head to their cars, they pass a for sale on the front lawn. the church, soon, may follow its congregants.\n\ni see a whole lot of hope and growth out there in manor, said jones. i think the church would do well to move in that direction.

appeals court hears challenge to obama power-plant emissions rule\n\nyoutube\n\na panel of judges tuesday is hearing a case that could change the future of the power industry.\n\nthe d.c. circuit is hearing an appeal of the clean power plan, an obama administration rule that would restrict carbon emissions from coal- and gas-fired power plants.\n\nthe clean power plan may be the most ambitious carbon regulation proposed to date in the u.s. the outcome of this case has the potential to shut down a large chunk of existing coal-fired power plants and it will have a big impact on coal-producing states.\n\nthe plan would require a 32 percent cut in carbon emissions from power plants by 2030, although individual states have their own targets which in some cases are much stricter. twenty-four states have sued the environmental protection agency over the rule, arguing that it would hurt their economies and make power more expensive for consumers.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption michael s. williamson/the washington post/getty images michael s. williamson/the washington post/getty images\n\narguments also focus on whether the rule is constitutional — if it represents federal overreach — whether the epa can regulate a pollutant under two different sections of the clean air act and whether the agency changed the plan too much between the draft of the rule and the final version.\n\nappearing before the court, west virginia solicitor general elbert lin argued that the epa had overstepped its authority. the associated press reported:\n\nby limiting carbon emissions as it does other pollutants such as mercury and sulfur dioxide, lin said the epa was in effect requiring states to transform their electricity generation systems by favoring one source of energy over another. west virginia's economy is reliant on coal mining and gets 96 percent of its electricity from coal-fired plants.  'this rule is not about improving the performance of existing power plants,' lin told the judges. 'it's about shutting them down.' \n\njustice department lawyer eric hostetler said the epa was simply requiring what the free market is already doing amid the power industry's shift toward cheaper natural gas, the ap reported. this rule addresses the key environmental challenge of our time, and does so cost effectively, he said.\n\noriginally, a panel of just three circuit court judges was scheduled to hear the case, but tuesday's hearing is before the full court.\n\nthe supreme court put the clean power plan on hold earlier this year. and with the death of supreme court justice antonin scalia in february, the circuit court's ruling could ultimately decide the case if the supreme court is evenly divided or decides not to take up the case.\n\nstephanie joyce is with inside energy, a public media collaboration focused on america's energy issues.
the underwater damage left behind after hurricanes\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nthe u.s. virgin islands were devastated by hurricanes maria and irma, leaving homes collapsed and trees toppled on land. but there was also a great deal of damage under the water. in st. john, the storms churned up parts of the lush coral reef, depositing chunks on the beaches. joining us now to talk about it is marine biologist peter edmunds of california state university, northridge. he's been studying those reefs in st. john for more than three decades. welcome to the program, sir.\n\npeter edmunds: thank you very much. a pleasure to be here.\n\ngarcia-navarro: you received national science foundation support to visit st. john in november. and you took a look at the coral. what did you see?\n\nedmunds: well, storms bring massive waves that - 20, 25 feet in height to the surface. and those waves bring tremendous forces underwater that drag things across the bottom and break things off the bottom and cause a tremendous amount of scarring. and so in the virgin islands, we're accustomed to calm, sheltered waters, sunny days and spectacular underwater visibility. and then after a storm, everything has changed. and it's a remarkable game trying to imagine what it was like on that night of the storm.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so you saw specifically, i think, in the shallower parts quite a bit of damage. tell me what you saw there.\n\nedmunds: most folks who visit the virgin islands and snorkel around the virgin islands will snorkel in water that is five, 10 to 20 feet deep. and those are the areas that are most prone to the damage. and sure enough, when we swam over those areas, we saw the damage, the toppling and the scarring. but once we got below about 20, 25 feet, it was a different story. and certainly, you can find broken corals and toppled sea fans and the damage. but i think what was remarkable was the amount of coral and soft coral that survived.\n\ngarcia-navarro: we do know that there have been coral bleaching events and that there are pressures because of climate change. and add to that a storm like this. and is it harder for the reefs to recover?\n\nedmunds: absolutely. it's a situation where you've got slow challenges playing out over decades and centuries. and you've got short-term challenges playing out overnight. and one playing out over the night were the hurricanes. and the longer-term things are rising sea water temperature and declining ph of the ocean. and so since there are now fewer corals on adjacent islands, it will slow the rate of which the reefs recover. and i think that is very worrying. but that's quite different from saying that they won't recover. and i think in addition, the kinds of coral that live there are changing dramatically, as well.\n\ngarcia-navarro: explain.\n\nedmunds: the classic corals of the caribbean you might have seen there in the 1950s, 1960s would've been towering elkhorn and staghorn corals and beautiful, massive star corals. and unfortunately, those are the corals that have suffered particularly acutely from diseases and rising temperature and previous storms. but in their place are corals that are growing that are a more weedy species in the sense that - of a weed in your garden. they're small. they're perhaps a little drab. there's lots of them. they grow fast. and they die fast, as well. but they are a shadow of the kind of corals that used to be found there 50 years ago.\n\ngarcia-navarro: can you give us a sense of what percentage of the coral reef was damaged if you could quantify it and the timeline for recovery?\n\nedmunds: in some of the places where we were, by august of 2017, when we were last there before the hurricane, one-tenth of the sea floor or less was covered by live coral. and now 3 or 4 percent of that has been killed. and the rate of recovery will be slow. corals grow very slowly. so probably by next summer, we'll start to see baby corals settling on the reef. and some of those will survive and produce the reefs of tomorrow. but whether they do that or not will depend on these progressive changes in the environmental conditions and whether or not there are further category 5 storms in 2018 or 2019 or 2020.\n\ngarcia-navarro: marine biologist peter edmunds of california state university, northridge, thank you so much.\n\nedmunds: thank you very much.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
feds to waive penalties for some who signed up late for medicare\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption getty images/istockphoto getty images/istockphoto\n\neach year, thousands of americans miss their deadline to enroll in medicare, and federal officials and consumer advocates worry that many of them mistakenly think they don't need to sign up because they have purchased insurance on the affordable care act's marketplaces. that failure to enroll on time can leave them facing a lifetime of penalties.\n\nnow medicare has temporarily changed its rules to offer a reprieve from those late-enrollment penalties for anyone who kept the aca policy after becoming eligible for medicare part b. for those 65 and older and for people with disabilities, medicare part b covers doctor visits and outpatient care.\n\nmany of these people who missed the deadline did not receive the information necessary ... through the marketplace to make an informed decision regarding medicare enrollment, says a medicare spokesman, explaining the policy change.\n\nautumn deadline to request a waiver of the late-enrollment penalty\n\npeople age 65 and older who have a marketplace plan or had one they lost or canceled, as well as people who qualify for medicare because of a disability, but chose to stay with a marketplace plan, may qualify for the penalty waiver or a reduction. they'll now have until sept. 30 to request the waiver, according to federal health officials.\n\nthis has been a problem from the beginning of the affordable care act because the government didn't understand that people would not know when they needed to sign up for medicare, says bonnie burns, a consultant for the consumer group california health advocates. once they had insurance, that relieved all the stress of not having coverage and then when they became eligible for medicare, nobody told them to make that change.\n\nlisa grimes' 49-year-old sister is one of those people. she receives social security disability benefits because of mental illness. she became eligible for medicare automatically because of the disability benefits, but she had marketplace coverage at that time. (grimes agreed to be interviewed as long as her sister was not identified.)\n\ngrimes' sister mistakenly opted to keep her marketplace plan and drop her part b coverage, probably because her marketplace premium at the time cost half as much, says grimes. that decision has kept grimes, a st. louis real estate lawyer, busy for months, unraveling the consequences.\n\nonly after the sister's $50 monthly premium ballooned to $360 did she and grimes learn that marketplace customers lose their premium subsidies when they join medicare.\n\nthe rules are tricky, and mistakes are common\n\n\n\nother medicare beneficiaries have made similar mistakes by assuming they didn't need part b if they had a marketplace plan, or retiree coverage from a former employer, or health coverage through the department of veterans affairs, or via a current employer with fewer than 20 workers. beneficiaries didn't realize that none of these is a substitute for medicare part b.\n\ngrimes says her sister couldn't afford the new marketplace premium and had to drop her plan last year. after that, the social security administration denied her appeal to reinstate her part b coverage with no penalty or wait period. then she learned about the new medicare waiver — from a missouri counselor at the state health insurance assistance program.\n\nit took several hours for grimes to find the right letters and other documents needed to apply for the waiver, since her sister's filing system was a large shopping bag. but with assistance from the medicare rights center, a consumer advocacy nonprofit, her sister eventually received part b coverage without a late fee or waiting period. it was retroactive, so she may even be reimbursed for the medical bills she paid last fall and winter when she had no insurance coverage for doctor visits.\n\nusually people need to sign up for part b within three months before or after turning 65 if they aren't getting job-based insurance, or when their job-based health insurance ends if they are older than 65, according to medicare rules. most people under 65 who receive social security disability benefits qualify for part b after 24 months of benefits.\n\nunder the aca, people who qualify for medicare will lose subsidies if they choose to remain in plans purchased on the federal or state exchanges. and being enrolled in one of those plans does not protect them from a permanent late enrollment penalty from medicare.\n\nmarketplace insurers, who are often the first to spot when a member is turning 65, are barred under the health law from canceling coverage because that member may qualify for medicare, burns says.\n\nlast summer, medicare officials began sending emails each month to about 15,000 people who have subsidized coverage through the federally run marketplace. the notices target people approaching their 65th birthday and tell them how to avoid an unwanted overlap in marketplace and medicare coverage. officials also began contacting individuals who already have both medicare and subsidized marketplace coverage, urging them to discontinue the latter.\n\nhow to get a waiver of the penalty\n\nyet many people have missed the warnings.\n\nthese are very complex rules, says stacy sanders, federal policy director at the medicare rights center, which spearheaded an effort in 2015 by nearly 50 unions, insurance companies and seniors' advocacy organizations to convince medicare officials to address the problem.\n\nthe lack of good notification was leading people down a dangerous path in terms of declining or delaying part b, sanders says.\n\nin march, medicare began emailing letters about the temporary waiver to some people 65 and older who are enrolled in plans sold on the marketplaces run by the federal government. but others who may be eligible for a waiver are not getting those notices.\n\ncalifornia, which has the largest state-run marketplace, serving 1.4 million consumers, is planning a similar information campaign. so are some other states that run their own marketplaces, including connecticut, massachusetts and new york.\n\npeople who may be eligible for the waiver, officially called time-limited equitable relief, must submit a request by sept. 30. you can find information on how to apply on the medicare rights center's medicare interactive website or can call the center's helpline at 800-333-4114.\n\nkaiser health news, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the kaiser family foundation. find khn's susan jaffe on twitter @susanjaffe
pittsburgh faces hurdles in removing lead from drinking water\n\npittsburgh faces a pennsylvania state mandate to lower the amount of lead in its drinking water. the city's initial effort backfired, and the job will drag on for years.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nthree years after flint, mich.'s lead crisis began, many other cities are still struggling to deal with the same problem. pittsburgh is one of them, mired in an effort to replace lead pipes laid down decades ago. the city is now under state mandate to lower the amount of lead in its drinking water. but as the allegheny front's reid frazier reports, it faces legal, technical and financial hurdles.\n\n(soundbite of shovels digging)\n\nreid frazier: on pittsburgh's north side, a work crew digs through asphalt, cement and clay. an hour in and five feet below the street, mark mcclafferty shovels out one last scoop of dirt before finding what he's been looking for.\n\nmark mcclafferty: lead.\n\nfrazier: he sees the telltale sign of lead pipes, large round lumps where different sections of pipe join together, almost like the pipes are swollen.\n\nmcclafferty: like a ball there. it's round. that's when they heat it up and melt the lead together. anything else would have a nut on it.\n\nfrazier: since failing a lead test last year, pittsburgh's water and sewer authority has been required to find and replace lead service lines, the pipes that take water into houses. now, the city only has authority to replace the public side of the water line, the part from the curb away from the house.\n\nbut doing that and leaving the private side in place can actually make the problem worse. bob weimar is interim executive director of the pittsburgh water and sewer authority.\n\nbob weimar: we had some particularly high results well over a hundred parts per billion.\n\nfrazier: that's six times the epa threshold for lead in drinking water. turns out there's a coating inside the pipes that keeps lead from leaching into the water.\n\nweimar: and what we found is that the lining we're putting in and has been in place now for a couple of decades is subject to being broken up as a result of just physical jostling.\n\nfrazier: in some places, when a work crew has removed a public side of the line, loose chunks of that private lead pipe right next to it have broken free. the long-term solution is to replace the entire line. the city is pushing a state bill to allow it to do just that.\n\nthat would cost upwards of $400 million and take a decade or more to complete. for now, that work crew on the north side is just identifying problem lines to fix later, says water authority engineer manda metzger.\n\nmanda metzger: we just backfill it and leave it until we either coordinate with the homeowner if they prefer to change their line. otherwise, we can't do a partial replacement.\n\nfrazier: though lead levels have been falling in pittsburgh, scientists say there's no safe amount of lead in water, especially for young children.\n\nkevin edmonson: that's a pretty rock. could you please put it back?\n\nfrazier: kevin edmonson has been watching the digging from his porch with his two young grandchildren. even with months of publicity, edmonson hadn't heard about pittsburgh's lead problems until the work crew showed up. they actually can fix the lead problem at his house since only the public side of his line is lead. in fact, edmonson's been drinking bottled water for a long time because he doesn't trust the city's water. but he does use it for cooking and bathing.\n\nedmonson: i'm excited for them to be changing it, though - you know? - to keep my family safe.\n\nfrazier: edmonson is lucky. thousands of pittsburghers will have to wait years to have their lead pipes replaced. for npr news, i'm reid frazier in pittsburgh.\n\n(soundbite of david gilmour's and then)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
ben sasse rips trump for stoking mob, calls josh hawley's objection 'really dumbass'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption kevin dietsch/pool/afp via getty images kevin dietsch/pool/afp via getty images\n\nrepublican sen. ben sasse of nebraska was in the u.s. capitol on wednesday when rioters attacked. as congress was preparing to reconvene, sasse issued remarks saying that lies have consequences and that the attack on the capitol was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the president's addiction to constantly stoking division. and then sasse voted to affirm the election results.\n\ni think it's obvious that the president's conduct wasn't merely reckless and destructive. it was a flagrant dereliction of his duty to uphold and defend the constitution, sasse said in an interview friday with npr's morning edition.\n\nsasse also criticized sen. josh hawley of missouri, who was the first senate republican to announce publicly that he would vote to object to the electoral college results. sen. hawley was doing something that was really dumbass that helped incite the crowd that mobbed the capitol, sasse said.\n\nbelow are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity.\n\ninterview highlights\n\nwhat did this week's events say about the state of democracy?\n\nwell, we're not very healthy right now, but i want us to be sure we focus on the fact that we're going to get healthy again. but obviously, americans are angry right now and our country is mourning. ... the loss of life is gut-wrenching. but on wednesday, the people's capitol, which is the greatest symbol of freedom and liberty and representative self-government anywhere in the world ... was ransacked by a mob that was incited by the president of the united states.\n\nsen. josh hawley of missouri. he was the first senator to say that he would join the objections to the election results. he raised his fist to the mob before they stormed the building. he continued his objections afterward and said he was just raising some concerns about ballot security. is there any doubt, though, that your colleague knew what he was inciting?\n\nwell, let's begin by laying the blame first and foremost on those who actually committed the acts of violence at the capitol and then on the president of the united states as well, because he was the one pouring gasoline on these fires of division.\n\nbut a big part of the problem with our polarized politics at this moment is that there's a massive demand for it. this isn't just a supply problem. we have a big chunk of voters. they're not a majority, but they're really loud and they're growing. there is a large group that is hopped up on on rage-clicks and they're demanding nonsense stunts like the objection to the electoral college vote.\n\nso sen. hawley was doing something that was really dumbass. and i have been clear about that in public and in private since long before he announced that he was going to do this. this was a stunt. it was a terrible, terrible idea. and you don't lie to the american people. and that's what's been going on. the american people have been lied to chiefly by donald trump. and lies have consequences. and those consequences are now found in five dead americans in a capitol building that's in shambles. and there's a lot of work that has to be done to rebuild, and legislators should not be aiding and abetting those kinds of lies.\n\ndavid humphreys, who's a missouri businessman who spent $2 million to support hawley's election in 2018, now tells the missouri independent that hawley is a political opportunist willing to subvert the constitution. and he would like the senate to censure sen. hawley, which would take a simple majority vote. would you vote for that?\n\ni have not been shy in my criticisms of josh hawley, either in public or in private. this was a terrible, terrible idea. the mechanism of how the senate handles it next is something that we'll obviously need to talk about. but the most fundamental issue for any individual senator is their conscience to their oath of office, to the constitution and their relationship with citizens of the state that they serve. so missourians are the most important people in that conversation.\n\nbut obviously, i think lots of deliberation needs to be had on the perverse incentives inside [congress] right now. the way people raise funds, the way they raise money during legislative debates is disgusting. ... we have somewhere between 4% and 14% of americans who are identifying their political tribe as their most important community. and it's not a community of love, they're anti-communities, they're communities of hate.\n\nhawley sent out a fundraising message shortly before the storming of the capitol, according to the kansas city star. should the senate be disciplining its own members for doing this sort of thing?\n\ni think we need to change rules that allow people to be fundraising while the senate is in session. you know, i'm a fan of term limits. i don't think the idea of constantly trying to get these feedback loops and make politics the center of kind of horse race rage, addiction, social media stuff, i don't think any of that is healthy. so the fundraising is gross. i want to ban cameras in committee rooms. not audio — i want the american people to have transparency. but i want to end the constant grandstanding that drives so much of our politics at present.\n\ni want to ask about the president of the united states and what happens to him now. i know there's talk of urging the 25th amendment. there is talk in the house of impeachment, which would take a while. and we had jeh johnson on this program, the former homeland security secretary, who said he thought the best option was for people around the president to urge him to leave town. what would you have the president do in the final 12 days of his term?\n\ni think that the less the president does over the next 12 days, the better. mike pence fulfilled his obligations on wednesday while blood was being shed at the people's capitol. the president was actively rage-tweeting against his vice president because the vice president was fulfilling his oath of office to the constitution to affirm the fact that joe biden won. ... we were in the senate chamber and the secret service had to rush in and grab the vice president from the dais and rush him out of the room and the president of the united states was rage tweeting against him at the same time.\n\nso, frankly, i think it's obvious that the president's conduct wasn't merely reckless and destructive. it was a flagrant dereliction of his duty to uphold and defend the constitution. and we need to know more about why the national guard wasn't deployed when calls were sent out for it.\n\ncatherine whelan edited the audio version of this story. avie schneider produced for the web.

facebook taps former obama official as vice president of civil rights\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption facebook facebook\n\nsocial media behemoth facebook announced monday it has created a new executive role at the company and that it will be filled by a veteran of the obama administration.\n\nroy austin jr. has been named vice president of civil rights with the mandate to oversee facebook's accountability on racial hatred and discrimination on its platform. he's slated to start jan. 19.\n\nnaming austin to the position comes six months after a scathing independent audit found that the company had made painful decisions [not to control content] with real world consequences that are serious setbacks for civil rights.\n\nthe auditors had several recommendations, such as calling on facebook to do more to rein in hateful speech on its platform, and stricter penalties for users who post items that violate company standards.\n\nthe auditors also advised facebook to create a position to lead the company's efforts on civil rights, even after acknowledging the company had taken several positive steps in that direction. those included barring advertisers from using tools that target housing, employment and credit ads at individuals based on gender, age or zip code.\n\ni am excited to join facebook at this moment when there is a national and global awakening happening around civil rights, austin said in a statement.\n\ntechnology plays a role in nearly every part of our lives, and it's important that it be used to overcome the historic discrimination and hate which so many underrepresented groups have faced, rather than to exacerbate it, he added.\n\nfacebook said austin will be based out of washington, d.c.\n\nhe comes from the law firm harris, wiltshire & grannis llp, where he was a partner focusing on criminal defense and civil rights law. earlier in his career, austin held several positions within the u.s. justice department, including senior assistant u.s. attorney in the civil rights unit of the washington, d.c., u.s attorney's office, and deputy assistant attorney general in the justice department's civil rights division from 2010 to 2014.\n\nafter that austin worked on the white house domestic policy council in the obama administration. he also worked on president obama's task force on 21st century policing and was a member of obama's my brother's keeper task force.\n\nlaura murphy, a former american civil liberties union executive, who was hired by facebook to lead a two-year investigation into the company's polices, applauded austin's hire.\n\nthe appointment of a civil rights vice president is an historic, positive and timely milestone in the evolution of facebook, murphy said in a statement.\n\nroy austin is a great choice for this role; i worked with him extensively during his tenure at the white house. i urge facebook to give him the latitude and resources to tackle the audit recommendations and any other civil rights issues that arise, she added.\n\njust how much latitude austin ultimately gets remains to be seen.\n\nmark zuckerberg, the company's co-founder, ceo and controlling shareholder, has the final say in any decision made at facebook.\n\npressure has been building for facebook to implement changes to its platform following the killing of george floyd by minneapolis police on memorial day.\n\nthe audit was released in the immediate weeks following floyd's killing, just as national protests calling for a reckoning on race, police brutality and social injustice were gaining momentum.\n\nas npr's shannon bond reported in july, the audit of facebook came at the same time hundreds of companies pledged to pull advertising from the platform to protest its lax approach to policing harmful posts.\n\nbond also reported at the time that advocacy groups, including color of change, the naacp and the anti-defamation league held a conference call with facebook executives to press for change, but hung up disappointed with the social media network's response.\n\nthey showed up to the meeting expecting an 'a' for attendance, rashad robinson, president of color of change told npr at the time.\n\neditor's note: facebook is among npr's financial supporters.\n\nnpr's shannon bond contributed to this report.

saudi arabian businesses struggle with rule to replace foreign workers with locals\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption fayez nureldine /afp/getty images fayez nureldine /afp/getty images\n\nthe mobile market center is a popular place in riyadh for anyone who needs computer accessories or help with a cellphone. the two-story mall, next to a busy thoroughfare in the saudi capital city, has shops selling all kinds of electronics.\n\nit's also where the frustrations and challenges of saudi arabia's economic overhaul are being played out.\n\nthe owner of one small cellphone accessory shop on the ground floor sits at a desk, enjoying a cup of cardamom-laced saudi coffee and some dates. the owner, who goes by the name abu saud, has three shops in this mall. he says he was a happy man, and business was good, until the saudi government told him to replace his foreign workers. for years he hired mostly south asians who are skilled at fixing cellphones.\n\nbut under new economic reforms, telecommunications shops are required to hire only saudi workers.\n\nthe changes are part of a sweeping plan to wean the kingdom off its dependency on oil revenues and put hundreds of thousands of unemployed saudis to work in the private sector. but while some economists welcome the reforms, business owners interviewed by npr during a recent visit to saudi arabia say the changes are challenging to implement.\n\nfor one, abu saud says the new saudi hires don't last long in his shops.\n\nmiddle east saudi prince may have trouble finding u.s. investors after anti-corruption

says. he gets the impression saudis would rather be working in a government office. each one he like to have a table, he's a boss. even if just to graduate he just want to be a boss, direct, he says.\n\nabu saud has to bring in his two sons — both are doctors — to help run his shops. if he wants to use a foreign worker, he has to pay a fee to the government — anywhere from $80 to $107 per month for each foreign employee. those fees are due to increase over the next two years as part of the reforms.\n\nsoon many other types of retail outlets will also be required to only hire saudi workers. it's causing a lot of problems for businesses, says a saudi accountant. npr is not using his name so he can speak without fear of recrimination.\n\nduring last year we have seen a lot of small and medium entities going out of business because they cannot afford it, the accountant says. he agrees saudi arabia needs to reform its economy but says the changes should be made more slowly and carefully.\n\nin my office every day i get new regulations either from the ministry of commerce or the minister of finance or the tax department. everyone is changing their own regulations and the bylaws, he says.\n\nthe uncertainty over regulations and bylaws is affecting the foreign investment the government is trying to attract. think about the foreign investor who is staying outside and risking his investment, or taking the risk to invest in a new country, says the accountant, who deals with international clients.\n\nsaudi arabia finished 2017 with 12.8 percent unemployment, according to the official statistics office. many of its job seekers are young adults, who make up the majority of the country's population.\n\nduring his reign until his death in 2015, saudi king abdullah recognized the potential for economic problems and introduced some reforms. but in 2016, the now crown prince mohammed bin salman launched vision 2030, a comprehensive plan to diversify the economy and create more private sector jobs for saudis.\n\nthis is very welcoming because the old saudi arabia to be honest ... the system was not viable ... the country was going to collapse, says john sfakianakis, director of economic research at the gulf research center, in riyadh.\n\nsfakianakis says crown prince mohammed is making bold changes in the kingdom.\n\ntoday you have a very young crown prince who is ambitious who needs to push the envelope ... because demand is changing for oil, technology is changing, he says.\n\nsaudi arabia needs to be part of that change, he adds, as the country has little time to waste.\n\nthe country is the world's biggest oil exporter, but a slump in oil prices since 2014 and a rapidly growing population have stretched the kingdom's budget.\n\nnadir mohammed, a world bank official for the middle east and north africa, urges patience as saudi arabia's government tries to reduce its dependency on crude oil.\n\nif 90 percent of your gdp, 80 percent of your exports, 60 percent of your fiscal revenues is from one source, it's going to take you a decade or more to make significant transformation, he says.\n\nfor decades, oil helped the saudi royal family keep a compact with the population: saudis would be taken care of — free health care and education through college, cheap utilities and gasoline, often a government job, and, until recently, no taxes. in return, they did not challenge the royal family's absolute rule.\n\nthe crown prince now wants to change that deal, says bernard haykel, a saudi arabia specialist at princeton university.\n\nhe's saying that you know we are no longer able to afford this nanny state ... and so the terms of the social contract have to be renegotiated, haykel says.\n\nthe crown prince is sweetening the deal with the population by loosening the ban on cinemas and concerts and allowing women to drive and go to work. now you see saudi women working in malls and at hotel receptions — unheard of until a few months ago.\n\nthe crown prince is also pushing some megaprojects, including spending $500 billion to build a futuristic city called neom.\n\nto help pay for such projects, the government is planning to sell a 5 percent stake in saudi aramco, the giant oil company. it is being touted as one of the world's biggest initial public offerings. mohammed al-tuwaijri, the minister of economy and planning, says that sale will provide a huge injection of cash to the kingdom.\n\naramco is a first-class, world-class company, great proven track record, he says. it's going to be a very attractive proposition for local and global investors.\n\nthe crown prince is also involved in drumming up foreign investment. he was on weeks-long tours to the u.s., the u.k. and france promoting saudi arabia as a good place to do business.\n\nin november, he rounded up about 200 of saudi arabia's wealthiest people — including government ministers, businessmen and senior members of the royal family — and detained them in the ritz-carlton hotel in riyadh, in what he said was an anti-corruption cleanup. most were held for three months, until they agreed to pay large settlements totaling more than $100 billion, according to the saudi attorney general.\n\nthere were cries that it was an unlawful crackdown on possible rivals and that it could scare off investors. but saudi economist motasher almurshed says the move was hugely popular with ordinary saudis.\n\nthis move is done for the benefit of the saudi population, for the saudi economy, and for making the vision possible, he says.
there will be books: james comey sequel signals new wave of memoirs in post-trump era\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption flatiron books flatiron books\n\nthe collapse of president trump's administration in its final fortnight will surely downgrade his already damaged standing in history. it may also make all previously published books about his one-term presidency seem truncated.\n\nthe horror of seeing extreme trump backers barging past u.s. capitol police, driving out the congress and disrupting completion of the 2020 election will darken what we remember of the trump years in toto. more than a few manuscripts may come back to authors for additions and revisions.\n\nthere isn't time for that to include james comey's latest work, saving justice: truth, transparency and trust. but comey has had his assessment of trump locked and loaded for some while. as the title suggests, this is a sequel to comey's a higher loyalty: truth, lies and leadership, which appeared in april 2018 and swiftly became a best seller. it could be called the first really consequential critique in the initial barrage of books about president trump in office.\n\nat the time, comey was not just looking back, he was elucidating history in the making. his first subtitle recalled his testimony to a senate committee right after he lost his job as director of the fbi. trump had said he wanted and needed loyalty. comey had offered loyalty to the truth — and shortly thereafter he was fired.\n\nwhile within his rights, trump shocked the legal and political worlds by booting an fbi director who was midway through his 10-year term and whose agency was still investigating russian interference in the 2016 election. it was shocking enough that the justice department named an independent counsel, robert mueller, whose lengthy probe and eventual report haunted trump's first two years in office. it set up trump's loss of the house in the 2018 midterms and the eventual departure of trump's first attorney general, jeff sessions.\n\ntoggle caption paul marotta/getty images\n\nbut thousands also bought a higher loyalty wondering how much comey could tell about another fbi probe, this one into democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton's use of a private email server for official business while secretary of state. questions of what she might have been hiding dogged her campaign throughout 2016, even after comey recommended against prosecution (for her incredibly careless behavior). comey's decision to reopen that probe just weeks before the election, albeit briefly, may have contributed to her narrow loss to trump.\n\nin other words, comey the first-time author, renowned for his height (6 feet, 8 inches) and high-mindedness, stood at the nexus of two issues that may have determined the fates of trump, clinton and the nation in the 2016 election. no wonder everyone wanted to know what he knew.\n\nthis time round, there are no similarly suspenseful questions in the air. but saving justice might still be called a continuation of the first memoir, and both might be titled defending comey. the answers he gives in both books, to detractors from both parties, are much the same. he sees his obligation, his client if you will, not the person or party who appointed him or even as the department of justice. he sees his obligation as being to justice itself. he knows how it looks, sometimes, and how hard it is to explain to others. but he has to refuse to care, or at least act as though he doesn't, while he perseveres.\n\nhe explains this in a series of illustrative anecdotes about cases he handled over his years as an assistant u.s. attorney, then as a full-fledged u.s. attorney, as the deputy attorney general to john ashcroft under president george w. bush and finally as fbi director. he cites an early case in his career where the actual currency seized in a raid had been replaced with an equal cash value in different denominations. he brings this to the attention of judge and jury knowing it may cost him a conviction.\n\nhe also details time spent prosecuting gun crimes in richmond, va., sending his people out door to door to explain to african americans why the federal government is concentrating on their community. we earned their trust with truth and transparency, comey writes.\n\nthere is also a human story here. we see him court his wife, patrice, and we see them struggle to set up a home while moving often and having five children. comey shares quite a bit, including how he made an offer on a suburban home outside new york city without noticing one bathroom had no toilet. we learn that he had to make an oral argument to the u.s. supreme court in borrowed trousers that were 4 inches too short.\n\nsome of this serves the eliot ness image of the g-man with the g-rated lifestyle. but comey is prepared to be regarded as many things, including sanctimonious and self-important. he sees it as part of the obligation he bears if he is going to take down members of the gambino crime family in new york or some of the political heavyweights in washington.\n\nthe first and last sections of his latest book lay out his case against the trump administration, particularly against trump's second attorney general, william barr, whom he blames for subordinating the values of the justice department.\n\nmore specifically, he upbraids barr for suppressing the anti-trump essence of mueller's report: in light of the attorney general's statements, the report itself would come as a shock to fair-minded people who actually read it.\n\nbut neither does he spare mueller, a former fbi director whom he served and who produced a report of 448 pages and 2,375 footnotes but failed to provide a salient summary in terms people could understand.\n\nhe quotes winston churchill, who said in another context: this report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read.\n\nbut here, as in the first book, comey's central issue is trump, whom he views as the antithesis of his own focus on truth, transparency and trust.\n\nfrom the beginning, barr echoed the president, aping his dishonest characterizations of the department's work and appearing to respond to president trump's self-interested demands for investigations and prosecutions, comey writes.\n\none person whom comey does not spend much time on is the first u.s. attorney he worked for in new york, rudy giuliani. he refers to giuliani's harshness as a boss and powerful ambition for higher office, but leaves him comfortably in the past, sparing him any part in the trump meltdown of recent months.\n\nit is possible that comey would write the barr passages somewhat differently today, having seen the recent turnaround by the attorney general in rejecting trump's false accusations of election fraud. it is also possible comey would rethink his negative recommendation on seeking criminal charges against trump based on the mueller report. setting those issues aside, would it make sense to charge trump for pressuring georgia state officials to find votes for him? or for inciting rioters to breach the capitol and disrupt the counting of electoral votes?\n\nthese are the risks one takes in writing history while it is unfolding.\n\ncomey's first book marked the point at which trump literature moved to a new and serious phase, leaving behind the campaign accounts, the ghost-written business bragging (the art of the deal) and the magazine exposé mongering of previous decades. trump was no longer just a tabloid subject or a tv reality show star. the man was leading, in some sense, the free world. his decisions were upending policies, precedents and principles on a daily basis.\n\nof course, there had been those who were quicker on the trigger. magazine profile artist michael wolff had managed access to the president's inner circle in the early weeks and months to produce a fast fire and fury: inside the trump white house by january 2018. it is 'reality' journalism in the same way trump is a 'reality' character, said the atlantic. wolff would produce a sequel the following year with the somewhat eerily predictive title of siege: trump under fire. while there were again many blind quotes, the second book also identified former trump strategist steve bannon as a major source.\n\nmore deliberate in his work habits and style, legendary washington post investigator bob woodward took a little longer to produce fear: trump in the white house in 2018 but gave a much fuller and more profoundly frightening picture of life around the 45th president. while primary sources were not named, they bore great resemblance to cabinet and west wing figures who left the administration relatively early.\n\nin 2020, woodward came out with rage, based largely on extensive interviews he had done with trump on tape. among other stunning revelations, we learned how much trump knew in early february about the emerging covid-19 virus. even as he dismissed it publicly as just like the flu and promised one day it will just disappear, trump knew better. trump did not bother to deny or dispute woodward's account. he apparently felt secure in the knowledge that woodward's target audience did not include much of his own, and evidence would suggest that was correct. woodward's account did not produce a notable change in the president's approval rating, nor was it identifiable as a factor in november.\n\nperhaps no book ever could be. at least not as a weapon against a candidate or officeholder such as trump. comey surely lifted the lid on that little secret well before woodward did.\n\nand other writers, some well-known but not on woodward's level, were not able to do much more in altering perceptions. journalists such as jonathan karl of abc news (front row at the trump show) and philip rucker and carol leonnig of the washington post (a very stable genius) were able to take readers inside the operations of the white house and trump team and marshal reams of evidence concerning trump's mercurial personality and haphazard governing style.\n\nthe post also turned loose its fact-checking staff, led by glenn kessler, in a lengthy compendium of falsehoods, misleading claims and flat-out lies titled donald trump and his assault on truth. it was all far in excess of the assault on any previous president in the mainstream media, and yet it did not seem to dent the president's armor. to be sure, it was pleasing to people who had not cared for the man from the beginning, but there is an underlying assumption in digging for and telling hard truths needs to make a difference.\n\nbut comey was part of separate stream, one that may matter more, at least to historians sifting back through the evidence. comey kicked off a series of tell-alls that would come to include quite a few insiders. early on there was chris christie, the former governor of new jersey who had run against trump in 2015 but jumped aboard the bandwagon as the primaries began. christie was still steaming over having his extensive transition plan consigned to the dumpster when he himself was denied a white house job. (it turns out the west wing wasn't big enough for him and trump's son-in-law, jared kushner, whose father christie had prosecuted in federal court years earlier.)\n\nanother victim of west wing internal wars was cliff sims, a young blogger from alabama brought into the campaign by bannon in 2016. sims' team of vipers appeared in early 2019 and foretold some of the infighting that would be featured in other accounts. sims, however, remained basically loyal to trump. the same could not be said for national security adviser john bolton, who blistered his former boss in the room where it happened. and the deepest cuts of all might have been those by michael cohen, formerly trump's personal lawyer and fixer, whose disloyal appeared in september 2020.\n\nthe temptation to get one's side of the story told can be hard to resist. thus we had an early autobiographical entry from nikki haley, who lasted less than two years as ambassador to the united nations. with all due respect: defending america with grit and grace is largely a defense of trump but a critique of his chief of staff and national security adviser. in any event, it has been taken as an early campaign document for haley's expected presidential bid in 2024.\n\nbut this is but the briefest of thumbnail sketches of the trump lit to date. carlos lozada, the estimable book editor for the washington post, in october published what were we thinking, the result of reading some 150 trump-related or trump-themed books, adding, that's just a fraction of the trump canon. and he's ready for more, listing trump aides he hopes will pitch in.\n\nwe are told that quite a few are planning to do just that. kayleigh mcenany and kellyanne conway are said to be continuing their speaking-for-the-president roles in print, as past spokespersons sarah huckabee sanders and sean spicer have already done.\n\nformer chief of staff mick mulvaney is also rumored to be publishing, and his resignation this week coupled with statements about trump not being the same man he was eight months ago suggest he may be more disaffected than when he was reassigned as special envoy to northern ireland.\n\nin any event, the next generation of trump literature, whether pro or con, will have a different tone and perspective in the wake of his reelection defeat and the astonishing lengths he has gone to in denying it — and insisting others do the same.
we're having a baby!? how to feel the joy, without the financial fears\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrea seabrook for npr andrea seabrook for npr\n\nlook into an infant's eyes, and there you'll find the stirring of a new life. look into the eyes of that infant's parent, and you may just find something else: financial terror. having a child can change everything in a family, especially the budget.\n\nyami chavarria and anthony rivas are navigating this lovely — and frightening — time together. chavarria was 39 weeks pregnant — in other words, really pregnant — and was cooing over the super-cute, hand-painted onesies her friends made at her baby shower.\n\none says my dad is the best. another would make an infant look like a tiny cow. they're all adorable — and chavarria said they all were going to get a lot of use.\n\ni can change, like, many, many times a day, she said with a laugh.\n\nso our first financial tip for new families: don't be shy about the baby shower. tell people what you need — and not just onesies and mobiles. for the more expensive things, like strollers, car seats and cribs, consider asking people to pool money. if you don't tell people what you want, you may end up with 200 newborn onesies, and none of the other things you'll desperately need.\n\nin chavarria's case, she had some great friends at church and her day care job who helped her save several thousand dollars on supplies, but clothes, diapers and strollers will be only the beginning. chavarria, in fact, was already looking way ahead — saying she wants to hopes to pay for her child's college education.\n\njoin npr's 'your money and your life' facebook group\n\nfast forward\n\nthe baby, a perfect little girl named ayla kimberley, finally arrived. it's a joyful, sweet time — and time for chavarria and rivas to get some more serious financial advice.\n\nthat's where financial adviser paivi spoon comes in. she sits down with the couple to go over the bundle of questions that come with the bundle of joy.\n\nfirst, their income: rivas, the father, just started a public works job. between that and a night job he also just took, they're making around $50,000 a year. it's not a whole lot of income, but spoon says that's not the point.\n\ni have seen people who make exactly what you do, spoon tells them, and they're very wealthy after 20, 30 years. it is not the amount of money that you make, but how much of that do you consume.\n\nhere's another financial tip for new families: if you're used to spending money and not really thinking about it, let the baby be an incentive to finally put together a budget.\n\nspoon says people basically spend money on three categories of things: necessities, like rent and food; investments, like property and savings; and consumption, like a new watch or dinner out.\n\ndon't just look at the children and their future. if you're not well off, they won't be.\n\nwe all consume, spoon says. but consumption means it's gone. you consume food, it's gone. you consume money, it's gone.\n\nthe trick is dialing down the consumption and turning up the investments. and, says spoon, education is one thing that's always an investment — both for the child and the parents. more education for the parents could mean more money for little ayla's education later.\n\nquite often different professional certifications are just as beneficial to you and your future earnings potential as is a college degree, spoon says. so don't just look at the children and their future. if you're not well off, they won't be.\n\nbudgeting, investing, studying — it's a lot for new parents to tackle. but there's more help here.\n\nand figuring all of this out is worth it, spoon says, and not just because it'll give chavarria and rivas control of their money. it'll also let them focus on what's important: their baby.\n\njoin npr's 'your money and your life' facebook group, an online community featuring stories from some of the best investors and financial experts on the planet along with crowdsourced wisdom curated and overseen by npr reporters and editors.
can seagrass save shellfish from climate change?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption lauren sommer/kqed lauren sommer/kqed\n\nthe impacts of climate change aren't a far-off possibility for the pacific shellfish industry. acidifying seawater is already causing problems for oyster farms along the west coast and it's only expected to get worse.\n\nthat has one bay area oyster farm looking for ways to adapt. it's teaming up scientists who are studying how the local ecosystem could lend a helping hand.\n\nwe need help, says terry sawyer of hog island oyster company. that 'canary in a coalmine' analogy drives me crazy, but that's what we are.\n\nsawyer's natural habitat is on the mudflats of tomales bay, about 50 miles north of san francisco, where his oyster operation is located. but a few years ago, he started going to climate change conferences, sitting next to scientists and policymakers.\n\ncarbon chemistry is incredibly sophisticated, complicated science, he says. i am definitely out of my element. out of my comfort zone. i'd rather be in shorts and no shoes.\n\nto him, it was a necessity. like a lot of oyster farmers, he buys baby oysters from hatcheries in oregon and washington. but starting a decade ago, the hatcheries began having mysterious die-offs.\n\nthe orders that we were getting – if we were getting them at all, they wouldn't necessarily happen at the time or the size that we could take them, he says.\n\nscientists eventually identified the main culprit: acidifying seawater.\n\nat least a quarter of the carbon humans put into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels is soaked up by the ocean. it acts like a carbon sponge, but adding carbon to seawater makes it more acidic. since the start of the industrial revolution, the oceans have become about 30 percent more acidic.\n\nit's harmful for animals that build shells, like oysters, and spells big trouble for the pacific shellfish industry, worth more than $100 million.\n\nyou don't want to curl up in a fetal position, says sawyer. you do want to say we've got to move on this and we need help.\n\nsawyer found some help by opening up his oyster farm to a team of scientists.\n\nthe water's acidity is monitored with real-time equipment, part of a network run by uc davis's bodega marine lab.\n\nthat was a significant move: knowing what's going to day-to-day, minute-by-minute, he says. and it's also been proving the point. we have numbers you can't argue with.\n\nhog island is also opening its own oyster hatchery in humboldt bay to improve the reliability of the supply chain.\n\nthe oyster farm is also assisting with cutting-edge scientific research, focused on how oysters could get a boost from native plants in tomales bay.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption lauren sommer/kqed lauren sommer/kqed\n\non a sunny morning, a team of scientists is scuba-diving in a shallow part of the bay, surrounded by thick, green seagrass, waving in the current.\n\nwhen you're down in it, it really feels like you're in a forest of seagrass, says kristy kroeker, professor of marine biology at uc santa cruz. it's quite long.\n\nthis seagrass is a glimmer of hope for oyster farmers. plants, whether it's a forest or lawn, take up carbon dioxide and use it for photosynthesis.\n\nthe plants under the water are doing the exact same thing, kroeker says.\n\nthe seagrass pulls the carbon out of the water, which makes it slightly less acidic.\n\nessentially, they're creating this little bubble of seawater around them that's more friendly for animals that might be threatened by ocean acidification, she says.\n\nkroeker is trying to find out if the seagrasses could act as a buffer, protecting the oysters nearby.\n\nshe plants mesh bags of baby oysters in the seagrass bed, which she'll be watching in the months to come. so far, the results look promising, but not necessarily the whole answer.\n\nseagrass can reduce acidification around it, but potentially only in certain locations or at certain times of year. more research will be needed, kroeker says, but against a global problem, local approaches have a lot of potential.\n\ncan we use parts of nature that we already know are important – seagrasses – to actually benefit people and protect them from some of these impacts? she says.\n\nthe approach is being studied around the world in different ecosystems, including near coral reefs, and using bigger marine plants, like kelp.\n\neventually, it'll be up to oyster farmers like terry sawyer to make the research work on the ground – or, in the water.\n\nfrom an aquaculture point of view, you bet i'm hopeful, sawyer says. maybe i'm being idealistic here. but we're learning so much. we're just at the tip of the iceberg on that.

hong kong police arrest activists\n\nin hong kong, dozens of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists were arrested — the biggest roundup under the new national security law since its introduction last summer.\n\nailsa chang, host:\n\nmore than 50 people were arrested in hong kong in morning raids yesterday. it is the biggest roundup of pro-democracy activists and politicians since a new national security law was introduced last summer. npr china correspondent john ruwitch looks at what's behind this latest move.\n\njohn ruwitch, byline: after the chinese government sent the army into tiananmen square in 1989, killing possibly thousands of pro-democracy protesters, it paid a price. there was outcry from the international community and economic and political sanctions for years. but it learned from the experience, and now it's applying those lessons in hong kong.\n\njeffrey wasserstrom: what's been happening in hong kong is everything that happened, repression-wise, in 1989 except the massacre.\n\nruwitch: jeffrey wasserstrom is a historian at the university of california, irvine.\n\nwasserstrom: these moves in hong kong have been an attempt, i think, by beijing to have that same kind of deterrent effect without having the equivalent to the tank man photograph.\n\nruwitch: and that has had one big consequence, he says - less global alarm. when beijing imposed the national security law on hong kong, critics feared it would be used to silence dissent. and these arrests seem to confirm those fears. but ho-fung hung of johns hopkins university says china feels like now might be the time to take a chance.\n\nho-fung hung: what they fear most is this u.s. pushback for sanctions and things like that that now that u.s. is in the transition mode. so it is a kind of a time that they think that they can do whatever they want.\n\nruwitch: the arrests come just days after beijing reached an investment deal with europe that was years in the making and shine a light on the leadership's thinking.\n\nhung: china's calculation is that european is desperate to have this deal.\n\nruwitch: desperate because china offers a huge market. and while other economies are struggling because of the pandemic, china's is humming. the china-eu agreement isn't ratified, and yesterday's arrests may put it at risk. a trade agreement with pacific nations inked a few weeks ago may also be in play, but chinese leader xi jinping seems to think otherwise and not without reason, says wasserstrom.\n\nwasserstrom: the chinese communist party has made a whole series of moves during the last year or even the last years, and there haven't been dramatic consequences, really.\n\nruwitch: trump's sanctioned some chinese companies and officials and moved to revoke hong kong's special trade status. and some european countries have spoken out against beijing's tightening grip on the former british colony. donald clarke of george washington university law says pushback on these arrests might not change china's course but could help.\n\ndonald clarke: a robust response could lead to, you know, a decision by the hong kong and prc authorities to impose, you know, less harsh sentences than they were planning or indeed to acquit some.\n\nruwitch: but to really get xi's attention, some experts say, it would take something like coordinated sanctions on top chinese officials and possibly even on xi himself or a boycott of the 2022 winter olympics, which china is hosting. steve tsang of the university of london says even if that doesn't happen, beijing still pays a price for its actions in hong kong.\n\nsteve tsang: if we are looking at the overall interests of china as a whole, i think the policy is backfiring because a vibrant, prosperous, successful hong kong is in the best interest of china, not only of hong kong.\n\nruwitch: but he says backfiring isn't an issue if your main concern is the communist party's power and xi jinping's grip on it.\n\njohn ruwitch, npr news.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
democrats unveil changes to house rules on debt ceiling, ethics\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption j. scott applewhite/ap j. scott applewhite/ap\n\ntop democrats announced late sunday a series of changes to house rules that could eliminate causes of major instability during the previous eight years of republican rule in congress.\n\nwe are proposing historic changes that will modernize congress, restore regular order and bring integrity back to this institution, said incoming house rules chairman james mcgovern, d-mass., in a statement explaining the changes.\n\nwhen a new congress convenes every two years, the majority party must approve a resolution outlining house rules, the intricate parliamentary procedures that govern the chamber. two notable changes in the democrats' package are aimed at avoiding certain confrontations that became commonplace during the republican majority from 2011 through 2019, after the rout of the party in the 2018 midterms.\n\ndemocrats will revive the gephardt rule, introduced in the late 1970s by rep. dick gephardt, d-mo., that automatically raises the debt ceiling — the nation's borrowing limit — once the house passes a budget.\n\nhouse republicans preferred to force votes to approve debt ceiling increases in an effort to bring more accountability and political pressure to reduce the nation's deficit and debt. however, that decision never resulted in reducing spending and only added to a culture of brinksmanship in recent years that often threatened the u.s. into default on its debts and increased economic uncertainty around the globe.\n\nthe rules change — coupled with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's long-standing promise that the u.s. will not default on its debts — greatly diminishes the odds of a default threat in the new, divided congress.\n\nadditionally, democrats are changing the rules regarding motions to vacate the chair, a procedural tool that could be used to force out a sitting house speaker. it is the procedural weapon that conservatives led by rep. mark meadows, r-n.c., were planning to use to try to oust speaker john boehner, r-ohio, in 2015 before he made the decision to step down.\n\ndemocrats plan to tweak the rules so that a motion to vacate can only be offered on the house floor if a majority of either the house republican conference or the house democratic caucus agrees to do so. the change limits the ability of any one member to wreak havoc on the floor and ultimately bolsters incoming house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., against potential agitators in either party.\n\nother notable house rules changes:\n\n1. creating a committee to address climate change. the panel will not have subpoena power or the ability to introduce legislation so it will not be as powerful as a similar committee created by pelosi during the previous democratic majority from 2007 to 2011, but the issue is expected to be a major priority for the party's progressive wing.\n\n2. creating a bipartisan select committee tasked with coming up with proposals to modernize and improve the way congress operates.\n\n3. setting new ethics rules that prohibit lawmakers and aides from sitting on corporate boards and a new requirement for annual ethics training for all lawmakers.\n\n4. reviving a rule that requires 72 hours before major legislation can get a vote in the house to ensure all lawmakers have time to review the bill.\n\n5. amending rules to extend bans on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity and to allow religious headwear to be worn in the house chamber — an accommodation for rep.-elect ilhan omar, d-minn., a muslim woman who wears a headscarf.

trump spoke in florida earlier this month, he issued a stern warning about venezuela: members of the armed forces who continue to support president nicolás maduro will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out, he said. you will lose everything.\n\ntrump said the administration wants a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open — suggesting the possibility of military involvement.\n\nvice president pence visited colombia monday and announced new economic sanctions against venezuelan politicians aligned with maduro.\n\nthat followed a weekend of violent clashes when venezuelan security forces blocked most of the humanitarian aid that u.s.-backed opposition activists tried to bring into venezuela. four people were reported killed and hundreds injured.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption yuri cortez/afp/getty images yuri cortez/afp/getty images\n\nwhile many venezuelans disapprove of maduro and have called for international assistance, many in latin america are wary of america's moves. even for some of maduro's enemies, washington's efforts to oust the venezuelan leader raise concern because of the history of u.s. intervention in the region.\n\nit is a long history that starts in mexico, says enrique krauze, a noted mexican historian. the mexican-american war, the brutal two-year conflict in the mid-19th century, ended with mexico losing — or as krauze says, being robbed of — half its territory.\n\nit would be hard to name a country where the united states didn't have an intervention, he emphasizes.\n\nover 40 regime changes in a century\n\nthe united states participated, directly or indirectly, in latin american regime change more than 40 times in the last century, according to historian john coatsworth. that figure doesn't include a number of failed missions like the 1961 bay of pigs assault in cuba.\n\nsome of the more stinging u.s. moves included the ouster of democratically elected governments in guatemala in 1954, in brazil a decade later and in chile in 1973. chilean president salvador allende was deposed in a violent coup by cia-backed opponents, and the u.s. government long supported his replacement, the dictator gen. augusto pinochet.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption martin thomas/afp/getty images martin thomas/afp/getty images\n\nin addition to covert support for insurgencies, the u.s. has invaded its southern neighbors numerous times. for instance, the u.s. launched invasions of the dominican republic (1916), grenada (1983) and panama (1989).\n\nthe motives were varied and are often still debated. writing in harvard university's revista magazine, coatsworth says, two factors seem to have been crucial in tipping decision makers toward intervention: domestic politics and global strategy. much of the interference occurred while america was competing against the soviet union for influence around the world, even as u.s. leaders sought to shore up political support at home.\n\none bloody chapter that recently re-entered debate is the u.s. government's roles in central america's civil wars in the 1980s, including support for death squads in el salvador and contra guerrillas in nicaragua.\n\nthe trump administration's special envoy for venezuela, elliott abrams, was convicted of withholding information about the iran-contra scandal from congress but later received a pardon from president george h.w. bush. this month, congress members grilled abrams and questioned whether he would speak truthfully.\n\npolitics controversial past comes back to haunt elliott abrams at house hearing controversial past comes back to haunt elliott abrams at house hearing listen · 3:29 3:29\n\nin 2002, the u.s. government allegedly had prior knowledge of an abortive coup against venezuela's then president, hugo chávez, although president george w. bush's administration denied any involvement. abrams was a senior white house official at that time as well.\n\ntricky balancing act\n\nnow, historian krauze says, the world wants to stop the humanitarian crisis he calls the slow genocide of the venezuelan people.\n\nvenezuela was once considered the richest country in latin america, and it holds the world's largest oil reserves. many world leaders, analysts and rights groups blame maduro for enabling the country's spiraling problems such as hyperinflation, crime, hunger and shortages of medicine and basic goods.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption yuri cortez/afp/getty images yuri cortez/afp/getty images\n\nthe u.s. and more than 50 other countries' governments have issued statements recognizing congressional leader juan guaidó as venezuela's rightful president, according to prodavinci, an independent website for venezuela analysis. the maduro administration said earlier this month it had enlisted about as many countries, including china and russia, in its support. most latin american governments now back guaidó. mexico's president says the country is neutral and is calling for dialogue.\n\nwith a combination of sanctions, diplomatic pressure and heightened warnings, the united states is playing a difficult balancing act. it cannot be seen as leading the charge in venezuela, says john feeley, who resigned as u.s. ambassador to panama last year, later citing differences with trump.\n\nprecisely the history of u.s. intervention in latin america is such that it always seems to engender a worse backlash than the original issue that mattered to american interests, he says.\n\nmexico's former foreign minister, jorge castañeda, warns that the united states should not take too large a role in maduro's ouster. while bolivia, cuba, el salvador and nicaragua continue to back the embattled leader, castañeda fears that a larger u.s. leadership role would rally more of latin america's left to maduro's defense.\n\nit's not so much that it should be leading from behind; it shouldn't be leading period. it should be doing what it is doing, not less, but not more, castañeda says.\n\nyet, with speeches like the one in miami, trump was working to americanize the crisis, according to greg weeks, a university of north carolina professor who edits the journal the latin americanist.\n\nthe more you americanize the situation, the worse the eventual result for the average venezuelan, he wrote on his blog on tuesday. it badly undermines whatever government comes next and increases the chances of armed insurrection.\n\nwith trump campaigning for re-election, weeks assessed from the speech that u.s. domestic politics are a strong force behind the president's push to oust maduro.\n\nformer ambassador feeley says he hopes trump takes a diplomatic path. the repercussions of a u.s. intervention in venezuela would undermine recent progress made in the region, he says.\n\ni think that the last 25 years of u.s. latin american diplomacy have actually gone a long way, he says, via trade agreements, people-to-people diplomacy to pushing back against that legacy.
trump names wall street and real estate titans as economic advisers\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption photographers, top row, from left: mario tama, daniel zuchnik, alex wong; bottom row, from left: andrew h. walker, brendan smialowski, robin marchant/getty images photographers, top row, from left: mario tama, daniel zuchnik, alex wong; bottom row, from left: andrew h. walker, brendan smialowski, robin marchant/getty images\n\ndonald trump has released the names of his economic advisers, a list heavy with wall street and real estate industry figures, but short of actual economists.\n\nthe names include several people from the world of hedge fund and private equity firms, including steven feinberg, chief executive and co-founder of cerberus capital management; thomas j. barrack, founder and executive chairman of colony capital inc.; and john paulson, president of a hedge fund company bearing his name.\n\none major oil industry executive is on the list: harold hamm, ceo of continental resources, who made a fortune in bakken shale formation and is said by forbes to be worth almost $13 billion.\n\namong the real estate industry executives trump named are howard m. lorber, president and ceo of vector group, and steven roth, chief executive of vornado realty trust.\n\nthe trump campaign said in a statement that the team is comprised of the top economists in the country as well as the most successful industry leaders in finance, real estate and technology.\n\ni am pleased that we have such a formidable group of experienced and talented individuals that will work with me to implement real solutions for the economic issues facing our country, trump said in a statement. he added:\n\nfor too long we have watched as president obama and hillary clinton have ruined our economy and decimated the middle class. i am going to be the greatest jobs president our country has ever seen. we will do more for the hardworking people of our country and make america great again.\n\nhe has an economic speech planned for monday. he has not released detailed economic policy positions, but has proposed very large business and personal tax cuts and infrastructure spending. he has also made u.s. trade policy a central part of his campaign, saying he wants to renegotiate trade agreements and bring back manufacturing jobs to the u.s.\n\ndespite that, there is only one figure from the manufacturing world on the list: dan dimicco, the longtime ceo of nucor corp., the largest u.s. steel producer.\n\nsome of those trump named are people he already has strong ties to, especially steven mnuchin, chief executive of dune capital management, who serves as finance chairman of trump's campaign.\n\namong the only economists in trump's inner circle are peter navarro, professor of economics and public policy at the university of california at irvine, who has written about u.s.-china trade policy; and david malpass, founder of the consulting firm encima global and a veteran of the reagan and second bush administrations.\n\nasked on cnbc friday about whether trump has the judgment to be president, malpass said, i think his judgment is great that the economy is supposed to do better, that the country can do a lot better than we're doing, and what we really need is a lot of change in washington.\n\namong the best-known figures on the list is stephen moore, founder of the conservative club for growth, and a frequent tv, radio and newspaper commentator.
epic climate cartoon goes viral, but it has one key problem\n\nfrom anthrax outbreaks in thawing permafrost to rice farms flooded with salty water, climate change seems to play a bigger and bigger role in global health each year.\n\nbut sometimes it can be hard to grasp what all the numbers and stats mean. for instance, when scientists say earth's average surface temperature has gone up about 1 degree celsius over the past 150 years or so, what does that really mean? besides, hasn't earth's temperature always fluctuated?\n\nnow a cartoon from randall munroe, a former roboticist at nasa and founder of the website xkcd, helps put the numbers into perspective.\n\nbefore scrolling through it, check out those axes.\n\nalong the x-axis is temperature change. and each vertical block of color is 1 degree celsius or 1.8 degrees fahrenheit.\n\non the y-axis, we've got time. the whole cartoon, which starts at the end of the last ice age, represents about 22,000 years. people have been around for about 200,000 years. the dinosaurs were around about 65 million years ago. and earth is 4.5 billion years old. so the graph is only a teeny-tiny period of earth's lifetime.\n\nxkcd\n\nthe cartoon is fantastic! says curt stager, a paleoecologist at paul smith's college.\n\nreally seeing the temperature changes over the long time scale helps you grasp, on a gut level, what we're doing to the earth, he adds.\n\nbut there's one problem with the graphic that makes it a bit misleading.\n\nas you scroll up and down the graphic, it looks like the temperature of earth's surface has stayed remarkably stable for 10,000 years. it sort of hovers around the same temperature for some 10,000 years ... until — bam! the industrial revolution begins. we start producing large amounts of carbon dioxide. and things heat up way more quickly.\n\nnow look a bit closer at the bottom of the graphic. see how all of a sudden, around 150 years ago, the dotted line depicting average earth temperature changes to a solid line. munroe makes this change because the data used to create the lines come from two very different sources.\n\nthe solid line comes from real data — from scientists actually measuring the average temperature of earth's surface. these measurements allow us to see temperature fluctuations that occur over a very short timescale — say, a few decades or so.\n\nbut the dotted line comes from computer models — from scientists reconstructing earth's surface temperature. this gives us very, very coarse information. it averages earth's temperature over hundreds of years. so we can see temperature fluctuations that occur only over longer periods of time, like a thousand years or so. any upticks, spikes or dips that occur in shorter time frames get smoothed out.\n\nso in a way the graphic is really comparing apples and oranges: measurements of the recent past versus reconstructions of more ancient times.\n\nin fact, if you take the modeling method used to create the dotted line and extend it all the way out to the present, the recent spike in earth's temperature would be partly smoothed. kevin anchukaitis, a paleoclimatogist at the university of arizona, ran that exact experiment tuesday and showed his results on twitter.\n\nit isn't possible to confidently compare annual observations v. millennial-scale reconstructions, he writes, without accounting for these differences in the data's resolution.\n\nstill, at the end of the day, the conclusion about climate change is the same, anchukaitis says: we are taking the planet into a fundamentally different state.\n\nandrea dutton, a geochemist at the university of florida, agrees.\n\none to 2 degrees celsius sounds really small when you hear scientists talk about it, she says. but it's a big deal when it comes to the climate of the earth. and it means really enormous changes for coastlines around the world.\n\nthis graphic, she says, helps us make the connection between the numbers and their impact on life, even if the cartoon itself isn't perfect.
rep. steny hoyer on border security\n\nnpr's lulu garcia-navarro asks rep. steny hoyer, democrat of maryland, about his recent trip to the u.s.-mexico border and about the status of border security funding negotiations on capitol hill.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nthe deadline for select members of the house and senate to reach a deal on border security funding is friday. if they settle on a compromise that can pass both chambers and get signed by the president, we'll avoid another shutdown.\n\nso let's begin this hour of the program talking border security with steny hoyer. he's the house majority leader, the most powerful democrat behind the speaker. he spent the weekend at the border in texas and new mexico. good morning, and welcome to weekend edition.\n\nsteny hoyer: thank you very much, glad to be with you.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so i understand you're at the airport this morning, finishing up this border trip.\n\nhoyer: correct.\n\ngarcia-navarro: will there be a compromise, and will it bring some new stretches of physical barrier at the border?\n\nhoyer: well, i'm optimistic that there will be a compromise based upon my conversations with a number of the conferees on thursday. it obviously has not been reported out. i don't know the specifics. i would believe it's going to be a compromise because that's what conference committees are. so i would believe there's going to be some barrier treatment in the bill. i hope...\n\ngarcia-navarro: the number 2 billion has been floated for border fencing. you would support that?\n\nhoyer: i have not heard - i've heard that number. and i want to see what the rest of the bill looks like. and i'm sure i'm like every other member. but i would think that that's - when you talk about between 1.6 and 5.7, that's not a surprising compromise. but in any event, we want to see it used smartly.\n\nand the trip that i've just concluded, in concert with four other members of congress and two - including two of whom represent the texas border in el paso, veronica escobar, and the new mexican border, xochitl torres small, those two congresswoman were with us, as was deb - debra haaland, who also represents new mexico but a northern district, and mary gay scanlon, like me, represents an east coast district. she's from outside philadelphia.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so you've been...\n\nhoyer: and what i think we...\n\ngarcia-navarro: so you've been at the border. and i want to bring this up because i was also in texas at the border this past week. and you say that you would support some border fencing. and i spoke to people and organizations there. and here's one border resident, nayda alvarez.\n\nnayda alvarez: they're going into our properties to build this wall. luckily, we're in the 2019 appropriations. so whatever it is that they vote on next week, on the 15, that's when we'll find out what's going to happen to us. so we're hoping it doesn't go through or that they don't give any money towards the - any more barriers or walls.\n\ngarcia-navarro: so people are already getting letters from the federal government using the power of eminent domain to seize private property in order to build a wall. what can you tell them?\n\nhoyer: well, i think that that is going to depend upon what the language in the bill is as to how the money can be used. again, i haven't seen it. i don't know that there's going to be 2 billion. i don't know that there's going to be barriers in there. i presumed because a conference is a compromise, and the president and the senate members of the conference committee wanted some barrier.\n\nwe think that that's not really necessary, as you know. what we think is necessary is dealing with personnel, technology, infrastructure. and in addition to that, lucille roybal-allard from california has suggested - and i strongly support it - monies available to the triangle countries where the...\n\ngarcia-navarro: honduras, guatemala...\n\nhoyer: yes, el salvador, guatemala...\n\ngarcia-navarro: right.\n\nhoyer: ...and honduras, where so many of the refugees are now coming. there's a real change. five years ago, it was single men coming in, a lot sneaking in. now what we're seeing is moms, children, families coming to points of entry and going up to border patrol and saying, we want to turn ourselves in and seek asylum, which of course, under our law, is what they can do. so there's a character difference in the kind of influx of immigrants that we are seeing today than we saw five years ago.\n\ngarcia-navarro: we're going to have to leave it there. house majority leader steny hoyer, thank you so much.\n\nhoyer: thank you very much. good to be with you.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
after 13 hours of fiery debate, senate adopts impeachment trial rules\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption chip somodevilla/getty images chip somodevilla/getty images\n\nupdated at 1:50 a.m. et wednesday\n\n\n\nafter a long day and night of dueling between the house managers calling for impeachment and attorneys for president trump declaring the articles of impeachment ridiculous, the senate adopted a set of rules that will govern its impeachment trial, in which opening arguments will get underway wednesday.\n\nthe resolution, put forward by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, calls for each side to receive up to 24 hours to argue their case, spread over three days.\n\nthe measure was approved on a 53-47 party-line vote after senators rejected 11 different amendments offered by minority democrats. those amendments called on the senate to subpoena records and documents from various agencies, including the state department, the white house office of management and budget and the defense department. the trump administration had refused to turn over most of the documents to house investigators.\n\nmcconnell, r-ky., released his resolution outlining the next steps, including a week of hours-long opening arguments, on monday. by tuesday, ahead of the debate, senate leaders made additional changes to the trial timeline.\n\nthe back-and-forth is a culmination of disagreement between democrats and republicans over what would constitute a fair trial. the democratic-led house voted in december to impeach president trump but held off on transmitting the two articles of impeachment in an attempt to get more details on the trial rules. house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., ultimately moved the process forward without the assurances democrats sought.\n\nmcconnell needed a simple majority — 51 votes — to approve his resolution laying out how much time house impeachment managers and the president's defense team will get to make their arguments. the republicans hold 53 seats in the senate.\n\nspeaking on the senate floor, mcconnell called the resolution a fair road map, that closely tracks precedents. senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., called the rules completely partisan. he said mcconnell's resolution seems designed by president trump for president trump.\n\nmcconnell said he would move to table any democratic amendments to the resolution.\n\nlater tuesday afternoon and into the night, he did just that. he called for a vote to table, or kill, several amendments proposed by schumer that would have subpoenaed records of communications related to white house officials, national security council personnel and other trump administration officials who have direct knowledge of key events in question.\n\nthe amendments were killed on party-line 53-47 votes.\n\ntrial timeline\n\nmcconnell maintains that he based his plan on the rules for the impeachment trial of president bill clinton in 1999, with each side getting 24 hours. in a last-minute change, mcconnell called for the 24 hours to be divided over three days, rather than two as he originally proposed. that would address one democratic complaint — that a two-day limit would force the session to last long into the night, since the trial days do not start until 1 p.m. et.\n\nmcconnell also altered the rules for admitting the house evidence into the record. it is now automatically part of the record, rather than senators having to vote to include it.\n\napparently, these were not only concerns for democrats.\n\naccording to a spokeswoman for sen. susan collins, r-maine, senator collins and others raised concerns about the 24 hours of opening statements in 2 days and the admission of the house transcript in the record. her position has been that the trial should follow the clinton model as much as possible. she thinks these changes are a significant improvement.\n\nwill there be witnesses?\n\nthe resolution also delineates how much time senators will get for written questions, and it postpones the debate and vote over whether to call witnesses until after both sides have made their presentations and address questions.\n\nhouse impeachment manager adam schiff, d-calif., also argued against the rules resolution, while calling on the senate to allow testimony from new witnesses. he played senators a tape of trump saying he would love to hear testimony from secretary of state mike pompeo, acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and others (even though white house officials have so far been barred from testifying).\n\nloading...\n\neven senate republicans like sen. mitt romney of utah, who said he was open to hearing from witnesses like former national security adviser john bolton, said that he backed mcconnell's resolution and that if attempts are made to vote on witnesses prior to opening arguments, i would oppose those efforts.\n\ntrump's defense\n\narguing in favor of mcconnell's resolution, trump personal lawyer jay sekulow attacked the house impeachment process and schiff.\n\nreferring to trump's july phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy, sekulow asked, why are we here? are we here because of a phone call? or are we here, before this great body, because since the president was sworn into office, there was a desire to see him removed?\n\nsekulow is part of a defense team for the president led by white house counsel pat cipollone, who called the articles of impeachment ridiculous and said it was an act of patriotism to defend the constitutional rights of the president, because if they do it to the president, they can do it to any of you, and they can do it to any american citizen.\n\ncipollone also falsely stated that not even mr. schiff's republican colleagues were allowed into the scif during the pre-impeachment depositions. in fact, republicans from all three of the house committees that held the depositions were allowed into the secure hearing room, and many of them did attend.\n\nschiff responded that he would not suggest that cipollone would make a false statement, but he said cipollone was mistaken.
pope benedict's complex role in abuse scandal\n\nin his papacy, pope benedict has been the first pope to break the vatican's wall of silence on this issue. still, allen allows that whether the pope has done enough is a matter of fair debate.\n\nbut after pope john paul ii put cardinal ratzinger and his office in charge of the abuse complaints in 2001, allen says he began to talk much more openly about what he described as 'filth' in the catholic church, and became much more aggressive about prosecuting abusers.\n\nprior to 2001, allen tells host neal conan of then-cardinal joseph ratzinger,in the very few public statements he had made about this crisis, he came off, to be frank, as just another roman cardinal in denial.\n\njohn allen, senior correspondent for the national catholic reporter, says the pope isn't just part of the problem, but also an important part of the solution. his op-ed,  a papal conversion , appeared in the new york times.\n\nrevelations that pope benedict xvi failed to do anything about reports of sexual abuse by priests years ago have raised questions about how much he knew, and when.\n\nneal conan, host:\n\ntime now for the opinion page. the scandal over sexual abuse by priests and cover-ups by bishops erupted in this country 10 years ago. now, there are similar charges from several countries in europe that seem to place some responsibility and blame at the door of pope benedict xvi, as a bishop in his native germany, later as a high-ranking vatican official. but in an op-ed in the new york times, john allen, senior correspondent of the national catholic reporter, says before we rush to condemn the pope as part of the problem, we must first understand that he's also been part of the solution.\n\ncatholics in our audience, we'd like to hear from you today. almost five years since he took office, has the pope done enough to clean up the church's sex abuse scandal? 800-989-8255. email us: talk@npr.org. you can also join the conversation on our web site. that's at npr.org. click on talk of the nation.\n\njohn allen of the national catholic reporter joins us now by phone from his office in denver. john, nice to have you back on the program.\n\nmr. john allen (senior correspondent, national catholic reporter): hey, neal. it's always a pleasure.\n\nconan: and you write that then-cardinal ratzinger experienced a conversion of sorts on this issue almost 10 years ago.\n\nmr. allen: yeah, that's right. i mean, one point that is often forgotten in this discussion - because in some reporting, it's been suggested that then-cardinal joseph ratzinger, the guy who is now the pope was somehow the vatican's point person on sex abuse for the entire arch of his 25-year career in rome. and that's not really correct. in fact, he didn't get any direct responsibility for this until 2001, when pope john paul ii put him and his office in charge of it.\n\nand by all accounts, it triggered what i have described - i mean, it's my language, not his - but what i've described as something of a conversion experience, because prior to 2001, in the very few public statements cardinal ratzinger had made about this crisis, he came off to be frank, as just another roman cardinal in denial. but after 2001, when he actually had to sit down and read all the case files for every catholic priest, everyone in the world who had credibly been accused of sexual abuse, he began to talk much more openly about what he described as filth in the catholic church and became much more aggressive about prosecuting abusers. and that has followed into his - flowed, rather, into his papacy, where we see him as the first pope to embrace a zero-tolerance policy on sex abuse, the first pope to meet with victims, the first pope to, in effect, break the vatican's wall of silence on this issue.\n\nso, look. i mean, whether he has done enough, i think, is a matter of fair debate, but i think what is inarguably is that he has at least done something, and by something i mean considerably more than any of his predecessors ever have on this issue.\n\nconan: and you also note - and i think any student of history would have to agree, the church's progress on almost any issue can be glacial to those of us on the outside.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. allen: yeah, that's right. i mean, the saying around the vatican is that they think in centuries. i mean, i have to sometimes joke that the working motto is talk to me on wednesday, and i'll get back to you in 300 years.\n\nconan: yeah.\n\nmr. allen: now, look. i mean, that's not to defend their slowness and ambivalence on this issue. i think - and quite honestly, you know, by contemporary 21st century standards, the response from rome on this and many other things has been abysmally slow. but it is nevertheless to say that from the pope's own point of view, the kind of progress he's made on this issue in the last eight years is, by historical standards, quite remarkable.\n\nconan: and we hear the stories - and this happens to be the start of holy week. it happens to be the fifth anniversary of the death of pope john paul ii, so there are issues that the roman catholics would rather focus on other than this crisis. but nevertheless, the crisis is not going to go away. but we keep hearing the stories of then-bishop ratzinger overlooking the parish priest in - back in germany when he was responsible for this. and nevertheless, there are other stories that we don't hear so much about. if you would tell us how, as pope, he has handled an institution called the legionaries of christ.\n\nmr. allen: yeah. this is - i suppose for catholic insiders, the legionaries of christ would be one of the more high-profile new religious orders in the catholic church, founded in the middle part of the 20th century and known for being very - or i should say fairly conservative and very loyal to the pope, loyal to the vatican. the founder was a high-profile mexican priest by the name of father marcial maciel degollado, who actually died in 2008. father maciel was one of these sort of charismatic figures who was very skilled at generating a following, and very skilled at ingratiating himself in senior levels in rome.\n\nfor several decades, there had been sex abuse allegations lodged against him. one case filed under church law came from a handful of ex-members. and it went to then-cardinal ratzinger's office at the vatican in the mid-'90s, where, essentially, the vatican set on the allegation until 2001. after 2001, with this change i've described in cardinal ratzinger's attitude to this issue, they re-launched the investigation against father marcial. even so, it was widely believed that nothing would happen to him, because father marcial was protected at the most senior levels of the church, all the way up to and including pope john paul ii.\n\nso that when benedict was elected, a matter of just months after his election, in effect, the hammer came down. father marcial was taken out of priestly ministry and was instructed by the new pope to go live a life of prayer and penance. this is widely taken to be a finding of guilt. and, essentially, the conclusion that catholic insiders drew from that episode is that even someone as prominent and well connected as father marcial - if even that guy is not safe under the new pope, then no one is. i mean, in other words, the conclusion was there's a new sheriff in town.\n\nconan: now, let's see if we can get some callers in on the conversation: 800-989-8255. email us: talk@npr.org. if there is indeed a new sheriff in town, is it too little too late - i guess, is the question we're asking. let's go to shawn(ph), shawn with us from fort lauderdale.\n\nshawn (caller): yes. i was just wondering - it seems to me, i agree that the - this pope has been moving quickly, probably, for obvious reasons. my question is more throughout the world church. i know mr. allen is very familiar with what's going on in the church. is this more of a problem, at this juncture, of looking back? in other words, we're looking at offenses, very grave offenses that occurred in the '50s, '60s, maybe into the '70s, and that we're not really talking about an ongoing problem. is there - there's no widespread problem, or is there a widespread problem of abuse currently in the catholic church? and that's my question, and i can take my answer off the air.\n\nconan: all right, shawn, thanks very much. john?\n\nmr. allen: sure. well, look. i think you can always find individual problems of abuse if you're looking around. but let me take a step back and say that i think from the beginning, what we now talk about is the sexual abuse crisis in the catholic church has really been two interlocking, but distinct problems. there's the problem of priests who abused, and there's the problem of bishops who covered it up - that is, who should have known better and failed to act.\n\nnow, i think on that first problem - that is the need to adopt tough policies to try to prevent future acts of abuse - i think most people would give the catholic church, in general, and in this pope, in particular, fairly high marks. i mean, today, zero tolerance is more or less the official policy of the catholic church.\n\ntoday, it is abundantly clear whether we're talking about europe or north america or africa or latin america or wherever, it is abundantly clear that if a priest sexually abuses someone - and in particular, if he sexually abuses a minor child - that that priest is going to be immediately yanked out of the priesthood and he's also going to be turned over to the cops. so, in that sense, the church, i think, today is paying the price for failures in the past, as opposed to failures in the present.\n\nbut the other piece of the puzzle is, of course, what about senior management that allowed this to happen? that is, what about bishops who just drop the ball? who - and in some cases, who overtly try to cover this up rather than deal with the problem? there, i think, a lot of people would say that that is the big piece of unfinished business from this crisis. and it's not clear what new accountability measures the church might be able to adopt to give some teeth to the idea of accountability for bishops. and that, frankly, is what makes these revelations about the pope's track record both as archbishop in munich from '77 to '82, and also as a vatican official.\n\nit's what makes those revelations so explosive, because ultimately, what's at stake here is his moral authority to deal with this unfinished bit of business. because what people will ask is: is it credible to believe that benedict can crack heads with other bishops if, at least prior to 2001, his own record really isn't any better? and that's the hard question the pope is going to have to answer.\n\nconan: well, just continuing along the lines of the question, just the case of father marcial, the cases we've heard about - north america and europe, for the most part - are people concerned that there may be other shoes ready to drop in south america, in asia, in africa?\n\nmr. allen: oh, absolutely. look. i mean, this crisis today has broken in - it broke first, really, in canada in the late '90s, then australia, the states, ireland, to some extent the u.k., now germany and some other places in europe. and now that's a lengthening list of countries, obviously. but, i mean, let's bear in mind that two-thirds of the 1.2 billion roman catholics in the world today live in the southern hemisphere - that is latin american, african, asia. by mid-century, that'll bee three-quarters.\n\nbasically speaking, i think if we adopt the premise that this problem probably is a global catholic problem - that is, it's no more likely to flare up in north america or europe than it is in latin america or sub-saharan african - then the truth is, there's probably at least two-thirds of the catholic world where this crisis has not yet erupted, but where it very well could. and so if i were in senior leadership in the catholic church today, if somebody were trying to tell me that we're rounding a corner, that this story is almost over, i would be deeply skeptical of that.\n\nconan: to your knowledge, are there efforts underway to, well, be a little more proactive this time around and unearth these problems before they come to light on their own?\n\nmr. allen: neal, i think there are some bishops and some other church leaders who sort of on their own have taken it upon themselves to try to, in effect, to diffuse the bomb before it goes off - that is, who are well aware that this crisis could erupt in their zone of competence and who have tried to look into among their own, to establish what the record is, and to be transparent about it. and i certainly think anyone who has watched this crisis play out in other places ought to draw that conclusion, that it's far better for the church to get this out all at once and on its own terms rather than to suffer death by a thousand cuts.\n\nbut, on the other hand, i can also say that there is no formal policy, either from the vatican or anyplace else, that instructs bishops to do that. so i would say that at the moment, it's sort of catch-as-catch-can. some people are trying to get ahead of the curve, and others are simply holding their breath, hoping this won't happen to them.\n\nconan: john allen of the national catholic reporter, also the author of the rise of benedict xvi. you're listening to talk of the nation from npr news.\n\nand let's get mark on the line, mark with us from tulsa.\n\nmark (caller): yes, hello. how are you?\n\nconan: good, thanks.\n\nmark: great show, by the way. mr. allen, thank you for all your work.\n\nmr. allen: oh, you're very welcome, mark. what's your question?\n\nmark: a comment, more so. as a 30-year-old male from the midwest - in tulsa, specifically - of mixed ethnic background, many of us - we applaud the pope for what he has done, but it's all relative, more or less. when an institution, for centuries, has moved at a snail's pace and you're going to tell me that slightly faster than that is all we can do right now, we take what we can, but at the same time you throw your hands up in arms. because as your guest just said, this has not erupted throughout two-thirds of the known catholic world. and we look at ireland, how that has flared up recently in the past year. we just dont know when it's going to end, or if it's even started, to tell you the truth.\n\nconan: there was - the pope did accept the resignation of one of the irish bishops this past week.\n\nmark: yes, that's right. there are, basically speaking, now five irish bishops who have offered their resignations in the wake of this crisis, two of which have been accepted, and the other three are sort of still waiting on the pope's desk for him to act.\n\ni mean, part of the problem here, neal, is that on the one hand, it may well be the case that accountability is going to require more bishops to resign. on the other hand, there is a cultural and historical problem here, which is the vatican never likes to see bishops step down under fire, because in their mind, thinking historically, this is an invitation for people to mount pressure campaigns to try to bring down bishops for various reasons. that makes them very uncomfortable, and this is what communist regimes try to do, and so on. and the vatican, thinking globally and thinking historically, can't help flashing on those kinds of memories.\n\nin addition, the vatican has a whole another understanding of what accountability means in a case like this, because their theological model for understanding a bishop is not that he is the ceo of a corporation, but he's the father of a family. and as we would say with regular human families, you know, when things get tough, you don't tell the father to walk away. you tell him to, you know, try to solve the problem. that's their understanding of what accountability means.\n\nand so there's a lot that has to be weighted through there. but at the end of the day, i would say that in the court of popular opinion, this business of how do you hold bishops accountable for their failures, that would be the single most important bit of unfinished business from this crisis.\n\nconan: mark, thanks very much for the call.\n\nmark: thank you both.\n\nconan: let's go next to - this is bette(ph), bette with us from grand rapids.\n\nbette (caller): hello.\n\nconan: hi, bette. go ahead, please.\n\nbette: about - i guess it was 1993 when i brought my case against the diocese here in grand rapids. i was molested by our parish priest when i was 12 and 13 years old. it went on for a year.\n\nconan: i'm so sorry.\n\nbette: i was one of several of his victims. and during the time that it was happening, there were several parents who tried to bring attention to what they thought was bad behavior on this priest's part. and the bishop, you know, ignored the problem, transferred him, and did all the things that they do. but i believe that the bishops do need to be held accountable, because when i brought my case forward, when i made my accusations, the bishop and the lawyers denied everything. they said that i was making things up, i had false memories, et cetera, et cetera.\n\nand that went on for several, several months, until finally, the priest who molested me was put in front of a lie detector. and before he was hooked up to the machine, he confessed everything. he spent hours talking to the lie detector technician, confessing it all. and as it turned out, he had wanted to confess all along, but the lawyer and the bishop were sitting on him and insisting that what i was saying was all lies.\n\nmr. allen: bette...\n\nbette: i wound up on being successful in my suit, and by success i mean that i got - i didnt want him defrocked, because i was afraid that he would just go to another state and pick up work (unintelligible)...\n\nconan: bette, we just have a few seconds left. i wanted to give john a chance to respond.\n\nmr. allen: well, bette, actually, i wanted to ask you very, very quickly: when you say you want the bishop held accountable, what would that mean to you? what would accountability look like?\n\nbette: well, what happens when a person commits perjury in a civil situation like that? if they're asked directly if these accusations are true and they say no and they know, in fact, otherwise, what happens in those cases?\n\nconan: that would be a criminal case.\n\nbette: right.\n\nmr. allen: in other words, there would be some kind of criminal prosecution. look, i - first of all, i'm dreadfully sorry for what happened to you, and i'm glad that, ultimately, you are able to prevail. i don't know exactly what should happen, because i know that the vatican has to set policy for a global church. but i do know that when i talk to just ordinary people, the kinds of disappointment that bette is describing, particularly about how the bishops seem - how the church seems to have dealt with its priest problem, but not its bishop's problem - that, to me, does seem to be the single biggest sort of neuralgic point in all of this. and somehow...\n\nconan: and i'm afraid we're...\n\nmr. allen: ...it's a question the pope is going to have to answer.\n\nconan: beth, thank you very much for the call. and i'm sorry to cut this short, but we're running out of time. and john allen, thank you for your time today.\n\nmr. allen: neal, great pleasure.\n\nconan: john allen of the national catholic reporter.\n\nthis is talk of the nation from npr news. i'm neal conan, in washington.\n\ncopyright © 2010 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
u.s. puts cuba back on list of state sponsors of terrorism\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption yamil lage/afp via getty images yamil lage/afp via getty images\n\nupdated at 4:25 p.m. et\n\nthe trump administration is designating cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism in a move that will return the island nation to the pariah list from which it was removed five years ago.\n\nas he announced the designation monday, secretary of state mike pompeo accused cuba of repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism in granting safe harbor to terrorists.\n\npompeo also said the trump administration is intent on denying the castro regime the resources it uses to oppress its people at home, and countering its malign interference in venezuela and the rest of the western hemisphere.\n\ncuban foreign minister bruno rodríguez tweeted, we condemn the hypocritical and cynical designation of cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism announced by the us. the political opportunism of this action is recognized by anyone with an honest regard for the scourge of terrorism and its victims.\n\nthe u.s. removed cuba from its state sponsors of terrorism list in may 2015. president barack obama's administration had reached an agreement to restore relations with cuba months earlier, including a plan to boost travel and trade between the two countries.\n\nthe world is upside down, cuban diplomat josé ramón cabañas said late last week as news spread of the pending change. he noted that the cuban embassy in washington, d.c., came under an armed attack in april – an incident in which a texas man was arrested on assault and weapons charges.\n\nsen. patrick leahy blasted the administration's move, saying, this blatantly politicized designation makes a mockery of what had been a credible, objective measure of a foreign government's active support for terrorism.\n\nnothing remotely like that exists here, the democrat from vermont said in a monday statement, adding that the move will make u.s.-cuba relations more difficult for the incoming biden administration.\n\nbeing put on the u.s. terror list exposes countries to a suite of sanctions, including restrictions on u.s. foreign assistance; a ban on defense exports and sales; certain controls over exports of dual use items; and miscellaneous financial and other restrictions, the u.s. state department says.\n\nthe state department currently lists only three countries as state sponsors of terrorism: syria, iran and north korea.\n\nin a much-anticipated move, the u.s. formally took sudan off the list last month as part of a deal in which the country agreed to normalize relations and open economic ties with israel.\n\nthe trump administration has steadily reversed many of the steps obama took to end cuba's isolation. in the spring of 2019, it placed new sanctions and penalties on cuba, hoping to undermine the communist regime. it also killed a deal that would have made it easier for cuban baseball players to join professional teams in the u.s. and canada.\n\ntwo months later, the united states imposed new travel restrictions to stop u.s. citizens from visiting the island on cruise ships and other travel.\n\nand in may it returned cuba to a list of countries that the u.s. deems as not cooperating fully with its counterterrorism efforts. it cited the country's refusal of a request from colombia to extradite leaders of the national liberation army and said cuba has harbored several u.s. fugitives from justice.
trump can't bring back all those jobs from china. here's what he can do\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption johannes eisele/afp/getty images johannes eisele/afp/getty images\n\ndonald trump's rhetoric on china and trade has been blunt, to say the least.\n\nwe can't continue to allow china to rape our country — and that's what they're doing, he said at a may 2016 campaign rally. it's the greatest theft in the history of the world.\n\nhis tone was a bit more measured leading up to his meeting with chinese president xi jinping, though the message was similar: the u.s. must be tough on china when it comes to trade.\n\nthe meeting next week with china will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits ... and job losses, the president wrote across two tweets. trump continued, american companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.\n\ntrump's anti-trade rhetoric was great politics during the campaign. but the hard truth is that getting those jobs back from china just won't happen — indeed, china isn't primarily responsible for manufacturing job losses in recent years. but if trump is concerned about the jobs lost to china, there are other steps he can take right now, some of which don't at all involve negotiating with president xi.\n\nwhat exactly has (and hasn't) the u.s. lost to china?\n\nthe u.s. has most definitely lost jobs to china. in perhaps the most commonly cited recent paper on the matter, a group of economists led by mit's david autor found that between 1990 and 2007, chinese import competition accounted for the loss of 1 million manufacturing jobs — about 25 percent of the total manufacturing job loss over that period.\n\n(in fact, trump may want to thank xi for all his country's exports; those same economists plus lund university's kaveh majlesi found in a january paper that, all other things being equal, if the growth in chinese import penetration had been 50 percent lower than the actual growth in wisconsin, michigan and pennsylvania than it was between 2000 and 2016, those states would have chosen hillary clinton, and she would have won the electoral college.)\n\nin addition, china has not lived up to a variety of commitments it made when it joined the world trade organization, according to a january report from the u.s. trade representative's office. in areas including intellectual property protections, the government's favoring of state-owned enterprises and troubling agricultural policies that block u.s. market access, the ustr said the chinese government could stand to improve.\n\nis a country like china different, and is it more likely that they are — cheating isn't necessarily the right word, but — doing more of these kinds of things that are more worrisome than other countries? said chad bown, senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics. and i think the answer to that is probably yes.\n\nso there are reasons for concern regarding the u.s. trade relationship with china. but if china did indeed suck 25 percent of manufacturing jobs out of the u.s. over nearly two decades, that leaves about 75 percent of those jobs that weren't lost to china.\n\nwhat happened? automation is a huge factor here. u.s. factories simply grew more efficient over time. in fact, while the number of manufacturing jobs plummeted — manufacturing output nevertheless grew.\n\ni used to go out on an auto factory floor and it looks like fifth avenue in new york at christmastime, said carla hills, who served as u.s. trade representative under george h.w. bush. today, you look at the floor and there are six people with long white smocks and buffers on their shoes.\n\nwhat can be done?\n\nthere are a host of things that trump might be able to do to improve the u.s. economy when it comes to trade with china. but let's start with one thing he can't do:\n\ntrump can't bring back those lost jobs\n\nhe at one point threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on china's goods. there are some big problems with that approach. one is that it simply wouldn't be that effective.\n\nthat would bring some manufacturing production back to the u.s., said gordon hanson, who co-wrote that study on u.s. jobs moving to china. but that's not the same thing as manufacturing employment. the jobs that left were 20th century jobs. that is, they were jobs in factories that were built using older vintage technology that was more labor intensive than 21st century tech in which automation is more present.\n\nnot only that, but that could also have the pesky side effect of launching a trade war. still, there's plenty more that could be helpful to u.s. goods producers.\n\ncombating china's trade practices\n\nrather than threaten massive tariffs, trump could try to make the footing a little more equal for both u.s. and chinese goods.\n\nthere are a lot of industries in which you could make the case that china is violating existing trade rules, said hanson. but the response to that is not an across-the-board tariff. the response is to go industry by industry and pick those things apart.\n\nthat could be a long (but worthwhile) process of filing complaints with the world trade organization. still, a long string of nonsplashy administrative actions may not suit president trump's decidedly unsubtle governing style.\n\nwork with other countries\n\nchina trades with a lot of other places besides the u.s., so the u.s. could band together with those places to put pressure on china to change its trade practices.\n\naccording to hanson, the u.s. could get together with the eu, get together with a bunch of wto partners, document violations, and say, 'look: if you don't remove those subsidies, then we're going to enact a series of retaliatory tariffs on other products.' \n\nnegotiate\n\ntrump loves to complain about the u.s. trade deficit with china. and it is indeed big — in 2016, the u.s. imported $347 billion more than it exported to china, accounting for almost half of the total u.s. trade deficit with the world.\n\ntrade deficits aren't inherently bad, but if the u.s. does want to sell more goods to china, the trump administration could try to negotiate china into being more open to u.s. products, says one expert.\n\nin general, china's market access restrictions prevent the consumption of american goods and services, wrote the brookings institution's david dollar this week. he points to one example: in automobiles, a 25 percent import tariff plus domestic content rules in the past mean that american-brand cars sold in china have little u.s. content. likewise, he said, china could be more open to u.s. agricultural and service industries.\n\nhowever, it doesn't make sense to make too big a deal (as trump does) out of any single trade deficit with any country.\n\nbilateral trade deficits are not as relevant as your overall trade deficit, hills said. i have a deficit with my grocery, and i have a surplus with my clients. but i can't have a surplus with my grocer. i have to buy from them.\n\npolicies that have nothing to do with china\n\nmainstream economists often say that trade is ultimately a net good; it creates broad, albeit easy-to-ignore-in-everyday-life benefits, like cheaper goods and a wider variety of products. but it also comes with acute pain for those people who do lose jobs.\n\nthat same pain is felt by people who lose their jobs to robots, though, said hills, and if the u.s. is serious about getting former manufacturing workers back to work, that means adopting policies outside of trade pacts.\n\nwe could be criticized for not addressing, in my opinion, the policy of skill training for those who have lost their jobs to automation, and the majority of job losses have been as a result of automation, said hills. but if you're someone who lost their job — whether it's a miner in west virginia or on the floor of a ford factory — you don't really care if it's automation or international competition.\n\nshe points to the transition from horses and buggies to cars.\n\nthe question is, what do you do with the people who were driving the horses and the coaches? she said. they don't know how to drive cars. you've got to send them to a skill center.\n\nbut then, there's a related problem: often when new jobs do pop up, they're not near the people who need those jobs, bown pointed out. there's a related problem in the energy sector, as npr's domenico montanaro wrote last week: the lion's share of the nation's new solar jobs aren't exactly in coal country. that means there could be some sort of way to help people relocate to where the jobs are, bown added.\n\nof course, none of that kind of domestic policy will come up as trump meets with xi jinping this week. plenty of issues will be hanging over their heads — north korea and missile defense, for example. one thing that won't be hanging over them: the trans-pacific partnership.\n\nbecause trump scrapped the tpp, which had been in process for nearly a decade, the two leaders come to a table where the game board for trade has been overturned and reset. china was not a party to that deal, but the deal was written to allow the u.s. to hem china in on trade by setting stiff and transparent rules on trade in asia.\n\nhowever imperfect the tpp was, hanson said, the u.s. did give china a lot more trading power by giving up the deal.\n\nwe just walked away from it and gave china carte blanche to dictate the way in which trade rules will be written in asia for the next decade, hanson said.
we may see color so we can understand each other\n\nenlarge this image istockphoto istockphoto\n\nhumans and other primates see color thanks to three different kinds of cells in the retina.\n\nby responding differently to short-, medium- and long-wavelength light, these cells provide the information the brain needs to figure out color in the environment.\n\nthis is how we do it. it's also how the birds and the bees do it.\n\nbut it turns out that our eyes do this imperfectly.\n\nwhereas the cells in the eye of the birds and the bees sample light evenly across the spectrum, the receptors in our eyes are tuned less-regularly. in particular, long-wave cells (that is, cells that respond more readily to light from the long-wave, red end of the spectrum) are only a very narrow band apart from the medium-wave cells that are tuned to green light.\n\nit seems, then, that evolution has given us the short end of the color-vision stick. but, thanks to work over the last decade or so, it is now possible to understand why this, actually, is not really true. human (and primate) color vision may, in fact, be superbly well-adapted to its primary purpose.\n\nthe trick is getting clear about what that purpose is.\n\nfor many years — nearly a century, in fact — it was believed that color vision was for spotting ripe fruit. but there may be a better adaptive hypothesis: we see colors so that we can see each other.\n\ncolor is full of meaning to old-world primates such as ourselves. changes in skin color reveal all manner of information about ourselves — are we happy or sad, sexually receptive, ovulating, angry?\n\nand it turns out — as is argued in a paper published this month by an international team of researchers from japan, the u.s., canada, and the uk — that the narrow separation of bandwidth sensitivities of long- and medium-wave cones may be the best way for a trichromatic system, such as ours, to discriminate facial hues.\n\nas chihiro hiramatsu of kyushu university in japan explains in an email, a narrow separation means a large overlap and that means, in turn, that those cones respond to similar reflected spectra from objects, and could be able to compare subtle difference of the spectra at long wavelength.\n\nwhat hiramatsu and his colleagues did was present human perceivers with images of faces designed to mimic the effects of different kinds of color vision. for example, they compared our distinct form of trichromacy with one in which the wavelength sensitivities of the cones was more evenly tuned and also with one in which the distance between the sensitivities was even more narrow. they also looked at color systems in which there are only two effective kinds of receptors (dichromacy).\n\nwhat they found is striking. we do it best. our irregular distribution of sensitivities turns out to be just what we need to be sensitive to blushes and blanches.\n\nthis doesn't prove that the social signaling hypothesis is right, the authors cautiously acknowledge. maybe trichomacy of our sort became fixed early on in catarrhine evolution, due to fitness benefits from improved foraging ability, and that subsequently the red-green color channel became co-opted for socio-sexual signaling.\n\nbut these findings do demonstrate that our sort of trichromacy gives individuals a clear benefit in exploiting the variation in skin coloration associated with important aspects of individual condition, such as intra-cycle variation in female fertility.\n\nthe authors continue:\n\nto our knowledge, this is the first empirical support that a necessary condition of social signal hypothesis is met, indicating that the relative spectral positioning of the m and l photoreceptors in catarrhine trichromatic visual system is well suited for detecting facial skin color variation in non-human primates.\n\nso we may have developed color vision to see faces. but this raises another question: why do faces fluctuate in color in the first place?\n\npresumably evolution wouldn't have favored creatures who visibly manifest, in the form of colorful change, how they feel, if there were not already others around to take in the spectacle? we blush for others. so you need color vision to have color. and you need color to have color vision?\n\nthis is a beautiful puzzle, one the theory of evolution is well able to explain.\n\nalva noë is a philosopher at the university of california, berkeley, where he writes and teaches about perception, consciousness and art. he is the author of several books, including his latest, strange tools: art and human nature (farrar, straus and giroux, 2015). you can keep up with more of what alva is thinking on facebook and on twitter: @alvanoe
for our 30th anniversary, fresh air tapes live with seth meyers of 'late night'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption paul loftland/paul loftland photography paul loftland/paul loftland photography\n\nwhen it comes to comedy, late night host seth meyers is clear about what drew him in: i got into it because it looked like the most fun job in the world, he says. and it has not led me astray.\n\nindeed, meyers' resume is packed with fun. before taking over the reins at late night, he spent 13 years at saturday night live, first as a performer, then as head writer and the co-host, alongside amy poehler, of the show's weekend update segment.\n\nbut both writing and working in front of a live audience each week on snl was not without its drawbacks. meyers recalls ruminating over shows that didn't quite hit the mark: if you had a bad snl, it stayed with you all week, he says.\n\nnow, as host of his own nightly show, meyers actively works against the instinct to second guess himself. we made this decision after [late night] every night not to do a post-op ... [and] instead [to] sleep on it, he says. and if it's still bothering you in the morning, let's talk then. the reality is, you are then just focused on the next show. ... it's nice to be in this place where you can be very forward focused.\n\ninterview highlights\n\non late night comedy in the trump era\n\npeople say, oh you are doing the job of journalists. we can't do our job without journalists. journalists can do their job without late night comedians; they'd be just fine without us. but we, of course, use their work every day to build our pieces. ...\n\ni think we're all lucky as a society that journalists are trying to hold this standard and hold this line of what it means to be a journalist, and the integrity that it means to be a journalist. whereas comedians are built for the donald trump era, because we comedians notoriously have very low levels of integrity.\n\non making fun of donald trump at the 2011 white house correspondents' dinner\n\ni saw him three days after, and we were at an event in new york. ... the reason that i found him to be such a fair target that night [of the dinner] was the birther issue — that was what he was loudly championing at the time, which i still, to this day, find to be one of his more disgraceful things he's ever done. so i wasn't just bullying for the sake of bullying. i thought he was, and continue to think he's a bully.\n\nlorne michaels, [creator and executor producer of snl], one of the things he'd always say to you is: don't tell a joke about somebody where, if you saw them, you would feel you had to leave the room. be decent enough, if it's fair enough and you believe in it, you shouldn't have to leave the room.\n\nand so i saw him and i walked over and i said, hey, i just wanted to thank you for being a good sport the other night. even though he hadn't been and he had already criticized me. i wanted to give him the chance to have some revisionist history with me. and he did not, and he said: you were very rude. it was too far, the president was funny. you were too rude. and i said, well, it's good seeing you.\n\nbut then we ran into each other at the snl 40th, which i would say [was] maybe only about four months before he announced [his candidacy]. ... it was very crowded, and that studio is very small and i realized — i was with my wife — and i realized we are going to cross in an aisle getting to our seats. ... he and i actually had a very lovely bygones be bygones interaction then, and i think we would be in a perfectly fine place had he not decided to run and win president.\n\non getting his start in comedy\n\nmy father to this day is the funniest person i know. and he was the funniest person anybody who knew him knew. and when he started laughing at me, when i could make him laugh, i had the sense of, oh i might be good at this.\n\nand also, my parents, at a very inappropriate age, introduced us to things like snl and monty python, and it was stuff i just loved and was delighted by. and i went off to college and i hadn't really done much comedy stuff, but i went to northwestern university ... and they had a really good improv troupe and i saw it [during] new-student week my freshman year, and i had a real sense of ... i think i can get onstage with other really funny people and come up with things off the top of my head.\n\non being hired at snl as a performer in 2001\n\ni was hired as a performer and then they course corrected. [becoming a staff writer] took about five years, and those were my hardest five years on the show. i thought when you showed up at snl, that meant you were as good as everybody at snl. like how could lorne be wrong?\n\nand you walk down the hallway ... there's everybody's first head shot. and your first few weeks there, you just see all the people that are super famous and you realize that's your next chapter: oh eddie murphy, mike myers, will ferrell, i'm on that path. and then, about three months in, you start looking at the people who were there only a year, and you're like, oh no, maybe i'm gonna be that person. i was really afraid i would be fired.\n\non getting the phone call from snl that they might not renew his contract\n\ntwo years in, and this happens, you basically get a call where they're like, we're supposed to pick up your contract this day [but] we're gonna wait another month. [they're] basically saying, we're gonna see what else is out there before we make a decision. i did get that call, and that is an awful way to spend a month in the summer. ...\n\nit was really bad, and the other thing that was really bad, and this is something that was my own shame and something that i did not find attractive in myself: the people that came after me were some of the great performers i think of this generation. fred armisen came, will forte, and then bill hader and jason sudeikis, and andy samberg. and these were people that i was in competition with, and they were my friends. and i felt great jealousy towards them and their successes — which was an awful thing to feel. and so i was kind of saved by the fact that lorne offered me this position on the writing staff, and then i felt at home. it was the first time that i felt like i was adding value as opposed to keeping space warm.\n\non how hosting late night has changed his life\n\nit is strange, because i do walk into the same building, it is on the same floor as saturday night live, so there are parts of my life that are very similar; i did not have to move to a different place or a new elevator bank. but there is this lovely consistency to a job that is the same hours every day and the same schedule everyday.\n\nand also at snl, they call the guests hosts for a reason, because they completely take over the dna of [the show] that week. whereas your own show, you are the host, because the guests ultimately don't change the show that much. ... it's nice to be in a place that is more consistent. that is the part i enjoy the most.\n\n... when you write something or when you tell a joke that works really well; it's the greatest feeling on earth.\n\non the best parts of working in comedy\n\nit was a chance to work with people who are really funny, which has been the greatest gift of this life. ... i loved sports and was terrible at sports, and i never once in my life did anything on any field of play that gave me that adrenaline rush of success. but i do feel that when you write something or when you tell a joke that works really well; it's the greatest feeling on earth. i am chasing it because it makes me feel good, i'm not trying to cloak anything that feels bad.\n\nradio producers lauren krenzel and therese madden and web producers bridget bentz, heidi saman and beth novey contributed to this story.
excerpt: 'a fierce radiance'\n\na fierce radiance\n\nby lauren belfer\n\nhardcover, 544 pages\n\nharper\n\nlist price: $25.99\n\nchapter one\n\nwednesday morning, december 10, 1941\n\nthe rockefeller institute for medical research, new york city\n\nclaire shipley was no doctor, but even she could see that the man on the stretcher was dying. his lips were blue from lack of oxygen. his cheeks were hollow, his skin leathery and tight against his bones. his eyes were open but unfocused, like the glass eyes in a box at a doll factory she'd once photographed. although his hair was full and dark brown, not gray, claire pegged him at over eighty. his head swayed from side to side as the orderlies slid the stretcher out of the ambulance and onto the gurney. beneath the once-white blanket, his right leg was grotesquely swollen.\n\nmaking a split-second appraisal of the scene, guided by intuition, claire crouched and pivoted until she found the best angle. using the 35 mm lens, she stopped down on the leica to increase the depth of field. she took a quick series of photos, bracketing to guarantee the exposure: the patient in profile and a half-dozen nurses, doctors, and orderlies gathered around him, like a group portrait by rembrandt, their faces saying their thoughts. they knew he was dying, too. out here in the cold without their coats on, with the man looking dead already and nobody else nearby but claire, they dispensed with their usual cheery and encouraging expressions.\n\nthe group proceeded into the hospital. claire followed, the others oblivious to her. she was like a spy, paid to fit in, to hide in plain sight, her identity and her loyalties concealed. her ability to hide in plain sight was a paradox, even to herself, because she was physically striking. had the others taken the time to notice her, they would have seen a thirty-six-year-old woman filled with the confidence and glamour of success, tall, slender, strong, her arms and shoulders shaped from carrying heavy photographic equipment. her thick dark hair fell in waves to her shoulders. her face was broad, her features well defined.\n\nshe wore her usual winter uniform of loose navy blue trousers, cashmere sweater over silk blouse, and a beige fleece-lined jacket with eight pockets. it was a hunter's jacket, and she'd ordered it from a specialty store. claire shipley was a hunter: searching and waiting for the proper angle, the telling moment, for a narrative to give sense to the jumble of existence.\n\nupstairs, the group crowded into a private room. in one coordinated heave the orderlies shifted the patient from the gurney to a bed. the man moaned. at least the orderlies were quick. the staff bustled around the bed, taking the patient's pulse, drawing blood, rearranging his useless limbs. in the enclosed space, the rotting stench he gave off assaulted claire. she felt a constriction of revulsion and forced herself to ignore it, because the man's eyes were alive now. golden brown eyes, shifting slowly, their movement consuming his energy. his eyes followed the voices of the nurses. when claire's daughter, emily, was a newborn, her delicate face peering from a wrap of pink blankets, her eyes had followed claire's voice around the room just so while claire's husband held her.\n\nclaire felt a piercing ache. her daughter had died seven and a half years ago. june 13 would mark eight years. rationally, claire knew that seven and a half years was a long time. nonetheless sudden, intense memories jarred her, bringing emily back with painful clarity.\n\nclaire's husband was gone, too, although by now she could usually keep a mental door closed on the anger and despondency that had followed his departure. automatically claire did a maternal checkin: her younger child, charlie, was safe at school. later he would be at home following his usual routine with maritza, their housekeeper, who was like a grandmother to him.\n\nat the recollection of tucking a wool scarf into charlie's coat this morning, claire confronted the dying man before her. outside, he'd been easy to objectify. here, with the movement of his eyes, he became an individual. someone's husband, dad, son, brother. his fate became personal. focusing on his eyes, claire opened the camera's aperture to narrow the depth of field. she wanted to portray the staff and equipment as blurry and ominous, the way he must be experiencing them.\n\nclaire couldn't help herself: there was emily, lying on her bed at home, too weak to fight on, lost to infection, strands of her curly, light brown hair sticking to her cheeks. the well-meaning doctor who visited each day couldn't help her. claire held emily's hand long past the moment when emily's spirit or soul or spark—whatever constituted life—slipped away. in a wave of delayed recognition, claire understood that emily was no longer simply resting after her terrible, twisting struggle, but was lifeless. without life. dead. after a moment emily's eyes opened, staring at the ceiling without seeing it. her pale blue eyes seemed to turn white while claire watched. screams of torment consumed claire in waves, even though someone else seemed to claire to be screaming, a kind of ghost self within her. charlie woke from his nap in the next room. mama, he called.\n\nmama.\n\nwhom did he want? claire wondered as she heard his cries. she was immobilized by a dense weight within her chest. then claire realized with a start that she was his mother. the mama charlie called for was her. she heard footsteps in the hallway. a voice hushed charlie. comforted him. took him from his crib. claire's own mother, here to care for them.\n\never so softly, with a lifetime's worth of gentleness, claire pressed emily's eyelids shut. she kept her hand in place for long minutes. beneath her fingers, she felt emily's brow, the tickle of her eyelashes, the tender perfection of her eyelids, the softness of her eyebrows. emily's eyebrows were darker than her hair, and claire's mother had predicted that emily's hair would turn dark as she grew older. now they would never know. claire tried to collect within her hand a generation of caresses, from the moment of emily's birth to the point far in the future, past claire's own death, that should have been the natural course of emily's life. emily's skin was still warm beneath claire's palm.\n\nseven and a half years ago. like yesterday. a cliché that was always true. claire picked up the chart from the end of the hospital bed and read the history of the man lying helpless before her. edward r. reese jr. age: 37. height: 5'11. weight: 175. marital status: married. two children. address: 1020 park avenue, new york, n.y. profession: banker. claire shuddered. he was only one year older than she was. she imagined him holding his children on his lap to read them a story at bedtime, the way she held emily and charlie. she saw him advising clients in a wood-paneled office.\n\nhe began to breathe in quick, choked gasps, as if the air were a knife cutting his lungs. claire read on. fever upon arrival at the presbyterian hospital on monday, december 8: 104.1. fever upon transfer to the rockefeller institute: 106.04. bacterial level in his blood at 7 am on december 10: 100 per milliliter. claire didn't know what that meant but assumed it was high. he'd been treated with two types of sulfa drugs, sulfadiazine and sulfapyridine. neither had worked. he'd had three transfusions to try to clear the bacteria from his blood, to no avail. the infection had entered his bloodstream from a skin abrasion at the right knee. there were six abscesses in his right leg. his lungs were affected. diagnosis: staphylococcal septicemia.\n\nblood poisoning. emily had died of blood poisoning. in one gliding motion, a stately, straight-backed nurse took the chart from claire's hand and reattached it to the end of the bed. chief nurse brockett, her identification badge read. beneath her regulation cap, her steel gray hair was pulled into a bun. her aloof severity reminded claire of her high school headmistress, the type of woman who could intimidate with a glance.\n\nyou may not read the chart. nurse brockett enunciated each word with precision, as if she suspected that english were not claire's native language.\n\nthat's fine. claire pushed her memories of her daughter out of her mind and attacked the problem at hand. nurse brockett. well, claire wasn't subject to this hierarchy, and nurse brockett didn't intimidate her. through her years of work she'd learned to agree with everyone in charge and then, when their attention was diverted, do exactly what she needed to do to get the story. bravado was a trait claire put on each morning with her silk blouse and tailored trousers. her boss had sent her here to follow the testing of a potentially revolutionary medication, but already claire knew that the real story, the one with emotion and power, was about saving the life of edward reese.\n\nto establish her prerogatives, claire took her equipment bags to a narrow table against the wall on the far side of the room. the table held a blue-patterned porcelain vase filled with white, billowy hothouse roses. claire placed the vase on the floor. sensing the nurse's glare at her back, she slowed her movements, staking her claim. she took off her jacket, folded it, and stashed it beneath the table. when claire heard the nurse's footsteps leaving the room, she felt relieved: first skirmish won. she arranged her cameras and film on the table for easy access. in her notebook, she wrote down the details about edward reese. she checked the picture count on the cameras and sketched out rough captions. claire was working alone today, without a reporter to take formal caption notes and help with the equipment. ever since the attack on pearl harbor several days before, the office had been topsy-turvy. this assignment had come in unexpectedly, and with staff heading to washington and hawaii, editorial had no reporters to spare. just as well. claire preferred to work alone, without a reporter's interference.\n\nwhen claire finished what she thought of as her housekeeping chores, she looked around and was surprised to find herself alone with edward reese. his eyes had settled on her. she felt self-conscious and wanted to say to him, don't worry, i'll do you proud. meeting his gaze, she said nothing, but it was the vow she made to herself. with her light meter in hand, she toured the room, taking sample readings and orienting herself. luckily the room was bright. she wouldn't need artificial light or a tripod, at least not yet. the setup here was a little strange for a hospital. she glanced at reese, who continued to watch her. she wondered if he'd noticed the oddness. the spacious, high-ceilinged room looked like the reception area of a private club, with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the river and an arrangement of leather chairs and a sofa. brilliantly colored, semiabstract seascapes decorated the walls, no doubt loans from mrs. john d. rockefeller jr., who collected modern art. sunlight reflecting from the river shimmered and trembled upon the walls and ceiling, as if the hospital room were an extension of the paintings.\n\nclaire shipley?\n\nclaire turned. a doctor in an unbuttoned white coat stood before her. he was about six feel tall, lean, with brown hair brushed back, and steel-rimmed glasses. he wore a conservative tie, buttoned-down oxford shirt, and a dark suit beneath the white coat. a stethoscope was draped around his neck. he held a clipboard and a three-ring binder. he was in his late thirties, claire judged from the lines around his eyes. his face had an open, boyish handsomeness, yet the hard set of his shoulders revealed his disapproval. nurse brockett stood like a sentinel behind him. in the light from the river, the doctor's eyes were deep blue. at five foot eight, claire could almost look him in the eye, an advantage.\n\ni'm dr. stanton. the physician in charge of this case. as claire evaluated him, he evaluated her, and he was surprised. she was attractive. a professional woman who paid attention to herself. he appreciated that. she wore red lipstick. her clothes, clearly designed to be comfortable for her work, nonetheless showed off her figure. claire understood his look and gave him time to indulge it. she needed dr. stanton, because now her narrative had two protagonists: the man dying on the bed, and this doctor, who might, or might not, save his life.\n\nwould you kindly step outside? he said.\n\nhappy to. as she followed him into the hallway, she sensed reese studying them. dr. stanton walked with a certain insouciance, or maybe simply absolute confidence. of course the confidence could be a veneer forced upon him by his position. whichever, claire found it stirring. the bottom of his white coat flicked backward with each step. he turned to her when they were several yards down the hall. dr. rivers told me you'd be working here today. dr. rivers was the director of the hospital. he was the one who'd contacted her editor about the story, following up on a casual conversation they'd had over lunch at one of their clubs. frankly it wasn't my idea to invite you, but he's the one in charge. we don't have time for you, and we won't be making allowances for you. i'd advise you to stay out of our way. good. i'm hoping to stay out of your way, too. i'm hoping you'll forget about me completely.\n\nfrowning, james stanton appeared at a loss for a response. nothing like agreement to diffuse an argument, claire had learned long ago. by necessity, she was an expert in the manipulation of her assigned subjects. stanton stared at her, and she stared back.\n\nmaybe you should tell me what you're dealing with here. so i can work harder at staying out of your way, claire added with a flirtatious touch of irony.\n\nher tone surprised him, too. for one instant, he allowed this woman to take him away from the morning's pressures and responsibilities . . . to a vacation at the seashore, a hotel room filled with sunlight. he confronted her naked body on the bed.\n\nstop. she'd made a request for information. what was he dealing with? he couldn't easily explain the issues to an outsider. here at the institute, the medication had been tested only on mice, never on a human. worldwide, the medication had been tested on only a half-dozen humans. for a variety of reasons, none had survived. nothing about the medication was established except its unpredictability. educated guesswork alone would provide stanton with the proper dosage for the injections. edward reese might have an allergic reaction and die the moment stanton gave him the first shot. an undiscovered impurity in this batch of the drug could kill him. yet the patient was on the verge of death anyway. most likely he would be dead within hours. there was also a chance that the medication would work. in that case, james stanton and his team would save edward reese's life.\n\nall this he was dealing with. to claire shipley he said only, the patient will die without radical intervention. that's what makes him a suitable candidate for this experiment.\n\nclaire detected the emotions held in check beneath stanton's professional demeanor. she made herself sound sympathetic. i understand, doctor. tell me about the medication.\n\nto stanton, the potential power of the medication was staggering. its origins, however, were preposterous. what about it? his tone was harsher than he'd intended.\n\nclaire heard his defensiveness, and it alerted her: here was a place where she could penetrate his inner life, his doubts, fears, and hopes. everything. what it is. where it's made. how it's made. she asked a string of questions to keep him engaged, to develop a common ground between them.\n\nwe make it in the laboratory downstairs.\n\ni'd like to photograph the lab later.\n\nnot possible. his refusal was automatic. he wouldn't let an outsider get too close.\n\nthink about it. keep the conversation moving forward, don't stop to recognize rejection. what's the medication made from? when his professional colleagues heard the answer to this question, they thought he was crazed. he'd learned to confront their disapproval openly rather than retreat from it. he gave her a half smile, not exactly a friendly smile, more like a dare.\n\ngreen mold. it's made from a fluid produced by a common green mold in the same family as the mold that grows on stale bread and that's used to make roquefort cheese.\n\nsounds delicious. green-mold medicine didn't bother claire, if it worked. she saw emily's small and perfect hands folded upon her chest as claire waited for the undertaker. who had folded those delicate hands? claire herself ? she couldn't remember doing it. her own mother, who might have remembered, was dead now, too, so this was something else claire would never know.\n\ndepends on your point of view. stanton was glad she made a joke about the mold, glad she didn't try to ingratiate herself with disingenuous acceptance. after all, maybe he was crazed. recognizing the possibility steadied him. gave him perspective. in the lab, they grew the mold in milk bottles and bedpans. the drug had worked well on mice in the lab; indeed the results had been spectacular. the medication was ready for the next step. this was an experiment like any other, he reassured himself. just like any other.\n\njamie. cradling a folded towel, a young woman walked down the hall toward them. swaying on high heels, she held herself with the elegance of a movie star. her makeup was perfect. her dark hair was held back with a filigree barrette at the nape of her neck, a utilitarian style that she'd transformed into the height of fashion. beneath her unbuttoned, tan-colored lab coat, she wore a stylish skirt and a white silk blouse. claire rarely felt outdone in appearance, but this woman made her feel overweight and earthbound.\n\nwhen she reached them, stanton said, claire shipley, this is dr.\n\nlucretia stanton. our resident mycologist.\n\nclaire demanded of her memory the meaning of the word mycologist. a page in a high school science textbook came to mind. a mycologist studies mold.\n\nplease, call me tia. her tone was more youthful and friendly than claire expected from her appearance, and her appearance was the opposite of what claire would have expected from a woman who studied mold. jamie told me you were coming today. i wish i could shake hands, but as you see. she held forth the towel, and claire glimpsed a glass vial of brownish yellow powder cradled within it.\n\ntia stanton, james stanton . . . were they a couple?\n\nthat would make an intriguing twist, a modern-day version of madame and monsieur curie, the french couple who discovered radium. in her best of-course-you-can-trust-me manner, claire asked, are you two married? the female dr. stanton laughed and took a step backward, as if to escape a common accusation.\n\ntia is my sister. she's younger and much more brilliant than i am,\n\njames stanton said. she's willing to work here at the institute even though she has to put up with me. the job market for mycologists, let alone female mycologists, who want to do medical research is somewhat limited—a fact that is obviously an affront to our civilization.\n\nclaire was an only child and thus not an expert in siblings, but she thought tia looked at her brother with an unusual degree of trust and affection. glancing between them, claire saw that the two shared a familial link in their eyes and their coloring.\n\ndespite its appeal, stanton resisted the urge to continue this conversation.\n\nlet's get started. abruptly he turned away and walked into the hospital room. tia followed with the vial of brownish yellow powder. claire experienced a satisfying sense that both dr. stantons had forgotten her. at the long counter along the wall, the two had a quiet discussion and checked the information in stanton's binder.\n\nusing the rolleiflex, claire went to work. she knelt to make the two scientists look larger and more dramatic in the photos. the distinctive feature of the rolleiflex was that the viewfinder was on top, and claire held the camera close to her waist to frame the shots. nurse brockett brought them a sealed container of clear fluid. a filipino orderly wheeled in a cart of sterilized glassware. james stanton chose a beaker from the cart. double-checking the measurements, he mixed the powder and the liquid in the beaker. claire photographed every step. film is the least of our costs, so use it, her photo editor always said. better to have too much coverage than not enough, to give some choice in the layout meetings.\n\nwhile claire worked, she recalled reading in the times some months before about a new medicine made from a fluid given off by green mold . . . sitting in the garden, the pale leaves feathery on the trees, her son building a model-train village across the flagstones at her feet. yes, she'd read the article in the spring, may or june. the experimental drug was called penicillin. the drug had been discovered in the late 1920s by dr. alexander fleming, a researcher in london. although fleming published his discovery and experimented with the mold, he'd had no success developing the fluid into a viable medication. the mold was temperamental, virtually impossible to work with. few researchers saw any reason to pursue fleming's discovery. penicillin was essentially forgotten until the past few years. with the war raging in europe, physicians and military leaders were desperate to find a cure for battlefield infections. the development of sulfa drugs in the 1930s had shifted physicians' attitudes toward systemic medications, those that could be injected into the body without harming healthy tissues. researchers at oxford in england, and at columbia university here in new york, began experimenting with penicillin. according to the newspaper, penicillin was thousands of times more powerful than sulfa drugs. unlike sulfa drugs, which were made from chemical dyes and caused a range of side effects, thus far penicillin had proven to be nontoxic and without side effects. scientists theorized that it would prove to be useful against a wide range of infections, including pneumonia, scarlet fever, meningitis, syphilis, and blood poisoning. however, the necessary clinical testing hadn't yet been done. given the production problems, the times noted, penicillin might remain nothing more than a laboratory curiosity.\n\na quiet crowd gathered at the door, doctors, nurses, orderlies, and several administrators. their presence alone showed claire what was at stake here today for james stanton and lucretia stanton. a robust, gray-haired man dressed in the white uniform of a naval captain pushed his way into the room. from his sense of entitlement, not to mention the flashy uniform, claire pegged him as dr. rivers.\n\nall right, let's get going, i've got a luncheon meeting at noon. the usual way of the world, even here. rush ahead because the boss has a luncheon to get to.\n\ni trust you've checked this batch for impurities, stanton.\n\ninstead of answering the question, stanton said, dr. rivers, this is claire shipley.\n\nforgetting his schedule, dr. rivers turned gracious. he took claire's hand and patted it, holding it a second too long. his skin was puffy. she suppressed the inclination to pull her hand away. honored to meet you. i've admired your work.\n\nthank you, she replied, grateful for the recognition. if his admiration made the assignment easier, so much the better.\n\ni knew harry would send me the best. he was referring to the magazine's editor, henry luce. you have everything you need, miss shipley? mrs. shipley? he had the soft trace of a southern accent and a cultivated southern charm.\n\nmrs. claire continued to use her married name, both because she'd made her reputation with it and because it felt like a protection for her son. the stigma of divorce was bad enough; she didn't want the parents of charlie's friends to wonder if he'd been born out of wedlock.\n\nmy staff has made you welcome?\n\nextremely. james stanton was the one she had to work with, so she positioned herself on his side. they've been most accommodating. in every way. especially dr. james stanton.\n\ngood. stanton, give mrs. shipley every consideration, would you?\n\ni have, sir, and i will. she heard the edge in stanton's voice. she didn't dare glance at him, for fear she would smile and give the game away.\n\ndr. rivers glanced around the room. you're alone here, mrs. shipley?\n\nclaire knew what this question meant: no man here with you, mrs.\n\nshipley? no man to be in charge of everything? after years of experience, the question annoyed her only a little. she didn't need to fight any personal or societal battles with him or anyone. she only needed to get the story. quite alone, dr. rivers.\n\nand you can manage?\n\nyes, i can manage.\n\ngood for you. he play-punched the air with approval. okay, stanton, let's go. i've got three minutes.\n\ndr. stanton ignored his boss's injunction to hurry. he stood at the porcelain sink at the end of the counter and slowly washed his hands. nurse brockett held a clean towel for him. he dried his hands methodically. with care, he filled a syringe with liquid penicillin measured to a precise amount.\n\nthirty-five thousand units, he said to tia, who nodded and made a note of it in the binder. the dosing was extrapolated from what they'd been giving the experimental mice. a mouse weighed x and was cured with dose y. this human subject weighed a and therefore needed dose b. a simple algebraic equation. he tried to maintain this level of detachment, to keep at bay the other variables vying for his attention by the hundreds. the leap between a mouse and a human suddenly became staggering. yet he had to move forward. holding the syringe upward, he pushed the plunger to make certain no air remained inside. he capped the needle. tia watched intently, as if poised to catch any misstep. he stoppered the beaker that held the remaining penicillin. he went to the bedside. nurse brockett followed him.\n\nedward reese appeared comatose, his head fallen to one side at an odd, twisted angle. the stench was pervasive, but stanton didn't notice. holding the syringe in his right hand, stanton put his left hand over the patient's.\n\nmr. reese, i'm dr. stanton. he took his time. stanton believed that reassurance and respect were part of the treatment process, too. everything that's happened to you in the past few hours must be a little confusing.\n\nmr. reese showed no sign of hearing him.\n\nwe've got a special medicine we want to try today. it's proven useful for the type of illness you've come down with. his voice and manner were soothing and calm. you shouldn't feel anything when i give you the shot, possibly some stinging, but that will pass. we'll be giving you this medication every four hours. all you have to do is rest and let the medicine work. someone will be with you all the time to make sure you're okay. if you need anything, just ask.\n\nmr. reese wasn't capable of asking for anything.\n\nnow i'm going to inject the medicine into a muscle in your arm. ased on his research, he chose to give the medication intramuscularly instead of through an intravenous drip.\n\nclaire positioned herself on the far side of the bed, looking across r. reese to stanton and brockett, capturing in one shot the contrast f their faces: the intense concentration of the doctor and nurse, the keletal emptiness of mr. reese, tia gripping a pencil and frowning n concentration in the background.\n\nnurse brockett pushed up the striped sleeve of the hospital own and cleaned a spot on mr. reese's upper arm with an alcohol-dampened cotton ball, adding the smarting scent of alcohol to the stench of infection. dr. stanton removed the cap from the needle and slowly injected the medication. those standing around angled to get a better view as they watched the brownish yellow fluid being pressed into mr. reese's body.\n\nwhen the injection was complete, dr. stanton withdrew the needle and placed the syringe on the metal tray nurse brockett held out to him. in the silence the syringe clattered against the metal. she placed the tray on the bedside table and wiped the injection spot with a fresh alcohol dampened cotton ball, pressing against the skin to ward off bleeding.\n\ndr. stanton stepped back. he felt suspended in time, waiting for a reaction. what he wanted was no reaction. everything should remain the same. mr. reese continued to breathe in short, shallow gasps of pain. after several minutes, nurse brockett checked mr. reese's pulse and blood pressure. she nodded to dr. stanton, then to the others. the audience relaxed into a fidgety sense of relief, the men touching their ties, the women patting their hair. everything was normal. the patient had received the medication and was still alive. nurse brockett noted the pulse and blood pressure on the chart, maintaining the usual routines.\n\nwell done, stanton, dr. rivers said as he strode out. the crowd slipped away. after a few private words with her brother, tia left. dr. stanton asked nurse brockett to put the remainder of the liquid penicillin into the refrigerator until it was needed. then he turned to claire. he was surprised by how liberated he felt, how lighthearted. he even felt a touch of pride that he'd been able to show claire shipley this accomplishment. but work pressed against him. most likely we won't see any results for several hours, mrs. shipley. probably not until tonight. perhaps you'd like to return to your office? i'll have someone telephone you later.\n\nno, thanks, claire said cheerfully. i'll wait here.\n\ni thought you would. his face softened into a diffident smile. i need to make some notes, so i'm afraid you're on your own.\n\nexactly what i like to be.\n\ni suspected as much.\n\nall at once claire liked him, his dry humor, his hidden shyness. retrieving his binder, he sat at the desk in the corner and began writing, his legs stretched out and crossed at the ankles. observing him from a distance, claire realized how attractive he was. when she took his picture, he didn't glance up.\n\nwhat now? the story had just begun, yet the action had dissipated. of course the waiting was part of the story, too, with its own rhythm, its own creeping boredom and anxiety. claire organized and numbered the rolls of film she'd exposed and outlined the captions. she loaded the cameras with fresh film, so she wouldn't be caught changing film at a crucial moment. sensing that she needed a few more shots of mr. reese at rest, she turned to him.\n\nthen she noticed the woman standing at the far side of the bed and clutching a camel-hair coat to her chest. when had she slipped in? the woman's shoulder-length straight hair, a bright, pure blond, was pushed behind her ears uncombed. her youthful skin was splotchy, her eyes swollen. she wore a blue cashmere twin set that was stretched down on the left side, as if she'd slept in it. her plaid skirt had twisted so that the zipper was halfway toward the front. her perfect pearls, glowing with a pinkish sheen, made her appearance even more bedraggled by comparison. she stared at the bed but appeared afraid to take the ten steps that would bring her to the bedside and envelop her in the reek of infection.\n\nthe patient's wife. she had to be.\n\nclaire's renowned colleague robert capa said that if you didn't take sides as a photographer, you were nothing but a voyeur. claire knew capa, had talked to him for hours over drinks, questioning him about his experiences. he'd forthrightly said that he'd be happy to continue their conversations in a hotel room, but although claire didn't oppose an occasional (or more than occasional) fling, she avoided men who were reputed to ask every woman who came along. claire appreciated the perhaps naive pleasure of feeling special. instead claire made capa her friend and learned what she could from him.\n\nnow, following his precepts, she took this woman's side and photographed her staring at the bed, capturing her pathos and her tragedy.\n\napproaching her afterward, claire moved slowly, trying not to startle her. mrs. reese?\n\nlike someone sleepwalking, the woman turned toward claire. she nodded.\n\nmy name is claire shipley.\n\npatsy reese. she held out her hand with instinctive courtesy. her palm was overwarm and damp. nevertheless claire shook it firmly. i'm a photographer with life magazine. claire paused to let the name sink in. life was wildly popular, the most popular magazine in the country, defining and reporting on everything that was newsworthy and exciting. we're doing a photo essay on penicillin, the medicine they're giving your husband. we're hoping other people will learn about the drug and be helped by it.\n\nthis was exaggerating the truth, but claire had to get mrs. reese's permission to do the story. without her permission, the story would end here. you can trust me. this was the message underlying claire's every professional interchange. she sensed that someone from mrs. reese's background, park avenue and pearls, would be best influenced by an appeal to charity.\n\ndo you mind if i follow your husband's story?\n\nmrs. reese looked confused. i don't know.\n\ndr. rivers, the director of the hospital, thought the testing should be documented. how quickly she called upon the support of a man she hadn't liked. claire despised this part of her job.\n\ndr. rivers was the man wearing the uniform? patsy reese asked.\n\nyes. would you be willing to sign a permission form? claire pressed. you can change your mind later. theoretically this was true, although in claire's experience people seldom felt emboldened or entitled to retract a signature on a document. there's no problem with changing your mind later.\n\npatsy looked as if she couldn't wrap her mind around the option laid before her. she concentrated on it, struggling to pin it down. i guess it's okay.\n\nthank you. from a zippered compartment in her camera bag, claire retrieved the permission form. placing her coat on the back of a chair, using the coat as a table, patsy signed the form without reading it.\n\nagain, thank you. well, that crucial task was easier than claire had expected.\n\ned and i read your magazine. patsy spoke with an extreme politeness, as if she were courting claire instead of the other way around.\n\nwe enjoy it.\n\nthat's kind of you to say.\n\ni remember when life first came out. her voice turned wistful. ed brought home a copy. we were the only family on our elevator bank to have one. that first issue, november 23, 1936, just over five years ago, was famous for selling out within hours. our neighbors came over to see it.\n\npatsy was filling time, claire realized. reaching for any available triviality before she had to confront her husband on the bed. that must have been fun, claire said soothingly.\n\nit was. i made popcorn and we sat around the living room taking turns looking at it. suddenly patsy grasped claire's hand and pressed her fingernails hard into claire's palm. claire steeled herself and didn't move. claire? your name is claire?\n\nyes.\n\nmay i ask you a question?\n\nof course.\n\npatsy glanced at dr. stanton, engrossed in work at the desk. not here. she searched the room for a safe haven. by the windows. she dropped claire's hand and crossed the room, claire following. when they reached the windows, patsy leaned toward claire and whispered, what did you say about the medicine they're giving my husband? what did you call it?\n\npenicillin.\n\nwhat's that? she challenged claire, as if claire, not the medical staff, were responsible for it. i never heard of that. at presbyterian hospital, they wouldn't tell me anything. only that they wanted to try a new medicine, and they didn't have enough of it there so they had to bring him here. as if i didn't have a right to know anything else. claire said, i'm sorry. and she was, terribly sorry, for this unfortunate young woman.\n\nwhen they asked me if it was all right to bring him here and to give him the medicine, i had to say yes. what else could i say? you're right, you couldn't say anything else.\n\nthey wouldn't even let me get into the ambulance with him. i had to search for a taxi. what if something happened to him while i was caught in traffic?\n\nthank goodness he arrived here safely, claire said.\n\ntell me what you know about the medicine, patsy said.\n\nnot very much. i read an article about penicillin in the times. about six months ago. that's all. claire couldn't bring herself to tell patsy reese about stale bread and roquefort cheese, and especially not about finicky mold and laboratory curiosities. you should ask the doctor. do you think he'd tell me?\n\nboth women looked at dr. stanton. he was using a ruler to plot out information on a graph. his intent concentration made him look like the smartest student in any class he'd ever attended. the resident genius. claire understood patsy's reluctance to approach him. when claire's mother, anna, was dying of cancer through increasingly tortured months, her doctors refused to share any information. the physician in charge didn't even want anna to know that she had cancer. anna demanded the truth, in a conversation that quickly turned hostile. the physicians' creed seemed to be that the fewer facts patients and their families knew about an illness, the better for everyone, especially the doctors. physicians justified their approach by claiming that patients and their families lost hope when they knew the truth.\n\npatsy sighed and turned to look out the window. she pressed her forehead against the glass. she breathed deeply, taking control of herself. her breath produced a circle of condensation on the windowpane. the reflected light was soft against her hair and cheeks. exhaustion was layered onto her face in fine lines. claire thought of italian renaissance paintings of women posed beside windows. stepping back, she took patsy's portrait in profile.\n\nthen claire followed patsy's gaze out the window. the east river was green-black and roiling. tugboats pushed barges piled with construction beams, gravel, garbage. a police boat patrolled the harbor. ferries labored across the blustery current. sunlight glinted off the steel trusses of the queensboro bridge. welfare island, with its maze of dilapidated public hospitals, seemed to shine in the winter light. the tide was coming in, rolling against the embankment, tossing the small delivery boats that plied the river. the east river wasn't a river at all, but a strait. manhattan was a coastal island, and the sea was close by, surging and unforgiving.\n\ndo you want to know what happened to ed? patsy asked.\n\nif you'd like to tell me.\n\nokay. she seemed to drift, and when she spoke again, she might have been in a trance. it started out as a scratch. not even. he was playing court tennis.\n\ncourt tennis—here was a reference that gave away this family's social standing. court tennis was a game played in the enclaves of the upper class.\n\nevery thursday at lunchtime ed plays court tennis with his brother kip. kip is a nickname for christopher. some people call him chris or even chip, which he hates, but we call him kip. her voice grew stronger, as if these meaningless details grounded her. they play at the racquet and tennis club. well, that's the only place you can play court tennis. in manhattan, i mean. when we're in tuxedo, they play at the club there. anyway, it was just a slip. he stumbled when his shoes stuck to the floor. you know how that sometimes happens, when you're racing from side to side and the floor is almost sticky from so much polishing?\n\nclaire nodded, although she didn't know, had never played court tennis or squash, had never been to the racquet and tennis club on park avenue, or visited the protected enclave of tuxedo park northwest of the city. she felt an unexpected tinge of class resentment. it wasn't even a scrape. the skin was barely broken. that's what ed said, at least. he didn't remember it when he was in the shower afterward.\n\nclaire saw emily, skipping joyfully outside their apartment building on west 111th street. she tripped on an imperfection in the sidewalk, a small edge where one slab rose above the next by a quarter inch, no more. that quarter inch killed her. emily broke her fall with her hands. she wasn't the type of child to scream and cry, but she moaned as she pushed herself up. both knees were scraped. brush burns covered her palms. but her face never touched the pavement. her face remained perfect and lovely to the end . . . the full cheeks, the wide brow, her skin so smooth and soft. the day was warm for june. emily was wearing her favorite dress, the one with smocking on the bodice. the dress was yellow with a print of green and blue merry-goround horses. emily didn't want to get blood on her dress. mommy, hold my dress, she said as they went upstairs to wash and bandage the scrapes. claire bunched the skirt and held it above emily's knees. four days later emily was dead.\n\npatsy continued, oblivious to claire's anguish. by sunday his knee was a little swollen and stiff, but then we heard about the attack on pearl harbor and he put the stiffness out of his mind. it seemed so minor compared to everything else that was going on.\n\npatsy paused, remembering that day. claire remembered, too. each morning when she woke up and turned on the radio news, she felt as if she were hearing about pearl harbor for the first time. each day, she felt a shock like the first shock. the attack on pearl harbor and the destruction of the nation's fleet were incomprehensible. pearl harbor was the first topic when you telephoned a friend or passed an acquaintance on the street. where were you, what were you doing when you heard the news, people asked obsessively, as if trying to grasp that it had actually happened. claire and her son were at home. claire was tormenting charlie by making him try on all his clothes so they could donate what he'd outgrown to greenwich house, the local settlement house, before christmas. claire had turned on the radio, to a concert by the new york philharmonic. she'd been looking forward to it. in the middle of the program, an announcer delivered the news.\n\nclaire hadn't waited for her boss to telephone her. immediately she arranged for charlie to spend the rest of the day around the corner with the family of his best friend, ben. charlie was thrilled, especially because they simply left the clothes in a pile on his bed. claire went to the office. when she arrived, she learned that mr. luce had ordered the week's issue remade, a tremendous expense because they'd already closed and were in production. trying to get an overview, mack mahoney, the photo editor, had sent photographers around the city for shots of ordinary people and their reactions.\n\nwhen mrs. roosevelt spoke to the nation in the early evening, claire was outside grand central station. i have a boy at sea on a destroyer, the first lady said in her high-pitched voice, always surprising to claire in a woman who otherwise seemed formidable. a dozen people pressed around the open doors of a checker cab parked in front of the station, the radio turned up loud. many of you all over the country have boys in the service who will now be called upon to go into action. . . . you cannot escape anxiety, you cannot escape the clutch of fear at your heart.\n\nalong forty-second street in the chill of early winter, cars and taxis pulled over and strangers gathered to listen to mrs. roosevelt. using a tripod and a long exposure in the misty darkness, claire captured a rhythm of headlights, streetlamps, and silhouetted figures bundled in coats and hats. mr. luce admired the haunting shot and ran it as a double truck, across two facing pages, in the magazine.\n\nby monday morning, patsy said, ed's knee was huge, and there were red streaks up and down his shin and his thigh and he could barely walk, and the pain was . . . she inhaled sharply, fighting back tears. claire touched her shoulder to comfort her, but patsy pulled away, biting her lower lip and clenching her hands together. she stared fixedly at the river. it happened so fast. by the time we arrived at the hospital, the infection was in his bloodstream and in his lungs and everywhere. the pain was so awful that ed asked them to amputate his leg, but they said it was too late even for that.\n\nsearching for some way to comfort her, claire asked, how old are your children?\n\nslowly affection transformed patsy's face. her clenched hands relaxed. claire wondered how she herself looked when she talked about emily and charlie, wondered if she revealed the same combination of joy and love that patsy now showed.\n\nsally is eleven and ned is nine. sally goes to spence and ned goes to collegiate, she added, replying to a standard question, heard even when it wasn't asked.\n\ni'd like to meet them. take their picture.\n\nfor the magazine?\n\nyes.\n\nthank you. i'd like that. i'm hoping they can visit ed tomorrow.\n\nshe glanced at her husband in confusion. if he's not busy with the doctors, i mean.\n\nif he's not dead, claire assumed patsy must be thinking.\n\nmaybe when the children are here, i'll ask the doctor about the medicine. maybe he'll explain it to them. they're only children, after all. we can say it's a science lesson.\n\nthat sounds like a good idea.\n\npatsy gave claire a grateful smile, as if they were two mothers at the playground plotting a treat that was supposed to be for their children but was actually for the grown-ups.\n\npatsy swayed, gripping the windowsill to steady herself.\n\nare you okay, mrs. reese?\n\ni'm a little dizzy. i haven't been sleeping or eating.\n\nclaire gestured toward the sofa. the doctor said he won't know anything for several hours. you should lie down.\n\nyes. retrieving her coat, patsy made her way to the leather sofa. claire followed, careful not to touch her but close enough to help if she stumbled. patsy shaped her coat into a pillow, unfolded the tartan blanket draped across the sofa's armrest to cover her legs, and settled herself on her side. she closed her eyes. a lock of hair fell across her cheek. claire pretended to busy herself with the equipment. after several minutes, patsy's breathing took on the steadiness of sleep. claire used the leica. although she bracketed the shot, she trusted she had what she wanted on the first try: the entire scene a blur except for patsy's now-innocent, sleeping face.\n\nedward r. reese jr. received the first injection of 35,000 units of penicillin at 12:04 pm, when his fever registered 105.9. he received the second injection at 4:00 pm, when his fever was 105.7. claire confirmed these details when she reviewed the chart during one of nurse brockett's breaks. his breathing was still a harsh, tortured moan.\n\nat 6:00 pm, nurse brockett ordered a junior nurse to escort patsy reese, who'd woken, to the dining room for dinner. an orderly brought dinner on a tray for dr. stanton and came back with a tray for claire, an unexpected gift. she looked at stanton, expecting him to ask her to join him, but he reviewed his notes while eating. generally she shared meals with the subjects of her stories, but in this case claire decided not to press her position by inviting herself to join him.\n\nat 8:00 pm, at the third injection, mr. reese's fever registered 105.8. stanton was troubled when nurse brockett told him this. she also gave him a report on the latest blood tests. the concentration of bacteria was down, but only slightly. tia stanton had rejoined them, accompanied by a colleague, a slight, white-haired british man whom she called david. the stantons didn't take the time to introduce david to claire.\n\ndo you think we should raise the dose? dr. stanton asked them. hard to say, david said. we don't know why he isn't responding. in our experiments, the mice responded almost immediately.\n\nwe need to keep our long-term treatment options open, too, tia said.\n\ndespite all that was at stake, they gave their opinions matter-offactly. claire was impressed.\n\nseveral high doses short-term might be better than sustained doses long-term, stanton said. he, too, appreciated the attitude of his colleagues. they kept him steady. there was no room for overt emotion within the confines of the experiment. there would be time, too much time most likely, for emotion afterward.\n\nit's a possibility, said tia. we'll design the protocols to test the hypothesis in mice. she noted it on her clipboard.\n\nstanton thought for a long moment, considering the options. the staff waited on his decision, but he took his time. impatience was an enemy. he had to keep his mind clear, thinking ahead to the next patient and the next. i'll continue with 35,000 units every four hours. we'll use higher doses on the next patient. next time, i'll also use a double dose for the first injection.\n\nthe mice will try that idea, as well, david said.\n\nhad they already given up on edward reese? claire wondered.\n\ntheir attitude was part of the story, too, the professionalism reflected in the steadfast expressions and straight postures, which she duly captured on film.\n\ntia and david left. after writing his notes, stanton gave claire an appraising glance. as attractive as she was, he wasn't in the mood for small talk or flirtation. he retrieved a back issue of the journal of biological chemistry. might as well use the empty hours between injections to catch up on his journal reading. he didn't want to leave the room for any length of time until he had a clear understanding of the outcome of the experiment.\n\nmidnight. the fourth injection. protect us now and at the hour of our death, the prayer came to claire's mind unbidden. patsy dozed in one of the big leather chairs. nurse brockett took mr. reese's temperature.102.4.\n\nthe fever was down, dramatically. stanton steeled himself to a pretense of calm impassivity. take the temperature again, would you, nurse brockett.\n\nyes, sir. she looked as if she doubted it herself. afterward, she went into the hall, where the light was brighter, to read it. claire took a shot looking through the darkened doorframe, the hospital bed a shadowy presence on the left, nurse brockett in full light in the hall beyond as she read the thermometer. it was a design that reminded claire of dutch paintings: women glimpsed through doorways. claire was risking handheld long exposures because she didn't think dr. stanton would take well to flashbulbs going off near his patient or to the maneuvering of the tripod. she prided herself on being able to remain absolutely still for a half second or even more to secure night shots without intrusive equipment. the photo-lab staff would push the film during development.\n\nclaire glanced up: stanton was watching her. unexpectedly, she felt self-conscious, sensitive to his opinion of her.\n\nrejoining them, nurse brockett repeated, 102.4.\n\nkindly draw blood for a slide, nurse brockett. make no conclusions yet, stanton cautioned himself.\n\nyes, sir. she followed his instructions, taking a small amount of blood from mr. reese's left index finger. stanton smeared the blood on a slide and stained it. when it was dry, he examined it through the binocular microscope on the counter. he made notes on what he saw. even now, he didn't let himself make a definitive conclusion.mrs. shipley, take a look?\n\nhe beckoned to her, suddenly eager to share his work. he didn't tell her what to do. he assumed she knew.\n\nclaire hadn't looked through a microscope since she took a required biology course as a college freshman. she didn't want to disappoint the doctor or embarrass herself by making a mistake. the eyepiece was a jab of cold metal against her skin. she decided that the large black knob on the side must be the focus, and she turned it. he stood beside her, observing. his close physical presence stirred her.\n\nyou're looking for colonies of staphylococci. staphylo means 'grapes' in greek, and that's what they look like. round and clumped together, like a bunch of grapes.\n\ngradually dark shapes came into view, small, clustered circles like grapes, harmless-looking shapes that could make a thirty-seven-yearold man, and a three-year-old girl, die.\n\ni see two groups.\n\ni found three, but even so, very few. he turned to nurse brockett. well, i think we're finally making some progress. all at once he felt exuberant, as if pure energy flowed through him. his years of effort suddenly became worthwhile. when claire raised her camera to capture the joy on his face, she sensed that his defenses had dissolved and she was sharing his thoughts.\n\npatsy reese slept on. stanton decided not to wake her. let her\n\ncatch up on her sleep. good news is welcome anytime it arrives. hi, everybody. a young doctor bounded into the room with the boisterous demeanor of a man who's just gotten out of bed, had three cups of coffee, and can't wait to start the day. dr. lind said the name embroidered on his white coat. he was blond and had the big, pudgy appearance of a college football player who's no longer getting enough exercise. you okay, boss? he asked stanton. you look a little . . . off. the fever's down and he doesn't know what to do next, nurse brockett said smugly, as if she'd known all along that the medication would work. she prepared to turn her authority over to the night nurse, a pert middle-aged woman who looked like a puritan and who rapped her fingers on the counter impatiently as nurse brockett reviewed several dozen details.\n\nwe're not ready to break out the champagne yet, stanton said, but things are going well. better than i expected. sit down, lind, and i'll brief you. mrs. shipley, he said with resigned forbearance, dr. lind is covering for the night. the patient's condition has stabilized, and i'm going to get some sleep.\n\nat least he would try to get some sleep; he felt so jazzed up he doubted he'd be able to. as a resident physician at the institute, he was required to live at the hospital, which was both good and bad on nights like these: good because his bedroom was nearby, bad because he could have used a little distance, a quiet walk home to gather his thoughts.\n\ni suggest you do the same, he said.\n\nclaire saw no reason to insist on working all night if the physician in charge, her story's co-protagonist, felt confident enough to go to bed.\n\nyou may come back tomorrow. around noon, shall we say?\n\nthat sounds a little late. claire challenged him because presumably he would expect it, while thinking to herself, good, i'll be able to walk charlie to school and drop off the film at the lab.\n\nno visitors in the morning, hospital rule. the patients have to be bathed and the rooms cleaned. dr. rivers made an exception for you this morning. i'll tell the guard at the gate to let you in at 11:45. he felt unexpectedly pleased at the prospect of having her around tomorrow.\n\ngood night, mrs. shipley.\n\ngood night, she replied, putting on a bright tone.\n\non her way out, she captured the two doctors reviewing the chart, their faces drawn together in concentration. the angle of the light, a slanting wedge from the desk lamp, emphasized the darkness around them.
'aftershocks' tells of a reckoning with the self — and with memory\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption simon & schuster simon & schuster\n\nnadia owusu has lived many lives.\n\nshe's been the privileged child of a un agency employee, ferried to school and back by chauffeurs while civil wars brewed outside walled compounds guarded by young men, where women called house girls cleaned and cooked for expats.\n\nshe's been a world traveler, experiencing life in tanzania, england, italy, ethiopia, uganda, and finally the united states, all before she turned 20.\n\nshe's witnessed and experienced the aftershocks of colonialism in several nations.\n\nshe's been orphaned by a mother who left by choice, a father dying, another mother trying and failing to give her the love and safety that she needed.\n\nshe's mothered her siblings as best she could. she's been a student at several international schools, a boarding school, later college and graduate school. she's been a server, a serial job applicant, a writer; she's been a daughter, an orphan, a girlfriend, a friend, a lover, a sibling.\n\nshe is a black woman with a ghanaian father and an armenian american mother, her looks questioned everywhere, by everyone, seemingly no matter the land she's lived on. her speech patterns have shifted to fit her surroundings — to protect herself or to feel more at home.\n\nshe is a woman with many homes and none, a woman who learned to allow madness in so that she could finally begin to acknowledge the pain of it all and learn that home is within her, in all her lives, in the fault lines and fractures between them.\n\nnadia owusu's first full-length book, aftershocks, is about all of these parts of what is her single, complex life. it is a nonlinear memoir which owusu organizes around a central metaphor: earthquakes. it opens with the day that her birth mother, who had already left nadia, her sister yasmeen, and their father osei some years before, came to rome — where they were living at the time — for a brief visit. the same day, an earthquake in armenia destroyed the city of spitak. owusu had never been to armenia; her mother's family hadn't either, not for generations, her ancestors having been exiled from turkey during the armenian genocide. still, the child owusu made the link, and when a teacher asked her what was wrong, she could not explain:\n\nhow do i tell her about the trembling that leads to ripping, then to violent rupture; to whole lives and whole cities disintegrating; to piles and piles of rubble; to displacement and exile? how do i tell her that a day that begins with pancakes for breakfast can end in disaster; that, in an instant, an earthquake or a mother can arrive and change everything?\n\nin the following sections, owusu moves back and forth through several main fault lines that she closely examines from varying angles. one involves her stepmother telling owusu that her father died of aids rather than the brain cancer owusu knew he had. another involves the many ways in which she was racialized in the nations she lived in and made to feel foreign even in places she was taught to believe were home. a third examines her mothers, the long and complicated relationship with each.\n\nthere are other threads, or cracks in the earth of her life, that she weaves in and out of these narratives, so that at times there is a sense that we are wandering away from the main question a chapter opened with. owusu always brings us back just on time, so that what seems at first like free association is revealed, instead, as potent context. the effect ties directly into another of owusu's main themes: storytelling is how we understand ourselves, others, and the worlds we live in, and any story that is too simple or that holds no contradictions is suspect, for that means it lacks the nuance necessary for a deeper understanding. in her capable writing, stories become nearly tangible objects she holds to the light, turns over and over, eager to discover a never before glimpsed sparkle or a surprising divot in their familiar shapes.\n\none of the recurring sections, the blue chair, is a stirring exploration of owusu succumbing to — and also embracing — the kind of breakdown that might sound terrifying to some but alluring, even necessary, to others. she spent a week almost exclusively in a blue rocking chair she'd found on the street and lugged up to her apartment in chinatown, new york. it reminded her of her father — and it became a haven. she read, and she wailed, and she ate a little and drank a lot of alcohol during that week. she became a body that needed only some, very particular things that she allowed herself, especially as her mind was turning over all that she no longer had, the certainties and homes and lands and languages and parents she had lost. owusu's depiction of this breakdown is not about redemption or even strictly about healing. it's instead about a reckoning with the self, with memory, with the stories that she thought could keep her safe.\n\nstories cannot keep us safe, but they can do other things. a story is a flashlight and a weapon, owusu reminds us. i write myself into other people's earthquakes. i borrow pieces of their pain and store them in my body. sometimes, i call those pieces compassion. sometimes i call them desecration.

top senate democrat says agreement is close over coronavirus financial package\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption senate television via ap senate television via ap\n\nupdated at 7:20 a.m. et\n\nafter a tense day on the senate floor that included leaders trading barbs over who is to blame for failing to advance a new coronavirus response bill, the top senate democrat said late monday night that he was very, very close to an agreement with the white house on a deal for a third wave of emergency funding that could go well past $1 trillion.\n\nthere are still a few little differences. neither of us think they are in any way going to get in the way of a final agreement. secretary mnuchin called the president, we told him we are very, very close to an agreement and he seemed very happy with that, senate minority leader chuck schumer told reporters shortly before midnight.\n\nschumer met with treasury secretary steven mnuchin four times monday, including a meeting shortly after 8 p.m., a schumer spokesman had said.\n\nthe top senate democrat said that there was a desire to get things settled on tuesday. i think the american people want it done as quickly as possible, schumer added, noting that he was pleased with where talks stood on democratic priorities related to support for workers and hospitals.\n\nit was not clear overnight where senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., stood on a possible deal between democrats and the white house.\n\nmcconnell set up yet another procedural vote to move forward on the legislation. two previous attempts failed to advance the bill – one on sunday and again monday when democrats largely held together to try to force more changes to the bill. if there is an agreement the senate could vote earlier.\n\nmcconnell has blamed democrats for delaying progress on the bill even as democrats continued to negotiate with white house officials.\n\nmcconnell called for the senate to support a gop-drafted bill that includes expanded unemployment insurance, aid for small businesses and loans for large corporations, among other proposals.\n\nthe american people have had enough of this nonsense. they're wondering where we are. they're looking to us to solve this problem, mcconnell said.\n\ndemocrats said the measure didn't go far enough for worker protections and too far for aid to major industries, and had insufficient oversight for the assistance fund based at the treasury department for impacted industries.\n\nlate monday, house democrats introduced their counter proposal to the senate. house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., stressed that any final proposal should protect worker pay and benefits and not ceo pay, stock buybacks or layoffs.\n\na house democratic aide said the package was valued at $2.5 trillion and focused on boosting healthcare access, unemployment insurance, the healthcare industry and payments to workers, among other issues. pelosi has not said whether the house would move forward with its proposal. the chamber could take up the senate bill if more changes are made to it that satisfy democrats' concerns.\n\npresident trump said monday evening that he hoped lawmakers would make a breakthrough.\n\ni think the democrats want a deal and i think we want a deal. so it would be very foolish if they didn't make a deal. the american public is demanding a deal, he said.\n\nwhile there has been general consensus on key provisions of the package, including small-business loan guarantees and direct cash payments, democrats want more conditions placed on funds to assist large corporations in order to ensure, for instance, that the money goes to protect workers' jobs and not stock buybacks to benefit shareholders.\n\ndemocrats are also asking for more money for hospitals and more generous unemployment benefits for laid-off workers — proposals that, if included, would balloon the cost of the package even more.\n\nrepublicans criticized democrats for last-minute demands that they see as not critical to the crisis at hand, such as new collective bargaining powers for unions, increased fuel emissions standards for airlines and expanded wind and solar tax credits.\n\nmcconnell argued that democrats were turning the bill into a left-wing episode of supermarket sweep.\n\nschumer told reporters early monday morning that democrats see this bill as their best opportunity to provide the most help. this bill is going to affect this country and the lives of americans not just for the next few days, but in the next few months and years — so we have to make sure it is good, he said.\n\nwhile tensions between mcconnell and schumer are high, mnuchin has been an active participant in the negotiations, talking and meeting with democrats all day sunday and into the early monday morning hours.\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., is going to introduce a counterproposal in the house on monday afternoon. it's unclear whether pelosi's move is a pressure tactic on the senate to reach a deal or a firm commitment to move a house bill. moving forward on competing legislation could delay negotiations considerably.\n\nhouse majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., previously announced that he would not reconvene lawmakers back in washington until there was critical legislation to vote for in response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nas more lawmakers test positive for the virus and even more self-quarantine because of possible exposure, congress itself is racing a clock to pass a bill and likely recess for at least a few weeks. while some lawmakers continue to call for allowing remote voting in the house and senate, both pelosi and mcconnell remain resistant to the idea, which has never been done before, would require votes to change the rules of both chambers and could face constitutional challenges.\n\nin an afternoon speech, pelosi encouraged the senate to include ideas from the house democrats' proposal, which is called the take responsibility for workers and families act. it focuses on direct payments to americans, paid leave for workers and child tax credits, among other efforts, she said.\n\nwe urge the senate to move closer to the values in the take responsibility for workers and families act, she said. we must be bold and forward looking in our thinking ... swift and evidence based in our actions, and we must be prayerful.

'it's just a shame': trump voters react to insurrection at u.s. capitol\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption tovia smith/npr tovia smith/npr\n\nfor some, it was the final straw. the u.s. capitol riots, and the president's behavior both before and after, has soured some of trump's supporters.\n\nfor others, it has only ratcheted up their zealous devotion to the president, and their deep frustration with an election they falsely believe was rigged.\n\ncarol jones, 74, from franklin, tenn., is among those regretting her support for trump since wednesday's insurrection, when thousands of pro-trump protesters stormed the capitol building.\n\nthe protests were timed to coincide with congress' certification of the electoral college votes and aimed at pressuring republican lawmakers into supporting trump's effort to overturn biden's electoral victory. the violent confrontations ended in a lockdown, with four casualties and dozens of arrests.\n\nhe started the whole thing. it's just plain as the nose on your face, jones said. i don't understand it other than a humongous ego that he had a need to satisfy. it's like he has a mental condition he needs to get a handle on. it's just sad.\n\nrandy dittmer, from liberty, mo., is fed up with trump, too. the 62-year-old retired schoolteacher said he watched the rioting on tv in disbelief that it was happening in the united states.\n\nit was hard to watch, he said. i lay the blame straight on the president.\n\nbrenda baer, a nurse in rural northwest pennsylvania, was more circumspect. the riots, she said, were not okay, and there has to be some accountability for trump.\n\nhe's done a lot of good things, she said. but i do think he needs to be a little more ... responsible and needs to think a little bit more before he speaks.\n\ndylan costello, 25, and bobby manson, 28, both construction workers from quincy, mass., see it differently. they're still proud trump supporters, with a trump hat, trump face mask and trump stickers on their truck.\n\nwe have some trump flags here, too, but i can't pull it out because it has some swears on it, manson said with a chuckle. i have a lot of respect for trump, and i always will.\n\nbut the trump supporters who broke into and ransacked the capitol building, they say, are a different story.\n\nthey should have never done that, manson said. it's like making trump look like a bad person, and he's really not. they made him look bad.\n\nmanson credits trump for eventually tweeting that people should leave the capitol and go home, though costello is quick to concede that trump's tweets and video message after his speech to the crowd on wednesday were also egging rioters on.\n\nhe tried to play both sides, costello said. he played one side, and then the other when everything went down.\n\nboth manson and costello say they sympathize with the frustration of pro-trump extremists who breached the capitol. they too, believe the president's baseless claims that the nov. 3 election was rigged and that president-elect joe biden won because of widespread voter fraud.\n\ntrump was ahead, and then all of a sudden he went down, costello said. most definitely, there was something going on, but we're never going to find out what actually happened.\n\nit was fraud, said manson. 100% fraud.\n\nanother trump supporter, jeffrey stroehmann, also believes trump's unfounded portrayal of an election rife with corruption, even though courts, state election officials and many leading republicans have rejected those claims.\n\nhe travelled from rural central pennsylvania to washington and participated in the protests. his intention, he said, was to march peacefully.\n\nbut once there, when listening to trump in the morning, and later, surrounded by the angry mob, stroehmann said he was surprised to find that he, too, was feeling his own rage boiling over.\n\nthere i was going to a different level of protest he said.\n\ni don't feel like i was doing anything wrong, he added. as the crowd got increasingly agitated, he said, people's pent up frustrations were starting to pour out.\n\nstroehmann concedes the violence likely harmed their cause. but, he warns, lawmakers who dismiss trump's supporters do so at their own peril.\n\ni think the elected officials need to stop minimizing the concerns of the millions of people who voted for donald trump, he said. donald trump is just the mouthpiece for what we are feeling. don't look at it as him inciting us. look at it as him being the person who is vocalizing our frustrations and concerns.\n\ngabriel king, a trump supporter who installs floors in colorado springs, also hopes the siege of the capitol building will serve as a wake-up call to congress.\n\nit's hard to see it happening, king concedes. but on the other hand, i'm tired of being bullied by the scum in d.c. ... they're just criminal trash that lie about everything. thank god someone finally did something. i'm actually happy about it.\n\nhe's among the many trump supporters who reject the widespread accusations that the president bears some of the responsibility for inciting the violence.\n\nat no time did he say smash windows and get violent, stroehmann said.\n\nhe blames outside agitators. the violent rioters at the capitol, he said, were not your down-home trump supporters.\n\nother trump supporters are promoting a conspiracy theory that it was actually left-wing activists, masquerading as trump supporters, just to make trump look bad.\n\nit was antifa and blm stealing the trump flags and playing like they were trump people, said bonnie metter, a retired irs worker from fresno, calif. it was disgusting.\n\nher friend jane ochs, 78, agrees. it's just a shame that they had to do this to trump. he's been maligned for four years now. the man doesn't deserve it.\n\nsylvia cervantes from laredo, texas, is equally supportive of trump, but is content to leave the judgement of his sins to god, she said.\n\nshe urged fellow trump supporters to stop being crazy, and to accept that trump lost. it's time to move on, she said.
torture at issue during pre-trial hearing at guantanamo\n\ntestifying publicly for the first time this week in guantanamo bay, cuba, one of the psychologists who designed the cia's torture program said he now believes the torture techniques went too far.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nsome stunning testimony this week at the u.s. military court in guantanamo bay, cuba. a psychologist who helped develop the cia's torture program for accused terrorists was on the stand at a pretrial hearing in the case against five men charged in the september 11, 2001 terror attacks.\n\nsacha pfeiffer of npr's investigations team has been covering the trial. she returned last night from guantanamo. a warning to our listeners, we will be talking about some disturbing details. sacha, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nsacha pfeiffer, byline: thanks for having me, scott.\n\nsimon: and remind us please who this psychologist is.\n\npfeiffer: he is a retired air force psychologist named james mitchell. and to help the cia after 9/11, mitchell took a military program that teaches people to cope with torture. and he reverse-engineered it, meaning he trained cia interrogators to use those methods against prisoners to get them to answer questions, methods like putting people in painful stress positions and smashing them against walls. in fact, mitchell himself personally waterboarded khalid sheikh mohammed, the alleged 9/11 mastermind.\n\nsimon: and why was he on the stand this week?\n\npfeiffer: because defense lawyers for the 9/11 defendants want the judge to throw out all the statements they made to the fbi on grounds that are tainted by torture. and the lawyers want to use mitchell's testimony to help support their argument. now, i had assumed much of his testimony would be censored because almost anything related to torture used to be top secret. and in guantanamo's courtroom, reporters sit in a spectator gallery behind a glass wall. and we listen to what's happening on a 40-second delay. if anything is said the government doesn't want us to hear, the sound is cut off, and white noise is piped in. so i expected that cut off would be triggered a lot when mitchell was on the stand.\n\nsimon: but i gather from your reporting this past week, whatever they cut off, he also said a lot of startling things.\n\npfeiffer: he really did. you know, he described some torture techniques in a fair amount of detail, like putting a broomstick behind someone's knees and pushing them backward until their shoulders were touching the floor and their knees were at risk of getting dislocated or walling, which he described as putting a collar around someone's neck and, in his words, bouncing them against a wall. one of the guantanamo prisoners got a traumatic brain injury from being walled. that's according to the prisoners' lawyers.\n\nsimon: sacha, i have to ask, what was what was mitchell's tone like when he described this torture?\n\npfeiffer: well, you know, this was so interesting. at first, he had a very casual, matter-of-fact way about describing his methods. in fact, he does not call it torture. he calls it coercive physical pressure. the cia called it enhanced interrogation. and mitchell had no apologies for anything he did. he even said he would do it again.\n\non his first day on the stand, he was very defiant and argumentative. he portrayed himself as an american patriot who had been trying to save our country from another attack by islamic jihadists who might even have nuclear or biological weapons. and he said the u.s. government was justified in putting extreme pressure on suspected terrorists to try to get information out of them.\n\nsimon: i understand later in the testimony his tone did change a bit.\n\npfeiffer: it did because mitchell also said he thought the caa had gone too far and verged on breaking the law. he said they were using his methods incorrectly and abusively. he described one secret overseas prison where men were chained naked to the ground in cold weather in what mitchell said look like horse stalls. and even he was uncomfortable with that, even though he helped create the torture program.\n\nmitchell also testified that one of the 9/11 defendants was subjected to excessive abuse because he'd been used as a teaching tool for cia employees learning interrogation techniques. mitchell said the man had been used as, in his words, a training prop.\n\nsimon: it's one of these times you have to note a human being turned into a training prop.\n\npfeiffer: exactly. and, you know, listening to mitchell's testimony made me think about how much the united states is still wrestling with having tortured people. now, many people think it was morally reprehensible and many others believe torture was deserved after the horrific ways so many people died on 9/11. but torture is also why the 9/11 case is still dragging on nearly 20 years after those attacks because so much evidence cannot be used at trial since it was gained through torture. and as a result, the 9/11 defendants still have not been convicted of anything, yet billions of dollars have been spent at guantanamo imprisoning them and trying to prosecute them. so whether you think it was right or wrong, torture is this enduring expensive legacy that still has consequences to this day.\n\nsimon: sacha pfeiffer of npr's investigations team, who spent the last week in guantanamo bay, cuba, thanks so much.\n\npfeiffer: you're welcome, scott. thanks for having me.\n\n(soundbite of spunkshine's and it

everyone uses singular 'they,' whether they realize it or not\n\nenlarge this image csa images/vetta/getty images csa images/vetta/getty images\n\ntalk about belated recognition. at its meeting in washington, d.c., on jan. 7, the american dialect society voted to make the 600-year-old pronoun they their word of the year for 2015. or more precisely, a particular use of that pronoun that grammarians call the singular they. this is the they that doesn't care whether it's referring to a male or female. as in if i get a call, tell them they can call me back. or did someone leave their books here?\n\nas ordinary as it is, that use of they has always been a bit disreputable — you might say it, but you wouldn't want to write it down. but now it's a pronoun whose hour has come.\n\na few months ago, the washington post style guide accepted it. and it's been welcomed by people who identify as genderqueer and who feel that he and she don't necessarily exhaust all the gender possibilities. universities allow students to select it as their personal pronoun. and so does facebook, so that your friends will get notices like wish them a happy birthday.\n\nthis use of they has been around for a long time. it shows up in shakespeare, dickens and george bernard shaw. jane austen was always saying things like everybody has their failing. but the victorian grammarians made it a matter of schoolroom dogma that one could only say everybody has his failing, with the understanding that he stood in for both sexes. as their slogan had it, the masculine embraces the feminine.\n\nnobody would ever say, 'every candidate thanked his spouse, including hillary.' when you utter 'he,' you always bring a male to mind.\n\nthat rule wasn't really discredited until the 1970s, when the second-wave feminists made the generic masculine the paradigm of sexism in language. male critics ridiculed their complaints as a libspeak tantrum and accused them of suffering from pronoun envy. but most writers now realize that the so-called gender-neutral he is anything but. nobody would ever say, every candidate thanked his spouse, including hillary. when you utter he, you always bring a male to mind.\n\nbut once the generic masculine fell out of favor, what were we going to replace it with? people weren't about to adopt a brand-new gender-neutral pronoun the way they were adopting gender-neutral job descriptions. he or she was impossibly clunky. it was time to restore singular they to respectability. and that's been happening, even in edited books and the media.\n\nbut singular they still has its critics, and they can get pretty lofty about it. one british grammarian calls it illiterate, which always strikes me as something diane would have said to sam in cheers.\n\na lot of people tell you it sets their teeth on edge, but my guess is that they're not listening to themselves very attentively. everyone uses singular they, whether they realize it or not. in an engaging recent book called between you & me, the new yorker's self-designated comma queen mary norris says that that use of they is just wrong. but flip back a few pages and you find her writing nobody wanted to think they were not essential. if that sentence got by a new yorker copy editor in her own book on grammar, what hope is there for anybody else? if you insist on coming down on singular they, it's best to be a bit ironic about it, since you're almost certainly going to be making a hypocrite of yourself before the day is out.\n\nthe only problem with singular they is that some people still think there is one. but that's reason enough for most grammar guides to advise their readers to write around it. it's what i think of as the don't make trouble theory of english usage.\n\nthe chicago manual of style provides nine different strategies for achieving gender-neutrality without having to resort to using they — change the subject to a plural, repeat the noun and so on. that can be prudent. even when you know your sentence is fine as it is, you don't want to make some pedant's morning. but if i could have back all the time i've wasted writing my way around a perfectly grammatical singular they, i could have added another book or two to my name.\n\neverybody seems certain that singular they will ultimately prevail, even the grammarians who disapprove of it. a lot of younger writers don't think twice about using it, and the rest tend to think of it as a pretty venial sin — the grammatical equivalent of wearing white after labor day.\n\nbut our pronoun controversies aren't going to subside any time soon. english is never going to have a one-size-fits-all pronoun the way chinese and finnish do. we've spent the last few hundred years struggling to get our unwieldy pronoun system to line up with our genders, and that was when everybody thought there were only two of them.\n\nnow some genderqueer people are taking they into new grammatical territory, using it for alternative genders exactly the way you'd use a personal pronoun like he or she. so you could say, pat shrugged their shoulders, or ronnie bit off more than they could chew. that's the usage that the american dialect society was focusing on when they made they their word of the year. it takes quite a bit of getting used to, and it's launched a whole new conversation. but that's the advantage of having a messy pronoun system like ours — in every era we have to thrash things over again.
'no scrubs' in the white house: steyer gets a boost from tlc\n\nstepping into billionaire activist tom steyer's battle ready rally on friday night in las vegas felt more like walking into a really fancy, well-financed party at a club rather than a campaign event.\n\nthe industrial space was filled with strobe lights, twinkle lights, light-up plants (ok, just a lot of lights), instagram-worthy faux-grass pillars with the word tom in glowing red and blue, food, drinks, a dj and a performance by tlc, whose hits waterfalls and no scrubs kept the 500-person crowd dancing and singing. (note: steyer's campaign has said the band's appearance was arranged through a booker and isn't an endorsement.)\n\nit's not exactly common to see people waving their beer and it's the economy signs in the air as they rock out to icona pop's electro-remix of dolly parton's jolene.\n\nbut this is the campaign in las vegas.\n\nthe racially diverse crowd was made up of supporters from teenagers with their parents in tow to college students to grandparents.\n\nlynn arce says that kind of diversity meshes with steyer's messaging.\n\ni'm really energized by steyer, she said. he's for everyone. i really believe that race, along with climate, have to be the top priority, and he seems to be the candidate that is putting it first and foremost.\n\narce said she was originally nervous that steyer didn't make the debate stage earlier this week, worrying it could hurt his chances in nevada. but after watching the debate, she thinks it may have been a good thing he wasn't there.\n\nthe debate seemed vicious, arce said. i'm hoping tom just stays on message, which he seems very consistent on that and so i think things will go his way.\n\nonce tlc finished performing, steyer took the stage and emphasized his core messages of climate change (we need to rebuild america in a climate-smart way) and the economy, saying he's the only candidate who can go after president trump on the economy and win.\n\nbefore heading to the campaign's selfie line, steyer urged supporters to bring friends and family with them to caucus on saturday.\n\nthe threat we have is if we don't come together, he said. that's why nevada matters so much. nevada is the first place where we have diversity. this is the first place where you can claim you pulled together the broadest coalition that is the democratic party.\n\nif we win tomorrow, we're going to win the whole god**** thing, he said to cheers.\n\nwhile people were still partying on the dance floor, steyer left to attend a town hall of a very different vibe: one hosted by mi familia vota at a union hall for plumbers and welders. before taking questions from the smaller, primarily latino crowd, he focused on immigration and what he called a humanitarian crisis at the border. the night ended with the crowd chanting, sí se puede (roughly translating to: yes, we can or yes, it can be done).
why trade is an important issue in the presidential campaign\n\nsteve inskeep talks to dartmouth economist douglas irwin about the perceptions and realities of trade policy in the current political primary season.\n\nrenee montagne, host:\n\nof the states voting for presidential candidates today, michigan is the biggest prize. it's a state sensitive to debates over trade.\n\nsteve inskeep, host:\n\na poll shows 60 percent of michigan republicans want more trade restrictions on china, just to give one example that may help to explain why the candidates talk so much about trade.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbernie sanders: secretary clinton supported virtually every one of these disastrous trade agreements written by corporate america.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nhillary clinton: i want to make sure that i can look into the eyes of any middle-class american and say, this will help raise your wages. and i concluded i could not.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\ndonald trump: does mexico come here and build a plant in the united states? we lose a fortune with every deal we have.\n\nmontagne: hillary clinton, bernie sanders and donald trump are among those critiquing trade deals from nafta, 20 years ago, to the trans-pacific partnership now.\n\ninskeep: and douglas irwin has been following all this and more. he's a dartmouth college economist who specializes in trade policy. welcome to the program.\n\ndouglas irwin: thank you for having me.\n\ninskeep: what really is making trade such a potent issue in both parties?\n\nirwin: well, historically that's really been the case. we think back to 1992 when pat buchanan and ross perot ran on an anti-nafta platform. in 2008, barack obama ran against nafta - 2012, mitt romney raised issues with china. so trade has always been a sensitive issue in american politics because jobs are at stake.\n\ninskeep: and you say jobs are at stake. in what way is that really true? you mentioned nafta. it's more than 20 years old now. is there enough evidence to say whether free trade deals cost american jobs or add american jobs or something else?\n\nirwin: well, trade does destroy jobs in import-competing sectors, such as apparel and furniture. but so does technological change. and it also has to be pointed out that trade creates jobs in export-oriented sectors, such as aircraft and high-tech. so trade doesn't affect the number of jobs in the united states so much as it affects the composition of jobs. and unfortunately, some of those jobs are located in ohio and michigan, where heavy industry has traditionally been.\n\ninskeep: which makes sense. does it affect how much people can get paid? are there higher-paying jobs being destroyed for lower-paying jobs?\n\nirwin: actually, it's sort of the opposite. a lot of the jobs that are being destroyed in apparel and furniture were low-paying jobs. and a lot of the jobs that are being created are in aircraft and high-tech - are high-paying jobs. but still that said, wages have been flat even though total compensation is up because health care costs are taking that wedge, that bite out of people's paycheck. so people don't think they've been getting a pay increase at all.\n\ninskeep: well, tell me about something else that i think is in peoples' heads and that is part of the argument here. there's a sense that jobs may well be created. but jobs are also destroyed. people are thrown out of work. and the people who are really profiting are investors or stockholders. it may be good for the broader economy to do a trade deal. but it's really people at the top who are benefiting. is that statistically true?\n\nirwin: well, people at the top have been benefiting. but it's not so much because of trade. if you look at the people in top 1 percent in law and entertainment, financial services, it's not because of international trade so much. and we sometimes forget that consumers and, particularly, downstream industries really benefit from imports. a lot of the imports that we bring into the country are needed by our manufacturing industries as inputs into production.\n\ninskeep: for example, if we're talking about the auto manufacturing industry, which is centered in michigan. they may get auto parts out of a mexican factory, just to give one example.\n\nirwin: absolutely. and even our candy and confectionery industry depends on cheap sugar. and we have a sugar policy that keeps out cheap sugar. marco rubio from florida defends that. but we've lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in our candy and confectionery industry.\n\ninskeep: so we have a wide range of trade positions. donald trump has very loudly denounced nafta and other trade deals, has said the united states has done a terrible job of negotiating them. bernie sanders has a position on this. he's very skeptical of trade deals. hillary clinton favored the idea of the trans-pacific partnership. but does not like the reality. we could go on for some time. what is the basic difference here as you follow the different campaigns? what are the sides?\n\nirwin: well, it's very interesting. both parties have this division within them. interestingly, public opinion polls suggest that democrats support trade more than republicans. but the democratic candidates are speaking more to their union base in the party and opposing these trade agreements. meanwhile, the republicans traditionally have been, in recent decades, much more in favor of free trade. but the republican base does not support trade as much. and now you see some candidates moving in that direction as well.\n\ninskeep: wow. are you saying that on both sides the interest groups within the party are in a different place than the mass of voters within the party?\n\nirwin: well, it's a matter of degree. but it is surprising that in public opinion polls, democrats tend to support trade more than republicans, despite what you'd expect from the party leadership, which would be exactly the opposite.\n\ninskeep: professor irwin, thanks very much.\n\nirwin: you're welcome.\n\ninskeep: douglas irwin of dartmouth college, we reached him by skype.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
#mosquemetoo gives muslim women a voice about sexual misconduct at mecca\n\ntoggle caption rasoul ali/getty images\n\ndressed in a hijab and covered from head to toe, she felt something. someone — a man — had grabbed onto her butt and would not let go.\n\nthe islamic pilgrimage to mecca, saudi arabia, called hajj, was supposed to be the holiest moment of mona eltahawy's life. when she was 15, she journeyed there with her family. the magnificence of the great mosque had taken her breath away. but that man turned the trip into a nightmare.\n\ninstead of telling the authorities, the young eltahawy simply burst into tears.\n\nwho wants to talk about sexual assault at a holy place? no one would believe it, she says, recalling the encounter, which took place in 1982.\n\nin early february, eltahawy, an egyptian-american activist and journalist and the author of headscarves and hymens: why the middle east needs a sexual revolution, shared this story on twitter. it was in response to a viral facebook post by a pakistani woman who shared her own experience of being sexually assaulted at hajj. the post inspired an outpouring of similar testimonies from muslim women around the world.\n\nfor unknown reasons, the post was removed from facebook, but the conversation continued on a tweet posted by eltahawy. her tweet was shared more than 2,500 times and elicited hundreds more stories. she then suggested that women start using the hashtag #mosquemetoo to organize the discussion.\n\nsexual assault during hajj is not a new phenomenon. it's clearly happening and has been happening, but we don't know how widespread this is, says rothna begum, the women's rights researcher for the middle east and north africa for human rights watch. given the taboo nature of sexual harassment, women are probably not reporting this.\n\nthat — and the fear of stoking the islamophobia that persists in the world today. many women are worried that speaking out will give the public a reason to further blame muslims, says daisy khan, the executive director of the women's islamic initiative in spirituality and equality. the tendency is to keep it under wraps.\n\neltahawy thinks that #metoo, the movement to end sexual harassment in the workplace, has helped muslim women feel comfortable enough to open up about their abuse. people pay attention to what famous hollywood actresses do. but #metoo has to be available to all people — not those who are rich, famous and white.\n\nthat's why she started #mosquemetoo, she says. i wanted it to be a space where women can share our stories from hajj and the muslim space.\n\nhajj is one of the five pillars of islam. it requires muslims who are healthy and financially able to travel to mecca at least once in their lifetime. during this time, men and women perform a ritual called tawaf: praying while making seven circles around the kaaba, a black cubic structure in the middle of the great mosque. the kaaba is believed to have served as a sanctuary for centuries.\n\nit is during the tawaf that many women experience groping, fondling and grabbing, says eltahawy, according to the responses she's heard from women. it's very crowded. at any given moment, there are thousands of men and women [circling kaaba at one time].\n\nthe social media testimonies are unprecedented, says begum. it's exposing something that has not been talked about. it's brave of women to come forward.\n\nbut it's unclear whether there will be an impact on the authorities in saudi arabia, which is in charge of the mosque.\n\nsaudi arabia, which operates under sharia law, did just put a new law in place to address sexual harassment, says begum. created in december 2017, the law states that people who are found guilty of such behavior by the saudi authorities can be subjected to punishment, which includes flogging or imprisonment. saudi leadership has called harassment a contradiction of islamic principles.\n\naccording to fatimah baeshen, a spokesperson at the royal embassy of saudi arabia in washington, d.c., the harassment law is part of a broader set of reforms taking place in the country under a program called vision 2030, which levels the playing field and facilitates the advancements of women.\n\ngiven the increased access of saudi women into the public space, the government is proactively ensuring that along with more mobility women also feel safe, says baeshen.\n\nmuslim activists like khan hope that #mosquemetoo can trigger change. i've seen things in hajj that i am personally disturbed by, she says. measures need to be taken [to protect women]. there is no place for it.\n\nstill, a part of her fears that conservative muslim clerics may twist #mosquemetoo to women's detriment. the danger is that people could use this to try to separate men from women, which could be a disaster. we have enjoyed [praying] in the same space together for [more than 1,400 years], she says.\n\nin 2006, saudi authorities attempted to restrict women's access to the holiest part of the great mosque, but it was met with protest from various islamic groups, including khan's.\n\nislamic leaders like saba ghori see #mosquemetoo as a wakeup call. she's the board president of peaceful families project, a group that works to prevent gender-based violence in muslim families.\n\nghori says her group is striving to be part of the solution. she hopes to continually raise these issues of [sexual harassment] in the muslim community through training and education programs, cultivating support from imams and male allies, and helping the women who do speak out seek justice.\n\neltahawy has her own advice. saudi authorities should insist that the imam of the great mosque give a sermon to all muslims around the

npr poll: majority of americans believe trump encourages election interference\n\nenlarge this image marcus marritt for npr marcus marritt for npr\n\nweeks before the first votes of the 2020 presidential election, americans report a high level of concern about how secure that election will be and worry about the perils of disinformation, according to a new npr/pbs newshour/marist poll.\n\nforty-one percent of those surveyed said they believed the u.s. is not very prepared or not prepared at all to keep november's election safe and secure.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above? click here.\n\nreflecting the polarization of the trump era, two-thirds of democrats think the country isn't prepared, while 85% of republicans said they think it is.\n\nlike so many issues, americans view election security from opposite poles of the partisan divide, said lee miringoff, director of the marist college institute for public opinion, which conducted the poll.\n\npresident trump, who has often disputed the u.s. intelligence community's assessment that russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election, gets low marks from many voters on his handling of election security.\n\ndriven by democrats and independents, 56% of those surveyed think trump has not done very much or has done nothing at all to make sure there will be no future election interference — although 75% of republicans think he has done enough.\n\ni can trust [trump's] word to know that he is going to try as best as he can ... in order to stop influence from foreign countries in our elections, said first-time voter joel martin, a republican from california.\n\nmartin and other respondents were contacted by npr for follow-up interviews after they had given their initial responses to questions from marist pollsters.\n\ntrump faces an impeachment trial this month tied directly to his efforts to get ukraine to launch an investigation into one of his potential 2020 rivals, former vice president joe biden.\n\nand despite the scrutiny and criticism of his actions with respect to ukraine, trump also said in october that china should start an investigation into the bidens.\n\nremarks like those may have been on the mind of the 51% of the americans surveyed who said trump had encouraged election interference. eighty-eight percent of democrats and 51% of independents backed that assertion.\n\ni considered the attack on our electoral system to be the single biggest assault on united states sovereignty since pearl harbor, said poll participant dimitri laddis, an independent voter from new york.\n\nthe fact that the commander in chief has done nothing to reassure us that we are safe from such an attack — and the fact that he seems to be keenly aware that he benefits from outside forces having influence over our elections — is very disheartening, laddis said.\n\nalthough there is no evidence that any votes were changed by a foreign power in 2016 or 2018, almost 4 in 10 americans surveyed said they believe it is likely another country will tamper with the votes cast in 2020 in order to change the result.\n\nthe poll's results also paint a picture of a polarized electorate wary about what it reads and not fully convinced that elections are fair.\n\nin a reflection of how divided the country is, only 62% of americans said u.s. elections are fair.\n\nbarely half of democrats agree with that sentiment, perhaps a reflection of lingering unhappiness that donald trump won the 2016 election by capturing the electoral college while losing the popular vote.\n\nand even as trump has continued to claim without evidence that millions of votes were cast illegally in 2016, 80% of republicans surveyed reported that they believe elections are fair.\n\nmany americans think election cycles are no longer on the up and up, said miringoff, the marist director. these opinions are a troublesome sign about this keystone of our democracy.\n\ndisinformation\n\nintelligence and elections officials work hard to reassure voters about the integrity of the system, but there is concern about the effect of disinformation in the political discourse. false, misleading and agitating material were a big part of russia's active measures in 2016.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above? click here.\n\namericans retain concerns about this today; 59% of those surveyed reported that it is hard to tell the difference between what is factual and what is misleading information.\n\ndespite nearly four years' worth of attention to disinformation, 55% of americans say it will be harder to identify deceptive information than it was in 2016.\n\neighty-two percent of those surveyed said they believe they will read misleading information on social media and a similar proportion believe foreign countries will spread false information about candidates this year.\n\nthe public does not trust big social network and tech companies to prevent their platforms from being misused to present election interference, the poll revealed.\n\nseventy-five percent of those surveyed are not confident about the tech companies, a 9-point increase from a similar 2018 npr/marist poll.\n\ndespite casting blame on tech companies for spreading disinformation, there was little consensus on who should be most responsible for reducing its flow: 39% pointed to the media, 18% to tech companies, 15% to the government and 12% to the public itself.\n\nnot surprisingly given trump's oft-repeated claim that the media peddles in fake news, 54% of republicans say it's the media's responsibility to stop the spread of disinformation.\n\nvoting rights and election administration\n\namericans who responded to the poll were divided about what they considered the biggest threat to the election — 35% said disinformation is the biggest threat; 24% blamed voter fraud; 16% said voter suppression; 15% blamed foreign interference.\n\nin yet another sign that voters live in very different media bubbles, voter suppression was cited as the greatest threat for democrats. voter fraud topped the list for republicans. independents were most concerned with misleading information.\n\nby an overwhelming margin, americans said they found voting to be easy, and most have not encountered problems with confusing ballots, problems with their voter id or registration or broken voting machines.\n\nbut more than a third of younger and nonwhite voters say they have experienced long lines.\n\nmoreover, women and nonwhite respondents are considerably more likely than men and white voters to say that their own vote won't be counted. and half of women and slightly more than half of nonwhite respondents said many votes will not be counted, in contrast to men and white americans, who are more confident that all ballots will be tallied.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above? click here.\n\npeople are trying to redline the country to stop different ethnic groups from voting, said larry swoffard, an african american poll respondent from california.\n\nlocal election officials get relatively high marks from voters, with 68% expressing confidence that officials will run a fair election in 2020. nearly 6 in 10 respondents say they plan to vote in person on election day. twenty-three percent say they will vote by mail or absentee ballot. another 18% said they would cast their ballot at an early voting site.\n\nnpr's domenico montanaro and lexie schapitl contributed reporting to this story.\n\nthe phone survey of 1,259 adults was conducted by the marist college institute for public opinion between jan. 7 and jan. 12. it has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points when adults are referenced and 3.8 percentage points when registered voters are referenced.
rund abdelfatah, host:\n\nhey, everyone. just a warning before we get started - this episode has some references to sexual violence. producer laine kaplan-levenson has the story.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nvictoria nourse: i think i'm one of the only people i know who went to law school to rebel against their parents. i grew up in a household where my sisters are quite a bit older than i am. and their generation, they just weren't groomed to be having careers. in the day, it was thought that if you had a career, you would be odd - an oddball, that you would not have the chance to have a family, that those two things were opposed to each other.\n\nbut being a little bit rebellious, i decided to go to law school at berkeley. it caused a bit of controversy in the home, and so i decided, well, i'll just pay for it myself. so i worked as a waitress, and i got some loans and went to law school.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: my name's victoria nourse, and i'm a law professor at georgetown law center.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: i'm going to berkeley in the early '80s. i'd park my little honda up on the hillside where a lot of the frats were, and i would take out all my heavy law books. and people would jeer outside the window - what's a cute girl like you with all those law books? (laughter).\n\nbut i think a lot of us just felt like we were happy to be there - to have the access. it seemed as if it was just the luckiest possible thing.\n\nlaine kaplan-levenson, byline: so were you interested in studying women's issues?\n\nnourse: no. many of the women that i was working - were there, we - i don't we'd call ourselves feminists. i took securities regulation and really liked that and did well (laughter). i wrote my student note on an obscure section of the securities laws.\n\nkaplan-levenson: fascinating.\n\nnourse: yeah, i know.\n\nkaplan-levenson: (laughter).\n\nnourse: it's so...\n\nkaplan-levenson: but like you said, you didn't identify as a feminist.\n\nnourse: no.\n\nkaplan-levenson: a few years out of law school, victoria landed a job with the senate judiciary committee.\n\nnourse: and i had just been hired to the chairman, and that was joe biden.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: this is joe biden when he's around 50 or maybe a little bit before 50. a couple of years earlier, he'd had an aneurysm and almost died. and he's really coming back to his legislative life at this time, but i had no idea about that.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: and so eventually, i'm sitting in a room - not too long after i'm there - and i'm with the guys (laughter). and literally, they're the guys in the legislative room...\n\nkaplan-levenson: because victoria was the only female lawyer on the senate judiciary committee.\n\nnourse: ...and the chairman says, we need to do something on women. and then there's no women in the room, and he points at me - he has no clue who i am - and says, i think you should do something on it - and then flashes his million-dollar smile.\n\nand at that point, what are you supposed to say - no, i'm not a feminist, i studied securities law? no, i (laughter) - so i'm like, ok. (laughter) and - then he walks off.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: victoria left that meeting having no idea what she had just said yes to. joe biden had essentially swiveled around, pointed at her and told her to do something about women. she needed more information, so she went to the committee's chief counsel ron klain.\n\nnourse: and he showed me an op-ed by one of my current colleagues - a woman named lisa heinzerling, who's a well-known professor at georgetown - and she had written an op-ed about what had happened in montreal, where a guy had gone into an engineering classroom. he had separated the women from the men.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified person #1: he said in french, you're a bunch of feminists - and he started to shoot.\n\nnourse: and he'd shot all the women.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified person #2: (speaking french).\n\nunidentified reporter #1: there was utter pandemonium outside the university building as ambulances carted away the injured. police have now confirmed 14 students dead, all women. another dozen people were hurt, caught in a rampage that witnesses called a human hunt, with the gunman yelling - i want women. police say after going on the rampage...\n\nnourse: the op-ed is basically saying, women are being targeted for being women - for their gender.\n\nso ron handed me this. and he says, we need to do something about this. and i now know he had handed that to biden.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: the 1989 montreal massacre pushed biden over the edge on an issue he was already concerned about. he didn't think his own country took violence against women seriously enough, and he became set on changing that with landmark legislation that protected people in ways the constitution never had before.\n\nvictoria's job was to write it. in order to do that, she had to understand the laws through a new lens - through the history of violence against women. this is a story about a group of people who got a rare chance to take on an age-old problem - a problem rooted in power - in the hopes that something could finally be done.\n\n(soundbite of montage)\n\nunidentified reporter #2: sexual assault in this country is epidemic.\n\nunidentified reporter #3: it's america's dark secret.\n\nunidentified reporter #4: in the u.s. alone, an estimated 1 in 4 women is victim of severe physical abuse.\n\nunidentified reporter #5: every 16 hours in the united states, a woman is shot to death by her partner.\n\nunidentified reporter #6: how many domestic violence calls do you get on most nights?\n\nunidentified person #3: might not be unusual to have six or eight.\n\nunidentified reporter #7: but i don't understand why the victim is ostracized and not the perpetrator in these cases.\n\nunidentified person #4: well, that's the issue...\n\nunidentified person #5: the person who's rape is damaged goods. no, how about the person who did the raping has a problem?\n\nunidentified person #6: it's hard for me to understand how people are punching out their wives at home and the rest of that. but it does happen. and it's an issue we've been working on for a very long time.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nabdelfatah: you're listening to throughline from npr...\n\nramtin arablouei, host:\n\nwhere we go back in time...\n\nabdelfatah: to understand the present.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nmelissa ortiz: hi. i'm melissa ortiz (ph).\n\nharsh shavla: and i'm harsh shavla (ph) from san francisco, calif.\n\nortiz: and you're listening to throughline...\n\nshavla: from npr.\n\n(soundbite of documentary, violence: an american tradition)\n\njulian bond: it is now recognized that for generations, behind a portrait of marital bliss, all too often lurked men with short tempers and violent tendencies. americans didn't invent violence against women, but they took to it with vengeance.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: in the 1990s, an anthropologist named shannon a. novak was studying skeletons of the fremont civilization, a group of people that lived in utah 1,300 years ago. she noticed that all the female skulls had specific types of cracks and dents in them, while most of the male skulls didn't.\n\nnovak thought that was odd, so she went and spent a year at an emergency room, studying female abuse trauma cases. she found that the wounds of the cases in the er matched the ones on the utah skulls.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: the history of violence against women is as old as history itself. it shows up in human remains and in the laws. hammurabi's code is one of the first sets of written laws and dates back to the 1700s b.c., the age of ancient mesopotamia. there are laws in there saying men were allowed to use violence against their wives in certain situations. for instance, if a woman was caught cheating or left her husband, she could be tied up and drowned.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: and then there were the puritans.\n\n(soundbite of documentary, violence: an american tradition)\n\nbond: in puritan new england, women were routinely whipped and publicly humiliated. married women were little more than the property of their husbands.\n\nkaplan-levenson: this is audio from a 1995 hbo tv special called violence: an american tradition.\n\nand then there was this 1864 court ruling in north carolina.\n\n(soundbite of documentary, violence: an american tradition)\n\nbond: the law permits husbands to use such a degree of force as necessary to control an unruly temper and make a wife behave herself. if no permanent injury has been reflected, it is better to draw the curtain, shut out the public gaze and leave the parties to forget and forgive.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: ok. now back to victoria nourse who, if you remember, didn't identify as a feminist, hadn't learned any of this history in law school and had no plans to make gender a focus of her career in any way - until joe biden told her to take on the issue of violence against women. all of the history i just described was new to victoria but ancient history nonetheless. she had to catch up on what was on the law books now - or in 1990.\n\nso what did you go do?\n\nnourse: i went to the library, which is the oddest place. no one writes legislation in a library.\n\nkaplan-levenson: but she didn't really have any other options.\n\nnourse: i didn't have any women to really go to in the senate because there were two women senators. so i went to the ladies on the shelves, the ladies in the books. and then it became - the more i read, the more shocked and the feminists who were considered radical at the time didn't seem terribly radical to me.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: give me some examples of what you were reading and discovering that was so shocking to you.\n\nnourse: well, you have to understand that the 1990s was an entirely different world. so - for example, a woman named susan estrich had written a book called real rape - that there was something called date rape. but that was really super controversial - right? - at the time. but it turns out that the laws of some states at the time actually said it could not be aggravated rape if you were a voluntary social companion. that was the term in the law.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: so let's just give you an example. so someone, like, cuts off your arm and you're on a date and rapes you, that's not aggravated rape.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: that just struck me. you didn't have to be a feminist (laughter) - just struck me as wrong.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: and i was upset that there were different rules for this particularly heinous offense.\n\nkaplan-levenson: victoria studied rape trial after rape trial and she realized from the records that, time after time, these cases were handled differently than other crimes.\n\nnourse: ok, so if you wanted to claim rape in some jurisdictions, you would have to go in and engage in a lie detector test. there were still places where prosecutors just refused to take the cases. they would say, you're lying, essentially. there were judges who would say things that - you wore a short skirt. what were you doing there? so it was as if someone who went to a bar assumed the risk of rape.\n\nso i just compared it to, all right, you go to a bar, and you're in a brawl. do they disbelieve you? no, right? you were in a brawl. no one says you have to have a psychiatric exam. there are no special rules for that. why are there special rules that stack the deck heavily in favor of the defendant when the deck is already stacked in favor of defendants because we have beyond a reasonable doubt? so i compared the brawl or any old assault on the street to these cases, and they just did not line up.\n\nkaplan-levenson: the term voluntary social companion haunted victoria. the law essentially rendered date rape impossible. and it didn't stop there.\n\nnourse: if your husband raped you, you could not bring a criminal charge in many, many states. that was on the books. and that shocked me. i didn't think that in a world where the constitution provides for equal protection and that i'm an equal citizen - i certainly thought i was an equal citizen - that that could possibly apply. and i kept thinking, what if that had happened to me?\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: sitting alone in the library, victoria realized that any federal protections she thought she had did not exist. she was shook.\n\nnourse: there's a professor at yale who worked with me on the bill. and she doesn't remember this, but she once said to me, victoria, i've never met anyone who is in so much denial. when she said that to me, i thought, but what am i in denial about? and there was a point when i was starting there that i very much was in denial.\n\nyou know, i went to school to study engineering. i was the only woman in the class. and my professor wanted to study with me in his office. and i don't think there was anything to it. i think he actually wanted to encourage me. you know, sexual harassment was not even a concept, really, that i was being taught or had been taught in school. so i don't even know what that would be. but i felt uncomfortable. so i ended up being a history major. so i pretty much quit engineering.\n\nkaplan-levenson: you quit engineering...\n\nnourse: i just didn't know what to do. i couldn't tell whether he really wanted to be my mentor or whether there was something else going on. and i couldn't face it. so i denied it, and then i just switched. you know, i mean, i think this is a very common phenomenon in a world where you knew that kind of stuff happened, and you knew you'd be blamed. like, i kept thinking at the time, well, my mother will blame me if i do this. my mother will blame me. and i'm already out on a limb out here in california, where they don't want me to be, so i better not do that. so i'll just stay away and do something else.\n\ni started to see things. i would see democratic senators fondling interns or cornering them in elevators. why was the world like this, when i saw people just assuming the power to corner the intern? this was the kind of thing that you saw literally. and i think this is what this woman was saying, you're in denial about how deeply sexist the institution may be.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: there were times working on it that i got flooded. there are times when i didn't know if i could continue. and it was an extraordinary awakening.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: victoria had been planning to leave the senate and accept a job teaching at the university of wisconsin. but this awakening made her see that she was in a position to revolutionize a system she had come to view as utterly skewed.\n\nnourse: i had a special opportunity, a moment in time that i could have 15 seconds to help change the world for my daughter, if i ever had a daughter. so i had to take it.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: she had done her research and was now staring at a blank page. in order to write this legislation, she had to figure out what it was actually meant to do.\n\nnourse: we were trying to name a phenomenon that people didn't really realize existed, and we were trying to unify it. i mean, the big move here was to say this is part of discrimination.\n\nkaplan-levenson: one of her biggest revelations was that there were no federal laws that addressed violence against women - rape, assault, domestic abuse. these cases were up to local cops and handled in state courts. too often, victoria found in the records that women were stripped of their power when they came forward. they were ignored, doubted, blamed. and if the survivor lost in state court, she didn't have the right to an appeal. there were no grounds for her to.\n\nnourse: and i saw this, and i said, this system is rigged. the criminal law was saying there are some people who are just not protected. how can that be equal protection of the law? the constitution says you have equal protection of the law. how can that be equal protection? that was the core of the kernel that i just kept building out.\n\nkaplan-levenson: a kernel that suddenly made her see this was as basic as could be. this was about civil rights.\n\nnourse: and what civil rights are, is the rights that we all deserve as citizens under the 14th amendment.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: so, real quick, the 14th amendment was ratified in 1868, and it granted citizenship to all people born or naturalized in the u.s., including formerly enslaved people. this is the amendment that guarantees each of these citizens equal protection of the laws. now she had an idea. she went back to chief counsel, ron klain.\n\nnourse: and i said, ron, can we do a civil rights remedy? and he's like, yeah, maybe we can do a civil. he said, what for? i said, well, violence against women. he said, yeah, yeah, yeah. so what would it do? and i said, well, we can't fix the criminal justice systems in the states. the feds have no power to do that. but we can provide a backstop. if the states fail, we can provide a another place where women can go. so we wanted the civil rights remedy to provide an alternate system so that women who got no protection when people threw away your rape kit or people refuse to prosecute your case, that they could go to federal court, and they could actually sue the perpetrator.\n\nkaplan-levenson: a civil rights remedy would make gender-based violence a federal issue for the first time, which victoria hoped would get people talking.\n\nnourse: there were no good names for what was going on. at the time, biden called it a dirty little secret that society had, and one way that kept being reinforced with the names. so domestic violence, you know, sounds like an oxymoron. there's nothing domestic about a hook to the left jaw. there's nothing tame about it. i needed something very clear. and so one day, i think i said violence against women.\n\nkaplan-levenson: the bill would be called the violence against women act - vawa.\n\nnourse: it seemed simple enough.\n\nkaplan-levenson: what wasn't so simple was how to convince 535 powerful politicians, almost all men, that this was worth it. vawa takes on congress when we come back.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nbrianna beckeney: hi, this is brianna beckeney (ph) from tokyo, japan. and you're listening to throughline from npr. love the show; love everything about it. thanks for all your hard work, and keep it up.\n\nkaplan-levenson: victoria had been working solo up until this point, alone in the library giving herself a crash course on gender and the law. but she knew she couldn't write this bill alone. she needed support. she needed muscle.\n\nnourse: and then i called new york. i called the now legal defense fund.\n\nkaplan-levenson: now is the national organization for women.\n\nnourse: and i found myself talking to a woman named sally goldfarb.\n\nsally goldfarb: i got a phone message that victoria nourse, who worked as an attorney for the senate judiciary committee, was interested in meeting with me to talk about this new legislation. she had heard of me because i was doing work on civil remedies for domestic and sexual violence.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngoldfarb: i'm sally goldfarb. i'm a law professor at rutgers law school in camden, n.j.\n\nnourse: she said, this is really fascinating, and does senator biden really mean this? i said, yes. in fact, i think he's very excited about it. i said, you've got to come down here and talk to me about it if you're willing to help. and she said, really? and i said, really.\n\ngoldfarb: so i went over and met with her.\n\nnourse: i'll never forget. we're sitting in the conference room outside the senate judiciary committee.\n\ngoldfarb: and she briefly laid out what she had in mind, which was to have, for the first time, comprehensive federal legislation addressing the issue of gender-based violence. and i immediately knew that this was a very exciting and groundbreaking and worthwhile idea.\n\nnourse: and i think she just could not imagine that the senate of the united states just coming out of the reagan era would have any interest because if you know anything about the history of feminism in the 1980s in the senate, it was a very, very negative place for feminists to be. they were dismissed. they were disparaged. they were insulted in the record.\n\nkaplan-levenson: a decade earlier, california senator alan cranston had tried to get federal funding for battered women's shelters.\n\nnourse: he brings it to the floor, and it's essentially filibustered. gordon humphrey, who's a senator from new hampshire, says this is about indoctrination. battered women shelters are indoctrination centers. they're going to indoctrinate people into this idea of feminism, and using feminism as if it were communism.\n\nkaplan-levenson: north carolina senator jesse helms chimed in that battered women's shelters would encourage the disintegration of the family. that's the last time someone had tried to make domestic violence a federal issue. so victoria's plans had sally super excited.\n\ngoldfarb: so i offered to stay in touch and try to be of help to her. i certainly didn't realize the extent to which my own life would become immersed in getting this law drafted and passed.\n\nnourse: i was delighted. i thought, wow, this is someone who really gets it, who knows more about this than i do. it was clear she was a true feminist, that she had worked on this.\n\nkaplan-levenson: and that she could help build that base of support, a base that could put pressure on members of congress to get on board, which they knew would be an uphill battle considering what happened the last time anyone had tried to pass something like this.\n\nnourse: so sally stopped litigating, and she started building a coalition. and then they needed someone who knew how to lobby.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: so they had to look for someone like pat reuss.\n\ngoldfarb: pat is a hoot, a veteran lobbyist on women's rights issues.\n\nnourse: she's warm...\n\ngoldfarb: ...irreverent.\n\nnourse: she's funny...\n\ngoldfarb: ...brilliant...\n\nnourse: ...authentic...\n\ngoldfarb: ...tireless, unbelievably committed.\n\nnourse: and she had the high ability to persuade almost anyone of the virtues of this particular project.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npat reuss: i wore my - a good christmas sweater for you.\n\nkaplan-levenson: oh, my god. that is...\n\nreuss: is that great?\n\nkaplan-levenson: ...incredible.\n\nreuss: isn't that wonderful?\n\nkaplan-levenson: when i walked into pat reuss's first-floor condo at 11 in the morning, the impeachment hearings were blaring from her flat-screen tv, and it smelled as if she had just finished a cigarette. as soon as i laid eyes on her, i realized she had really dressed for the occasion.\n\nreuss: well, it's a knit sweater that has all the christmas colors. and then right smack dab in the middle is a cartoonish face of ruth bader ginsburg with her glasses and her intensity (laughter). isn't that great?\n\nkaplan-levenson: i felt like i knew pat before i had even pulled my arms out of my coat.\n\nthank you so much for inviting me to your home. i really...\n\nreuss: would you like coffee, tea, hot chocolate, water? i have wine. i have coke.\n\nkaplan-levenson: (laughter).\n\nreuss: i have some cinnamon cream rum, but i (laughter) have enough trouble waiting till 6 o'clock to have my wine. i do not need to start drinking in the morning, although there are days. don't we all agree?\n\nkaplan-levenson: totally.\n\nreuss: yes, yes.\n\nkaplan-levenson: pat's known by some as the grandmother of the women's movement and by many as the grandmother of the violence against women act. she's been organizing for women's rights for almost 50 years, but that wasn't her original plan.\n\nreuss: when i was little, i wanted to be a doctor. and guess what? ka-zam (ph) - university of california, i'm sorry. we've already filled our 10% quota for women for premed. and everybody goes, but, pat, you're so assertive. why didn't you just get up and dump the table over? i said, my god, that was 1959. i still was wearing a girdle, for goodness sakes.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nreuss: i also wanted to be a baseball player - a doctor who played right field for the yankees, i announced. i know. and then my father - remember; we're in the mid-'50s now - had to explain to me why girls couldn't play baseball. so my revenge is all my work in the women's movement.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: in the early 1970s, pat and her husband moved their three sons to montana. she was already politically active at that point and spent most of her energy working on getting women elected to office. but everything changed for her one day in 1972, when a friend showed up at her door.\n\nreuss: she comes over, and her face is a mess. she's been beat up - puffy lip and puffy eye like she'd been in a bar fight. that's the only fight i'd ever seen before. or - i've dated rugby players. and my - two of my sons were rugby players. somebody was always beat up. she looked like that.\n\nand she's sitting there. one of her kids is in school, and the other two are with her. and we have to whisper, and i have no idea what to do. so i get on the phone. who do you call? i called somebody in the city, i called churches. i don't know, i had a list about eight places i called. and we found nothing for her. there was nothing for her. she said, i'll just go back and try harder. and i've never forgotten that.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: pat couldn't believe there was nowhere for her friend to go. she couldn't believe it when her friend called her to say she had to run away with her three kids to go live with her mom. and what she really couldn't stand was that there was nothing she could do about it. so she got together with a few other women.\n\nreuss: we decided to raise money for a battered women's shelter.\n\nkaplan-levenson: and because there was nothing for them to tap into, they had to start small - really small.\n\nreuss: and so we decided to have a plant sale.\n\nkaplan-levenson: a plant sale.\n\nreuss: that was our seed money to begin our women's research center, a women's center and a couple of rooms for battered women.\n\nkaplan-levenson: pat's friend was the first person she knew who had been beat up by her husband, or so she thought.\n\nreuss: then, of course, as i start working on it, my cousin comes up - whisper, whisper - well, just that he - you know why i got divorced? 'cause he just beat the you-know-what out of me. and i didn't tell anyone. i'm telling you, but you can't tell anybody. then my aunt comes up. she's a social worker. and she says that she became a social worker 'cause her first husband - i always wondered why they all got divorced. and she said, don't tell anybody. and i'm going - oh, my god.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nreuss: and so it turns out that everybody knows somebody. whether you know it or not, everybody knows somebody.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: pat spent the next two decades making a name for herself in the movement - so much so that by the time victoria and sally needed a lobbyist, they knew who to call. she said yes and went to work traveling the country, preaching the vawa gospel.\n\nreuss: i would say, i'm here today to talk about violence against women and joe biden's bill. and i know he's a guy - and everybody would laugh, you know - but he really is earnest and we have a chance. and in the bill, there'll be money for shelters. and they all go, yay. and then i said - and in the bill, we have a provision that gives people a right to sue their rapist or their batterer - i boiled it down - and that is the closest we can get to holding them accountable.\n\nkaplan-levenson: whatever pat was doing, it was working. the coalition grew and grew.\n\ngoldfarb: ranging from the girl scouts to civil rights groups to labor unions, religious denominations, obviously women's rights groups, domestic violence, sexual assault - all the different kinds of groups you could possibly imagine.\n\nkaplan-levenson: now they needed to convince members of congress directly that this was important. they were the ones, after all, who were going to vote on the bill. so pat had a separate strategy for the politicians and coached sally on how to play ball.\n\ngoldfarb: and she taught me everything i needed to know about talking to members of congress.\n\nkaplan-levenson: like, how to literally go up and talk to them.\n\nnourse: there's a funny story when - apparently, sally goldfarb was flying back...\n\ngoldfarb: from washington to new york after a day of meetings...\n\nnourse: and she somehow finds out that she's sitting in a plane with chuck schumer, who is in the house.\n\ngoldfarb: in the house of representatives.\n\nnourse: and she knows who he is. and she wants somebody in the house, and she wants him to move the bill through the house committee.\n\ngoldfarb: and there were no cellphones at the time. i used the telephone on the back of the seat in front of me on the plane, using my credit card to place a call.\n\nreuss: the phone rings, and it's sally. i've just seen chuck schumer.\n\ngoldfarb: chuck schumer's on the plane with me. what should i do?\n\nreuss: so instead of saying - oh, for god's sakes, you dummy, of course you know what to do, i sat there and outlined a cause of action. you approach him. you love him. he puts his pants on one leg at a time, just like you. you are equals right now, and you love him. and you maybe drop that you chair this giant coalition.\n\ngoldfarb: and we had a conversation about the violence against women act. and i did my best to explain to him why it was important, why he should support it.\n\nreuss: she then calls back and she says - ok, i did it. oh, my - i mean, she might as well have just won the new york marathon, she was so proud of herself.\n\ngoldfarb: at the time, he lived very near where i was living in park slope in brooklyn. and he offered me a ride from the airport back to park slope.\n\nreuss: so then she calls - is it ok for me to get a ride from a member of congress? and - i know. i know. i know, i know. and i'm going, absolutely. just, you know...\n\nkaplan-levenson: get in the car, sally (laughter).\n\nreuss: get in the car, sally. and don't talk about business anymore. talk - ask about his kids, whatever. just - and then - and be friendly. you lobbied him; you're through. and the good thing was he came back and said to his staff that they'd been praised. and so they loved it, and they were our friends for life.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: schumer became a major supporter of the bill.\n\nso that's why they call you the godmother of this bill.\n\nreuss: part of it, yes. yes.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: in order to raise public awareness and get bipartisan support, it wouldn't be enough for congress to only hear from lawyers and advocates - they needed to hear from survivors themselves. so the coalition organized a series of public hearings.\n\nand when was that first hearing?\n\nnourse: it was in june of 1990. and you walk into the large double doors - mahogany doors and marble floors. you might have seen this if you've watched a confirmation hearing of a supreme court nominee. it's pretty darn intimidating because you have a dais that is on high - a bench where the senators sit. and they're a lot higher than the witnesses. in the front, crouching down in front of the witnesses, are cameras - lots of cameras with motorized drives. so it's loud.\n\n(soundbite of camera drives whirring, shutters clicking)\n\nnourse: it's a very intimidating atmosphere.\n\nkaplan-levenson: so the survivors are telling their stories to a group of men that are towering over them.\n\nnourse: yes. it was very clear there was a lot of nerves in the room.\n\ni'm sitting there in the back bench of the senate judiciary committee, tapping my heel like i'm nervous out of my brain is that i don't really know what they're going to say. and i've got strom thurmond. and i've got joe biden. and i've got all these people, and i have no idea what they're going to say and how it's going to go.\n\nin the first hearing, there was a woman who - her case had been in the news in new york.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified reporter #8: she's former fashion model marla hanson, whose face was horribly slashed in 1986 outside a midtown manhattan bar...\n\nnourse: so this woman had been a model. and she was well-known because her landlord had disfigured her, essentially, so she could no longer be a model.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified reporter #9: marla's landlord hired two men to slash her face. after the attack, he pretended to be her concerned boyfriend at the scene of the crime.\n\nkaplan-levenson: this happened after marla hanson rejected sexual advances by her landlord. pat remembers another witness who was left partially paralyzed after she was attacked by her estranged husband.\n\nreuss: and she had to suck in air before she could say it. she took an hour to give her testimony. and every member of the house judiciary committee sat there and just died. oh, please, god, make her stop. you could see that look on their faces.\n\nkaplan-levenson: victoria also remembers a woman named sarah buel.\n\nnourse: sarah buel was an extraordinary witness.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nsarah buel: good morning, and thank you very much for inviting me here...\n\njoe biden: thank you.\n\nbuel: ...to speak. i'm particularly in the mood to talk...\n\nnourse: she opened up her testimony with a demonstration. so she said, gentlemen, take out your wallet. now take out all your credit cards. now take out all your cash. now try and figure out how to get your children away from someone who is going to harm them. you have no money, you have no credit cards, and you're scared for your life.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbuel: so you try finding a homeless shelter, but 95% of them don't accept children. so you try finding a sympathetic landlord, but nobody will rent to you because you don't have a source of income in that city. and by that time, the batterer has found you. he's tracked you down, and he's going to kill you if you don't come home or else he's got a box of chocolates and a bouquet of flowers, and he's sorry, and it will never happen again. but you've spent the $20...\n\nnourse: it was riveting.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbuel: ...and getting back and forth to all these agencies.\n\nnourse: at the time, there were many myths about the battered woman. why didn't she just leave? and this was a very, very powerful demonstration about how it's much more difficult than you think.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: the hearings had an impact on congress, but vawa still hadn't reached bipartisan support. they needed the endorsement of a key republican in the senate judiciary committee - orrin hatch. hatch was an ultraconservative from utah. and so support for any democratic bill was not a given. but the thing is, like most people, he knew someone.\n\nreuss: he had a staff woman who had been cruelly beaten by her then ex-husband.\n\nkaplan-levenson: they held another public hearing, this time in salt lake city.\n\nnourse: hatch was nearly in tears. and he reached out to embrace me. and at this point, he says, oh, no. i'm sorry. i'm sorry. was that wrong? i said, no. it's fine.\n\nreuss: so i see him afterwards. and he goes, pat, did you get all those people there? i said, sir, i think i only know 10 feminists in utah, and i did not call them. so he experienced firsthand - you have your allies wherever you get them.\n\nnourse: after that, he says to his staff, well, we got to come up with some compromise. and i say, well, biden wants a civil rights remedy. that's - if you can't get on the civil rights remedy, then we can't do it. he said, well, maybe i can be on that if it's like a hate crimes act. and i said, well, maybe.\n\nkaplan-levenson: getting hatch on board was huge. not only was there this giant coalition, vawa officially had bipartisan support in the senate. but the biggest roadblock was yet to come. a fight to the finish when we come back.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: when vawa started out in 1990, everyone knew there would be pushback. republicans controlled the white house, and republican lawmakers were an obvious obstacle. but they were just the start.\n\ngoldfarb: the opposition came from some surprising places.\n\nnourse: the traditional liberal allies, they were not so interested.\n\ngoldfarb: even within the women's rights community, there were some people who felt that this wasn't the highest priority, that we needed to be working on other issues like family leave, which, at the time, was not yet protected under federal law - abortion rights, equality in the workplace. these are all important issues. some women's rights groups felt that working on the violence against women act would in some way distract or undermine those other efforts.\n\nnourse: there were concerns raised by some women's groups about native american women. there were some parts of the bill that might have had a negative effect because native american law is very specialized because they're nations. so somewhere along the line, in the first year, i reached out to a colleague of mine on the indian affairs committee, and i said, you need to help me redraft every piece of this to make it clear that indian tribal units can benefit from the law, they can get the money under the grants, that they are required to meet the same conditions, that there is no discrimination whatsoever.\n\nkaplan-levenson: native americans were just one of many communities with concerns. people of color were active in the coalition all across the country, but white people were the main authors of the bill, which caused blind spots to say the least. who was this bill going to actually protect? and who was it going to potentially endanger even further? there were feminists who publicly spoke out against the bill, like mari matsuda, a professor at georgetown law in the '90s who published her opinions in ms. magazine. she wrote, we know that the police are a source of violence in our communities, not just a deterrent to it. we also know that violence against women is endemic and that police don't come when a woman from the wrong part of town dials 911.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: vawa was attached to the criminal justice system, and that disturbed some feminists. at the same time, the justice system was disturbed by vawa. the bill's biggest enemy was a group that you wouldn't expect to come out so strongly for or against anything - judges.\n\nnourse: the federal judges launched an incredible campaign. and technically, under the judge's ethical code, they are not supposed to lobby. and, in fact, when the women judges were asked what their position on the bill was, one of them said, you know, i don't know if we should take a position because if we do, and then we have to rule on it, that would be a conflict. i never heard that from any of the male judges.\n\ngoldfarb: federal judges who felt that the violence against women civil rights provision was going to enable women to use this new statute as a way to manipulate the legal system and get a higher settlement in a divorce case.\n\nkaplan-levenson: judges wrote letters...\n\nnourse: ...saying that women would bring these cases in divorces, and they would lie to extort damages from their husbands.\n\ngoldfarb: and, of course, that was extremely disturbing, that judges would assume that women are going to fabricate charges of domestic violence in order to get an advantage in litigation.\n\nkaplan-levenson: the chief justice of the supreme court was william rehnquist. he led this resistance and warned that if the bill passed, the courts would be flooded with family squabbles.\n\nnourse: there are two things that are happening in their arguments. one, they're demeaning the problem as insignificant and not significant for a federal judge. so it doesn't matter. you can go back to state law. whatever mississippi said is fine, even if what mississippi says is entirely different from alaska. there's nothing federal about this, where federal means something important, right? the second thing they're saying is they're feeding into the very stereotypes the law was supposed to push against. from the very first witnesses, they were telling us stories about how they weren't believable, that they weren't credible.\n\nkaplan-levenson: the biggest issue for the judges was the most revolutionary piece of vawa - the civil rights remedy, which victoria had based off of previous laws.\n\nnourse: yes, previous legislation in the 19th century which was targeted at violence in the south. i mean, it's called the ku klux klan act that allowed the federal government to criminalize violence that was focused on race. and that was pretty well established. no one thought that that would be unconstitutional. i kept saying, well, if that isn't unconstitutional, why is it different for gender? this was my constant refrain. eventually, unfortunately, one of the judges on the committee said to me, well, we don't like those cases, either. i couldn't get out of there fast enough, man.\n\nkaplan-levenson: the judges were wearing victoria down. she was losing hope.\n\nnourse: i really was quite demoralized. i really didn't know how i was going to move forward. the women judges had by then come out in favor of a remedy. so we had some support. but judges are friends of senators, and they had convinced people that this was the worst thing that had ever happened to them. and i could never quite get them out of that mindset.\n\nkaplan-levenson: but finally, in yet another drawn-out meeting, sally got through.\n\nnourse: sally was very, very persuasive. i've never seen a better oral argument in my life. they all had legitimate questions about the scope. what did gender-motivated mean? there were questions, and sally won the day.\n\nkaplan-levenson: the judges ultimately backed down and decided not to take a stance on the civil rights remedy. now it was down to the final negotiations and deals cut behind closed doors. it had been nearly four years since victoria started working on the bill. and in that time, a lot had happened.\n\ngoldfarb: well, things politically had changed. by 1994, we had bill clinton as president.\n\nnourse: and then there was the nationally cataclysmic events of anita hill.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbiden: professor, do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god?\n\nanita hill: i do.\n\nbiden: thank you.\n\nnourse: i was sitting at dinner with a little sony tv watching. and like the rest of the nation, i was transfixed and horrified.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nhill: mr. chairman, senator thurmond, members of the committee, my name is anita f. hill. and i am a professor of law at the university of oklahoma.\n\nkaplan-levenson: during justice clarence thomas's confirmation hearings to the u.s. supreme court in 1991, law professor anita hill came forward that she had been sexually harassed by her former boss, clarence thomas. she testified before the senate judiciary committee over the course of three days, where she was interrogated by senators like alabama democrat howell heflin....\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nhowell heflin: i've got to determine what your motivation might be. are you a scorned woman? do you have a militant attitude relative to the area of civil rights?\n\nhill: no, i don't have a militant attitude.\n\nheflin: do you have a martyr complex?\n\nhill: no, i don't (laughter).\n\nkaplan-levenson: ...and by the committee chairman, joe biden.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbiden: it is appropriate to ask professor hill anything any member wishes to ask her to plumb the depths of her credibility.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: despite anita hill coming forward, thomas was confirmed to the supreme court. the hearings inspired women to run for office all across the country. 1992 was coined the year of the woman when 24 women were elected to the house and five were elected to the senate. all of these women now had an opportunity to pass vawa and influence their colleagues.\n\nnourse: there's no question that in terms of the senate dynamics, we used to joke that after that, senators would try to sign on to the violence against women act three or four times. you know, she's a tremendous hero for the violence against women act.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nhill: i guess one really does have to understand something about the nature of sexual harassment. it is very difficult for people to come forward with these things.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: as more and more women were taking jobs in d.c., victoria finally had to leave hers. remember; she had been offered a teaching gig at the university of wisconsin when she first started working on vawa. if she didn't take it now, she'd lose it for good. so she left before a deal was cut. about a month later, she woke up to a phone call in the middle of the night. it was one of her colleagues back in d.c.\n\nnourse: and she says, they passed vawa. i said, the civil rights remedy? she said, all of it. and it's 2:00 a.m. in the morning, and i'd been teaching for about a month or something. and i'm like, really? really?\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified person #7: please remain standing for the national anthem, sung by detective kim royster.\n\nkaplan-levenson: on september 13, 1994, president bill clinton signed the violent crime control and law enforcement act. vawa was included in that bill, the crime bill that many say contributed to the rise of mass incarceration in this country and the bill that many people of color and grassroots organizations didn't want anywhere near the violence against women act - that bill.\n\nnourse: so i fly in for the ceremony.\n\ngoldfarb: i was there on the white house lawn watching president clinton sign it.\n\nreuss: and we sat there, and it was very long 'cause everybody had to talk.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nunidentified person #8: you sustain us with your grace.\n\nreuss: but vawa was never mentioned.\n\n(soundbite of archived

by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?\n\nkaplan-levenson: for the next six years after vawa was signed into law, survivors of sexual violence filed suit against their perpetrators using the civil rights remedy.\n\nnourse: this was their avenue. you know, the coach harassed them. and they - under title 9, you could only sue the university. you can't sue the coach. so they're suing the coach. they're suing the professor.\n\nkaplan-levenson: and these women were winning?\n\nnourse: yes, they were winning.\n\ngoldfarb: now, of course, that wasn't the final end of the story.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nwilliam rehnquist: we'll hear argument now no. 99-5, united states against antonio j. morrison and christy brzonkala v. antonio morrison. ms. goldscheid...\n\nnourse: christy brzonkala was a student at virginia tech. and not long after she enrolled, she was attacked by two football players.\n\nkaplan-levenson: allegedly. also allegedly...\n\nnourse: one of them went on later to say something like, i like to get women drunk and f them. and basically, the school ended up going back and forth about whether they should be disciplined.\n\nkaplan-levenson: one of the football players, morrison, was suspended. but ultimately, he was reinstated.\n\nnourse: meanwhile, christie bzronkala dropped out of school and was traumatized by this. and she brought a suit under vawa.\n\nkaplan-levenson: bzronkala lost in the lower courts. in 2000, she brought her case up to the supreme court, led by chief justice william rehnquist.\n\nnourse: justice rehnquist wrote the opinion 5 to 4, holding that congress had no power to enact the civil rights remedy.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nrehnquist: petitioner bzronkala's complaint alleges that she was the victim of a brutal assault. if the allegations are true, no civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy for morrison's conduct. but under our federal system, that remedy must be provided by the commonwealth of virginia and not by the united states. the judgment of the court of appeals is therefore affirmed. justice thomas has filed a concurring opinion. justice...\n\nreuss: william rehnquist said we cannot find it in the constitution that this is a civil right.\n\nkaplan-levenson: which means...\n\nreuss: right.\n\nkaplan-levenson: ...the constitution cannot protect a woman against violence.\n\nreuss: absolutely. it means that it cannot find in its place to determine that gender-based violence is discrimination.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: the washington post came out in favor of the morrison decision, saying the court got it right. if congress could federalize rape and assault, it's hard to think of anything it couldn't.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: so what do you think would be different today if the civil rights provision had lived?\n\nnourse: well, the country lost the heart of it. the country lost a backstop for title vii, title ix. the country committed itself to something it couldn't imagine, which was #metoo.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: and i always thought before #metoo that the rest of vawa might have done the job. it might have educated people. it might have changed the institutions, like police departments. it might have, you know, gotten people to understand that women were credible.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: but after #metoo, i realized that the heart of it had died for the wrong reasons, and it made me deeply, deeply sad.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nreuss: i don't know. i guess i was used to it. maybe i've been abandoned at the altar so many times - i don't know. there was no town hall meeting that caused orrin hatch to be born again. there's no way. so - it's just like, oh, f***.\n\nnourse: guess what? in 2019, a district court in michigan held that congress had no power under the morrison decision to ban female genital mutilation, meaning torture under a number of international treaties.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: and only because of morrison, congress had no power.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nnourse: that has to change.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: since the morrison decision in 2000, vawa has been reauthorized numerous times with revisions that aim to be more inclusive and intersectional. for instance, the act didn't fully protect same-sex couples until 2013. there's still criticism from advocates who say women of color have paid the price for a law focused on criminalization. while seen as a victory for women by some, many are still asking - which women? - not to mention which genders.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nkaplan-levenson: with all its triumphs and shortcomings, today vawa sits in purgatory. when the bill expired in 2019, the house passed a new version that's currently stalled in the senate. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell hasn't put it on the legislative schedule.\n\nso while the future of the bill is uncertain, it's clear that no version of this law alone will ever make this problem go away. pat thinks that even after #metoo, a national reckoning around sex and power still hasn't happened.\n\nreuss: we can fight for cancer - pink ribbons for breast cancer. men are our best friends. god bless them. when we play baseball, they've got on all this pink stuff 'cause when you fight breast cancer, you don't blame the victim. but when it comes down to sexual and domestic violence and incest and stalking and rape, it's hard for them to do.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nreuss: we couldn't get obama to light up the white house in october purple. purple is domestic violence awareness month. i begged. i pleaded. i cajoled. i threatened. well, we have the pink all lined up, and we can't change or whatever - i don't know. lighting it up for breast cancer is cool. but domestic violence is just too hard.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nreuss: and that's why, you know, it's a power thing. it's a hierarchy thing. right now if you and i had some problem, i would look at you and i would say, who's going to believe you? you're 32 years old, and i'm 77. and i know powerful people, and you're just a kid. i would say that to you. and you would walk out the door - god, she's right. no one's going to believe me. and my mom will be some embarrassed - and my friends, you know. we can all put ourselves in that place.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\narablouei: that's it for this week's show. i'm ramtin

it sounds like science fiction but ... it's a cliché\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ronald siemoneit/sygma via getty images ronald siemoneit/sygma via getty images\n\nin the 1994 film timecop, jean-claude van damme plays a police officer who uses a time machine to catch criminals. time-traveling law enforcement may sound like the stuff of science fiction, but if one researcher has her way, it will soon become science fact.\n\nsee what i did there? that paragraph encapsulates the most tired cliché of science writing: it sounds like science fiction but it's true. \n\nsounds like sci-fi gets used everywhere, from cnn, to the new york times, to yes ... here on npr. and once you see it, you can't unsee it. the best examples usually include a reference to a mid-1990s sci-fi film, just to make crystal-clear what science fiction this particular science fact refers to.\n\nin 15 years of reporting, i've lost track of how many times i've run into sounds like sci-fi. and last year, i became a science editor here at npr. npr's ethics handbook carries a warning on cliches:\n\nreporters and news writers are under deadline pressure, and these are the phrases that spring to mind. the editor's job is not to let them get away with it.\n\nand yet, like jean-claude van damme's character in timecop, i may need to violate the very guidelines i am sworn to enforce.\n\na big part of our job on npr's science desk is to tell you about the latest scientific findings. that involves cramming a lot of complicated science into a very small space, and hopefully presenting it in a way that prevents your eyes from glazing over.\n\nscience fiction plays an important role in two ways. first, most people are not familiar with the latest findings on antimatter, but they do know star trek. so if i can use mr. spock to introduce the concept, then i'm giving our readers and listeners something to grab on to: a little piece of the familiar in a story that is otherwise abstruse. (in fact, new research on antimatter was the one case in recent memory where i indulged in the cliché.)\n\nsecond, science fiction often revolves around the moral questions of technology. it can help the public understand potential problems before they become real. take for example, a gene-editing tool known as crispr-cas9. while it's not yet well-known outside the world of science, this inscrutably-acronymed technology allows researchers to cut and paste genetic code like lines in a word-processing document. researchers are already looking ahead to how such gene-editing might be used in humans to eliminate disease.\n\nor, more worryingly, they could use crispr to create designer babies. it's the stuff of brave new world but it's real. actually, to keep truer to the trope, it's the stuff of the 1997 film gattaca. and those two dystopic views of genetics are a good way to help people begin to grapple with the problems something like crispr might bring.\n\nwe live in an era where the pace of change is quick. the lines between science fiction and science fact often blur. science journalists will continue to pull from science fiction, and they will inevitably write the sounds like science fiction cliché.\n\nthat doesn't mean i'll let them do it regularly on my watch. and there is one technology that exists purely as science fiction: time travel. that's why you won't see me making reference to timecop anytime soon, either.
young girls are less apt to think that women are really, really smart\n\ntoggle caption marc romanelli/getty images/blend images\n\ngirls in the first few years of elementary school are less likely than boys to say that their own gender is really, really smart, and less likely to opt into a game described as being for super-smart kids, research finds.\n\nthe study, which appears thursday in science, comes amid a push to figure out why women are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or stem, fields. one line of research involves stereotypes, and how they might influence academic and career choices.\n\nandrei cimpian, a professor of psychology at new york university and an author of the study, says his lab's previous work showed that women were particularly underrepresented in both stem and humanities fields whose members thought you needed to be brilliant — that is, to have innate talent — to succeed.\n\nyou might think these stereotypes start in college, but we know from a lot of developmental work that children are incredibly attuned to social signals, cimpian says. so they decided to look at kids from ages 5 to 7, the period during which stereotypes seem to start to take hold.\n\nthe researchers conducted a series of experiments that included 400 children. in one, they took 96 kids and asked them a series of questions about brilliance and gender. for example, they were told a brief story about a person who was really, really smart and then asked to pick the protagonist from four photos, two of men and two of women.\n\nacross the various questions, 5-year-old boys said their own gender was smart 71 percent of the time, compared to 69 percent of the time for girls. among 6-year-olds, the numbers were 65 percent for boys and 48 percent for girls. and among 7-year-olds, it was 68 percent for boys and 54 percent for girls.\n\nthe surprising thing is that already, by age 6, girls and boys are saying different things, says sapna cheryan, an associate professor of psychology at the university of washington who wasn't involved with the research. before they've heard of physics or computer science they are getting these messages.\n\nanother experiment showed that even as older girls were less likely to associate their own gender with brilliance, they (correctly) assessed that at their age, girls were more likely to get good grades in school.\n\nand another experiment asked 6- and 7-year-olds about the appeal of two similar imaginary games, one intended for children who are really, really smart, and one for children who try really, really hard. girls were less interested than boys in the game aimed at smart kids but interest was similar in the game for hard workers.\n\nthe research can't explain how these messages are getting to kids or how they could be changed, says cimpian. he is planning a long-term study of young children that would measure environmental factors, including media exposure and parental beliefs. that would give a better idea of what factors predict the emergence of stereotypes, and what levers are available to change attitudes.\n\nresearch does suggest that role models might inoculate women and members of other underrepresented groups. so the movie hidden figures, about female african-american mathematicians at nasa during the late 1950s and early 1960s, could inspire girls and teens of color to pursue stem fields.\n\nbut it's also important to step back and ask what the goal of any intervention should be, says cheryan.\n\ngirls, after all, were split about evenly in associating brilliance with their gender, she notes. the boys were more likely to make the association with their own gender. so do girls need help in thinking more like the boys, or vice versa? cimpian says it's important not to fall into the trap of always assuming it's the girls who need to change. but he says that girls at this age are usually overwhelmingly positive about their own gender, so any deviation from that baseline may suggest the beginning of negative attitudes.\n\nanother approach is to change the characterization of the academic fields themselves, namely that certain areas require inborn brilliance rather than hard work.\n\nstereotypes are all about who has an innate ability, says cimpian. if kids were instead exposed to the idea that success comes not because of fixed ability, but because of hard work over time (a so-called growth mindset, the idea developed by stanford psychologist carol dweck,) maybe those stereotypes would lose their punch.\n\nkids might also benefit from being exposed early on to fields like engineering, which aren't typically studied in high school, to demystify them, says cheryan.\n\nkatherine hobson is a freelance health and science writer based in brooklyn, n.y. she's on twitter: @katherinehobson.
fcc takes another step toward repeal of net neutrality\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption carolyn kaster/ap carolyn kaster/ap\n\nthe federal communications commission is working toward officially taking current net neutrality rules off the books. the agency took the requisite formal step of publishing the rules on thursday, opening the door for lawsuits from a number of state attorneys general and advocacy groups.\n\nsenate democrats have also been pushing for a special congressional vote to block regulations from going into effect, but have so far been one vote short of overcoming the republican majority. a similar vote would also face a very high hurdle in the republican-controlled house of representatives.\n\nnet neutrality it's a principle that internet providers should be neutral gateways that provide equal access to all legal web content. read all of npr's coverage of the topic here.\n\nthe pushback follows the december vote by the republican-led fcc to repeal obama-era net neutrality rules, which limit the power of internet service providers to influence loading speeds for specific websites or apps. the repeal can't take effect until the office of management and budget completes a review of the change.\n\nas npr has reported, the rules, put in place in 2015, banned cable and telecom companies from blocking or slowing down any websites or apps. they also prohibited broadband providers from striking special deals that would give some websites or apps 'priority' over others.\n\nthe fcc's repeal will allow both blocking and throttling by internet providers, leaving one requirement intact: that broadband companies — such as comcast, verizon and at&t — have to disclose to users how they handle web traffic. fcc chairman ajit pai has said the federal trade commission should then police violations. the ftc does not pre-emptively regulate them.\n\nthe history of net neutrality: how did we get here? listen · 8:11 8:11\n\nbroadband companies have said they do not intend to block, slow down or prioritize any web traffic as a result of the fcc's repeal, arguing that it's not in their interest to upset and potentially drive away subscribers. nevertheless, net neutrality supporters say the repeal will allow broadband companies to act as gatekeepers of how people use the internet, for example empowering internet providers to prioritize their own video-streaming services over competitors'.\n\na coalition of more than 20 state attorneys and several advocacy groups had already begun the process of challenging the fcc in court in previous weeks. now that the rules are officially published, the supporters of net neutrality are starting to re-file their formal lawsuits.\n\nthe legal challenges have the support of groups and internet companies including the aclu, fight for the future, public knowledge, reddit, vimeo, tumblr and mozilla. the internet association, which represents companies such as google and facebook, has also opposed the fcc's repeal of net neutrality.\n\neditor's note: npr's legal counsel had filed comments with the fcc on behalf of the public radio system, opposing the repeal of the 2015 net neutrality rules. you can read them here.
uber won't seek calif. permit renewal to test self-driving vehicles after fatal crash\n\nupdated at 9:10 a.m. et wednesday\n\nthe future of uber's self-driving car program is likely non-existent in california, at least for now.\n\nthe company announced it will not renew uber's permit through the state's department of motor vehicles to continue testing a fleet of autonomous-driving cars on california roads, following last week's deadly crash in tempe, ariz.\n\nwe decided to not reapply for a california dmv permit with the understanding that our self-driving vehicles would not operate on public roads in the immediate future,  a spokesperson told the verge.\n\nuber voluntarily suspended all of its self-driving programs in cities around the country. the current permit from the california dmv is set to expire on march 31st, according to the associated press.\n\nthe dmv will soon begin evaluating permit applications for companies interested in launching self-piloted car tests, although the likelihood of approval appears to be slim.\n\nthe dmv is allowed to begin issuing driverless testing and/or deployment permits on april 2, but that doesn't mean a manufacturer will meet the requirements or if we will approve them, a dmv spokes told the verge.\n\nalso on tuesday, chipmaker nvidia corp. announced it too will temporarily suspend self-driving tests, spokesman hector marinez told npr.\n\nthe company supplies the chips for uber's autonomous cars and has five test cars of its own operating in california and new jersey.\n\nalthough we developed our self-driving technology independently, as good engineering practice, we will wait to learn from uber's incident. the entire industry will learn from this incident, marinez said.\n\nthe change in uber's strategy follows a decision hours earlier by arizona gov. doug ducey to suspend testing in that state, where the fatal accident happened.\n\nthe crash, which occurred late at night in the phoenix suburb of tempe, killed 49-year-old elaine herzberg as she was walking her bicycle across a dimly lit city street.\n\nin a letter sent monday to uber ceo dara khosrowshahi, ducey called the incident an unquestionable failure to meet public safety expectations.\n\nthe local police chief initially called the incident unavoidable, but sentiment quickly changed after the release of video of the crash. the video, which depicts both internal and external views of the uber vehicle, shows the car's safety driver looking down, away from the road, as a pedestrian suddenly emerges into the headlights.\n\nthe governor cited the video on monday in both his letter and tweets about the crash.\n\ni found the video to be disturbing and alarming, and it raises many questions about the ability of uber to continue testing in arizona, ducey wrote in the letter.\n\nhe acknowledged ongoing investigations by the national transportation safety board and the national highway traffic safety administration but said arizona must take action now.\n\nit is unclear how exactly the uber suspension will be enforced. unlike california, arizona does not have a permitting system for autonomous vehicles. an executive order signed by ducey earlier this month requires only that testers submit a statement to state regulators attesting to their vehicles' safety. the order did note, however, that nothing in this order establishes a right to operate an autonomous vehicle in arizona.\n\naccording to a state department of transportation spokesperson, the suspension applies only to uber. arizona will continue to allow other companies to test autonomous vehicles.\n\nnonetheless, the announcement is a swift reversal for a state once called the wild west of self-driving cars. in 2016, ducey welcomed uber with open arms and wide open roads as the company sought alternatives to california's regulatory environment.\n\nfor its part, uber says it will continue to cooperate with investigators. a spokesperson for the company told npr that federal investigators have the vehicle, along with data from its onboard cameras and sensors. the spokesperson stressed uber's proactive steps in suspending testing after the crash, not only in arizona but in all other test cities — pittsburgh, san francisco and toronto.\n\nbut the accident comes as yet another controversy for a company trying to position itself for a public stock offering. the past year has seen uber struggle through a leadership crisis, a massive data breach, a sexual harassment scandal, and a high-profile trial ending in substantial concessions to its competitor, google subsidiary waymo.\n\nthe uber spokesperson says the company is unable to comment on details of the crash. last week, uber's ceo tweeted we're thinking of the victim's family.\n\ntechnology uber say it will cooperate with investigation after pedestrian killed in arizona uber say it will cooperate with investigation after pedestrian killed in arizona listen · 2:52 2:52\n\nin a separate incident, the national transportation safety board launched an investigation tuesday into the fatal crash of a tesla car equipped with a self-driving system. the vehicle struck a highway barrier, caught fire, and was later hit by another in northern california.\n\nthe mercury news reported the driver died in a hospital friday, the day of the crash.\n\nit is unclear if the autonomous driving system, called autopilot, was controlling the vehicle.
pandemic effects reach ocean depths\n\nthe global pandemic has led to a decline in ship traffic around the world, which means the oceans are quieter, given marine mammals a break from human activity.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nthings changed so much in 2020 as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic reached all parts of the world. and as we reported last july, that reach included underwater.\n\n(soundbite of whale singing)\n\nsimon: that's a humpback whale singing in glacier bay, alaska. scientists say the oceans have become quieter as shipping traffic has fallen. that could provide some relief for marine mammals, as npr's lauren sommer reports.\n\n(soundbite of archived npr broadcast)\n\nlauren sommer: a lot of scientists have had to cancel their field work this year, but not christine gabriele. she can work all alone in a boat on glacier bay. on a cool rainy morning, she spots what she's looking for and captures it on her smartphone.\n\nchristine gabriele: yeah, there are about five whales working this one little area, breathing when they're up.\n\n(soundbite of whale breathing)\n\nsommer: they're humpback whales.\n\ngabriele: it looks to me like they might be feeding on some schools of fish.\n\n(soundbite of whale breathing)\n\nsommer: gabriele is a wildlife biologist with glacier bay national park. for 35 years, the park service has been keeping track of the humpback population here.\n\ngabriele: one of the groups is a mother and calf, our seventh for the year. so that's really good news.\n\nsommer: gabriele also keeps track of them below the surface.\n\n(soundbite of whale singing)\n\nsommer: down at the bottom of the bay, there's a hydrophone continually recording. sound can travel for miles underwater, a lot farther than a whale can see. and humpbacks make all sorts of calls. they coordinate feeding or just stay in touch. but there are other things in the water that make noise, too.\n\n(soundbite of waves lapping)\n\nsommer: pre-pandemic, boats and cruise ships were common in glacier bay, and gabriele and her colleagues found that when ships are loud, the whales change their calls - kind of the way we talk at a loud party.\n\ngabriele: in order to communicate with each other, they might have to be close together, they might have to repeat themselves, or they might have to wait for a quieter moment.\n\nsommer: but this year, things sound different.\n\n(soundbite of whale calls)\n\ngabriele: it's much quieter. and just by listening to it, you can tell.\n\nsommer: the cruise ships are gone. boat tours are way down.\n\ngabriele: the pandemic has kind of created this unexpected opportunity for science, kind of a once-in-a-lifetime chance to look at whale communication behavior in its natural, undisturbed form.\n\nsommer: and scientists are finding that elsewhere in the pacific, too.\n\n(soundbite of whale calls)\n\ndavid barclay: so the southern resident killer whales are an endangered group of whales.\n\nsommer: david barclay is an assistant professor at dalhousie university. he measured ocean noise in the waters near vancouver, where those endangered killer whales live. he found there was about half as much noise in april compared to months prior.\n\nbarclay: even my mom said, it's kind of obvious, don't you think? less ships, less noise - i mean, duh, which is - you know, it's always hard when you get roasted by your mom.\n\nsommer: but it matters for killer whales because they need sound to hunt through echolocation, just like a bat does.\n\n(soundbite of whale clicking)\n\nsommer: ship sound can interfere with that, and it can cause chronic stress. but the quiet is likely a temporary thing says michael jasny, who works on marine mammals at the natural resources defense council.\n\nmichael jasny: right now there may be some break, but we have to look forward to what happens afterwards.\n\nsommer: jasny says the port of vancouver is a good example of where something is being done about ocean noise. ships get a discount on their fees if they're retrofitted to be quieter or simply slow down, which reduces noise. but that's just in one place.\n\njasny: you know, shipping is a global industry, and we're not seeing that kind of global commitment to change.\n\nsommer: still, jasny's hope is that what scientists learn from whales now could help protect them from human noise in the future.\n\nlauren sommer, npr news.\n\nsimon: lauren's report was first broadcast on morning edition in july.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

(@surgeon_general) february 29, 2020\n\nabout a month later, on friday, april 3, the centers for disease control and prevention recommended that americans wear cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials ... as an additional, voluntary public health measure.\n\nthis isn't the only example of a change or updating of mask-wearing policies during the coronavirus crisis. it's happened in countries around the world — from singapore to austria to kenya (which just announced one of the world's strictest policies — police are arresting anyone caught without a mask in their vehicle, on a bus or in a public place.)\n\nmeanwhile, some health agencies have taken a stand that calls for mask-wearing in public from the early stages of the outbreak — hong kong on jan. 24, mainland china on jan. 31.\n\ntoggle caption stringer for npr\n\nto understand why mask guidelines have been so varied, npr reached out to specialists in academia and in government. what we learned is that face mask guidelines are about science — but go beyond. the reasons for a policy may have to do with practical considerations like the national supply of masks but may also reflect cultural values and history.\n\nshifting guidelines\n\nin order to understand the range of guidelines, the first issue to consider is the data on the potential benefits of masks. as with so many points surrounding the novel coronavirus, there's not a clear-cut finding.\n\nbut there is emerging research and data that suggests transmission of covid-19 by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. such research has been coming out at least since february; the latest report is from singapore on april 1. these studies emphasize that people can spread the virus before realizing that they are sick — and that wearing a mask in public could help keep the infected person from spreading infectious droplets.\n\namong the reasons for reluctance on the part of some health agencies and places to urge mask wearing is the concern about the shortage of masks for medical workers. that's why the world health organization has stayed consistent in its recommendation, margaret harris of its coronavirus response team told npr. and that position is: yes to masks for health-care workers and people with symptoms, no for the general public.\n\nwho and other agencies have also raised concerns about the potential problems that could arise due to the wearing of a mask — for example, a false sense of security that would undermine other preventive measures or self-contamination from touching a contaminated mask.\n\nepidemiologist sergio brusin who works on the european center for disease control's coronavirus response, offered npr a similar rationale in an interview. however, ecdc only mentioned that face masks aren't effective in protecting the wearer on its public-facing website. a number of other health agencies — like who and the cdc — offered little explanation on their website.\n\nthe result of these sometimes incomplete messages: i think that if you talk to even the highly informed members of the general public and ask[ed] them a week, or two or three weeks ago, if the face masks work, they would say 'no' because they would have read cdc guidance, who guidance, says lawrence gostin, professor of global health law at georgetown university and director of the world health organization center on national & global health law.\n\nbut that wouldn't have been correct. based upon the science [about potential benefits of masks for the public] we knew at the time.\n\ngovernments should not have downplayed the importance of face masks [as a protective measure for the public], says leiyu shi, who researches comparative health systems and health policy at johns hopkins university, because it will make them [seem] very foolish when they change their stance. again and again, shi says.\n\nin response to npr's inquiry about its april 3 guideline change, the cdc said its change was driven by increasing and widespread transmission of the new coronavirus across the country, citing studies published in february and march showing pre-symptomatic and a symptomatic spread. a cdc spokesperson also noted reports from asian countries showing that a cloth face covering can reduce the chance of spreading respiratory droplets when people need to be in places with others.\n\nasked by npr about the surgeon general's earlier tweet about the ineffectiveness of masks, the office of the surgeon general issued a statement thursday noting that back in february dr. adams was following the cdc, who and other health organizations, which all recommended against wearing masks as a way to protect the person wearing them. the statement said that the understanding on spread from infected individuals who have not shown symptoms has since changed.\n\nthe impact of sars on mask guidance\n\nfor jeremy lim, adjunct associate professor of public health from the national university of singapore school of public health, east asia's threshold for taking action on face masks and more potentially preventive measures was sparked by sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, another coronavirus that swept through the region in 2003.\n\npolicymakers will always have to live with uncertainty and incomplete information,' lim says. for east asian countries, the attitude was 'better to be safe than to be sorry.' \n\nasked about the new cdc position in the u.s., public health academics like gostin and shi believe the guideline changes in the u.s. could have come sooner, given the emerging evidence of potential benefits.\n\ntoggle caption helmut fohringer/apa/afp via getty images\n\nbut it's not that simple just to issue guidelines based on science, noted many of the experts interviewed by npr. before issuing guidelines, governments also weigh how likely the public would be to follow them, they said.\n\ntoggle caption laurel chor for npr\n\nthe existing culture of mask-wearing helped asian societies in this regard — and is partly a legacy of sars. after surviving the outbreak 17 years ago, many people in this part of the world began wearing masks even if they just had a cold — to protect others but also for a sense of being protected from others, even if there isn't scientific data to back that up.\n\nthe mask is almost like a talisman, says harris of the who's coronavirus response team. people feel more secure and protected.\n\nthe culture is different in europe and the u.s., where people are less familiar with the idea of wearing a mask to protect others. people may think the face mask wearers they see want to be protected from them, harris says.\n\nto change the culture regarding masks or any other public health intervention, the u.s. needs to issue consistent messages from many different levels of government, says ross brownson, professor of public health at washington university in st. louis. he researched how research is translated into evidence-based policies.\n\nthis is because some listen to the scientists or the dr. faucis [the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases] of the world. there's another group that will listen to their local mayor. there's another group who might resonate with the governor. there's another group that might listen to president trump. brownson says.\n\nbrownson, shi and gostin all say that the heads of government should lead by example, practicing what they preach.\n\nit would be a complete shock to the american public to see widespread face mask use, says gostin. and i would like to see our leadership doing it to model that good behavior.\n\npresident trump said last friday, after the cdc updated guidelines were announced, that he would not follow them: sitting in the oval office, behind that beautiful resolute desk, the great resolute desk, i think wearing a face mask as i greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens. i don't know, somehow i don't see it for myself.\n\ntoggle caption kamil krzaczynski/afp via getty images\n\nthe president's, you know, an awfully powerful person. and if he doesn't think he needs it, why should i? gostin says.\n\ndifferent societies, different cultures\n\nthe matter of masks is also tied up with the willingness of citizens to heed advice from the government.\n\nin south korea, for instance, or even singapore, a recommendation from the government is taken really literally and in a very stringent way, says brusin of ecdc. other sources interviewed for this story suggest that is because there may be more trust in government than in western societies.\n\nother countries know that they have to communicate more to convince the citizens to abide by the values, recommendations, and culture has an influence into that, brusin adds.\n\namerica is a fiercely individualistic country, says gostin, where many might feel you couldn't force me to wear a mask. other researchers agreed with his assessment.\n\nbut the mask-wearing policies in other country do not necessarily reflect a more authoritian government, say some of npr's interviewees. perhaps we have a bit too glibly dismissed the chinese approach by saying that it's an authoritarian system. lim says, people are obedient, but it's really not about being [in] authoritarian [systems]. it's fundamentally accepting that society comes before self and putting the greater good ahead of one's own interests.\n\nand even while discussion of public mask-wearing continues, the academics interviewed for this article agree that social distancing is the most important measure the public can take to fight the virus.\n\ntoggle caption suhaimi abdullah/getty

opinion: iran is escalating its nuclear program. biden should not rush to respond\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption getty images getty images\n\nhenry rome (@hrome2) is senior analyst for iran, israel, and global macro issues at eurasia group, the global political risk research and consulting firm.\n\niran appears intent on generating a nuclear crisis early in joe biden's presidency. on monday, the iranian government said it began enriching uranium to the 20% level, which is close to the purity used in a nuclear weapon. it is preparing further steps in the coming months, according to a timeline passed by parliament. iran aims to compel biden to immediately and unconditionally remove the sanctions that president trump began to impose three years ago after he pulled the united states out of the iran nuclear deal. supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei repeated this demand on friday, calling on the u.s. to lift sanctions on iran immediately.\n\nbiden should not play into iran's pattern of nuclear threats combined with artificial deadlines. biden and his team will have time — and economic leverage — on their side. the incoming administration should take advantage of its strong position to diligently pursue its goal of strengthening and lengthening nuclear restrictions and should resist the pressure to act hastily.\n\nbiden will inherit significant economic leverage over iran. however misguided and erratic trump's approach was toward iran, the president renewed and strengthened the u.s.'s most comprehensive sanctions regime. trump failed to convert this leverage into diplomatic progress because he did not have a clear strategy or a realistic path to achieving it. while trump repeatedly urged iran to negotiate and make the big deal, secretary of state mike pompeo's demands for iran amounted to a call for regime change. trump also hired john bolton, an outspoken supporter of regime change, to serve as national security adviser. tehran had little incentive to talk, let alone offer concessions, to an administration that ultimately sought its surrender or demise.\n\nbiden will flip this logic. the president-elect has outlined concrete diplomatic objectives concerning iran — including reaffirming the importance of the 2015 nuclear agreement. the nuclear deal, signed by iran and six world powers, imposed limits on iran's nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief. biden and his team, which played key roles in securing that agreement when he was vice president, have proved they can negotiate in good faith and keep their word. by taking a more realistic approach, biden can unlock the power of the leverage trump accumulated.\n\nu.s. economic might should not be underestimated. combined with iran's endemic corruption and the coronavirus pandemic, u.s. sanctions have cratered the iranian economy, driven up inflation and eroded the purchasing power of average iranians. the u.s. measures have effectively cut off iran from the international financial system and targeted key sectors, including energy and manufacturing. oil exports, iran's most important source of hard currency, remain largely crippled by the threat of u.s. sanctions. the government has tried to boost the non-oil sector and focus on trade in goods that are not as easy for sanctions to interrupt. but iranian president hassan rouhani's latest budget proposal continues to rely significantly on oil. budgeting has a habit of focusing minds, and the message from rouhani's plan could not have been clearer: the long-term stability of the economy depends in large part on relations with washington.\n\ntehran will try to prevent biden from taking advantage of this leverage by creating an atmosphere of imminence and crisis. even as tehran reacted to the siege at the u.s. capitol this week, president rouhani repeated his call on biden to lift sanctions, saying, if you won't fulfill your commitments, we won't bow to you. tehran's efforts can be divided into three categories.\n\nfirst, the iranian president and his aides are urging biden to move quickly, before iran's june presidential elections. rouhani, a relative moderate, is serving his final term. a more conservative leader will likely prevail in the election, potentially creating a window of opportunity to deal with rouhani on his way out the door. but, as analyst ariane tabatabai and i have argued, the impending election will not fundamentally alter tehran's strategic outlook or its openness to negotiations. rouhani's successor will not necessarily be more hostile to diplomacy even if he is more anti-american. washington should not expect that its policies can dictate the outcome of the iranian election, and it should not allow the election to dictate its own policies.\n\nsecond, tehran is trying to create a ticking clock with its nuclear program. the parliament passed legislation that sets up a series of dates when iran is to take new nuclear steps. the most provocative next step, a significant reduction in international inspector access, is slated for late february. but these deadlines are purely artificial. iran's nuclear policy is ultimately under the control of khamenei, not the rambunctious, hawkish parliament or the lame-duck president. deadlines can and will be fudged depending on the overall political environment.\n\nthird, tehran continues to bolster its forces and lash out in the region, a not-so-subtle reminder to biden about its capability to cause trouble. washington noted with increasing concern last week that iranian-backed forces were planning to attack u.s. soldiers based in iraq to mark the anniversary of the assassination of iranian maj. gen. qassem soleimani. (foreign minister javad zarif responded with the bizarre suggestion that israeli agent-provocateurs are plotting attacks against americans in iraq.)\n\non monday, armed iranian forces boarded a south korean tanker and are apparently holding it hostage until seoul facilitates the release of some $7 billion of iranian assets frozen in korean banks. the following day, iran launched significant exercises with military drones.\n\nbut these shows of force may end up being self-defeating, as they turn more countries against tehran. for example, increased iranian provocations may push gulf arab states closer to israel, strengthening the agreements normalizing relations between these countries and israel that were brokered by the trump administration last year.\n\neven if iran does escalate its nuclear program or its provocative regional activity, biden has tools to deflect the pressure. he plans to strengthen relations with key u.s. allies, including france, germany and the united kingdom, which are party to the nuclear agreement. under trump, european states spent as much time condemning washington as they did tehran. with unity between the u.s. and europe, new iranian provocations will only further isolate tehran. the three european states on wednesday issued a sharp condemnation of iran's latest nuclear steps, a sign of future u.s.-european unity. russia and china, the other signatories to the agreement, will also oppose iranian efforts to significantly expand its nuclear program. israel will remain laser-focused on iran and probably will set clear red lines to box in iranian activity.\n\nhow biden decides to proceed with iran will depend in part on his other priorities, as well as the views of u.s. allies. during the presidential campaign and transition, biden and his aides indicated a desire to bolster the verification provisions of the nuclear deal and extend the duration of its physical restrictions. they have also expressed an intention to conduct broader, regional negotiations. all of these steps will require painstaking multilateral diplomacy. ultimately, biden should not feel rushed for these critical negotiations — and he should leverage his sanctions inheritance to advance these objectives.
trumpism suffers untold damage in its collision with the u.s. capitol\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption stefani reynolds/bloomberg via getty images stefani reynolds/bloomberg via getty images\n\nit took a building to bring down donald trump.\n\nunleashing the angriest of his supporters this week against the u.s. capitol may have been only the culmination of trump's 60-month campaign against the washington establishment.\n\nbut it was also its undoing. and his.\n\nwhen the crowd that trump whipped up on the ellipse marched up the national mall with his blessing and encouragement, they became a mob assaulting and invading the capitol.\n\nthe capitol is the closest thing to a national civic temple we have or would ever want in america. people who have been there once remember the awe they felt. people who go there nearly every day can still have that feeling.\n\nthat was why we were sickened by the real-time video and endlessly repeated images of desecration and terror on wednesday — images we will live with for the rest of our lives.\n\nin substance, the mob's aim was to stop the orderly, bipartisan process of electing a president. serious as that was, what gave it the force to shock and change minds was the spectacle of it happening where it did.\n\namericans were sickened, and they shared that feeling across a wider spectrum of the nation's political sentiment than at any time since the terror attacks of sept. 11, 2001.\n\nthere are no words to capture the spirit of the capitol. and it is no accident that the occasions on which trump has seemed most presidential — and was most praised for it — were his state of the union addresses, delivered to joint sessions of congress in the house chamber.\n\nhe entered that chamber for those addresses through a door that on wednesday was barricaded with furniture, plainclothes officers crouching behind with weapons drawn. rioters could be seen through the shattered windows. members of congress, old and young, men and women, republicans and democrats, ducked and scrambled and hid.\n\nforgotten for the moment was the business at hand. but to its eternal credit, the congress returned to that same chamber later that night. it resumed the counting of votes from the electoral college, votes cast on dec. 14 in 50 state capitals and in the district of columbia. votes certified by every governor in america. votes upheld in more than 60 cases in state and federal court.\n\nthere had been talk of reconvening the session at a more secure location. there were obvious reasons to do so.\n\nbut there was one overriding reason to come back to the capitol. and that was the capitol itself. no other venue could invoke the same history and convey the same legitimacy. the capitol is the embodiment of constitutional authority – and also of our national spirit. a moving example for many was the sight of second-term congressman andy kim of new jersey, the son of korean immigrants, down on his knees in the rotunda after midnight, helping clean up of bottles and trash rioters had left behind.\n\njust ransacked, just garbage and debris everywhere, all of it all over the statues, all over the floor, he told a reporter. it was really painful to see this room and this building that i love so much hurting.\n\nprovocations aplenty\n\nthe invasion of the capitol was not the first act of resistance to the election by trump or his most intense loyalists. the rioters wanted to stop the count because trump had told them that would mean another election could be held — at least in the states he falsely claimed he had won.\n\nthree days earlier, the nation was able to hear an exceptionally clear hourlong tape of phone call of trump urging, cajoling and pressuring state officials in georgia to find enough votes to change the outcome of the november election in that state. it was stunning, undeniable and potentially incriminating.\n\nand yet we heard few cries of impeachment, few calls for an early transfer of power. until wednesday. and since then, those cries and calls are coming from a growing chorus in congress, including members of both parties. they are even coming from people such as john kelly, the retired four-star marine general who served as trump's chief of staff for a year and a half, and the iconic retired gen. colin powell, a republican who was secretary of state under president george w. bush.\n\nthese calls came despite the fact that trump is leaving office anyway, in less than two weeks.\n\nwhy the sudden collapse of trump's presidency? yes, part of what is happening relates to the pandemic and economic unease and all the other transgressions that led to his impeachment and to his electoral defeat. yes, it stems from his refusal to accept that defeat.\n\nbut the final nail was the assault on the capitol.\n\nmore than a physical space\n\nthe capitol was begun in 1793 when george washington laid the cornerstone, and it has been the site where congress has counted the electoral college vote every time since the election of 1800. work on the capitol dome was finished during the civil war, when abraham lincoln insisted on its completion as a measure of faith in the future.\n\nit has been assaulted before. british troops burned it in 1814, before it had even been completed. more recent violent acts have included bombings and fatal shootings. in 1954, a group of puerto rican separatists fired pistols from the house gallery striking several members of congress.\n\nstill fresh for many is the memory of the capitol on sept. 11, 2001, when members were told to evacuate because one more jet airliner hijacked that day was still aloft. a commission later determined that jet was destined for the capitol dome when its passengers retook the cockpit and crashed it into a pennsylvania field. the thought of what could have happened has haunted everyone who remembers it.\n\nbut the comparative rarity of those attacks and the reverberating shocks from them underscore the building's significance. the structure is magnificent, the art inside is priceless. the decisions and debates heard here shaped our history through two centuries. the most important of our leaders have lain in state here.\n\nbut that is not what lends timeless significance to the place. what matters most is the message it conveys.\n\nit is the manifestation of the concepts of liberty, self-determination and the rule of law. it embodies the sacrifices of all who have served the country, and especially those who died in that service.\n\nif we still have the capacity as a nation to honor all of that, we should be as disturbed when a president defies the law as we are when rioters desecrate the place where the law is made.
'we failed you': female mounties receive apology after decades of harassment\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption xinhua news agency/getty images xinhua news agency/getty images\n\nfor decades, female officers belonging to the royal canadian mounted police have claimed harassment, discrimination and abuse within the mounties.\n\nthey received a historic apology on thursday from rcmp commissioner bob paulson, along with news that the government has set aside a multimillion-dollar compensation package.\n\ninstead of succeeding and thriving in a supportive and inclusive workplace, many women have suffered careers scarred by gender and sexual discrimination, bullying and harassment, paulson told reporters.\n\nat times visibly tearful, paulson added: you came to the rcmp wanting to personally contribute to your community and we failed you. we hurt you. for that, i am truly sorry.\n\nhe apologized to all canadians, adding that he knows they are disappointed by some of these very public and shameful examples of disgraceful conduct within our ranks.\n\nwatch his remarks here:\n\nyoutube\n\nthe government has set aside $100 million for the compensation package — that's about u.s. $75 million — but there is no cap on payments, as reporter dan karpenchuk tells our newscast unit. here's more from dan:\n\ntwo class-action lawsuits against the rcmp have been before the courts for five years. they include allegations of rape, unwanted sexual touching, physical assault, sexist comments, threats, gender discrimination, harassment and bullying. it's expected that about 1,000 former and current employees of the rcmp will seek compensation.\n\nthe agreement must still be approved by a federal court, the cbc explains. it adds that compensation claims will be paid at six different levels, based on the severity of the acts and the impact on the woman's welfare and career. the process will be confidential, but does not compel women to refrain from speaking about their experiences publicly.\n\njanet merlo and linda davidson, the former mounties who filed the two separate class actions, welcomed paulson's apology at the emotional news conference. according to the toronto star, while serving in the force, merlo endured sexist comments, sexual pranks, verbal abuse and double standards, while davidson was groped by a male supervisor who shoved his hands down her shirt and grabbed her breast.\n\ni represent 500 women who have reached out and who experience the same things that i did and that linda did, merlo told reporters in video carried by star. they all wanted change too. they all loved the rcmp, they loved their jobs, and they just wanted it to be a better place to work. a place for their daughters to want to work. a good career, a beautiful career. and for that i'm very thankful that today finally arrived.
it's agreed: nobel prize in economics awarded for contract theory\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jonathan nackstrand/afp/getty images jonathan nackstrand/afp/getty images\n\nthe 2016 nobel prize in economics was awarded monday to oliver hart and bengt holmström for their work in contract theory — developing a framework to understand agreements like insurance contracts, employer-employee relationships and property rights.\n\nthe issues they have worked on are ripped from the headlines — should prisons be privatized? — as well as deeply familiar to anyone who's earned a paycheck or paid for insurance.\n\nholmström's work has explored how to balance risk and incentives — both in idealized theory and in real-life situations. one early insight, according to the nobel committee, was that high-risk industries should have more fixed salaries while stable industries should more often consider performance bonuses.\n\nthe questions holmström and his co-authors considered are concrete ones: how do you reward ceos for improving a company's performance, without just showering them with money when the company is thriving because of luck? how do you evaluate teachers' performance without encouraging them to teach to a test? how does incentive pay need to change as an employee's career progresses and they are less likely to be motivated by future promotions? how can a team be rewarded for effort without incentivizing free-loaders to slack off and profit off their colleagues' work?\n\nhart, meanwhile, explored a fundamental shortcoming of contracts — namely, that no one can predict the future and there are too many future variables to possibly codify all of them in a contract.\n\nso, when the unforeseen inevitably pops up, who decides how to deal with it? this is the field of incomplete contracts, and hart wrote that a contract should identify who has the right to make future decisions — a significant kind of power.\n\nthe theory of incomplete contracts provides a way of thinking about which government services can benefit from being privatized, and which are better off under government control. here's the background summary provided by the nobel committee:\n\nsuppose a manager who runs a welfare-service facility can make two types of investment: some improve quality, while others reduce cost at the expense of quality. additionally, suppose that such investments are difficult to specify in a contract. if the government owns the facility and employs a manager to run it, the manager will have little incentive to provide either type of investment, since the government cannot credibly promise to reward these efforts. if a private contractor provides the service, incentives for investing in both quality and cost reduction are stronger.\n\nhart found that privatized services have a strong incentive for cost reduction — but often at the expense of the quality of services provided. hart accordingly raised concerns about private prisons.\n\nthe work of the two laureates has influenced not just economics but law and politics, the committee writes in a press release.\n\nhart was born in england and holmström in finland, but both have made their careers in the u.s.; hart is a professor at harvard and holmström is a professor at mit.\n\nthe economics prize was established nearly 50 years ago and was not one of the original nobel prizes. its full name is the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel.\n\nthe prizes in physiology or medicine, physics and chemistry, as well as the nobel peace prize, were announced last week. the prize in literature will be announced on thursday.
senegal's biggest art biennial returns with contemporary exhibits\n\nafrican artists are convening in dakar, senegal for the dak'art biennale. the month-long event showcases the latest developments in visual arts.\n\nmelissa block, host:\n\nthe latest in african visual arts is now on display in senegal's capital. dakar is host to a month-long arts festival that's held every other year. npr's ofeibea quist-arcton is taking it all in and has this report.\n\nofeibea quist-arcton, byline: the senegalese capital is buzzing with a 12th edition of the dak'art contemporary african art biennial and playing host to artists and art-lovers from across the continent and all over the world. simon njami from cameroon is the artistic director of the dak'art festival titled re-enchantments. he says africa must learn to become re-enchanted with itself through art.\n\nsimon njami: (speaking french).\n\nquist-arcton: the curator says africa must have confidence in itself to dream and make things happen. njami has selected a younger group of africans this year among the 70 exhibiting artists from 24 countries. the wheels of time must change, he says, to mix up the stew and make sure it's not the same old soup of established artists in the cooking pot.\n\nhe's chosen an unusual backdrop for the international art exhibition. senegal's cavernous, abandoned palais de justice, the former law-courts-turned-biennial space with its broken windows and light seeping in, and in a courtyard houses a display of silk, african-inspired clothing hanging on a washing line. to the right is what looks like a gorgeous, giant light shade made of transparent plastic bags.\n\nstep across the cracked flooring to an audiovisual installation of a topical subject, migration - a raft on the water from senegal to paris. artists from algeria via nigeria to the democratic republic of congo in the heart of africa - all are on display. and it's impressive, say these paris-based african visitors.\n\nsam lambert: i am sam lambert from angola. i think it's a great opportunity for young artists or young african artists. actually, i didn't expect it to be this good. and it's quite inspiring, really.\n\namah avivi: my name is amah avivi. i'm from togo, but i live in paris. and i'm here in dak'art for the biennial with some friends. and i love the vibe and the spirit this biennial brings in dak'art and to show different african artists' works especially because in the world, people forgot about african inspiration, african creativity. and here, in this biennial, you can see that we have more and more african creativity coming out.\n\nquist-arcton: biennial exhibitions and installations are dotted all over dakar, gracing the city with its dramatic atlantic ocean view setting. ofeibea quist-arcton, npr news, dakar.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
uganda's ruler museveni defends violent crackdown in bid for 6th term\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption john muchucha/ap john muchucha/ap\n\nugandan president yoweri museveni arrived at his ranch in kisozi, about a five-hour drive from the capital kampala, by helicopter. as the 76-year-old leader walked into an interview with npr, he was jovial, cracking jokes, eager to show off the 10,000 cows that roam this ranch.\n\nbut just days away from an election on thursday, the mood in the country is far more grave. museveni is facing a formidable challenge from robert kyagulanyi, a singer-turned-politician better known by the stage name bobi wine.\n\nat 38, bobi wine has electrified young people across uganda. and museveni, who has historically clamped down on anyone who poses a real threat to his power, has unleashed his security forces on him. in a press conference on tuesday, bobi wine said the military had killed his driver and that his home was raided.\n\neven before the electoral campaign began, bobi wine was arrested several times. in one instance, he was tortured so badly, he flew to the united states to receive treatment.\n\nafrica uganda's museveni faces tough challenge in presidential election uganda's museveni faces tough challenge in presidential election listen · 6:58 6:58\n\nin november, he was arrested once more, and 54 people were killed after protesters took to streets demanding his release. journalists were attacked and detained while trying to cover his arrest.\n\nuganda has already changed the constitution twice, allowing museveni to remain in power. in the past week, his government shut down social media and his police chief warned that anyone causing trouble on election day will regret being born.\n\nnpr spoke to museveni for more than an hour last week, about the elections, his opponent and why, after 35 years in power, he is seeking a sixth term. these are some highlights of the conversation, edited for clarity and length.\n\ninterview highlights\n\non pre-election violence\n\n[protesters] were attacking other people. because they have been told that they should cause an uprising here like happened in libya, like happened in syria... so they are [american] agents. they are no longer part of a protest movement. they are now agents of foreign schemes, here.\n\naccording to the police procedures, if people are protesting, there is a way you handle it — but if now they overrun — overrun, for instance, a police station — you will have to stop it by using lethal fire. rioting and attacking civilians and attacking property, it is something that we cannot accept.\n\non opposition leader bobi wine's arrests\n\nhe's not been arrested for putting forward ideas. he's being arrested for rioting and causing danger to other people. that's why he's been arrested. but there are other opposition leaders who are not being arrested. why, why him?\n\nthere are other opposition leaders who have never even seen a police station. but these ones whom you are talking about, they want to use violence to influence people, and that one our society cannot allow.\n\non why he thinks he needs to be president for another term\n\n[ugandans] don't have to work hard. now, that's a big struggle, which these know-it-all from [the] outside don't know, because in other parts of the world, people are pressured to work either by the environment, which is hostile, or by competition between man and man. but here, fools can survive.\n\non why he believes george washington could leave office after eight years, but he can't after 35 years in power\n\nanybody can run [the u.s.]. the problem is that in our case, the direction is not set. so it's very risky, very risky. it actually showed the lack of seriousness of those who [say] that you just go, just [leave power]. people don't know whether to go north or south, and you say, you just go.\n\nyes, if people are already clear that the direction is the north and ... there's no more argument about that, then anybody can lead. i can say now, you know the way, let me go.\n\non freedom of the press\n\nyes, we are committed to the freedom of the press, but see, the press, especially the western press, is arrogant. you don't want to learn; you know it all. then you come on and impose your ignorance on our society.\n\nso that's the problem we are having. how can we continue dealing with these arrogant ignoramuses? so if they change their attitude from arrogance to inquisitiveness and investigation, i'm very happy.
sen. kamala harris considers 'a collection of factors' related to possible 2020 bid\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption zach gibson/getty images zach gibson/getty images\n\nas possible 2020 presidential candidates start announcing exploratory committees, there's talk that sen. kamala harris may be on the verge of launching herself into the ring.\n\non tuesday, her memoir the truths we hold hits shelves. in it, the california democrat ticks through her résumé and credentials, while mixing in a look at her upbringing and family life.\n\nharris spoke with npr on a number of wide-ranging topics, from her mother to her views on the death penalty and the kavanaugh hearings to whether joe biden would make a good president. but she didn't commit to a presidential run herself.\n\nhere are some highlights from the discussion.\n\npeople like you write books like this mostly when they are getting ready to launch a campaign — it's a get to know me on a national level.\n\ni have not made up my mind. there are a collection of factors to consider ... they include my family, they include the need for real leadership in this country and whether i can provide that leadership. so there are a number of factors, but i will keep you posted. but i am not prepared to make any announcement at the moment.\n\nmuch of the book is framed around your mother. how does introducing her to your readers help them understand you?\n\nmy mother was a force of nature. she was somebody who really committed her life to the service of others. she is and was somebody who was incredibly smart but incredibly loving at the same time. these things coexisted with my mother. and there's so much that i learned from her that we would call values and principals, and reason for being.\n\nmany people will not know that your mom was an immigrant from india. why did she come to the u.s.?\n\nmy mother was 19 when she graduated college. she wanted to study science. she went to her father, my grandfather, and my grandmother and said, i want to go and study at one of the best schools for that. and my grandfather, who had an arranged marriage to my grandmother, and this was in the 1950s that my mother approached them, my mother said she wanted to go and study at uc berkeley california and my grandfather said go. and so they put her on a plane, and this is when transcontinental travel was not very common, she had never been to the united states. but my grandfather was really quite progressive, and he said to his eldest child who was his daughter, my mother: you go and you study.\n\ntruth be told, i believe that the plan was that she would then get that degree and come back and have a good arranged marriage in india, but my mother being who she was, the daughter of a father who fought for india's independence, she was naturally attracted to the civil rights movement that was exploding all over the united states — but also in the bay area... she became very involved in the civil rights movement, and met my father. instead of going back to india and having an arranged marriage, she had a marriage based on love. and that really was, in many ways, an ultimate act of courage and optimism and really set in place the foundation for how i think of the world.\n\nas you mentioned, they were both activists — met during the civil rights movement. in light of that, did you ever consider representing marginalized people as a defender? why did you decide to be a prosecutor?\n\nthe truths we hold an american journey by kamala harris hardcover, 319 pages | purchase close overlay buy featured book your purchase helps support npr programming. how?\n\nat a very young age, i knew i wanted to be a lawyer. and mostly because the heroes among many of the civil rights movements were the lawyers. these individuals who understood the skill of the profession of law to translate the passion from the streets to courtrooms of our country and do the work that we know must constantly be done of reminding people of that promise we articulated in 1776, that we're all equal and should be treated that way.\n\nmy family and extended family thought, at best, it was a curious decision and with some of them i had to defend the decision like one would a thesis.\n\nwhy did they not expect that from you?\n\nthey said, why would you go and be a part of an institution that is not always fair and does not always pursue justice? some would call it the persecutors office, not the prosecutor's office. ... law enforcement has such a profound and direct impact on the most vulnerable among us. and there is a duty and a responsibility to be a voice for the most voiceless and vulnerable and to do the work of justice. and that's the work i wanted to do. ... it is also understanding that the victims of crime come from the same communities as those who have been treated unfairly. the victims of crime deserve a voice. i, for a while, specialized in child sexual assault cases. i'm gonna tell you, prosecuting those cases were extraordinarily difficult and some of the most important work i did.\n\nyou have been criticized by some on the left over the death penalty, for defending the death penalty. how to you explain your position?\n\nto be clear, i am personally opposed to the death penalty. i have always been — and i remain — opposed to the death penalty. i believe for a number of reasons that it is a flawed system both in terms of the way that it has been applied historically, which is disproportionately against people of color and poor people.\n\nbut you still think there's a place for it.\n\nno. i don't. but as attorney general of the state of california, i had a constitutional responsibility to represent my clients. and one of my clients happened to be the california department of corrections and the district attorneys of california who did seek, in many jurisdictions, a death penalty sentence.\n\ngoing back to the brett kavanaugh hearings, do you regret how that unfolded for her [christine blasey ford]?\n\nwhat i regret about her experience is that she was treated as though she was on trial. she was not on trial. she had done nothing wrong. ... she decided that what she had known needed to be known by the decision-makers. so she reached out to her member of congress, to make sure that those people who have the responsibility for vetting this guy knew this thing that she knew. and she wanted to remain anonymous because it was never about her. she initiated all that visited her in the ensuing months because she felt an obligation as a citizen to make sure that those who are in a position of power and responsibility had all the information.\n\nand what ended up happening was a circus. what ended up happening was she was vilified for doing what she believed was the right thing to do. and again, having personally prosecuted sexual assault cases, i was incredibly disappointed and frustrated by the lack of information that leaders have about the nature of these kinds of issues like sexual assault. and how they treated her, i thought was regrettable and really unfortunate. and i have nothing but praise for her and her courage, including what it did, which was require people to have a national conversation about an issue that is seldom discussed — and impacts a wide range of people in all genders, in every socioeconomic background, race, religion and ethnicity.\n\nbig picture question: why do you think donald trump won?\n\ni'll give you a crude analysis. i mean, if we had hour upon hours, i could get into much more depth and specificity. but here's my take on it: over the last 10 years in our country, at least, we've seen an incredible amount of change — the great recession, the term great depression was already taken. but in america, then and today, people are literally walking around with the proverbial tin cup. economic upheaval like we have not seen in generations. people lost their homes, they lost their jobs, many of whom will never be able to buy a home or have a permanent job again. people are reading about the browning of america and the immigrants are coming. and we had barack obama as president and then we had a women running as president and we had a jew running for president and gay people can marry and: oh my god, oh my god. and then you talk about the impact of technology and automation ...\n\nthere's an incredible amount of change that has happened in a relatively short period of time, and it has understandably had a lot of people feeling displaced, wondering and asking a question about where do they fit in, their relevance, are they obsolete. i think it brings into question questions of identity. what does it mean to be an american? what does it mean to be a productive american? what does it mean to be a breadwinner or the leader of a household? and people are also resentful of this change and where will they fit into it and will this include them. and [trump] read it accurately. and then he took it to the lowest common denominator. [he said] it is us versus them instead of what real leadership would be about — which is to read it and say, hey everybody, we're all in this together. and my vision of the future includes you. you are in my vision of the future. we will get through this together.\n\nyou mention in your book about your relationship with a former attorney general of delaware, beau biden, who passed away a few years ago of cancer. you call him an incredible friend. do you think his father, joe biden, would make a good president?\n\ni think there are many people who would make a good president. and i got to know joe as a person through beau. they had an incredibly special relationship. it was really very special. i'm very fond of joe biden, so you're not gonna hear me criticize joe biden. i think he's a great guy.\n\ni started with an assumption about why you wrote this book, but i'm going to end by just asking you, what did you want to communicate?\n\nthe election of november 2016 — obviously it was a national election for president, but it was also the night i was elected to the united states senate. and as i write in the book, even just that night, which was the impetus for writing this book, i was experiencing our election and watching on the monitors this thing happen to our country. and i write about how my godson came up to me crying, auntie kamala, this man can't win. and he was afraid. and people were afraid. and my speech, impromptu that night, was we must fight. and that there is so much worth fighting for. and i wrote the book to talk about that.\n\ndo you think your mom would want you to run for president?\n\ni think my mother would want me to do whatever she thought i wanted to do. my mother, i write about it in the book, when she was in the hospital — and it was when i was just starting my race for attorney general — she had, at that point, disassociated from many things. she was turning things off. she was otherwise a voracious reader and passionate. she'd scream at the tv when necessary, when some debate was happening. and she was laying with her face turning the other way so her back was where i was, because i was just spending time with her. and then she said, kamala, how's the race coming along? and i said, well mommy, they say they're gonna kick my ass. and she turned around in the bed and looked at me with this big smile across her face — and that says it all.\n\nsydney harper and peter granitz produced and edited this interview for broadcast. milton guevara adapted it for the web.
'black panther': science, heroes — and how comics changed the world\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption marvel studios 2018 marvel studios 2018\n\nyou don't need me to tell you how exciting or important marvel studio's black panther has become. it's one of the most anticipated films of the year — and broke records for pre-release ticket sales.\n\nthe story of a black superhero who is king of an african nation that is the most technologically sophisticated society on earth has struck a deep cord in a country being reminded, once again, of the long, sad place of racism in its cultural fabric. many excellent writers have unpacked the significance of black panther for black americans (examples are here and here).\n\nbut there is another place comics hold in our collective imagination: the link between science and the hero.\n\nmy own story runs deeply through the history of marvel comics in culture. in the 1970s, when i was growing up, marvel's stories were a profound source of comfort and inspiration to me. much to my parents chagrin, i waited with anticipation each week for the release of titles ranging from spiderman to iron man to the x-men.\n\ni was a nerdy, science-geek outcast growing up as the definitive outsider in my town. back then, there weren't many deep fans of comics. most of the kids i knew were not interested. the universe marvel built was a long way from becoming the cultural juggernaut it is today.\n\nbut hidden in the often silly and campy narratives of those comics was an idea that grew like a seed in the imagination of kids like me: science and heroism were indelibly linked.\n\nmany of marvel's greatest superheroes were scientific geniuses; this includes t'challa who is both a brilliant scientist and a king. these ordinary people gained their fantastic abilities through their mastery of science and technology. science is also why t'challa's nation, wakanda, is globally preeminent.\n\na respect for the transformative capacities of science has always been an essential feature of comics — and of marvel in particular. as i noted many times about my experiences working as the science consultant for dr. strange, the marvel cinematic universe is filled with positive images of the excitement of scientific research. given their reach, i have been deeply grateful knowing these movies are delivering affirming representations of women and men doing science for good. there are kids out there right now being inspired by the fantastic possibilities of science in the same way i was when i was kid.\n\nso, one message in marvel comics has always been that science can be liberating.\n\nbut, of course, with great power comes great responsibility. the marvel universe is also full of villains who are equally adept at using science for, you know, evil. so these stories are not just about science, they are also about the choices individuals make with the power science and technology can grant. much ink (and many electrons) has been spilled over the links between superhero stories and the storehouse of myth all human culture draws from. it was joseph campbell who first articulated the universal myth of the hero's journey when a man or women undergoes superhuman tests to bring back some boon to their community. at their best, superhero comics have found ways to personalize these struggles by imagining how science-granted superpowers do not change the dynamics of human longing or grief. heroism then becomes recognizing there must be a repayment made to the human community.\n\nso much of our imagined science-fiction futures have been written by white men. black voices have rarely been given room in popular culture to explore their conceptions of what a future could, or should, look like. and while the original black panther was the vision of white men, the image and world brought to screen is one created by black screenwriter ryan coogler and team. one of the most compelling aspects of the black panther story is that africans, though wakanda, have fully won the future. it is from that position that t'challa's begins to reconsider wakanda's place in the world. this is the essence of the hero's choice.\n\ncomics have always been a place where science is cast as the engine powering heroism. the relatively small place comics used to occupy in popular culture meant that connection was mostly a secret inspiration for folks that considered themselves outsiders.\n\ni, for one, am more than happy to see that inspiration go truly global. perhaps it can do some real good.\n\n(for another take on this theme read physicist clifford johnson's excellent essay here.)\n\nadam frank is a co-founder of the 13.7 blog, an astrophysics professor at the university of rochester and author of the upcoming book light of the stars: alien worlds and the fate of the earth. his scientific studies are funded by the national science foundation, nasa and the department of education. you can keep up with more of what adam is thinking on facebook and twitter: @adamfrank4.
atlantic ocean current slows down to 1,000-year low, studies show\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption david goldman/ap david goldman/ap\n\nan atlantic ocean current that helps regulate the global climate has reached an 1,000-year low, according to two new studies in the journal nature.\n\nwhile scientists disagree about what's behind the sluggish ocean current, the shift could mean bad news for the climate. the atlantic meridional overturning circulation [amoc] – often called the conveyor belt of the ocean – exchanges warm water from the equator with cold water in the arctic.\n\nthe last 100 years has been its lowest point for the last few thousand years, jon robson, a researcher at the university of reading and one of the study's authors, told the washington post. these two new papers do point strongly to the fact that the overturning has probably weakened over the last 150 years.\n\nthe amoc plays a key role in the distribution of heat across the earth, but that is being disrupted by melting ice, particularly from greenland, causing larger volumes of freshwater to flow through the oceans, says david thornalley, a geologist at university college london and the lead author of one of the new studies.\n\na key part of the overturning circulation, this amoc, is the formation of dense water, he tells here & now's lisa mullins. the problem is that freshwater isn't very dense and it stops you forming those dense waters.\n\nmeltwater from the greenland ice sheet is lighter and floats on the surface, disrupting the ocean's circulation, research recent shows.\n\nsome scientists are concerned the influx of freshwater could cause the current to shut down altogether. this was the premise of the 2004 film, the day after tomorrow, but thornalley says the impact of the slowdown likely won't be as catastrophic as depicted in the film.\n\nscientists are worried about the amoc shutting down because evidence from the past suggests that it actually did happen during the last ice age, and it is possible that it could happen in the future, although at the moment we consider it very unlikely, he says.\n\nthe challenge for scientists is to monitor when the amoc may reach a tipping point when the system can't recover quickly.\n\nwhat we don't really know is: are we close to one of those tipping points where runaway processes could suddenly allow the mark to weaken much quicker than it has been doing? thornally says.\n\nas the system weakens, scientists are observing a kind of surprising response to global warming, where you can actually get regional cooling in parts of the globe, climate scientist max holmes told npr in 2006.\n\nin the study led by thornalley, researchers collected ocean sediment and measured the size of the grains to determine how the strength of the current has changed. larger grains mean a faster flowing current.\n\nyou can think about a mountain stream and how that stuff is often associated with boulders and rocks because there's a lot of energy to move those boulders; whereas if you think about sort of the sluggish mississippi, that's a muddy bottomed river, he says.\n\nthe other study examined the pattern of ocean temperatures, which researchers concluded has contributed to pockets of record warm and record cold right next to one another.\n\nwhile there is an ongoing dispute about what is causing the slowdown, scientists agree that it could have a dramatic impact on ocean ecosystems, such as coral reefs and deep-sea sponge grounds.\n\nthese delicate ecosystems rely on ocean currents to supply their food and disperse their offspring, prof murray roberts, who co-ordinates the atlas project at the university of edinburgh, told bbc news. ocean currents are like highways spreading larvae throughout the ocean, and we know these ecosystems have been really sensitive to past changes in the earth's climate.\n\nmuch like other issues concerning climate change, thornalley say preventing the amoc slowdown depends on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nthe only thing we really can do is obviously try and prevent global warming because that's the root cause of why we think it's weakening now with increasing temperatures, he says.
how the trump campaign weakened the republican platform on aid to ukraine\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption sergei ilnitsky/afp/getty images sergei ilnitsky/afp/getty images\n\none of the questions raised over the course of this year's presidential race is about how a president trump would deal with russian president vladimir putin.\n\none reason to wonder: the republican party platform's new language on policy towards ukraine.\n\nwhen republican party leaders drafted the platform prior to their convention in cleveland last month, they had relatively little input from the campaign of then-presumptive nominee donald trump on most issues — except when it came to a future republican administration's stance on ukraine.\n\nit started when platform committee member diana denman tried to insert language calling for the u.s. to provide lethal defensive weapons to the ukrainian government, which is fighting a separatist insurrection backed by russia. denman says she had no idea she was going into a fire fight, calling it an interesting exchange, to say the least.\n\ndenman is a long time gop activist from texas. when she presented her proposal during a platform subcommittee meeting last month, two gentleman, whom denman said were part of the trump campaign, came over, looked at the language, and asked that it be set aside for further review.\n\nshe says after further discussion the pair had to make some calls and clear it. she says they found the language was still too strong.\n\nthe trump campaign convinced the platform committee to change denman's proposal. it went from calling on the u.s. to provide ukraine lethal defensive weapons to the more benign phrase appropriate assistance.\n\nit's more than semantics. many republicans have been demanding the obama administration provide a more robust response to russia's incursions in ukraine.\n\ndenman was steam rolled, said melinda haring of the atlantic council, a washington, dc, think tank, who believes the language the trump campaign approved is weaker. and she says it's anyone's guess what trump would do regarding ukraine and russia, and that perhaps he might not even back appropriate assistance.\n\nharing was referring to trumps appearance on abc's this week with george stephanopoulos last month, when trump said vladimir putin is not going to go into ukraine, ok? just so you understand, he's not going to go into ukraine.\n\nof course, russia did go into ukraine when it invaded crimea two years ago and backed separatist fighters in other parts of the country. trump later said that he meant putin would not go into ukraine on his watch, if he were president.\n\nstill, that comment raised eyebrows, especially combined with his campaign chairman paul manafort's past work for deposed ukrainian president viktor yanukovych, a putin ally.\n\nanother gop delegate on the platform committee, rachel hoff, is a national security analyst with the american action forum and believe the final platform language signals that a trump administration would refuse to send lethal defensive weapons to ukraine.\n\nthis puts trump out of step certainly with republican leadership but i would also say mainstream conservative foreign policy or national security opinion, hoff said.\n\nrepublicans in congress have approved providing arms to the ukrainian government but the white house has resisted, saying that it would only encourage more bloodshed.\n\nit's a rare obama administration policy that the trump campaign seems to agree with.
teacher of the year in oklahoma moves to texas for the money\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption emily wendler/kosu emily wendler/kosu\n\nabout exactly a year ago we brought you the story of shawn sheehan, oklahoma's 2016 teacher of the year.\n\nat the time, he and about 40 other educators were running for office in the state, wanting to make a change because, as sheehan puts it, lawmakers weren't prioritizing education. funding for schools in the state has been cut tremendously over the past decade and teachers in oklahoma are some of the lowest paid in the country.\n\nand unfortunately, it didn't go the way that we had wanted, he says.\n\nsheehan, a math teacher, didn't win that race. in the end, only five of the 40 educators actually took office.\n\ndespite, he still hung on to hope that legislators this session would come up with enough funding to give teachers a raise.\n\nthen, things went south pretty quickly, sheehan says. he held his breath while lawmakers duked it out, but in the end, there was no additional money for public schools, or their teachers.\n\nnow he says he just can't make ends meet anymore teaching in norman, okla.\n\nso, he's leaving for texas.\n\nover the past few years, thousands of public school teachers in oklahoma, like sheehan, have left the state for better pay and less stress (fewer classes, smaller classes, less instruction time). it's gotten so bad that the state department of education has had to issue emergency teacher certifications to replace teachers as quickly as possible.\n\nacross the state, textbooks are out of date, electives have been eliminated, and support positions are being terminated left and right.\n\nit feels good because i know i'm doing the right thing for my family, but it also feels sad.\n\nsheehan and his wife are both public school teachers. supporting just two people, he says they could make the money work. together they brought in about $3,600 a month. so, after all bills are paid, we're sitting on about $400-450 per month.\n\nbut in late 2016, they had a daughter.\n\nsure, life can be done on $400, $450 a month, but i would challenge others out there to buy diapers, groceries and all the things that you need for a family of three on $400.\n\nin texas, he and his wife will see an increase of about $40,000 a year. we're starting at numbers that we will never ever see in this state as educators.\n\nsheehan says that he did everything that he could think of to improve the situation. he ran for office, he started a non-profit, and i'm hitting a wall, he says. so, i'm not going to keep running in to that wall with my daughter in my hands... that's what i'm saying.\n\njon hazell, this year's teacher of the year, says he would ask sheehan: if more teachers leave, who is going to teach oklahoma's children?\n\nwho's going to mentor them? and who's going to bring them up in this climate that's really tough?\n\nhazell believes you can't put a dollar amount on teaching children. it's a privilege that he's been doing for more than 30 years.\n\nand sheehan respects that idea, but disagrees. he says he feels called to teach, but he also wants to be paid like a professional.
3 grammy contenders share outrage at all-white category, decline nominations\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption frederick m. brown/getty images frederick m. brown/getty images\n\nthree of the five acts nominated for the 2021 best children's album grammy award are saying no thanks. they're upset that the contenders in their category are all white.\n\none of them is alastair moock, whose nominated album, be a pain, is about american heroes who stood up for their principles: the rev. martin luther king jr., harvey milk, rosa parks, the parkland, fla., shooting student protesters and others.\n\nupon hearing the news he was nominated along with three other white male acts and one white woman, moock smacked his head. after this year, to have an all-white slate of nominees seemed really tone-deaf, he says.\n\nthe boston-based singer-songwriter says he'd love to get a grammy, but i don't want it like this, where the playing field's not even.\n\nmoock is protesting by turning down his nomination. so are fellow acts dog on fleas and the okee dokee brothers.\n\nwe thought that it was the strongest thing we could do, to stand with people of color whose albums are too often left out of the grammy nominations, says joe mailander, one of the okee dokee brothers. he hopes to expand notions of what children's music is. this is not just white guys with guitars playing for kids. we want to welcome all different types of music to this community.\n\nthe okee dokee brothers, moock and dog on fleas — all white guys with guitars — sent a letter to the recording academy asking that their names be removed from the final grammy ballots. they wrote they couldn't in good conscience benefit from a process that has historically overlooked women and artists of color.\n\nthe other okee dokee brother, justin lansing, said they felt a special responsibility to ask for change in a genre tasked with modeling fairness and kindness to kids and families.\n\nlast month, the nominees met with the recording academy's new interim president and ceo, harvey mason jr., and its first chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer, valeisha butterfield jones.\n\nwe're an organization that's ready for change, but you know, we're not unique to the challenges of the world and to the challenges of our industry, butterfield jones says of the 63-year-old organization being revamped. i think it's time. you know, we saw in 2020 a racial reckoning. so now, you know, it's, you know, up to us what we're going to do to take real and meaningful action.\n\nbutterfield jones says since she started her job in may, she's been looking for ways to increase diversity among the academy's membership and in the grammy's secret nominating committees. the academy recently partnered with the racial justice group color of change to begin holding itself and record labels more accountable. they're pushing for more transparency at the academy and support for artists, especially those who are black.\n\nwe have made a very clear and firm commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion as a part of our core values, butterfield jones says. i think many of the actions that we've taken and have put into place are signs of that. but we still have a lot of work left to do.\n\nfamily music forward, a collective whose mission is to amplify black voices in children's music, was also invited last month to the recording academy meetings.\n\nwe had the floor, and we had the opportunity to voice our concerns. they definitely responded with a sense of urgency, says aaron nigel smith, a founding member of family music forward.\n\nthe collective formed in early 2020, inspired by the black lives matter movement. smith says the recording academy seemed open to recommendations such as restructuring the nominating committees.\n\nwe left it in a very hopeful tone that we can keep a discussion going and work together to increase membership with people of color in the academy, smith says. he hopes the academy can add more people voting for projects that don't necessarily sound like the mainstream, that might sound like [they've] got an african vibe or reggae vibe or a hip-hop vibe.\n\nall of the musicians interviewed for this story agreed that pierce freelon should have been nominated this year for his critically acclaimed album d.a.d., which has elements of hip-hop, jazz, electronic and afro-caribbean rhythms.\n\nfreelon appreciated the stance the grammy nominees took to support diverse artists. i just couldn't think of another example in my memory of white men specifically revoking their privilege in this way, he says.\n\nhe points to other nonwhite artists who should be on the grammy's radar: saulpaul, a rapper from texas; 123 andrés, a bilingual duo with immigrant roots in colombia; and the r&b soul band shine and the moonbeams. he also thought about the 96-year-old folk singer ella jenkins.\n\nshe's probably the most prolific and foundational person in children's music. and she's a black woman. but guess what? she's never won a grammy award through the recording academy process, freelon says. they had to give her an honorary lifetime achievement award, but she actually never got that recognition from her peers in the industry.\n\none of the two grammy nominees who decided to remain on the ballot is joanie leeds. her ninth children's folk music album is titled all the ladies.\n\ni didn't decline because my album is really about empowering young women. i mean, i have 20 women on my album. so for us, it was like it was kind of counter to our empowering women message to step down, leeds says. i know that this is really about the guys that dropped out, but i feel like a lot of times women are kind of left on the side. it's a shame. i wish there was more equality with women.\n\nthe other nominees and family music forward say they support leeds' decision. next year, they expect to see more women and people of color up for grammy awards.
a new goal: aim to be less wrong\n\nenlarge this image h. armstrong roberts/classicstock/getty images h. armstrong roberts/classicstock/getty images\n\nat a conference last week, i received an interesting piece of advice:\n\nassume you are wrong.\n\n\n\nthe advice came from brian nosek, a fellow psychology professor and the executive director of the center for open science. nosek wasn't objecting to any particular claim i'd made — he was offering a strategy for pursuing better science, and for encouraging others to do the same.\n\nto understand the context for nosek's advice, we need to take a step back — to the nature of science itself, and to a methodological revolution that's been shaking the field of psychology.\n\nyou see, despite what many of us learned in elementary school, there is no single scientific method. just as scientific theories become elaborated and change, so do scientific methods. the randomized controlled trial — which we now take for granted as a method for evaluating the causal efficacy of a drug — was a methodological innovation. statistical significance testing — which is often taken for granted as a method for evaluating the probability that an outcome was due to chance alone — was a methodological innovation.\n\ntriggered by a so-called replication crisis, the field of psychology has been actively engaged in a critical evaluation of our methods and how they ought to be improved. this has involved a close look at how psychological science is produced, evaluated, and published, alongside a shift in norms concerning how decisions about studies are made and reported.\n\nfor example, many academic journals have moved away from a narrow focus on statistical significance testing to consider a broader range of statistical measures. and some journals now allow researchers to submit papers that undergo peer-review prior to data collection, thus ensuring that decisions about the study are not made after seeing the data, and that the evaluation of the paper is not based on whether the data fit in with reviewers' preferences or expectations. these, too, are methodological innovations.\n\nbut methodological reform hasn't come without some fretting and friction. nasty things have been said by methodological reformers; nasty things have been said about methodological reformers. there have been victims (though who they are depends on whom you ask). few people like public criticism, or having the value of their life's work called into question. on the other side, few people are good at voicing criticisms in kind and constructive ways. so part of the challenge is figuring out how to bake critical self-reflection into the culture of science itself, so it unfolds as a welcome and integrated part of the process, and not an embarrassing sideshow.\n\nin some ways, science is already the poster child for critical self-reflection. as a community, we actively try to falsify our own and other people's ideas. peer-review is basically structured peer criticism, and the methodological innovations that fuel science come from science itself. but scientists are still humans and, like any human community, the scientific community can benefit from norms that make it easier to embrace our overarching values. these values include a commitment to seeking out and pursuing scientific methods that yield reliable conclusions — even as we use the tools of science to determine what those methods ought to be.\n\nso how can the scientific community better instantiate such norms? what, for example, does this mean for scientists conducting basic research?\n\nwhen nosek recommended that i and other scientists assume that we are wrong, he was sharing a strategy that he's employed in his own lab — a strategy for changing the way we offer and respond to critique.\n\nassuming you are right might be a motivating force, sustaining the enormous effort that conducting scientific work requires. but it also makes it easy to construe criticisms as personal attacks, and for scientific arguments to devolve into personal battles. beginning, instead, from the assumption you are wrong, a criticism is easier to construe as a helpful pointer, a constructive suggestion for how to be less wrong — a goal that your critic presumably shares.\n\nthis advice may sound unduly pessimistic, but it's not so foreign to science. philosophers of science sometimes refer to the pessimistic meta-induction on the history of science: all of our past scientific theories have been wrong, so surely our current theories will turn out to be wrong, too. that doesn't mean we haven't made progress, but it does suggest that there is always room for improvement and elaboration — ways to be less wrong.\n\none worry about this approach is that it could be demoralizing for scientists. striving to be less wrong might be a less effective prod than the promise of being right. another concern is that a strategy that works well within science could backfire when it comes to communicating science with the public. this is a topic i've written about before: without an appreciation for how science works, it's easy to take uncertainty or disagreements as marks against science, when in fact they reflect some of the very features of science that make it our best approach to reaching reliable conclusions about the world. science is reliable because it responds to evidence: as the quantity and quality of our evidence improves, our theories can and should change, too.\n\ndespite these worries, i like nosek's suggestion because it builds in epistemic humility (there are things i do not know!) along with a sense that we can do better (there are things i do not know yet!). it also builds in a sense of community — we're all in the same boat when it comes to falling short of getting things right. perhaps the focus on a shared goal — our goal as scientists and humans of being less wrong — can help compensate for any harms in scientific motivation or communication.\n\ni also like nosek's advice because it isn't restricted to science. striving to be less wrong — rather than more right — could be a beneficial way to construe our aims across a variety of contexts, whether it's a marital dispute or a business decision. i may be wrong about who did the dishes last night, or about which stock is the best investment; if i begin from the assumption that i'm fallible and striving to be less wrong, a challenge may not feel so threatening.\n\nunfortunately, this still leaves us with an untested psychological hypothesis: that assuming one is wrong can change community norms for the better, and ultimately support better science (and even, perhaps, better judgments and decisions in everyday life).\n\ni don't know if that's true. in fact, i should probably assume that it's wrong. but with the benefit of the scientific community and our best methodological tools, i hope we can get it less wrong, together.\n\ntania lombrozo is a psychology professor at the university of california, berkeley. she writes about psychology, cognitive science and philosophy, with occasional forays into parenting and veganism. you can keep up with more of what she is thinking on twitter: @tanialombrozo
'i'm not electing a pastor in chief' — how iowa's evangelicals are deciding\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bloomberg/bloomberg via getty images bloomberg/bloomberg via getty images\n\nted cruz has one of the most overtly religious stump speeches on the iowa campaign trail.\n\nin emmetsburg, iowa, friday the texas senator quoted the bible and exhorted his supporters to pray each and every day until election day.\n\nhe's real, said bobbie clark, a cruz supporter from algona. there's something there. there's substance behind it. it's not just talk.\n\nthere's a big reason cruz and others are making that kind of pitch here days before the first votes cast in this presidential campaign season — iowa's evangelical voters have carved a well-worn path for past iowa winners. rick santorum in 2012 and mike huckabee in 2008, for example, won them over and won the caucuses.\n\nas with the fractured 2012 field, it's not at all clear who will win this year's iowa gop caucuses. but it seems to be a two-man race — between cruz and donald trump.\n\nin the final des moines register/bloomberg iowa poll before the caucuses, trump leads cruz 28 to 23 percent overall. but cruz leads with evangelicals, 33 to 19 percent.\n\nthat could bode well for cruz monday night, if those evangelical voters turn out in high numbers like in year's past. but while cruz is ahead with those voters, he doesn't have the kind of dominant lead with the group that can ensure victory.\n\nj. ann selzer, the pollster who conducted the poll, said trump's lead shrinks to 1 point over cruz if religious conservatives match 2012's turnout of 55 percent of the electorate.\n\nin that sense, this year's race is looking more like 2012 than 2008. in 2012, iowa evangelicals' support was relatively divided. entrance polls showed santorum with 32 percent of evangelicals' support, compared with ron paul's 18 percent (remarkably close to the cruz-trump split that this latest poll shows). three other candidates each took 14 percent. santorum went on to win the caucuses by just 34 votes over mitt romney. paul finished a strong third.\n\nmeanwhile, in 2008, huckabee had a far more commanding lead with these voters. he took 46 percent to romney's 19 percent — and they made up 60 percent of the electorate. all that added up to a solid 9-point win for huckabee over romney.\n\nwhile all of the republican candidates are christians, some, like cruz and retired neurosurgeon ben carson, have made their faith a more central part of their message than others. at the cruz event in emmetsburg, his supporters said they appreciate his faithcentric campaign.\n\nbut while faith plays a part in how many voters choose a candidate, some say they feel manipulated by blunt appeals to their christian identity.\n\ni think sometimes they're just giving me lip service, said dave mouw before a jeb bush campaign event in sioux center, iowa. they're telling me what i want to hear. you can usually tell by a guy if he means it or not.\n\nas of friday, mouw was torn between a few candidates — bush, john kasich, rand paul and marco rubio. meanwhile, mouw said, there's one candidate who is not winning him over.\n\ni don't need donald trump reading me a bible verse, mouw said.\n\nother voters echoed that ambivalence toward religious appeals.\n\ni don't give support simply by quoting the bible. i want to see it lived out in the policy, said john lee, a pastor in sioux center. i'm not electing a pastor in chief. i'm electing a commander in chief.\n\nlee doesn't know whom he will vote for in monday's caucus, but he knows whom he won't be supporting: ted cruz and donald trump. lee said his christian beliefs led him to oppose their hard-line immigration stances — policies that are part of what he labels callous conservatism.\n\nsioux center, where lee and mouw came out to see bush speak on friday, is in the heart of iowa's conservative christian northwest corner, which helped push to victory huckabee in 2008 and santorum in 2012.\n\nfor context on just how conservative sioux county is — in the 2012 general election, around 47 percent of iowans voted for romney, but nearly 84 percent of sioux county did.\n\nthough lee acknowledges he is not intimately familiar with his congregation's political views, he said his unofficial sense is that they are divided among several candidates, especially rubio, santorum, carson and cruz. meanwhile, of the 600 to 700 people who attend on sundays, he knows of only one who supports trump.\n\nso while candidates may make religious references and show off their family bibles to win over iowa's christian vote, that approach can go only so far. many evangelical voters simply aren't first and foremost religious voters.\n\nnancy van roekel from hinton said her faith definitely plays into her decision to support bush but that his main appeal comes from his consistency and experience.\n\nindeed a big (huge, even) part of trump's appeal stems from his outsider status, with his promises to drastically change washington. in fact, many white, self-described evangelicals support trump despite also not seeing him as very religious, as npr's tom gjelten reported.\n\ntrump's message has driven him to the top of the iowa polls, and some are predicting it could push droves of first-time caucusgoers out the door on monday night.\n\nlee is one such person. he has never caucused before — caucusing requires choosing a party, and as he put it, i don't think god belongs to either party. but trump has inspired him — albeit not in the way trump might hope.\n\nthis year i will [caucus], lee said, adding, with trump leading in the polls, i feel like it's a status confessionis time, lee said, using a term referring to a

the plot thickens in the mystery of hong kong's missing booksellers\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption anthony wallace/afp/getty images anthony wallace/afp/getty images\n\na hong kong woman who suggested last week that her husband had been abducted by chinese police has withdrawn her missing person's report.\n\nthe surprise move came after her husband, lee bo, who sold books critical of top communist party officials, vanished from hong kong last week.\n\nlee was the fifth person in the city connected to the publication of sensational books on top chinese leaders to disappear since october, prompting speculation among democratic activists that chinese security agents may have detained them.\n\nsuch abductions are very rare in hong kong, which — unlike the authoritarian mainland — enjoys freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the rule of law.\n\nlee is a british citizen, according to u.k. authorities. his disappearance has unnerved people in hong kong, a former british colony, and generated international headlines.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption anthony wallace/afp/getty images anthony wallace/afp/getty images\n\non monday, lee apparently faxed a handwritten note to a colleague, saying he was in mainland china of his own volition.\n\nbecause i need to deal with some urgent problems and cannot let the outside know, i've gone back to the mainland using my own ways to assist relevant parties in investigation, said a note attributed to lee. it may take some time.\n\nassisting an investigation is often a euphemism for being in the custody of mainland authorities.\n\ni am fine right now, the note continued. everything is normal.\n\nlee's wife, choi ka-ping, confirmed the note was in her husband's handwriting. i believe he wasn't forced to write it, so that's why i withdrew the request for police help, she told reporters outside her apartment tuesday, according to the english-language newspaper south china morning post.\n\ndemocratic lawmakers, however, remain skeptical that lee went to the mainland voluntarily. when he disappeared last week, he left his mainland travel permit at home and hong kong police said there was no record he'd legally crossed the border.\n\nechoing the thoughts of fellow opposition politicians, lee cheuk-yan, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said he suspected mainland authorities had pressed the couple to change their stories.\n\ni think everyone knows she must be under pressure, said lee, who is not related to the missing bookseller. the whole thing has blown up in hong kong and they want to placate the public.\n\nsome newspapers in hong kong have speculated that lee and the other missing men were abducted because of their sensational publications — lightly sourced books that traffic in gossip and innuendo about top chinese leaders and their family members. the books are popular among mainland tourists who visit hong kong.\n\nhong kong police have asked mainland officials where lee is, but say they have yet to receive an answer. on monday, c.y. leung, hong kong's pro-beijing chief executive, insisted there was no evidence lee had been abducted. but if chinese agents were responsible, he said, it would be illegal and a violation of the basic law, hong kong's mini-constitution.\n\non tuesday, a pro-government hong kong legislator, ng leung-sing, said at a public meeting he had received a message from a friend in hong kong's business sector saying lee had been detained after sneaking into the mainland to see sex workers. ng, though, provided no evidence. opposition lawmaker claudia mo criticized ng on her facebook page, saying, didn't know a person can go as low as this.\n\nin a commentary published tuesday, global times, a nationalistic state-run newspaper, said the coverage of lee's whereabouts was hyped up by hong kong and international media. global times also attacked lee and the bookstore where he is a major shareholder.\n\ncauseway bay books almost only publishes and sells mainland-related political books, many of which contain maliciously fabricated content, the commentary said. those books have through various channels entered into the mainland and have become a source of certain political rumors, which have caused some evil influence.\n\nmany in hong kong worry the communist party is slowly trying to strip them of their unique freedoms. last year, thousands of protesters occupied areas downtown to demand democratic elections, which infuriated leaders in beijing.\n\nlee cheuk-yan, the pro-democracy legislator, says the booksellers' disappearance has sent chills across the city.\n\nthis case shows that if they want to enforce their law, they can come over suddenly and grab the concerned person back to china, said lee. then, the whole security — personal security — of the people in hong kong is at stake.
with paint and a camera, she's forging a new artistic vision of africa\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption aïda muluneh aïda muluneh\n\nmany images of africa in western media focus on war, famine or other crises that trouble the continent.\n\nbut ethiopian artist aïda muluneh wants to help people understand that there's more to her country than what they typically see in the news.\n\nborn in ethiopia in 1974, muluneh spent much of her childhood living in different countries — yemen, england, cyprus and canada — before studying film at howard university in washington, d.c. she graduated in 2000 and then worked as a photojournalist for the washington post.\n\nbut muluneh became increasingly interested in creating photography as art separate from her journalistic work — and in reconnecting with her ethiopian heritage. so she moved back to ethiopia 11 years ago.\n\nsince then, she's been creating bright, primary-colored portraits that both celebrate and transcend ethiopian culture.\n\nnow her work is on display at the museum of modern art in new york city (moma) as part of being: new photography 2018, an exhibition lasting through august 19. after her move back to ethiopia, muluneh also created the addis foto fest, the first and only international photography festival in east africa. the fifth edition will be held in addis ababa, ethiopia, in december 2018.\n\nnpr spoke with muluneh to learn about the creative process behind her art — and what she hopes viewers take away. this interview is edited for length and clarity.\n\nhow would you say your approach to photography as art differs from your approach to photography as journalism?\n\nthere are certain things i can't express in my journalistic work that i can express in my studio work. my studio work is an exploration of color first and foremost. i approach it almost like a painter, focusing on the basics — which are the primary colors.\n\ntoggle caption aïda muluneh\n\nmeanwhile, your journalistic photography is black and white.\n\ni have a running joke that in photojournalism, i can't see color. but for some reason, when i'm in the studio, it's these primary colors i feel strongest about. eventually, i know i'll start mixing colors and i'll start finding other colors. but for now, i want to learn as much as possible from the primary colors.\n\nit's also about pulling in elements from ethiopia. church wall paintings here use primary color. i want to show a different way of looking at my country.\n\nwhat's the stereotypical image of ethiopia that you think gets overdone in the media and art?\n\nthe cliché of ethiopia is the starving child or the priest with the cross. or war or famine. the international media are always consuming images not only about ethiopia but across all of africa related to those stereotypes. but this place has so much complexity, and i'm witness to that complexity. there are so many subcultures, there are so many contemporary things happening here, there are so many cities with interesting people who are trying to change the continent.\n\nthe thing i find unfortunate about international media is that it's not focused on that, and it's never about perspective. i'm not trying to tell people everything is hunky-dory and perfect in ethiopia, but everything isn't dark and dreary either. i can come to new york and photograph a lot of homeless people on the street and say, these are the alleys of new york, but that's not the full perspective.\n\ntoggle caption aïda muluneh\n\nso how did you come up with your own perspective?\n\nmy works are very intimate portraits. everything is very flat. i remove a lot of shadows from the image and take a very graphical approach to photography. when i started looking at traditional elements of my culture — body ornamentation and tattoos — it's highly sophisticated. unfortunately, eurocentric history has dismissed this art as primitive. but, in fact, specific colors, lines and designs have different meanings. even when you look at the movie black panther, a lot of [the movie's aesthetic] was inspired by ethiopia. i find traditional culture to be far more contemporary than the contemporary itself.\n\neven though your images have these qualities rooted in ethiopian culture, they're also almost otherworldly.\n\ni'm trying to share my heritage but also to show the universality of people around the world. i've gone from looking at body painting around ethiopia to looking across the continent to looking around the world. the kayapo indigenous people of brazil, wodaabe people of west africa, maori people of new zealand, for example, all used body painting. i realized from looking at all these different kinds of body painting that there are all of these lines of connection between different societies. whatever our struggle, there's something that we share. the whole collection isn't a matter of looking at our differences. it's a matter of looking at the similarities that we share.\n\nyour work also primarily features women. why is that?\n\ni'm a woman, and i'm sharing my experience with the world. i can't see myself doing that through a man's body. i feel as though there's a power in the gaze of the woman. especially in africa, women are our biggest assets. there's an expression that if you teach something to a man, you teach one person, but if you teach something to a woman, you're teaching the whole society.\n\nthe models i use are very specific. one that appears frequently is a makeup artist i came across randomly. i just loved her features — her gaze and long neck. because i'm trying to share my experiences, these women have become my portal for that.\n\ntoggle caption aïda muluneh\n\nlet's talk about how you create your images. where do you even start?\n\nmy work starts out with a sketch — more like chicken scratches. but i start on paper with the idea. then i figure out what i need for that set. i look at a lot of archived images from ethiopia in the 1930s and 1940s. people then looked so regal, and their afros were so perfect. i don't know how they got it that perfect. i can't get anybody's afros perfect today. you'll notice a lot of my clothing is long, and you don't see a lot of leg. that comes from these archived images because i don't want people to focus on the exotic or erotic features of the female body. it's more about her gaze.\n\nfor a piece like fragments, i work with local fashion designers. i had a sketch of what i wanted and they pieced it together for me.\n\nhow long does it take to apply the body paint on the models?\n\none-and-a-half hours.\n\nthat's not as bad as i thought it might be.\n\nit would actually be quicker to spray the paint on, but i like the texture the brush makes on the face.\n\nhow do you get the right shot?\n\non location, often i'll have everything sketched. this comes from my film background. but what happens when we get on set is that i have everything planned out, and then i realize i have to change this, and it's that magical moment i look for when i get that image that i seek.\n\nhow do you hope people react to your art in a gallery?\n\nwhen you see my images in any show, you can see my work from a mile away. the colors are so striking; you can't miss it. i hope people google my name and google ethiopia and see something completely different that they haven't seen in international media.\n\nthe topic of the moma exhibit you're part of is capturing what it means to be human. what do you think your photos communicate about what it means to be human?\n\nthe exhibit features images from a collection of mine called the world is 9, which is an expression my grandmother would say. it means the world is never a perfect 10. a lot of the challenges that we face come from within us. it's not based on our geographical location, it's not based on our culture; it's not based on our education. someone in new york — whatever they're going through — and someone in ethiopia are not completely different. we share commonalities. we have to question our own humanity and understand the universality of our existence.\n\nnatalie jacewicz is a freelance writer and law school student. follow her @nataliejacewicz.
chart: who wins, who loses with senate health care bill\n\ntoggle caption j. scott applewhite/ap\n\nsenate republicans on thursday unveiled their plan to repeal and replace the affordable care act — also known as obamacare. the long-awaited plan marks a big step toward achieving one of the republican party's major goals.\n\nloading...\n\nthe senate proposal is broadly similar to the bill passed by house republicans last month, with a few notable differences. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who has been criticized for drafting the bill in secret with just a dozen republican senate colleagues, says the proposal — which he calls a discussion draft — will stabilize insurance markets, strengthen medicaid and cut costs to consumers.\n\nwe agreed on the need to free americans from obamacare's mandates. and policies contained in the discussion draft will repeal the individual mandates so americans are no longer forced to buy insurance they don't need or can't afford, mcconnell said.\n\ninstead, the bill entices people to voluntarily buy a policy by offering them tax credits based on age and income to help pay premiums.\n\nthis bill is better designed than the house version, according to avik roy, founder of the foundation for research on equal opportunity, because it offers more help to older people who can't afford insurance while making coverage cheaper for young healthy people.\n\nthe bill will encourage a lot more of those individuals to buy health insurance, roy says. that, in turn, will make the risk pool much healthier, which will also lower premiums. and the tax credits in the bill will also be better-designed.\n\nbut caroline pearson, a senior vice president at the consulting firm avalere health, says the bill bases its tax credits on lower-quality insurance.if you're paying a similar percentage of income, you're getting a less generous product under this new plan, she says.\n\nthe plan keeps some popular parts of obamacare. it allows parents keep their children on their policies until age 26 and requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nbut it then allows states to opt out of that requirement.\n\nthe protections around pre-existing conditions are still in place in the senate bill, but the waiver authority gives states options that could include limiting coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, says pearson.\n\nthose waivers would allow state to drop benefits required by obamacare, such as maternity coverage, mental health care and prescription drug coverage.\n\nboth bills would eliminate most of the taxes imposed by the affordable care act.\n\nand they would bar people from using tax credits to buy policies that pay for abortion and also block planned parenthood from getting any money from medicaid for a year.\n\nperhaps the most sweeping move, however, is that the senate plan follows the house lead in completely changing how the government pays for health care for the poor and the disabled — and goes even further.\n\ntoday, medicaid pays for all the care people need, and state and federal governments share the cost.\n\nbut medicaid has been eating up an ever-larger share of federal spending. the senate republicans' plan puts a lid on that by rolling back the obama-era expansion of the program and then granting states a set amount of money for each person enrolled. republicans also want to change the way the federal government calculates payments to the states starting in 2025, reducing the federal government's contribution to the states.\n\nthe medicaid cuts are even more draconian that the house bill was, though they take effect more gradually than the house bill did, pearson says. so we're going to see very significant reductions in coverage in medicaid and big cuts in federal funding that will result in significant budget gaps for states.\n\nseveral republican senators have already said they oppose the bill, at least as of now. senate leaders are aiming for a vote before july 4.
ailsa chang, host:\n\nnancy pelosi is on her way to another turn as speaker of the house. earlier today, 203 democrats voted to make her their party's nominee to be the top leader in the house and third in line for the presidency. now, this does not mean pelosi is totally in the clear. more than two dozen democrats voted against her, but pelosi says she is not worried.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nnancy pelosi: are there dissenters? yes. but i expect to have a powerful vote as we go forward.\n\nchang: npr congressional reporter kelsey snell has been following all of this leadership drama in the house, and she's here with us now.\n\nhey, kelsey.\n\nkelsey snell, byline: hey, there.\n\nchang: so how strong of a display was this really? i mean, does this nomination mean she is going to get the speakership?\n\nsnell: well, this was a pretty strong vote. but no, it's not all over. there is a big vote on the house floor in january. it's one of the very first things that they do when they come back. after all the new members are sworn in, all the new members of congress will sit down on the house floor and vote for who they want for speaker. now, pelosi came out and talked to reporters before they were even done counting the votes inside of that closed-door dem caucus. and she was in a pretty celebratory mood, and it's not just about being speaker. it was kind of like a second victory lap for the election. here's what she said.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npelosi: let us just take a moment to dwell on the fact that we are in the majority - majority, majority, majority.\n\n(applause)\n\nsnell: those claps that you're hearing in the background there are some of her members who were just huddled around her to celebrate the moment. and she has a reason to be excited. the ap reversed a call just the other day, and now it looks like democrats might still pick up another seat in california.\n\nchang: majority, majority, majority - that said, pelosi did have 32 people vote against her today. i mean, that's more than enough to keep her from winning in january. right? but you say she sounds confident. she has sounded that way since election day. why should she be confident going into the floor vote in january?\n\nsnell: so the one thing she should be concerned about is that she has a majority of her party but not enough to get a majority of the whole house. she needs 218 votes. and like we said already, she had 203 today. but it's really not all that uncommon for people to vote against a speaker nominee in the secret ballot process when it's just an election within their own party. and then by the time they get to the house floor, they flip and vote for the person from their party.\n\none conservative democrat and i were talking. and he said to me that it's one thing to say you'd like an alternative to pelosi, but it's something completely different when they're being asked to publicly choose between her and a republican on the house floor. and that's what it would be in january.\n\nchang: yeah, yeah.\n\nsnell: and you can also compare this to the last time democrats voted for pelosi as minority leader back in 2016. republicans used her as a weapon in that election, too. and democrats had just lost seats in the house, but 63 people voted against her then. and she's cut that opposition by more than 20.\n\nchang: but her detractors are saying that they're confident that they can block her still. i mean, do they even have another candidate or any clear path for how they'll get that done?\n\nsnell: yeah - no, they don't have a new candidate, and they don't really have a path. but what they're saying is the only way to get a leadership change is to fight. and kathleen rice, who is one of the people who's been leading this charge, came out and talked to reporters. and she said this is something that pelosi herself would want them to do.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nkathleen rice: nancy pelosi said it herself: power is not given to you. you have to take it. and that's what this effort is all about. and these are not easy positions to be in, but we have to have this conversation.\n\nsnell: and they are having this conversation, but it doesn't seem to really be going anywhere right now.\n\nchang: all right. so really quickly - one of the things pelosi has promised along the way is that she's going to make room for new, younger voices. has she followed through on that promise yet?\n\nsnell: well, she did. she has promoted some newer people, like hakeem jeffries who'll be the no. 5 for democrats. he's 48 and from brooklyn and queens. but it is important to say that, at the end of the day, the top three people will still be the same top three people that have been representing democrats for years.\n\nchang: right.\n\nsnell: so there will be some room for fresh faces but not a lot of them.\n\nchang: that's npr congressional reporter kelsey snell.\n\nthanks, kelsey.\n\nsnell: thank you.\n\n[post-broadcast correction: in this story, we incorrectly say the speaker of the house is third in the line of succession to the presidency. the speaker is second in line after the vice president.]\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
in cosby trial, witness recounts 1984 assault at comedian's nevada ranch\n\neditor's note: this post contains graphic descriptions that some may find disturbing.\n\nheidi thomas — the first of several women expected to take the stand against bill cosby in his criminal retrial – described to the court on tuesday how the comedian lured her to his nevada ranch in 1984, drugged her and then forced her to perform oral sex.\n\nthomas' testimony against the 80-year-old cosby on charges that he sexually assaulted andrea constand at his philadelphia home in 2004 was meant to bolster the prosecution's case that the defendant has a long history of such assaults. besides constand, at least four other women are expected to provide similar testimony.\n\non the trial's opening day on monday, prosecutors revealed that cosby paid a $3.4 million civil settlement to constand in 2006.\n\nthomas, a 24-year-old aspiring actor at the time, said cosby enticed her to fly to reno on the pretext of giving her career advice.\n\ni'm a little nobody from colorado, she said. and he's this great man.\n\nhe said he was looking forward to giving back to the industry that has given him so much, she told the jury in norristown, pa.\n\nas bobby allyn of member station whyy reports:\n\ndays later, cosby arranged to have thomas flown to reno, nevada, where she was greeted at the airport by a driver who took her to a remote ranch house outside the city. the driver said it was a getaway cosby preferred as an escape from the glare of the paparazzi. ... cosby, dressed in sweat clothes, opened the door and ushered her in. he told her to change into something more comfortable and then meet him in the kitchen with a monologue she wanted to run through.\n\nit was then that she said cosby suggested acting out a script in which she was to play a drunk character. although thomas said she didn't drink, cosby gave her a glass of white wine as a prop.\n\nalmost immediately, she said, she felt her mental state powerfully altered. the next thing she remembers is waking up in bed next to cosby, she said. i have clothes on. he did not. and i was lying down, and he was forcing himself in my mouth. i remember thinking, 'i feel sick, and how did i get here?'\n\nwhyy writes: kathleen bliss, a lawyer for cosby, started at the end of [tuesday] to stress inconsistencies in thomas' story, including discrepancies over the time of her flight to reno [and] the exact date of the alleged assault.\n\naccording to the associated press, the testimony of thomas and the other women could help prosecutors insulate constand from the defense's contention that she is a 'con artist' who preyed on cosby's vulnerability after the 1997 killing of his son, ennis, and then framed him to score a big payday via a $3.4 million civil settlement.\n\nthe cross-examination of thomas by cosby's defense team was set to continue on wednesday.
on 'introducing...,' aaron frazer contemplates love and the road ahead\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alysse gafkjen/courtesy of the artist alysse gafkjen/courtesy of the artist\n\nthe music of aaron frazer feels a bit like stepping into a time machine: it's got touches of curtis mayfield and carole king, but it's also very much of this moment. the baltimore native, who's best known for playing drums and singing in the band durand jones & the indications, says he was in the middle of making dinner one day when he got a call from dan auerbach of the black keys, asking if they could make a record together. that solo album, introducing..., was released friday, and frazer joined npr's lulu garcia-navarro to talk about it. hear the radio version at the audio link, and read on for an edited transcript.\n\nthis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro: i understand you and dan auerbach wrote the album together in the course of just a few days?\n\naaron frazer: yeah, that's right. we wrote the record over the course of four days. i think we came out with like 16 vocal tracks and four more instrumentals. it was a sprint, but i've never had a writing session so fruitful.\n\nis that what it's like when something just clicks with someone? all that creative energy just explodes?\n\nyeah, i think that's right. i think dan tried to get me to a place of accessing my intuitive songwriting because, like you said, carole king, curtis mayfield, those are such finely crafted songs. each one is like a watch, or something. we both love 45s, these singles that sound raw and from the gut. i think the idea of this record was to find a midpoint between something that feels good in the brain and something that feels good in the gut and in the ear.\n\nand durand jones and the indications are known for this very retro-soul kind of sound. but on this album, you expand beyond those roots. tell me about the song have mercy.\n\ni love boleros — i've really fallen in love with them over the past few years, learning more about them and their history. i wanted to put a touch of that in the song. this one is pretty autobiographical: the story of me meeting my lady and that feeling of being like, 'oh my gosh, this person is so special.' and the fear that comes with that, of 'i don't want to screw it up.'\n\nyou brought in a wide range of musicians to record: members of the memphis boys, who backed icons like dusty springfield and aretha franklin, but also some younger artists. tell me about that dynamic and what they brought to the album.\n\ni think everybody, both old and young, brought such sensitivity and empathetic playing. most of it was done live. a bunch of stuff on the record, musically, you'll hear happen on the two [beat]: like, one, boom. that's because you have people who are listening first and reacting, letting other people set the tone and doing what needs to be done in response. i think that's the working dynamic at easy eye, dan auerbach's studio — everybody working together to make things happen. it's like a barn raising.\n\nthere's one song in particular i want to listen to, which reflects a lot of what we've been hearing lately. can you tell me what bad news is about?\n\nbad news was written two novembers ago, but i think it's only gotten more timely as release day was approaching. i wrote it to be heard almost from the perspective of mother earth — like, i'm on fire, i can barely keep it turning. but it's also all of us in this moment of relentless, 'yo, can i catch a break? please?' but we have to keep marching forward and waking up the next day and going back at it. ... ride with me is another climate change song. it's classic gospel sort of imagery — the train is at the station, you can hear the diesel humming and we can't afford to miss it. it's an issue i think a lot about, and stress out a lot about.\n\nyoutube\n\ngiven that so many artists who have come before me, especially artists of color, have given me so much, i feel like i have a platform and i want to use it. i think i can bring people joy and light while also bringing them some place to feel mourning or anger, outrage, sadness. all those things. that's what my heroes did: they made time to, on their records and in their lives, express all the dimensions of themselves in that way.\n\ntell me about this time for you. how has it been not touring, not doing live music?\n\nit has not been my favorite year [laughs]. it's really hard not to tour. being able to travel and meet people all over the world, i'm so thankful to have had that opportunity because i feel like it's helping me expand my perspective and understand other people's perspectives. especially because the kind of music i make is [enjoyed] pretty widely across the board: maybe it's not your number one thing, but generally people don't hear soul and soul-adjacent music and go, oh my god, i can't stand this. so yeah, not playing shows has definitely made me feel disconnected. but it's also been a time to take stock of what the last few years have been.\n\ni wonder about what art is going to look like after this period. because you've been in new york, which has been so affected by the pandemic, do you think that's going to make its way into your music in the future?\n\ndurand jones & the indications, we're starting our next album, this weekend and we definitely have a couple of moments on there that were born from what we all shared and went through together this year. i think that this year will affect things to come for a while, as so many past past moments of political chaos and other kinds of chaos have been reflected in folklife, whatever form you define it. i think a lot about gil scott-heron's h2ogate blues and how much it maps onto today.
we answer the question: what is medicare for all?\n\ndemocratic sen. kamala harris, who's a candidate for the 2020 presidential election, has endorsed medicare for all. but the details of what that means are rather elusive.\n\nrachel martin, host:\n\nvarious democratic presidential hopefuls are getting behind an idea long thought to be on the outer edge of progressive politics - so-called medicare-for-all. senator kamala harris endorsed the idea the other night in a cnn town hall. she also suggested getting rid of all private insurance.\n\nclearly health care is going to be a major issue in the democratic primary and seems like a good moment to have npr's health policy correspondent alison kodjak on to educate us. good morning, alison.\n\nalison kodjak, byline: good morning, rachel.\n\nmartin: we've heard this phrase for a long time, but it's worth explaining it again. can you just describe what exactly is medicare-for-all?\n\nkodjak: yeah, so what senator harris says she is supporting is a bill that was proposed by bernie sanders, and that would create a national single-payer health plan that would replace the whole private insurance system. and here's how she described it.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nkamala harris: well, listen; the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require.\n\nkodjak: so everyone would get a medicare card just like the one that my elderly mother has, and doctors would have to sign an agreement to participate in the program.\n\nmartin: and as you point out, this is the same thing as the single-payer system. so everyone may hear medicare-for-all and think, oh, this is just for, you know, elderly people. but this is actually - what she's proposing is a much more substantive overhaul of the current health care system.\n\nkodjak: yeah, it's huge. it would change everybody's health insurance.\n\nmartin: how would it be paid for?\n\nkodjak: well, that's the big unknown.\n\nmartin: (laughter).\n\nkodjak: i mean, it would clearly have to be through some sort of tax increase. harris didn't specify what she wanted to do in her town hall, and sanders, in the proposal that he put on the table, did outline some options. right now we spend about $3 1/2 trillion a year on health care, and sanders says his - making medicare-for-all will cost less. but the proposals to pay for it would be maybe a tax increase on employers to replace what they're now paying for health insurance premiums like a social security tax or maybe a tax increase on personal income tax. and then there are always proposals to increase tax rates on the wealthy high-earners and reduce their deductions.\n\nmartin: so we know kamala harris is behind this idea. what about the other candidates who've thrown their hat into the ring thus far?\n\nkodjak: yeah, well, we have kirsten gillibrand of new york and elizabeth warren who both also co-sponsored senator sanders' bill, so the - that democratic crowd is pretty much all in. you have two so-called moderate billionaire businessmen who are testing the waters, those centrist candidates. howard schultz, the former ceo of starbucks - he called this program not american because it would eliminate the health insurance industry. mike bloomberg - he says a medicare-for-all plan would, quote, bankrupt us. so those two potential candidates aren't quite as supportive as the three senators who have already co-sponsored senator sanders' bill.\n\nmartin: i mean, we should just point out it wasn't that long ago that there was an overhaul of the american health care system that gave birth to the affordable care act. so - and these democrats are arguing that didn't go far enough. but this is a very politically difficult issue. i mean, how does it poll with the public? do americans want a single-payer system?\n\nkodjak: you know, conceptually they do. fifty-six percent of people in a recent poll said they were supportive. but when you get into the nitty gritty - like, you're going to have to change your insurance, and if you like it, you won't get to keep it - people don't like that. people never like to hear that they're going to have to pay more taxes even if it replaces their insurance premiums. and of course the insurance industry is going to fight this like crazy...\n\nmartin: right.\n\nkodjak: ...if it gets to that point.\n\nmartin: npr's alison kodjak - thanks, alison.\n\nkodjak: thank you, rachel.\n\nmartin: one correction now - earlier we described the kamala harris campaign as backtracking from one aspect of medicare-for-all. her campaign has said that in fact she remains supportive of the medicare-for-all bill she co-sponsors with bernie sanders.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
north korea says it won't fire missiles at guam after all\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption justin sullivan/getty images, justin sullivan/getty images,\n\nnorth korean leader kim jong un reviewed his military's plans to rain an enveloping fire around the u.s. territory of guam — but opted not to fire missiles at this time, according to state media. despite the stand-down, some guamanians were alarmed after two radio stations aired an erroneous emergency alert tuesday.\n\nkim visited the korean people's army as the self-imposed mid-august deadline for a missile demonstration approached, the korean central news agency reports. but after hearing the plan and considering it, kim opted not to give the order to launch missiles, and instead would watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the yankees, the report says.\n\nkim also warned that the u.s. should not test north korea's self-restraint.\n\non guam, the territory's homeland security office says two radio stations aired an unscheduled test of the emergency alert broadcast system shortly after midnight, which residents and visitors may have noticed. the announcement — that the system had issued a civil danger warning for guam — was due to an unauthorized test and was not connected to an emergency, the agency says.\n\nguam and the u.s. air and naval forces that are based there have been under alert since it was named by north korea as a potential demonstration target, with the regime threatening to fire missiles into the sea near the island that's home to some 160,000 people.\n\nthe passing of the deadline without a missile launch could ease tensions that have been ratcheted up as president trump and north korea have traded threats. last week, trump said, military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should north korea act unwisely.\n\nsouth korea's president moon jae-in said his nation will do all it can to prevent violence from breaking out on the korean peninsula.\n\nin a speech delivered on tuesday — liberation day, commemorating the end of japanese rule following world war ii — moon was quoted by the korea herald as saying, without the consent of the republic of korea [south korea], no country can determine to take military action.\n\nit's still too early to say the situation has calmed entirely, guam lieut. gov. ray tenorio said, but we are happy that the rhetoric is starting to calm down, perhaps.\n\nthere is no change in the threat level, guam homeland security adviser george charfauros said. he added, we are very ... i'd say almost ecstatic that kim jong un has backed off.\n\nfrom seoul, npr's elise hu reports:\n\n[on] monday, u.s. defense secretary james mattis said if north korean missiles were considered a threat to guam, then, 'it's game on.' others in the trump administration, like secretary of state rex tillerson, continue to try and push a diplomatic solution to the current nuclear issue.
terry gross, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm terry gross. my guest is songwriter, singer and guitarist vic chesnutt. new york times music critic jon pareles describes some of chesnutt's recent songs as contemplating, not just mortality, but also the broader inevitability of collapse and decay.\n\nchesnutt had a brush with mortality in a 1983 car accident, when he was 18. after the accident, he lost the use of his legs, and his hands and arms were compromised. seven years after the accident, chesnutt recorded his first album.\n\nas pareles points out, if chesnutt's songs were more conventional, they would have the makings of folk rock, but he and his musicians see other possibilities.\n\non his new album and on the preceding one, chesnutt is backed by guitarist guy picciotto, formerly of the post-punk band fugazi, and members of the montreal band thee silver mt. zion.\n\nthe band has created a more dramatic and dissonant setting for chesnutt's dark songs. the liner notes state that, though everyone had a hand in the arranging, guy undoubtedly carried the most weight. so we invited him to join us for the first part of our interview with vic chesnutt. let's start with the opening track of chesnutt's new cd at the cut. this is his song coward.\n\n(soundbite of song, coward)\n\nmr. vic chesnutt (musician): (singing) the courage of the coward is greater than all others. a scaredy cat'll scratch you if you back him in a corner. but i, i, i, i am a coward. but i, i, i, i am a coward. courage born of despair and impotence...\n\ngross: vic chesnutt, guy picciotto, welcome to fresh air. that is one really powerful song. let's start talking about the lyric, which vic chesnutt, you wrote. the courage of the coward, greater than all others. that's a quote. tell us where it's from and what it means to you.\n\nmr. chesnutt: it's from mcteague, a frank norris book, and i wrote it down in my notebook, where i write lines that i come across. and it was a very telling line because i was coming to see myself as a coward, and it was a very illuminating line in my own personal story.\n\ngross: why were you starting to see yourself as a coward?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, it's like, and i've said this before, it's kind of like when you realize you're an alcoholic. you know, it takes a while to start coming to this realization, and i was coming to this realization that i am a flat-out coward.\n\ngross: like, in what sense do you think of yourself as a coward?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, in personal relationships, i don't want to confront my enemies and things like this. you know, i mean, in many ways, i'm a coward. i break up in email, instead of calling you to your face. that kind of thing. you know what i mean? and when i came across this line, it felt real and felt true. so i wrote it down, and then later when i came to be writing the song, i knew, you know, this was all part of the song.\n\ngross: there's another quote that you use in the lyric, a courage born of despair and impotence. tell us about that quote and what it means to you.\n\nmr. chesnutt: yeah, that comes from the radetzky march by joseph roth - roth or whatever his name is. it's another line that it felt true. you know, it was kind of the flip side of this coward - of the courage of the coward. it kind of - they dovetailed nicely together and helped illuminate this idea i had of, you know, hello, my name is vic chesnutt, and i am a coward - statement.\n\ngross: now, guy, the arrangement that you did for the song is so strong. the song is about being a coward, but the instrumentation is just so powerful and strong. it starts off quietly, and then it just kind of builds and builds, and the song turns into a howl, and the music turns into... i don't know. you describe what you tried to do and why.\n\nmr. guy picciotto (guitarist): well, i can't take really credit for the arrangement of that song. i mean, i think vic had the song formulated in his head, and i think the arrangement, the way it sounds is just born out of the fact of the scale of the band that's playing on it and the different instrumentation that everyone has and the kind of arrangement - i have to say of all the songs that we've done with vic, it was - i don't even remember even discussing the arrangement. everyone just played it, and it sounded like that.\n\nthe funny thing is, on the record, we were convinced it wasn't powerful or howling or crazy enough, like, because we've done it live so many times that we were - live it just felt like the most, you know, monolithic hurricane of all time. and then we recorded it, and we just kept fighting against the fact that we thought it sounded small, and no one else seems to think it does. so i'm really glad. i think we were just - we were just used to, you know, being in front of the amps and hearing how massive it was that we kind of lost track of the scale of the song.\n\nand the arrangement is really vic's. i mean, he wrote the melody lines. he wrote, you know, where the big chords enter, and really, i think it's just the fact that the group that backs vic up, everyone's playing kind of diff- instruments in different ranges, and when you combine them all together, it just becomes a mountain, you know.\n\ngross: vic, how did you learn to write with chords? i mean, what did you study that introduced you to chords?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, my granddad taught me how to play guitar in the late '70s, and i know the majors and minors. that's pretty much it. i'm a folkie. you know, i can play blowin' in the wind in any key.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. chesnutt: without...\n\nmr. picciotto: i'll say this... i was just going to interject and toot your horn for you, because i've known a lot of guitar players in my life, but i don't think i've ever known anyone who knows, like, the territory of the fret board the way vic does. like, when he's talking about transposing keys of a song on a fret board, like, most guitar players, you'd have to - me in particular - you'd have to sit there and really crunch it out in your head. but vic - vic just knows - i've never met anyone like him. i think it's because his grandfather really drilled into him playing a song - what was the song that your granddad made you play over and over again and change keys on?\n\nmr. chesnutt: yeah. this is how he taught me how to play guitar. my granddaddy, he would show me the chords to sweet georgia brown in g, and then we would play that song for an hour without stopping, and while my granddad would play lead over it.\n\n(soundbite of humming)\n\nmr. chesnutt: and i would play the chords, and then that would be the lesson. and then a week later, we would come, and we would do, okay, sweet georgia brown in a flat, and then we would do it that way, and we did it until we played all 11 keys, and that was it.\n\ngross: did you enjoy that?\n\nmr. chesnutt: i loved it. it's so much fun. my granddad was such a great guitar player that it's fun to listen to him, like, improvise these leads, you know. he would go play it through pretty much straight, you know...\n\n(soundbite of humming)\n\nmr. chesnutt: and then he'd go off, and it was pretty much fun to watch him. and he was having fun doing it. he didn't say anything to me, like good job or, you know, anything. we just sat there. it was a silent exercise, and it's one of my great joys of my life, is thinking back on that.\n\ngross: guy, you had said that everybody knew what they wanted to play after they, you know, heard the song. so there wasn't an arrangement, per se. how did you know what you wanted to play?\n\nmr. picciotto: it was pretty straightforward because we were, like, all right, we're going to have all the guitars follow this, you know, lead line, and some people are going to deviate. and we're playing with a violin, we're playing with another guitar that's tuned differently. we've got a stand-up bass, we've got, you know, organ - all these different instruments. so everyone just, kind of, found their slots.\n\nbut we knew that when you those - the heavy chords kicked in, we wanted everyone on top of them. i mean, it just made sense for it to be, you know, a real punch in the gut. and vic's songs are deceptive, because when he plays them by himself, they're so beautiful that part of you is like i just don't want to touch this. it's like - and a lot of vic's records are really just vic playing and singing, and it's masterful.\n\nbut there's so - like, as a musician, there's so much in vic's chordings, and there's so much in his melodies that you can also build on top of them. you can build these structures that are quite elaborate. and his material, like - you know, his music is the foundation, and it can support a lot of architecture. and i feel like that's the case with a song like coward.\n\ngross: if you're just joining us, my guest is songwriter, singer and guitarist vic chesnutt and guitarist and arranger guy picciotto. guy is featured on vic chesnutt's new cd, at the cut. we'll talk more after a break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: if you're just joining us, my guests are vic chesnutt and guy picciotto. and vic chesnutt is a singer and songwriter. his new cd is called at the cut. and guy picciotto used to be with the band fugazi, and he's a member of the band that backs vic chesnutt on the new cd at the cut and also on vic chesnutt's previous cd, which is called north star deserter.\n\nlet me play another song from at the cut, and this is called flirted with you all my life, and it's a song about flirting with suicide. so let's hear it, and then we'll talk about it musically and lyrically.\n\n(soundbite of song, flirted with you all my life)\n\nmr. chesnutt: (singing) i am a man. i am self-aware, and everywhere i go, you're always right there with me. i've flirted with you all my life, even kissed you once or twice, and to this day, i swear it was nice, but clearly i was not ready.\n\nwhen you touched a friend of mine, i thought i would lose my mind, but i found out with time that really, i was not ready, no, no, cold death, cold death, oh death, really, i'm not ready.\n\ngross: that's flirted with you all my life from vic chesnutt's new cd at the cut. before we talk about what's happening lyrically, in that cd, guy, i wanted to ask you about what's going on musically. you know, this is a song about flirting with suicide, flirting with death. so what did you think should be happening musically? and let me just say something, that that slow drumbeat in the background, it sounds like a death march.\n\nmr. picciotto: yeah, that song is interesting. i first heard vic do that song by himself in vienna. i was part of a trio that was - vic and i, we played in a trio together, where he was performing in vienna, and we'd done a concert of a bunch of songs, and then for the encore, he came out and played that song, and it was the first time i'd ever heard it. and it's one of the songs that wrecks a room. i mean, it was like you could just hear everybody's heart break, and we were all stunned, including, like, the guys who run the record label that puts the record out. and we were all just like man, you know, it really set us back on our heels.\n\nso when we were going to do the new record, everyone was like, well, that song has to be on the record. and again, it was one of those songs where, like, man, should we just, like, let vic play the song and just leave it alone? but a couple of things happened with the way that song ended up coming out, musically.\n\none thing was, one of the other guitar players, chad, started playing this lick against the line that vic had, and it was - it was almost perverse because it had this kind of lilt to it. i mean, the song is, you know, quite a heavy lyric, and then the combination of that guitar lick, and then a mistake happened where the drummer was playing this beat, and the bass player was coming in off a different one. and it was - so the kick would hit, and then the bass note would pluck, and they were off each other, and vic was like ooh, like, you know, tasty.\n\nand then - so that ended up being the kind of - the song ended up having this groove, and it was - you know, when i saw him play it before, you wouldn't have called it a - it didn't have a groove, per se. and then it - the song just kind of - it was, you know, a series of - the way songs like this kind of come together, there's like a series of accidents or ideas or people putting things out there, and then it's like weird lego where things just start fitting.\n\ngross: vic, let's talk about the lyric. the song is about flirting with suicide, but from what i've read, you've done more than flirt with it. it's something you've tried.\n\nmr. chesnutt: right. well, this song is a love song. it's a suicide's breakup song with death. you know, i've attempted suicide three or four times. it didn't take. and this is really a breakup song with death. you know, it's talking about flirting with, you know, flirting - i had flirted with death my whole life, you know. even as a young kid, i was sick and almost died a few times. and then suicide attempts - it's a kind of - you know, it's a breakup song.\n\ngross: did you try to kill yourself even before the accident?\n\nmr. chesnutt: i did, yeah.\n\ngross: and after the accident?\n\nmr. chesnutt: i did, yeah.\n\ngross: and each time when you came through, when as you put it, death didn't take, were you relieved or sorry?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, you know, it's more complex. you can't... i couldn't say either. i mean, you know, sometimes i'd be angry.\n\ngross: angry that...\n\nmr. chesnutt: angry that they revived me, you know? i'd be like, how dare you? you know, how dare you people interfere in my, you know, what is obviously my life, my wish? but you know, of course, as the hours and days wear on, you realize well, there is joy to be had. i mean, this is how i - i'm sure everybody's different, you know, just how i, how it struck me. you know, when the days would wear on, you know, i would start to, you know, see some joy again in the world and be like whew, i eked - i squeaked that one out.\n\ngross: this is such an emotionally heavy album. is it hard to write a song like this, about flirting with suicide, or is it therapeutic to write it, or you know...?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, it occurred to me that i would like to sing this song where at the first half of it, you think i'm singing it about a lover, and then it becomes obvious that i'm singing about death. death is my lover. and it took a bit of time to get it to fit just right and to work. and when we were actually cutting the track, it was hard to make it through without kind of breaking down emotionally and just crying. you know, it's a heavy song, no doubt about it.\n\ngross: now, one of the heavy lines in it is about your mother. you write, when my mom was cancer sick, she fought but then succumbed to it, but you made her beg for it. lord jesus please, i'm ready. how old were you when she died?\n\nmr. chesnutt: i was in my mid-20s. and that's the thing about a suicidal person, i think, is that, you know, i mean, right after my mom died was, like, one of my last suicide attempts. it really destroyed me. my dad had died a year before, and that was the end of my whole close family, who had all died off within two or three years of each other: my grandpa, my grandma, my other grandma, my mom and my dad. they all died off in a couple of years. and so i felt lost, and i was depressed. but also you see - a suicidal person, when you see somebody else die of natural causes or whatever, for me it's also a kind of wakeup call.\n\ngross: tell me more about what, the effect that had?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, like when my friends have died or something like that, it made me feel silly. my sorrow seemed silly and that i'm not ready to go. as i said in the song, the sweet relief, i'm not - i don't deserve the sweet relief of death yet, because i haven't accomplished my tasks yet.\n\ngross: um...\n\nmr. chesnutt: but i do want to say one thing, though, about this song.\n\ngross: yeah, go ahead.\n\nmr. chesnutt: this song is a joyous song, though. i mean, it's a heavy song, but it is a joyous song. this is a breakup song with death, you know what i mean?\n\ngross: right, because you're saying clearly, i wasn't ready.\n\nmr. chesnutt: i'm not ready to kill myself, you know. it's a joyous song, so -and it has these very heavy aspects, you know, but it's a joyous song.\n\ngross: well, guy, i want to thank you for talking with us. i'm going to ask vic to stick around. we're going to have a kind of biographical interview. but thanks for talking with us about what's happening instrumentally on vic chesnutt's new cd, and thanks very much, and guy plays guitar and has done some of the arranging on the new cd at the cut, and he was a co-founder of the band fugazi. thanks and all the best to you. be well. thanks so much for talking with us.\n\nmr. picciotto: thank you, terry. see you, vic.\n\nmr. chesnutt: bye, guy.\n\ngross: vic chesnutt will be back in the second half of the show. his new cd is called at the cut. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross, back with songwriter, singer and guitarist vic chesnutt. his new album, at the cut, features several songs about mortality. he survived a serious car accident in 1983 that left him unable to walk and diminished the use of his arms and hands.\n\ncan i ask you about the accident? is that all right?\n\nmr. chesnutt: sure. of course.\n\ngross: would you tell us what you know of what happened?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, i don't remember anything of it. i don't remember the whole day really. i was so drunk. you know, it's quite a cliche: a stupid teenager out drunk and then i had a drunk-driving car wreck and broke my neck.\n\ngross: was anyone else hurt?\n\nmr. chesnutt: nobody else was in the car. i ran into a ditch and flipped over and just, you know, broke my neck.\n\ngross: how much movement did you lose?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, i'm a quadriplegic from my neck down. i'm, you know, i'm an incomplete spinal cord injury. that means that i have feeling all over my body and i can move my legs a little bit and, so it's a very strange, very strange injury. it's not like your typical spinal cord injury. it's very different.\n\ngross: it sounds like you feel enough to feel physical pain but you don't have enough feeling to actually be able to move.\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, i can move my legs a little bit. i mean i can't walk.\n\ngross: mm-hmm.\n\nmr. chesnutt: i mean i can walk with a walker, somewhat, but not really functionally. if i fell down i'd never be able to get up.\n\ngross: right. but you play guitar, right?\n\nmr. chesnutt: i play guitar. yes. my fingers are definitely affected greatly by my injury. greatly. in fact, yeah, they - my fingers don't move too good at all.\n\ngross: so how do you manage to play?\n\nmr. chesnutt: i just figured out a way to do it, you know? it's very strange. it's hard work to do it. it's not easy.\n\ngross: now, i know some quadriplegics don't have a lot of breath support and it's hard for them to sing.\n\nmr. chesnutt: yeah.\n\ngross: but you don't seem to have trouble with that.\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, i think one half of my diaphragm is completely paralyzed, the other one has some, you know, i think that one half of my diaphragm kind of works.\n\ngross: how did your music change? where were you headed before the accident, musically?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, i played - my chords were a lot different. there was a lot more kind of odd chords and things in my songs before i broke my neck. there were a little more jazzy chords that my granddad taught me and a lot more kind of, yeah, strange chords and not just open g's and e minors and thing like that. those were not acceptable before my accident. i also, you know, i was 18 when i broke my neck. i didn't really have anything to say at the time. i wasn't sure what was - i just didn't know what i wanted to say. it was only after i broke my neck and after even like maybe a year later that i really started realizing that i had something to say. and physically, when i could start playing the guitar again after about a year, i realized that all i could play were these kinds of you know, g, f, c - those kind of chords. and so it was going to be - well, that's what i was going to do.\n\ngross: you could only play those chords for technical reasons because you didn't have enough mobility to play chords more complicated?\n\nmr. chesnutt: exactly. exactly.\n\ngross: so you say it was after the accident that you really felt you found yourself musically. let me play a song from the first album that you made which is called little. and it was recorded in - was it 1990?\n\nmr. chesnutt: 1988.\n\ngross: 1988. so this is...\n\nmr. chesnutt: mm-hmm.\n\ngross: ...about five years after the accident?\n\nmr. chesnutt: 19 - yeah. five years after. right.\n\ngross: okay. the song i want to play is speed racer. so tell us about the song before we hear it.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. chesnutt: yeah. well, it's a kind of a little manifesto, i guess, in a way. it's kind of like, you know, a young man's realization of - where a young man's epiphany about his worldview, you know? and it's me. it's straight, you know, me as a young man. i was sitting in a college class and i had this realization. and there it is, this song, you know, speed racer. it's an atheist manifesto.\n\ngross: okay. so this is vic chesnutt from his first album back in 1988. the album's called little. the song is speed racer.\n\n(soundbite of song, speed racer)\n\nmr. chesnutt: (singing) i think it's my attention span eclipted by tv at an early age. well, who heard the radio when you are five years old? i used to watch speed racer with that hyper attitude that carried me here to this, a fluorescent enlightenment. i'm not a victim, i'm not a victim. oh, i am intelligent, i am intelligent. i'm not a victim, i'm not a victim. oh, i am an atheist, i am an atheist.\n\ngross: that's vic chesnutt from his first album recorded in 1988. you described it as an atheist manifesto. and, you know, this song proclaims: i'm not a victim. i am intelligent. i am an atheist. why did you feel that you needed to declare in a song that you are an atheist?\n\nmr. chesnutt: i'm not sure. i mean it was a joyful experience to sing the song on stage in that - in those days and i felt like it was an epiphany and it was, it is a revelation. and it's an exaltation, you know? and it's thrilling to sing this, you know? i mean it's in the same way that christians sing gospel songs at the top of their lungs, you know, i'm an atheist and i sing about my worldview at the top of my lungs with a great amount of joy and conviction.\n\ngross: one of the things i find interesting about like the declaration is that like so many people after something like horrible has happened in their life, they turn to god whether they believed or not before. and you obviously did not.\n\nmr. chesnutt: right. well, i'd already - i had my whole - my religious conversion at age of 12 or 13 or something like that. so that had no effect on my worldview at all. and...\n\ngross: what did your parents and grandparents have to say about that?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well they were, of course, they were not happy. i mean they were evangelical christians and they were not happy. they were in fact, bummed. in every...\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. chesnutt: ...every conversation i had with them from that time - about 12 years old until they died - was tinted with this disappointment and also them telling me well, you know, you're going to go to hell.\n\ngross: did it get worse after the accident? did they tell you that now you really had to pray?\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, there was a great deal of friction because they were trying to bring in healers and things. and i ended up for a month living with this faith-healer-type person in tupelo, mississippi, who tortured me with acupuncture and he didn't know what he was doing. but my parents firmly believed that faith - this guy was a faith healer - could heal me. and i went through with it just because i love my parents but i had zero faith in this guy. you know, the holy spirit fixing my spinal cord injury, i had zero faith in that.\n\ngross: so did he blame you for not healing - because when he didn't heal you, did he blame you since you didn't have faith in him and that was why he couldn't heal you?\n\nmr. chesnutt: he did. he did. he did. yeah. he did.\n\ngross: and...\n\nmr. chesnutt: i mean was giving me acupuncture. i mean this is a, you know...\n\ngross: and yet, he wasn't an acupuncturist is the point you're making, right? yeah.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. chesnutt: no. he was not an acupuncturist.\n\ngross: yeah.\n\nmr. chesnutt: no. no.\n\ngross: all right.\n\nmr. chesnutt: but, you know, it was a great, i mean my parents did feel like i had a great gift. they said you've got a great gift. your music, you have a great gift. you could be a great preacher. but you are doing the opposite of that, and it broke their hearts.\n\ngross: my guest is songwriter, singer and guitarist vic chesnutt. his new album is called at the cut. we'll talk more after a break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: let's get back to our interview with songwriter, singer and guitarist vic chesnutt. his new album is called at the cut.\n\ni want to play another song from your new cd, at the cut, and this is a song called granny that's about one of your grandmothers. you had mentioned that your grandfather was a guitarist and singer and he taught you how to play guitar. is this grandmother - was she married to him or is she a different grandmother?\n\nmr. chesnutt: no, this is my - this is the other one. this is the other grandmother.\n\ngross: so tell us about the song.\n\nmr. chesnutt: well, yeah. this is a very strange song. this song is the only one i've ever done this with but i dreamed it. i dreamt it completely as is on this album. i was in a hotel room in toronto and i dreamt this song. i was looking at my granny. she was at the kitchen sink and i was looking up at my granny from the perspective of a child. and i was crying in my dream. and then i woke up and my - the pillow was sopping wet. my face was all wet and so obviously i was actually crying. and i realized: holy moly, this is a great song. and so i reached over and i got the hotel stationery and pen and i wrote down the lyrics as exactly as they were in my dream. and then i reached over and got my guitar and i figured out the chords. and wow, there it is. straight from my subconscious to the recording tape. i mean it's an incredible thing that's never happened to me before.\n\ngross: and does the song come out of real life?\n\nmr. chesnutt: i mean it's pretty much - i mean my gran - something i could sing to my granny. i mean, in my dream, i was singing it to my granny. the last line about you are the light of my life and the beat of my heart, she always told me that. and it's about, you know, she said that i came around just when, you know, not a year after her husband died, and like i had a special place in her heart because of that. so i mean it's really, you know, very much straight out of my life and straight out of my subconscious.\n\ngross: okay. this is vic chesnutt with his song granny from his new cd, at the cut.\n\n(soundbite of song, granny)\n\nmr. chesnutt: (singing) granny, oh granny, where did your husband, my granddaddy go? where did your husband, my granddaddy go? she said he went off to heaven just before you were born. she said he went off to heaven just before you were born. she said he went off to heaven just before you were born. and she said you are the light of my life and the beat of my heart. she said, you are the light of my life, and the beat of my heart. she said, you are the light of my life, and the beat of my heart. she said, you are the light of my life, and the beat of my heart.\n\ngross: that's vic chesnutt from his new cd, at the cut. and that song is called granny. so, were you very close with the grandmother who you wrote that song for?\n\nmr. chesnutt: yeah. my - that granny, it's my dad's mom. she lived in the house with us. and so, you know, she kind of took care of us. my mom and dad were commuters. they had a long drive from pike county to the atlanta airport and to downtown atlanta. so, they were gone before i got up in the morning and they came home late in the evening. and so, my granny was there to take care of me and my sister. and yeah, she was great. i was pretty close with her. you know, we butted heads a lot, too, of course. but yeah, i loved her.\n\ngross: i read that you're in debt like $50,000 because of health insurance issues.\n\nmr. chesnutt: that's right.\n\ngross: so - and this is because you had a series of surgeries and although you pay a lot for your health insurance, it didn't cover all of it. is that - do i have that right?\n\nmr. chesnutt: that's exactly true, yeah.\n\ngross: uh-huh. so, what are your thoughts now as you watch the health care legislation controversy play out?\n\nmr. chesnutt: wow. i have been amazed and confused by the health care debate. we need health care reform. there is no doubt about it, we really need health care reform in this country. because it's absurd that somebody like me has to pay so much, it's just too expensive in this country. it's just ridiculously expensive. that they can take my house away for a kidney stone operation is -that's absurd.\n\ngross: is that what you're facing the possibility of now?\n\nmr. chesnutt: yeah. i mean, it could - i'm not sure exactly. i mean, i don't have cash money to pay these people. i tried to pay them. i tried to make payments and then they finally ended up saying, no, you have to pay us in full now. and so, you know, i'm not sure what exactly my options are. i just - i really - you know, my feeling is that i think they've been paid, they've already been paid $100,000 from my insurance company. that seems like plenty. i mean, this would pay for like five or six of these operations in any other country in the world. you know, it affects - i mean, right now i need another surgery and i've been putting it off for a year because i can't afford it. and that's absurd, i think.\n\ni mean, i could actually lose a kidney. and, i mean, i could die only because i cannot afford to go in there again. i don't want to die, especially just because of i don't have enough money to go in the hospital. but that's the reality of it. you know, i have a preexisting condition, my quadriplegia, and i can't get health insurance.\n\ngross: is it true you can't get good health insurance?\n\nmr. chesnutt: i can't get - i'm uninsurable. the only reason i have any insurance now is because i was on capitol records for a while. and i had excellent health insurance there. and then when i got dropped from capitol, i cobra'd my insurance for as long as it was legally possible. and then -which was insanely expensive, to cobra this very nice insurance. and then, when that ran out, the insurance company said they could offer me one last thing and that is hospitalization. it only covers hospital bills. that's all it covers. and it's still $500 a month. so, it doesn't pay for my drugs, my doctors or anything like that. all it pays for is hospitalization. and yet, i still owe all this money on top of that.\n\ngross: wow. well, i wish you the best with your health and your music. and i really want to thank you...\n\nmr. chesnutt: thank you.\n\ngross: ...a lot for talking with us.\n\nmr. chesnutt: oh, i'm honored, honored beyond belief.\n\ngross: vic chesnutt's new cd is called at the cut.\n\ncopyright © 2009 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
improving npr's workplace culture\n\nnpr's leadership is committed to addressing issues of sexual harassment and has taken immediate steps to improve npr's work environment and our complaint process.\n\nfor the past three months npr's chief operating officer loren mayor has been meeting with groups of employees to hear their concerns and ask what npr could be doing better to rebuild trust and improve workplace culture after revelations of sexual harassment forced us to reexamine our workplace. supported by staff input, npr has instituted several workplace improvement initiatives, including the following:\n\nclarifying and strengthening the complaint process. we have clarified the process for making complaints and added new avenues for raising concerns of inappropriate behavior, including an anonymous hotline. we have identified and communicated a range of consequences for inappropriate behavior. these include verbal warnings, personalized training, a change of responsibilities or assignments, suspension, and termination. we have enhanced our investigation process, reviewing complaints by representatives of both the hr and legal teams and working with outside counsel and our union representatives as appropriate. our overarching goal is to ensure that everyone at npr is safe and treated with respect.\n\ncreating the anti-harassment support group. this will be a network of trained and vetted volunteer colleagues who will listen and assist staff who may have experienced unwelcome behavior at work, including sexual harassment. the volunteers will advise and serve as guides through npr's misconduct reporting process if actions are warranted. the group will work as an independent partner with npr's management, hr and legal departments, as appropriate, to make sure npr staff are getting the right support and follow-up when misconduct has been reported.\n\nimproving sexual harassment training. we are replacing our bi-annual, online sexual harassment training module with mandatory, in-person sexual harassment training provided annually and more frequently if warranted.\n\nconducting a climate survey. this project is being led by a cross-functional employee team who will work with a vendor to conduct an evaluation of the corporate culture, provide recommendations to strengthen the work environment, and provide skill building for all employees.\n\nstrengthening our hr function. a strong hr function is essential in our work to improve our culture. we have elevated the senior-most position in hr to chief hr officer, we are adding capacity to the team with dedicated hr support at each of our sites, we have redefined priorities to increase company-wide efforts to improve training and foster an inclusive work place, and we are developing ways to increase executive accountability and increase employee engagement.\n\nincrease training opportunities. we want to ensure that everyone has the tools to advance their careers and be successful at npr – including managers and employees, whether regular or temporary, full time or part time. we are working to provide the training and development tools to support that.\n\nwhile we have enacted these changes, the npr board of directors has also retained the law firm morgan lewis to investigate sexual harassment at npr and review npr's related processes and procedures. the board will issue recommendations based on the report and we will incorporate them into our work.\n\nthe activities outlined here present a snap shot of where we are now in our effort to strengthen the culture of npr. this is a work in progress, and we will continue to listen to our staff and adjust and improve as needed. our overarching goal, however, is to ensure that we have a safer, more inclusive, and more respectful environment for years to come.\n\nmany people throughout the organization are involved in making this work happen, and we are grateful for their collective effort. everyone at npr cares deeply about our mission and our audiences, and we are committed to doing everything we can to surface from this moment stronger than before.
tracking down antibody treatment is a challenge for covid-19 patients\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption irfan khan/los angeles times via getty images irfan khan/los angeles times via getty images\n\nmonoclonal antibody drugs are supposed to help people with mild to moderate covid-19 avoid the hospital, but it can be a challenge to find out where the treatment is offered. npr has heard from people across the country who have been frustrated by this.\n\nthey include shirley wagoner, an 80-year-old who still hits the ski slopes and helps run the family plumbing business in spokane valley, wash.\n\nfirst, her sons fell ill and were diagnosed with covid-19. then on the monday after christmas she came down with the symptoms of a bad cold, including a sore throat and laryngitis.\n\nshe went to her doctor's office for a coronavirus test and learned on new year's eve that she was also sick.\n\nher son-in-law, myron lee, who lives near chicago, had been tracking the disease closely and knew his mother-in-law would be a candidate for treatment with monoclonal antibodies.\n\nthese are drugs available nationwide through an emergency authorization. they're designed to bind to the coronavirus to prevent it from invading cells. the government allocates the drug to states, which in turn decide how the drugs are distributed. uptake has been irregular, in part because the medicines are cumbersome to deliver – they're given by infusion. a committee convened by the national institutes of health is also not confident that the drugs actually work.\n\neven so, the food and drug administration granted their emergency use, judging that the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks. so, lee set about looking for somewhere in spokane where his mother-in-law could get treated. he contacted the two companies that make the drug, eli lilly and regeneron, to find it in spokane. information from them was discouraging.\n\nthe weird thing is spokane's a pretty major city in the inland northwest, lee says. it's kind of a medical center for the whole inland northwest, but there's not one place in spokane that has the eli lilly drug.\n\na representative from the eli lilly hotline (855-lillyc19) gave him phone numbers of facilities within a few hours' drive. (regeneron's hotline is 844-734-6643.)\n\nwagoner started calling around, including to her own doctor's office, which falsely informed her she would need to be hospitalized to be eligible for the drug. in fact, hospitalized patients aren't eligible for this treatment because clinical tests indicated they were only effective early in the disease.\n\nthen i called the washington state public health [department], and they'd never heard of either therapeutic, wagoner said.\n\nstate health officials eventually told lee to call the big hospital in spokane, but he simply got the runaround there and never learned whether it provides the treatment. wagoner finally found a clinic about an hour and a half's drive away that would see her, but only if she could find a doctor in that town who would prescribe it.\n\nand then i got to thinking, by the time i had my husband drive me there, have the doctor appointment, get the infusion, which takes an hour, and then they keep you two hours to make sure you don't have a reaction, and drive home, it would almost be too much for me, wagoner said. it was overwhelming.\n\nby then more than a week had elapsed since her first symptoms. the drugs are thought to work best within a few days of symptoms. fortunately, she was starting to feel better on her own, so she simply gave up the search. she remembered president trump promising that everyone could get this drug after he himself took it.\n\nthat was my frustration, she said. trump said we could have them, but you can't get the dang things!\n\nthe treasure-hunt aspect for patients is slowly improving. the national infusion center association built a website that now lists clinics known to offer it. (it shows that the regeneron drug has been shipped to a clinic in coeur d'alene, idaho, which is not far from spokane.)\n\njanelle sabo, who manages covid-19 drugs at eli lilly, said her company has fielded a couple of thousand calls asking for help locating the monoclonal antibody, and she's happy to see that the federal government has launched a locator website, too.\n\nas of monday, the federal website only had information for 22 states. (washington was not among them.) but hopefully that will change very soon, sabo says. i know the government is as motivated as we are to make sure people know how to access this medication and to try to avoid hospitalizations.\n\nbecause the drug has not been granted full fda approval, lilly is restricted in how it can promote the drug, sabo says. it's also a challenge that many people learn they have covid-19 from a testing center, not from their physician. people may in fact not have a regular physician, and doctors may not know where to refer patients for treatment in any event.\n\nsabo says some coronavirus testing sites are starting to hand out information about the antibody drugs, including information about where they are available locally. those are proving to be quite successful, she says, because very early on the patient knows what to do with their results.\n\nstill despite these gradual steps forward, right now there are hundreds of thousands of doses that have been distributed and not yet used, health and human services secretary alex azar said last week.\n\nyou can contact npr science correspondent richard harris at rharris@npr.org.
iowa democrats work to lower barriers to caucus participation\n\nthe iowa caucuses are criticized for excluding people who work nights, are out of town or don't speak english well. this year, democrats are setting up satellite caucuses to make them more accessible.\n\ndavid folkenflik, host:\n\nfor all the attention the iowa caucuses get, even in a high turnout year, less than 20% of eligible voters will come out to caucus. people have to miss work or take a time out of their evening in order to participate. and on top of that, language barriers stop some from caucusing in a state that's often criticized for being less diverse than many others. kate payne of iowa public radio and jimmy jenkins of kjzz bring this report on how iowa democrats are trying to respond to those concerns.\n\nkate payne, byline: this year, iowa democrats are allowing what they're calling satellite caucuses. they're places for people to go to participate that aren't their regular neighborhood precincts. some are at hospitals to catch people on the night shift, others at college campuses. and there'll be a site here at hoover elementary school in suburban cedar rapids. it's geared towards people whose native language isn't english.\n\ncaucus organizer and school employee lemi tilahun says hoover students and their families speak more than 20 languages.\n\nlemi tilahun: french creole, swahili, spanish, kirundi, french.\n\npayne: tilahun's team hopes a hundred people will caucus here. many of them will probably be parents of students and first-time caucusgoers, and they'll be able to participate in their own languages with help from interpreters, which he says will make a huge difference.\n\ntilahun: the families and neighbors around this area are not as engaged, so it's an opportunity for building a new voter base.\n\npayne: we step into a fourth-grade classroom. tilahun tells the kids to talk with their parents about caucusing.\n\ntilahun: so how many of you have gone to a caucus before?\n\nunidentified student #1: what's a caucus?\n\nunidentified student #2: what's a caucus?\n\nunidentified teacher: raise your hand.\n\ntilahun: that's a good question.\n\npayne: this year, there will be 97 of these sites. they'll be scattered across iowa and the country, and three will even be overseas. this is the first cycle iowans outside of the state will be able to caucus at this scale. my colleague jimmy jenkins got to go see a site in arizona.\n\n(soundbite of doorbell)\n\njimmy jenkins, byline: hi.\n\njoan koenigs: oh, nice to meet you. i'm joan.\n\njenkins: nice to meet you.\n\nj koenigs: come on in.\n\njenkins: thanks. thanks for having me in.\n\ni'm at the home of joan and deo koenigs, an hour east of phoenix. longtime iowa farmers, the koenigs were heavily involved in state politics. but since their retirement, they've been spending the winters here.\n\ndeo koenigs: snowbirds.\n\nj koenigs: we came out as a grand adventure. we didn't even know where we were going. we didn't plan on staying every year.\n\njenkins: but she says they fell in love with arizona. and the koenigs aren't the only iowans on the block. pat kramer just bought a home down the street a year ago.\n\npat kramer: i love the area. you can't beat the sunshine or the weather in the winter.\n\njenkins: while they don't miss shoveling snow, joan says caucusing is still a part of their identity.\n\nj koenigs: i always felt bad when we missed caucus because we have been political all our lives.\n\njenkins: and she says this year feels especially important. so joan applied to the iowa democratic party and was approved to host a caucus at her house. she was going to have people gather in the bedrooms and the kitchen and allow for overflow out onto the patio.\n\nj koenigs: and so i said, sure, that's what we'll do. little did i know.\n\njenkins: the response has been so big joan had to move the caucus to a nearby movie theater. she expects over a hundred people to show up on february 3. but back in iowa, my colleague kate payne says there's lots of questions about the future of the caucus.\n\npayne: the satellite sites could attract hundreds, maybe even a few thousand more people. the chairman of the iowa democrats, troy price, says the caucuses are getting modernized.\n\ntony price: the changes we're making this year are some of the biggest ones that we've made since the caucuses were created.\n\npayne: but critics say these satellite sites are not enough to fix what they see as fundamental problems. the process isn't set up for people who work at night, have little kids or don't have a car.\n\njon green: they're undemocratic. they're not inclusive. it's time-consuming.\n\npayne: jon green is with the johnson county democrats, and he'll be running a caucus site in the city of lone tree. green is one of an increasingly vocal number of iowa democrats who want the party to scrap the caucuses.\n\ngreen: and that doesn't mean that i'm not willing to do the best i can with what we've got. but by god, we'd better have something better four years from now.\n\npayne: some iowa democrats say adding satellite caucuses will make the process more inclusive, but green sees it as a marginal change. whether they're in arizona or iowa, he says most voters don't want to spend several hours at a caucus. they just want to vote and go home.\n\nfor npr news, i'm kate payne in iowa.\n\njenkins: and i'm jimmy jenkins in arizona.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at

concern grows for loujain al-hathloul, jailed saudi women's driving activist\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption doaa jamal doaa jamal\n\nin 2014, a 25-year-old saudi woman, loujain al-hathloul, got behind the wheel of a car and drove from the united arab emirates into saudi arabia. she took a video in which she's shown wearing sunglasses, a headscarf and a huge smile.\n\nfor women, driving was banned in the ultra-conservative saudi kingdom, and hathloul's road trip landed her in jail for more than two months.\n\ndespite her arrest, hathloul, who had a driver's license from the uae, continued to battle for saudi women's right to drive. but her efforts took a more grave turn last march, when she was arrested in the uae, says adam coogle, a middle east researcher with human rights watch.\n\nshe was ... pulled over while she was driving and apparently taken and put on a plane to riyadh in very murky circumstances, he says. she was briefly detained in riyadh before being released. then, coogle says, in may, just before saudi arabia lifted a ban on female drivers last june 24, hathloul was picked up again in the larger crackdown against the women's rights movement.\n\ncoogle says between 10 and 12 women, including academics and journalists, were swept up in that crackdown. saudi authorities still haven't clarified why the women, most of whom remain in prison to this day, were arrested.\n\nwhen they arrested them, they accused them publicly of treason and ran a smear campaign against them, he says. in fact, the women have not actually been presented with any charge.\n\nurooba jamal, 26, a friend of hathloul's since they were students at the university of british columbia in vancouver, says it's clear the saudi authorities do not like independent activism as a way of prompting change in the kingdom.\n\ni think that saudi arabia has felt threatened by the activists and their positions, and i think they're trying to teach them a lesson, she says.\n\njamal is part of a vancouver-based group called friends of loujain, calling for the release of hathloul and the other jailed saudi female activists.\n\ni felt compelled to join friends of loujain simply as someone who knew her, and someone who has watched her over the years grow in her activism, she says. hathloul is someone who took a huge risk to advance women's rights in her country and now is facing the most heinous injustices, she says.\n\njamal and human rights activists believe hathloul was arrested because saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman, the country's de facto leader, did not want anyone else but him to claim credit for the end of the driving ban.\n\njamal was outraged when vogue arabia dedicated a special edition in june 2018 to the changes in the kingdom under the crown prince. there was no mention of hathloul or other driving activists, and the glossy cover, touting the trailblazing women of saudi arabia, featured a photo of a saudi princess behind the wheel of a red convertible.\n\nthe friends of loujain group parodied that image with a photo of a woman driver wearing a free loujain t-shirt. a separate photo, showing five women wearing t-shirts calling for freedom for her and four other jailed activists, was published in september in teen vogue, along with an op-ed by jamal and other group members. the women write that these activists are the real trailblazers behind the overturned [driving] ban and demand their release.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption doaa jamal doaa jamal\n\nthe following month, saudi journalist jamal khashoggi was killed at the saudi consulate in istanbul. u.s. intelligence agencies have made an assessment that the crown prince was involved in khashoggi's death.\n\njamal says khashoggi's killing raised awareness of hathloul's situation.\n\nthere was suddenly a lot of worldwide attention, not just to khashoggi's case, but also saudi arabia's human rights record, she says. a lot of people were suddenly talking about the detained activists as well.\n\nin november, amnesty international and human rights watch issued reports about mistreatment of the female activists in prison. coogle says the rights groups' allegations were firmed up by hathloul's sister alia, who wrote a jan. 13 op-ed for the new york times in which she revealed that loujain had told her parents that she had suffered brutal torture, including beatings, waterboarding, whippings, as well as electric shocks. her parents ... noticed that she was trembling and she couldn't sit or stand properly, coogle says.\n\nin a jan. 31 op-ed for cnn, hathloul's brother walid wrote that his sister described being taken at midnight to a 'palace of terror' that is 10 minutes away from the prison. she said she was taken blindfolded and thrown into the trunk of a car on the way to this secret place. the torture sessions, she said, normally occur in the basement of this palace.\n\non a visit last week to washington, d.c., saudi foreign minister adel al-jubeir said saudi authorities were looking into allegations of mistreatment. he defended the women's incarceration and accused them of being a threat to national security.\n\nthere were funds received from foreign governments that were hostile, he told reporters. there were ... attempts to recruit individuals in sensitive positions and to take sensitive information and pass it on to hostile entities outside saudi arabia. so there's more to it than meets the eye.\n\njubeir said evidence about the female activists would come up at trials. i would say wait until the trials take place and the evidence will come out, he said. those who are not implicated will be declared innocent and those who are guilty will be punished.\n\nnow, 10 months after their arrests, there's growing pressure — from western governments, human rights groups, and the u.s. and u.k. press — on saudi arabia to release the jailed female activists.\n\nlast month, an impassioned twitter thread about hathloul and her husband, comic fahad albutairi, went viral. kirk rudell, a writer and producer in los angeles, met them on the set of the tbs show american dad! in 2017, after he'd hired albutairi for a small part.\n\nrudell recalls they were a dynamic and charismatic young couple.\n\nwithout trying to own a room, they owned the room in the most in the most lovely, gracious, likeable way, he tells npr.\n\nrudell says hathloul and albutairi were hopeful about the changes in saudi arabia under crown prince mohammed bin salman. he knew that hathloul had been arrested in the past, but thought she and her husband were safe because they were so well known.\n\nhe began to worry in early january, when he saw that albutairi's twitter account disappeared, and hathloul's went dormant. that's when he discovered she was in prison and her husband was keeping quiet.\n\nrudell says he feels a profound sense of sadness and anger because when he met the couple, they told him they were excited about creative projects they were going to work on. he was stunned and gratified his tweet captured worldwide attention, including from celebrities including sarah silverman, high-profile journalists such as jake tapper and chris hayes, and politicians including california democrat adam schiff, chairman of the house intelligence committee. he says more needs to be done to ensure hathloul and the others are released from saudi prison.\n\nthey were not advocating for overthrow, he says. they love ... their country, they just wanted to be able to live in it a little more equally.
who's in, who's left out with the latest senate health care bill\n\nthe gop's latest proposal to repeal and replace the affordable care act hews closely to the earlier bill that didn't win enough support among lawmakers to bring to a vote.\n\nperhaps the biggest change in the document released thursday is that it leaves in place the affordable care act taxes on wealthy individuals. it uses that money to reduce the number of people left without insurance coverage by the law's changes. this latest version adds $70 billion to a fund for states — bringing the total to $132 billion — to help support coverage of low-income people.\n\nit also would allow insurance companies to offer health plans without the consumer protections included in the affordable care act, or obamacare. that means insurers could sell stripped-down policies that cover fewer conditions and offer fewer benefits than currently allowed under the law.\n\nloading...\n\nthose plans would very likely be cheaper than the policies currently offered on the obamacare exchanges. but for people who would like to purchase plans that cover the essential health benefits mandated by the affordable care act, including mental health coverage, addiction treatment, maternity care and prescription drug coverage, costs could go way up.\n\nthe nonpartisan congressional budget office hasn't yet analyzed the new bill. it weighed in on the earlier senate bill, saying that proposal would result in 22 million fewer people having health coverage in the next 10 years, compared with under the affordable care act. of those, 15 million would lose medicaid coverage. that version was projected to lower the deficit by billions over 10 years — but that may have changed as the latest version offers billions more for state grants and also doesn't repeal as many of the obamacare taxes.\n\nyet this new variant is the same as its predecessor when it comes to subsidies to help individuals pay for insurance. it would mostly reduce subsidies and cause out-of-pocket costs to rise, as the cbo said about the previous bill. it's not yet clear how the state grants would alter that dynamic.
u.s. enlarges its military footprint in eastern europe, to mixed reviews\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption daniel mihailescu/afp/getty images daniel mihailescu/afp/getty images\n\nthe most tangible sign of a growing american military presence in eastern europe, behind the former iron curtain, is tucked inside a former military base in rural romania.\n\nhidden from view is a u.s. naval facility, where sailors use high-tech radar day and night to watch for incoming ballistic missiles fired at nato countries. if any are spotted, the americans would fire back with sm-3 block iia missiles.\n\na second such american site will also be built in eastern europe over the next two years, this one near poland's baltic coast. it's inside a base that once belonged to the nazis and later the soviets.\n\nonce this site is finished, the entire $800 million ballistic missile defense shield for nato countries in europe, more than a decade in the making, will be complete.\n\ntop u.s. and nato officials last week declared the romanian facility up and running, and a day later broke ground on the polish site. they say the state-of-the-art aegis defense system, which will ultimately be under nato control, is about protecting the alliance against rogue states like iran and has nothing to do with russia.\n\nbut moscow considers the american bases on nato's eastern flank to be a provocation, a position russia has maintained ever since the alliance began moving into eastern europe in the 1990s, following the soviet breakup.\n\nafter the deployment of those missile defense elements, we will have to think about how we can fend off the threats to the russian federation's security, russian president vladimir putin said friday. he has rejected repeated assurances by the americans and nato that aegis is designed to take out only short-and-medium range ballistic missiles fired from outside europe.\n\ntoggle caption gabriel amza for npr\n\nit is fully compliant with existing arms control regimes, u.s. deputy defense secretary robert work said at the groundbreaking in poland.\n\nit's not about russia, added frank rose, the assistant secretary of state for arms control verification and compliance, who attended the romanian ceremony. rose says the alliance has been clear for over 20 years that u.s. and nato missile defense are not directed against russia, nor do they have the technical capability to undermine russia's strategic deterrence.\n\nthat comes as a surprise to many romanians, who have a different view of the u.s. navy's aegis ashore facility, located on the outskirts of deveselu, a farming community that is a two-hour drive southwest of the capital bucharest.\n\nromania, like poland and the baltic states, has been clamoring for more u.s. and nato troops and equipment since russia's 2014 annexation of crimea and its backing for separatists in eastern ukraine.\n\nthe obama administration responded by quadrupling its spending on initiatives intended to reassure its european allies, and it has been increasing the scope of military exercises in northern and eastern europe. the plan also includes adding a third army combat brigade in europe, as well as a continuous rotation of 4,000 nato troops in the baltic states and elsewhere in eastern europe.\n\nthe kremlin, meanwhile, is reported to have sent more troops and weapons — including missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads — into kaliningrad, a russian enclave bordered by poland and lithuania.\n\nthe buildup on both sides has been accompanied by an escalation in rhetoric. at a change-of-command ceremony earlier this month, u.s. defense secretary ash carter lashed out at moscow over its actions in ukraine, moldova and georgia. he criticized russia for intimidating its baltic neighbors.\n\nand most disturbing, moscow's nuclear saber-rattling raises troubling questions about russia's leaders' commitment to strategic stability, carter said.\n\ntoggle caption gabriel amza for npr\n\nit's making romanians nervous, too, and helps explain why they are comforted by the u.s. navy setting up a base in their country, even if the americans say it's not about russia.\n\nmarius-lucian obreja, who heads the romanian senate's defense, national security and public order committee, says russian actions are destabilizing ukraine. and russia's annexation of the crimean peninsula, some 300 miles off romanian shores, caught us off guard and leaves us in huge need of help from a military power.\n\nhe said the romanian government is working to modernize its military and join the handful of nato countries that are spending 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense, which alliance members agreed to do in 2014. but he added it will be at least a decade before the improvements are complete.\n\nthe senator said he believes that even if it isn't directly targeting russian missiles, the u.s. facility will make moscow think twice about causing trouble in eastern europe.\n\nthere's also a palpable economic benefit to the american base for the 3,500 residents of deveselu, where the whole village is getting a facelift. mayor ion aliman says about $8 million in local and european union funds have gone to upgrade the power grid, sewage systems, roads and municipal buildings to accommodate their new american neighbors, who officially moved in 18 months ago.\n\nin addition, the u.s. embassy has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to refurbish the local school and build a new kindergarten.\n\nlike many romanians, my grandfather had been waiting for the americans since 1944, and they have arrived says aliman, who has several american and nato flags hanging in his office.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption gabriel amza for npr gabriel amza for npr\n\nworkers were also busy improving roads across from the navy base last week in a housing complex known as the airmen neighborhood. lined up to look like a russian mig jet when viewed from above, the apartments and homes were built for pilots who worked at the former warsaw pact base.\n\na handful of the deveselu base veterans still live here, including retired navigator marian georgescu, 54. he boasted that he'd given some of his american neighbors rides in his horse-drawn wagon, a common form of transport in romanian farming communities.\n\nanca nelson, 34, of highland, n.y., who was visiting her mom and dad, a retired paratrooper transport pilot, says it's great to have a different culture so close to us.\n\nthis opens our minds a little bit, she added. this is a very traditional community and we haven't had contact with foreigners very often.\n\nnelson said she hopes the base will attract investors and provide jobs for residents in this impoverished region.\n\ntoggle caption michal flud/getty images\n\nhundreds of miles to the northwest, in poland, slupsk mayor robert biedron had the same hope for his picturesque city and its 100,000 residents.\n\nbut he has since soured on the american base that was first proposed nine years ago and where ground was finally broken friday at the redzikowo air base, 2 miles from his city hall.\n\nbiedron said the polish government had promised to bring in investors and improve the highways, port and railway in slupsk in exchange for the base, which he said would have otherwise been turned into a regional airport for residents.\n\nbut none of it ever happened, and the new government that took over last fall refuses to even talk about it, biedron said, adding that he is incredibly frustrated.\n\nthere are so many limitations today because of the base, he explained. if i want to built anything in my city, i have to ask the american government for permission ... like if i want to build a factory, if i want to build a higher block of flats, i have to ask — not in warsaw, but in washington, the mayor said. this is so crazy!\n\nhe added that analysts estimate the region will suffer big economic losses because of the new base.\n\nother slupsk residents i spoke to worried that the base will make them ground zero for any russian retaliation, fears that were exacerbated by a russian military jet conducting a barrel roll last month over a u.s. air force plane that was flying a reconnaissance mission above the baltic sea.\n\none 72-year-old retiree, who said she was too afraid to give her name, whispered that she has always been against building an american base in her community. it's a provocation to the russians, she said, and that makes a lot of us afraid.
gop '200 day' agenda calls for spending, tax cuts. but what about the deficit?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption matt rourke/ap matt rourke/ap\n\nbuckle up. we're ready to go to work, vice president pence told republican lawmakers at their annual retreat in philadelphia on thursday.\n\nwith a gop administration in place for the first time in eight years, congressional leaders have mapped out an ambitious legislative agenda, with goals to have bills to repeal and replace obamacare, overhaul the tax code and build a wall on the u.s.-mexico border, all before lawmakers break for the annual august recess.\n\nwe've been working with the administration on a daily basis to map out and plan a very bold and aggressive agenda to make good on our campaign promises and to fix these problems, house speaker paul ryan told reporters gathered here for the party's annual three-day gop policy retreat. pence and president trump joined the lawmakers here on thursday.\n\nthe agenda will test the party's commitment to small government and a fiscal conservatism that in recent years has rejected any new spending without corresponding cuts in the federal budget.\n\ntrump's promises to expand health care coverage and spend more on the nation's ailing infrastructure systems — while cutting taxes for businesses and individuals — will be hard to reconcile with competing gop commitments to balance the budget and reduce the nation's debt burden.\n\nnearly all congressional republicans are self-described fiscal conservatives. but trump has shown support for vast new federal spending — like that $1 trillion infrastructure proposal — and an indifference to deficit spending if it can spur u.s. economic growth. for instance, republicans largely agree that tax cuts do not need to be paid for and consider them economic stimulus.\n\nryan would not say republican policies won't increase the deficit in the short term, but he reiterated a long-standing commitment to paying for new spending. we are fiscal conservatives. if we're going to be spending on things like say, infrastructure, we're going to find the fiscal space to pay for that in our spring budget, he said, referring to the annual budget resolution.\n\nrepublicans are already working to provide trump with $12 billion to $15 billion in new spending to fund his call to finish a border wall with mexico. congress is expected to use an upcoming defense supplemental spending bill to include new border funds. the supplemental spending bill is considered emergency spending and does not require spending offsets. ryan and mcconnell declined to answer repeated questions about whether the wall would be offset in the federal budget. trump has insisted mexico will reimburse the u.s. for the costs, through undetermined new measures affecting trade and tax policy with mexico.\n\nleaders say they are on the same page as the trump administration on an agenda that has expanded to the first 200 days in part to accommodate extra scheduling burdens in the senate related to the confirmation process for trump's cabinet and an upcoming supreme court nominee.\n\nryan and mcconnell struck a more cautious tone to reporters on their timeline for moving legislation. we don't want to set arbitrary deadlines on things. we want to get things right, ryan said.\n\nthe speaker understands the challenges of getting things through the senate, mcconnell added. that's been true for 240 years. but we're aware of those challenges and we think we can move forward.\n\nhowever, in a presentation to lawmakers on wednesday leaders outlined a 2017 program that included a specific timeline, including:\n\nrepeal and replace legislation for obamacare to president trump by early april\n\na defense and border supplemental funding bill by april\n\nan infrastructure bill by early summer\n\na tax overhaul and revamp of the irs by august\n\ncongress also wants to pass laws affecting federal flood insurance, veterans health care and financial regulations by the end of the year. lawmakers are also anticipating further executive actions from the trump administration on immigration and health care. the ambitious agenda is being pushed by trump, who has told lawmakers he wants quick action on his priorities.\n\npresident trump comes from a different world, house majority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., told reporters. out in the business community, he likes things done fast, and he's going to continue to push them.\n\non thursday, the president did. we have to deliver, he told lawmakers. this is our chance to make major and lasting change.
trump lashes out after pence refuses to overturn election results\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption drew angerer/getty images drew angerer/getty images\n\nupdated at 2:45 p.m. et\n\nfor a vice president who has navigated service to a mercurial president with praise and public acts of loyalty, vice president pence faced the ultimate challenge on wednesday as he presided over a joint session of congress that will make official joe biden's election — and president trump's loss.\n\ntrump has repeatedly and publicly lobbied pence to reverse the nov. 3 election outcome, including in a meandering, grievance-filled speech near the white house as pence drove to the capitol to take his place at the head of the joint session.\n\nas trump spoke, pence released a letter to congress that made clear he would not do what trump wanted.\n\nit is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not, pence wrote as trump badgered him to send results back to state legislatures.\n\npence agreed with experts who, in recent days, underscored that his role in the session is a ceremonial one: as the president of the senate, his actions are prescribed by law and the constitution.\n\ni don't think that vice president pence has any significant discretion in what he does, said joel goldstein, an emeritus professor of law at st. louis university and an expert in the vice presidency. the constitution assigns him a very modest role.\n\nthat's not how trump saw it. he called on pence to show extreme courage.\n\nmike pence, i hope you're going to stand up for the good of our constitution and the good of our country and if you're not, i'm going to be very disappointed in you, trump said in his speech.\n\nafter his remarks, trump supporters marched to capitol hill where they pushed past barricades and some broke in to the building, which had been locked down. pence was whisked out the senate chamber. not long after, trump tweeted a rebuke of his wingman.\n\nabout 15 minutes later, trump followed up to tell his supporters to stay peaceful.\n\n'diligent and studious approach'\n\nahead of wednesday's events, there had been little doubt that pence would side with trump. an administration official told npr on tuesday that pence intends to follow the law and uphold the constitution. the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record to reporters, said pence has consulted his general counsel, his chief of staff and the senate's parliamentarian ahead of the joint session.\n\nthe vp has taken a pretty diligent and studious approach to how he prepares for [wednesday's] proceedings, the official said. the official said pence, a lawyer by training, had also read legal opinions on the matter and had studied the electoral count act, and the 12th amendment of the constitution, which establish how the electoral votes are counted.\n\non tuesday evening, after the new york times reported that pence told trump he doesn't have the power to change the election result, trump released a statement calling the report false. he said he and pence are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act.\n\ntrump's public lobbying and denial of the election outcome — and the anger he has directed at republicans who have rejected his assertions — put pence in an unenviable and unprecedented bind.\n\nvice president pence is between the constitution and president trump, goldstein said. he finds himself in a situation where the president is articulating unfounded and unrealistic and simply wrong expectations of his role, and it's a very unforgiving president.\n\nduring his four years in office, pence has mastered the art of standing by the president without standing by his words, of conveniently shrinking from view when he'd rather not answer questions about something trump has said or tweeted, of looking off into the middle distance, expressionless as the president says something extreme, or outlandish or obviously wrong, of praising trump for saying something the president has never actually said, at least not in public.\n\nso, when trump first started claiming he had won the election when he hadn't, pence tweeted a message that never directly addressed the president's falsehood, or repeated them.\n\nand earlier this week, campaigning in georgia, pence walked a careful line.\n\ni share the concerns of millions of americans about voting irregularities, pence said. and i promise you, come this wednesday, we'll have our day in congress. we'll hear the objections. we'll hear the evidence.\n\nand that's true: republican members of the house and senate do plan to raise objections, and there will be debate. in the end, though, biden's election will be finalized. there are more than enough democrats and republicans in both chambers to overrule the objections. pence's role isn't to act as a judge or jury. he essentially just reads the results, as vice presidents have before him — though in his rally speech, pence stopped short of explaining that, and instead moved on to encourage people to vote in georgia's senate runoffs.\n\nbut this isn't about pence, argues mike duhaime, a republican political strategist. this, he said, is about trump putting a spotlight on pence over something that should just be ceremonial, passing quietly without much notice.\n\nmike pence was incredibly loyal for four years, plus the campaign before that, really did anything the president asked, even at times where it was probably very difficult for mike pence, duhaime said.\n\nwith trump you're only as good as the next loyalty test, duhaime said. you have to be perfect 100% of the time or you are going to suffer the wrath.\n\nand that could be a problem for pence, who is often talked about as a potential 2024 presidential contender, if trump doesn't run. if trump ends up turning on pence or doesn't publicly forgive him, then there are people in the trump base who will never forgive pence either, duhaime said.\n\ngoldstein, though, said there are longer-term stakes at play, arguing that pence will be remembered favorably for following the law and the constitution.\n\nif people don't like you because you refused to break the law or you insisted on telling the truth or following your constitutional and legal duty — shame on them, not shame on you, goldstein said.
view from paris\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nfrance and britain, of course, joined the u.s. overnight in launching those airstrikes against chemical weapons stockpiles. the french president, emmanuel macron, has consistently said the use of chemical weapons is a red line to him and if syrian president assad - and syrian president bashar al-assad has crossed it. that action came last night even though a chemical weapons verification mission was to begin today. eleanor beardsley is in paris. eleanor, thanks very much for being with us.\n\neleanor beardsley, byline: it's good to be here, scott.\n\nsimon: the french say that they have proof enough to launch attacks last night, right?\n\nbeardsley: yeah, absolutely. president macron said this week on television he had no doubt that chemical weapons were used. and today, the french foreign minister, jean-yves le drian, spoke, and he said they have undeniable proof of chemical weapons use from french intelligence sources on the ground, from independent medical sources, as well as photos and satellite images. and in fact, he says it's all published. it's on the internet under the french presidency's website so you can see it. and he said that the mission starting work today is really late. he said the russians repeatedly vetoed the use of another monitoring group that had confirmed the use of chemical weapons last year, scott. they were very effective. they were already, you know, nearly on the ground, and they could have quickly gone in. the russians continuously vetoed that.\n\nsimon: can you tell from paris do the french anticipate more airstrikes?\n\nbeardsley: well, foreign minister le drian said for the moment this is it. they've achieved their goal, hitting weapons, you know, chemical weapons depots and a research facility. he says he thinks they've pretty much knocked out nearly all of the syrian regime's capacity to use chemical weapons. but he added this when he spoke on television this morning.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\njean-yves le drian: (speaking french).\n\nbeardsley: he says a second goal of the strikes was to show assad that when you cross the red line - when you cross red lines, there are immediate consequences. we want to make sure he does not use chemical weapons against his people again. he said while the goals achieved last night were good, he said assad and his allies better heed this warning. and he said if assad ever tries it again, we will strike again. but he added that he thinks assad has understood the lesson.\n\nsimon: let me ask about the russian position. they insist there's no proof yet of chemical weapons. in fact, a russian general yesterday, i believe, said that british intelligence had somehow faked the attack in that suburb. could this attack escalate tensions now between the u.s., britain, france and russia?\n\nbeardsley: well, surely it is not going to calm things, scott. it will escalate tensions, but when the french defense minister spoke and the americans and british have also said this, the strike was very targeted. they stayed within their goals, which was to take out illegal chemical weapons. in no way was it meant to escalate the situation or change the war situation on the ground. in fact, macron said this week the strikes were necessary to fight against what he sees as a normalization of the use of chemical weapons. it cannot be a normal thing. macron has made it clear from the beginning exactly where he stands on this.\n\njust after being elected, he said that that was a red line for him, chemical weapons use, and that he would take measures if assad crossed that red line. and in fact, scott, he said this in public standing next to vladimir putin who was visiting france last may. macron's actually been working to keep putin in the loop. putin has been increasingly isolated. macron's been talking to him through this crisis. and analysts say putin doesn't really want to risk ruining the friendship - a tense friendship - that he has with macron.\n\nsimon: npr's eleanor beardsley in paris, thanks so much.\n\nbeardsley: you're welcome, scott\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
polls show likely abortion law change in ireland\n\nireland has one of the strictest abortion laws in the world. pro-abortion-rights groups have campaigned for decades to repeal the country's eighth amendment. now voters have decided.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nireland has voted to repeal its eighth amendment - one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the world. nearly all results are in, and 67 percent of the voters apparently said yes to the repeal. the prime minister of ireland, leo varadkar, said this.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nleo varadkar: well, i think what we've seen today really is a culmination of a quiet revolution that's been taking place in ireland for the past 10 or 20 years.\n\nsimon: alice fordham joins us from dublin. alice, thanks so much for being with us. and what's the reaction out there today?\n\nalice fordham, byline: well, scott, for many people, it is jubilant, and it feels historic. i was in the counting center earlier where all dublin's votes are being counted. and there were a lot of people there who had campaigned to change the law observing the tally, in some cases watching their own neighborhood's voting box being counted. and it was very emotional.\n\nas i arrived, one woman said that she felt like she had woken up in a whole new country today. another one said she'd been campaigning for this for 35 years - since that controversial amendment preventing changed abortion laws was put in the constitution.\n\nand then there was another younger woman who was crying. she told me that so many women had opened up about their own experiences of abortion in this campaign, and that ranged from people who travel abroad to have an abortion, as a lot of people do here every year, and they spoke often about how lonely and how stigmatizing that felt. and then she told me her own story of surviving a sexual assault and being so anxious she would be pregnant and not having any recourse to terminate the pregnancy safely.\n\nand, you know, ireland - it has changed so much here since the 1990s. it's made contraception easy to access. it's legalized divorce and homosexuality and same-sex marriage. and i think, for many people, they felt like abortion was the last, what they called, of the moral battle that they had to fight here.\n\nsimon: and what kind of conversations have you had with people on the other side who voted to keep the law?\n\nfordham: well, understandably, they're disappointed. and most people didn't really want to talk, although i did speak to one man who said he'd worked all his life as a teacher with severely disabled children. he said he was proud to have voted the way that he had, and he wished there could've been a compromise. but, you know, scott, he didn't seem hugely surprised. he said he felt like ireland was going through a huge social change. and that fits with what other people i've spoken to have said.\n\ni spoke to a priest. of course, the catholic church in ireland has historically been very powerful, very socially conservative. and this priest here in dublin, he told me he'd be disappointed but not surprised if abortion was legalized here. and i think that speaks to the erosion of trust in the church here, particularly with respect to women and children, after a series of scandals of abuse, basically.\n\nsimon: and what happens from here on out now that abortion has been struck down but the law still exists?\n\nfordham: so pro-abortion rights lawmakers say they hope that they will be able to change it by the end of the year. this is set to allow, among other things, the right to elective abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. in the short term, there are a lot of parties planned in dublin, but i think there's also a lot of people who are just exhausted by this fight as well.\n\nsimon: alice fordham in dublin, thanks so much.\n\nfordham: thank you, scott.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

on policing in baltimore, activist deray mckesson gets retweets. can he get votes?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andre chung for the washington post/getty images andre chung for the washington post/getty images\n\nif you don't live in baltimore, but you know anything about the mayor's race, it's probably that an activist with black lives matter is running. he's known as the guy in the blue vest, but he also goes by deray mckesson. mckesson is the city's highest-profile mayoral candidate, but one of the lowest in the polls.\n\nthe race for baltimore's next mayor was shaken up a year ago, following the death of freddie gray, the young black man fatally injured in police custody. after violent protests, current mayor stephanie rawlings-blake said she would not run again. now, well over a dozen candidates are competing, and because of the city's past voting record, the winner of this month's democratic primary will almost certainly become the next mayor.\n\nalthough that probably won't be 30-year-old mckesson — he registered less than 1 percent in a recent poll by the university of baltimore and the baltimore sun — he has been fielding a steady stream of national interviews. i find him working out of a trendy coffee shop, where he has run into some former colleagues.\n\nwoo! his friend cheers, as they pose for a selfie that mckesson posts online.\n\nmckesson has about as many twitter followers — more than 300,000 — as there are registered voters in baltimore, and he sneaks peeks at his phone throughout our interview. it's a following built since august 2014, when he heard about the police shooting of michael brown in ferguson, mo.\n\ni packed three t-shirts, four pairs of underwear, one pair of socks, and like, i was there, he says.\n\nmckesson ended up leaving a six-figure job as a school administrator in minnesota to protest police brutality full time. after the death of freddie gray, this mission brought him back to his hometown of baltimore. mckesson, the son of two recovering drug addicts, grew up in baltimore until he went to middle school. now he says he wants to shift his focus again from staging protests to bringing concrete change to people's lives.\n\nwe can make a strategy to address adult literacy today, he says. we can change the way that we police and think about safety today. and the local level is where, most often, those changes have the most impact.\n\nmckesson has gotten props for his detailed policy papers. but it's his activism that has drawn national attention, from a white house meeting with president obama to an appearance on stephen colbert's show, with his trademark smartphone in hand. he's trying to leverage this attention and his social media savvy to amplify traditional retail politics. mckesson says people will direct message him on twitter to say they'll gather 50 friends at their house if he shows up.\n\nwhen i periscope house visits or house parties, when i do facebook live, we average a few thousand people who look at all of that every time, he says.\n\nbut the vast majority of his followers are not registered baltimore voters.\n\ncan he take all that social media and fame nationally, and turn it into a ground game? asks roger hartley, who is dean of the university of baltimore's college of public affairs. so far, the answer is a resounding no.\n\nhartley says that for one thing, mckesson entered the race at the last possible moment — months after the others. what's more, his many rivals are also talking about policing and inequality.\n\nand they have served, he says. they have a record. they have won elections in those districts.\n\nthe front-runner is state sen. catherine pugh, who has touted her role on state and national police reform commissions.\n\nworking with the state is really important in terms of how we reform the police department, how we create opportunities, and how we lift some of the issues that are painful in this city, she said during a march 22 debate on baltimore affiliate wjz.\n\nbehind her in the latest poll is former baltimore mayor sheila dixon, whose experience cuts both ways. dixon has faced jabs over a 2009 embezzlement conviction, though in the wjz debate, she said that doesn't define her.\n\nmy plans are very clear, she said in the forum. i can hit the ground running the first day in office.\n\nin a gentrifying midtown neighborhood, 23-year-old business student becca mckenny is excited to vote. but she's been looking to social media to research candidates and is frustrated there's not more information out there.\n\ni mean, hey, make a youtube video, she says. make a short, do a skit. people are very artsy here in baltimore.\n\ni am totally expecting mckenny to say she supports mckesson. but i am wrong.\n\nsheila dixon has been out there, she's been hitting the streets, she says. she even visited my apartment complex. that was late last summer. mckenny says she was impressed by dixon and considers her embezzlement conviction small potatoes.\n\nmckenny was among those who protested after freddie gray's arrest and death last april, and says it feels as if not much has changed in the year since. i got pulled over by the police, she says. coming home from school, 10 at night, with — you see my pink neon backpack. and why?\n\na short drive away, near gray's neighborhood, brian mcalily wants a new mayor to change the way police treat people.\n\ndo like we used to do in the old days, he says. the police need to come out here and shake hands with everybody, get to know the neighborhood.\n\npolitical analyst roger hartley says there's widespread frustration. with a lame duck mayor and at least a third of the city council also set to change, he says it has left a vacuum.\n\nnot a lot has been done and it's almost like there's been a hold button placed right now, to see who's going to be the next leadership, he says.\n\nthe democratic primary is april 26, and baltimore's next mayor may face a leadership test soon after. the trials of the police officers charged with freddie gray's death have also been on hold and are set to start again next month.
janitors in st. louis protest for higher wages\n\nrenee montagne, host:\n\nin st. louis, a protest this week...\n\n(soundbite of protest)\n\nunidentified protesters: (chanting) we work, we sweat, put 15 on our checks.\n\nmontagne: the goal, as we hear from that tape from kmov tv in st. louis, is higher pay for thousands of janitors in the city. right now, janitors working for private companies make around $10 an hour.\n\nthe reverend darryl gray helped organize the protest as part of a larger campaign called fight for 15. he joins us now from st. louis. thanks very much for joining us.\n\ndarryl gray: well, thank you very much. this is definitely an honor.\n\nmontagne: seventeen people, as you know, were arrested this week in this protest. these were janitors and activists as well.\n\ngray: it was quite the coalition. we had janitors, activists, and one city alderperson was also elected, clergy. and we felt that it was necessary to let people know that we were prepared to sacrifice ourselves in this way to support the fight for 15 and the janitors.\n\nmontagne: people are calling this issue - some people - about janitors' pay a racial issue. why exactly is that?\n\ngray: well, in our particular case, there are 2,100 seiu local 1 janitors. and seiu - that's the service employees international union. out of that 2,100, over 90% are african american men or women. and so as i stood at the press conference and as i stood in front of the marchers and looked back, i could see, you know, a sea of black faces. the reality of st. louis in particular - the racial income gap is more than 10%. black families are three times more likely to live in poverty than whites. and so when we look at the disparity - the income disparity in this region, we know that it affects people of color more than anyone else.\n\nmontagne: and you have, in fact, i know, compared the fight for 15 campaign to the memphis sanitation workers' strike back in 1968. that was huge news at the time. and what parallels do you see?\n\ngray: you know, dr. king's last words - you know, moving from civil rights to economic rights and economic justice - those were his last speeches. and i think that when you look at when dr. king went to memphis to support the sanitation workers, people were, you know, were like, why are you going there? these are menial jobs. well, we - dr. king felt there are no menial jobs; there's just menial pay.\n\nwe feel the same way that just because they're janitors, they should still receive a livable wage. i mean, these people are the folks that continue to clean buildings. they do maintenance. we're talking about people who bring comfort and convenience and cleanliness to our lives and to our jobs. they make our jobs a lot more bearable to come to. they deserve to be treated with dignity. they deserve to be treated with respect. and as my grandmother would say, an honest day's work is worth an honest day's pay.\n\nmontagne: let's zoom out, though, for a moment on this whole subject of, really, civil rights, as we're talking about here. there has been a lot of race-related unrest in the st. louis area recently. i mean, we remember michael brown was shot and killed in ferguson in 2014. and now, also, this campaign for janitors' pay has that sort of aspect to it. has there been no progress on racial issues in the aftermath of ferguson?\n\ngray: the reality is this. everything has changed, but nothing has changed. we have a black police commissioner/police chief. we've got a black public safety commissioner. black elected officials, for the most part, are in abundance in the region, but it hasn't changed anything for the dynamics of the black community.\n\nand that's unfortunate because st. louis seems to be our selma, where you've got a handful of business leaders who really control this region. and they control the politics of this region. and that was reminiscent of selma, where you had five business families that controlled all the businesses in selma so everything was linked. and until the business community takes some leadership, until the business community has a social conscience and realizes that it has got to take care of the least of these, then, once again, nothing in this region will change unless the business community takes the leadership in changing it.\n\nmontagne: the reverend darryl gray, one of the organizers of the fight for 15 campaign in st. louis, joining us from member station kwmu. thanks very much.\n\ngray: oh, it has been a definite pleasure. and thank you for showing the interest in this issue.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
how a memphis food hall is transforming refugee lives and the community\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption global café global café\n\nseven years ago, nepal native indra sunuwar, now 23, arrived in memphis, tenn., with her mom, dad and four siblings. they were seeking an opportunity for a better life. i was really surprised by the cars and buildings and everything, she says. i'd never seen a city like this before.\n\n\n\nher family was resettled in memphis by catholic charities of west tennessee, which showed them how to do things like buy groceries and take a bus. for the first few years, the transition wasn't that smooth for sunuwar, who struggled to connect with her peers at school. i made a lot of friends from other different countries, like somalia, and i get along easy with them because they're like me, she says. but i didn't really get close with american students. i don't know why; it was just uncomfortable.\n\nafter graduating from high school, sunuwar was working at the commercial kaleidoscope kitchen with a fellow refugee named ibti salih, from sudan, when they met sabine langer. they didn't know it right away, but langer would soon change the course of their lives through a food hall she would launch called global café.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption global café global café\n\nlanger herself is an immigrant. she was born in switzerland and came to the united states when she was 21, finally settling in memphis in 2012. she was volunteering with the refugee empowerment program — an initiative that provides resources like after-school programs — in memphis' binghampton neighborhood when she began to think about how fresh, local food could make a difference in the community at large, and that there were immigrants who were willing and able to help.\n\ni met these amazing women from different countries who were cooking on the side as a hobby or a way to make extra income, says langer. some of them were dreaming about owning a restaurant but were not in a financial position to do that.\n\nso she formulated an idea for an international food hall that would bring together cuisines from around the world, providing job opportunities for refugees and supplying binghampton with healthy food sources. denver's avanti food & beverage, which features seven eclectic restaurant concepts under one roof, was one source of inspiration for global café, which langer opened in august.\n\nopen for lunch and dinner, global café is located inside crosstown concourse, a one-million-square-foot vertical urban village occupying the historic sears building, which until recently, sat empty for 20 years. crosstown concourse now includes food establishments, art galleries and artists' residences, wellness facilities, retail shops, a charter high school, a theater, and a brewery.\n\nguests come to global café to try authentic, affordable dishes prepared by refugee food entrepreneurs from three different countries. yet global café also serves as a gathering place, helping members of the community break bread together while learning about other cultures.\n\nthis southern city near the mississippi border seems like an unlikely place for such a concept. yet the area is surprisingly diverse: in 2016, there were more than 70,300 immigrants living in memphis — about 11 percent of the total population, according to a compilation of data from new american economy, a bipartisan research and advocacy firm focused on immigration policy. memphis is also home to one of 20 world relief offices in the u.s., which partner with churches and communities to provide transition programs for refugees and immigrants.\n\nthe area's diversity is projected to grow. between 2010 and 2015, the overall population of memphis grew 2.2 percent, while the immigrant population increased 2.7 percent. the trend mirrors one the entire country is experiencing, with u.s. foreign-born population reaching its highest level since 1910 (13.7 percent in 2017, up from 13.5 percent in 2016), according to u.s. census data.\n\neven armed with these statistics, langer — who's vegan, doesn't cook and has no culinary background — took a big gamble getting into the restaurant business. yet she saw a need.\n\ni eat a lot of ethnic food, and often found myself in hole-in-the-wall places in not-so-great neighborhoods, says langer. i thought, what if we could create a place for an average joe who would love to try something else, but hasn't had the courage to go to a neighborhood that's a little more salty [to get it]?\n\nshe asked both sunuwar and salih to come on board, inviting them to have their own cooking stalls in global café, where they could prepare beloved dishes from their home countries and serve them to the local community while sharing a bit about their culture, too. the open floor plan of the café makes it possible for customers to speak with the chef every time they order, as long as it's not too busy.\n\nfayha sakkan, who fled syria with her husband in 1992 and helps other refugee families get settled in memphis, was the third chef langer asked to be part of global café. sakkan had worked as a nanny for over two decades and was doing catering on the side when she learned of the opportunity.\n\ni could cook for 24 hours, i don't mind. i love to cook, she says.\n\nindeed, sakkan's chicken kababs and tabouleh have already become something of legend at global café in just a few months.\n\nthe other chefs have experienced similar success: sunuwar's momo (nepalase dumplings) and samosas, which she makes fresh to order, sell like hotcakes. one frequent customer comes in almost daily for vegetarian chow mein, often asking her about nepal and when she's going to open her own restaurant.\n\nit means a lot to me, says sunuwar. cooking is like, the way you get connected with people, or how you can prove yourself or learn about different countries.\n\nbut their journey hasn't been easy. while each of them talks about how well their food has been received, and how the community around global café has been welcoming, langer says the assimilation process is arduous.\n\nrefugees often get settled in a country with no advance notice, she says, so they don't have time to learn the language or the customs. typically they get the first job they can get that doesn't require english or skills, and end up in a warehouse job. many of them are highly educated — like salih from sudan, who has degrees in psychology and philosophy — but their paperwork doesn't translate, or they don't have paperwork due to an emergency situation.\n\nit's kind of a cycle; they work hard, and don't have time to take english lessons because they're busy trying to survive, says langer. you could be in country for decades and not really learn the language, and sometimes that brings up comments from people that they're not working toward integration.\n\nnow a dual citizen of switzerland and the united states, langer knows the struggles first hand. my process was pretty difficult from a rich country, she says, but being a refugee is a million times harder than being an immigrant.\n\nthat's a big reason she tries to employ as many refugees and immigrants as possible. global café's general manager is from mexico, and the chefs each have assistants from their home countries.\n\nthis idea of spreading refugee cuisine is taking off in other cities around the country, too. west side bazaar, in buffalo, n.y., functions as a small-business incubator for immigrants and refugees, with nine restaurants helmed by refugee or immigrant chefs, ranging from asian halal to ethiopian cuisine. there's been talk of turning seattle's king street station into an immigrant food hall similar to global café. and organizations like komeeda, a new york-based company that puts on food events, launched a series called chefugee cuisine, meant to help refugee chefs share their native cuisine.\n\nbite by bite, it appears to be making a difference.\n\na memphis taxi driver from somalia visits saliih's stall at global café every day because the food reminds him of dishes his grandmother used to make back home. sometimes he even brings one of his customers with him. if they're in doubt at first, salih's famous falafel — which she says once brought a guest to tears — soon changes their mind.\n\nwhat they don't realize is that the reward goes both ways. i miss my country a lot, but when i cook, and share my stories and my food with the people, it gives me a really good feeling about my culture, says

venezuela's health care system ready to collapse amid economic crisis\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption fidel suarez/ap fidel suarez/ap\n\nthe death of a former major league baseball player in his native venezuela this week is renewing concerns over the latin american country's growing health crisis amid ongoing economic and political turmoil.\n\nmarcos carvajal, a 34-year-old former pitcher for the colorado rockies and florida marlins, died of pneumonia on tuesday. he fell sick in december, but the antibiotics needed to treat the illness were hard to find. drugs for carvajal eventually were sent from abroad but he relapsed, returned to the hospital on monday and died the next day.\n\nthe pharmaceutical federation of venezuela estimates the country is suffering from an 85 percent shortage of medicine amid an economic crisis also marked by severe hyperinflation and food scarcity.\n\nthe entire venezuelan health care system is on the verge of collapse, says francisco valencia, head of the public health advocacy group codevida. some hospitals lack electricity, and more than 13,000 doctors have left venezuela in the past four years in search of better opportunities.\n\nthey don't give food to the patients in the hospital, valencia tells here & now's peter o'dowd. they don't have the proper medical supplies to take care of the people who go to the emergency [room] like gloves, like every basic thing they need for an emergency.\n\naccording to the pharmaceutical association, there is also a 90 percent deficit of other medical supplies and drugs used to treat more serious conditions like cancer.\n\nthe shortage has forced venezuelans to go looking for medicine on the black market, valencia says. even if they find the right medicine, which is often smuggled from colombia and brazil and could be expired, most people can't afford it.\n\nthe crisis affects valencia personally, who relies on medication for a kidney transplant.\n\ni haven't received my medicine since august last year, he says. right now, i'm taking medicines that [have] expired, and my transplant is at risk.\n\nvenezuela's president nicolas maduro has refused to accept humanitarian aid, blocking shipments of medicine and first aid supplies. government data shows infant mortality rose by 30 percent in 2016 and malaria infections shot up 76 percent, reuters reports.\n\nso most countries when they're hit by a crisis, they're taking aid from other countries, from ngos, associated press reporter hannah dreier told npr in 2016. but venezuela keeps refusing to take donations that other countries are offering and is actually turning back shipments of donations that people have given in places like the u.s., not letting medicine in.\n\ndrug prices have skyrocketed along with those for food and other basic necessities. the international monetary fund predicts inflation will soar to 13,000 percent this year and the economy will shrink by 15 percent.\n\nearlier this week, the government announced it would abandon one of its two official foreign exchange rates, which had been used for food and medicine imports, reuters reports. the policy change could encourage businesses to import more goods, but critics say it won't be very effective due to the lack of hard currency in venezuela.\n\nthe elimination of the exchange rate was a step in the right direction because it helps correct foreign exchange distortion, asdrubal oliveros of local consultancy ecoanalitica told reuters. but without dollars, things will continue to be more complicated.\n\nsince the collapse of venezuela's oil-rich economy in 2014, the country has struggled to raise hard currency. the monthly minimum wage for many venezuelans is now equal to $3, according to the ap.\n\nmaduro blames the country's growing crisis on foreign economic sanctions, claiming that the u.s. is leading an effort to wipe out socialism in venezuela, according to reuters. presidential elections are set to be held by april 30, which is much earlier than usual, but venezuela's pro-government supreme court last week banned the main opposition party from running.
who were your millionth-great-grandparents?\n\nenlarge this image istockphoto istockphoto\n\nhuman civilization began about 10,000 years ago with dawn of agriculture (give or take a millennia or so). this seems like such a long time that it can be hard to reconcile with the short span of our lives.\n\nbut there is another way to look at it that puts not just civilization, but the whole of your ancestry, in a different light.\n\neach of us constitutes a generation. we are the children of our parents who were the children of their parents (your grandparents) who were children of their parents (your great-grandparents).\n\nyou are, therefore, the latest step in a ladder of generations stretching backward in time and history. if we take each generation to be 25 years in length, then we can see something remarkable unspool.\n\nbetween the dawn of civilization and now, there have been just 400 generations. let's call each generation a grandma (great-grandma would be more accurate of course). what our little calculation shows is there are only 400 grandmas separating you and your first ancestor who put the earth to plow.\n\nif you close your eyes for a few moments, you can try imagining the line stretching back from you to your parents to your grandparents to your great-grandparents, etc., ticking off grandmas until your reach someone working in some field 10,000 years ago in a world of endless forests, fields, oceans and mountains.\n\nit's kind of staggering to see how much has changed in so short a time.\n\nbut you can go further. that's when your mind will really get blown. there is no reason to stop at 10,000 years. the line that led to you reaches back beyond civilization to humans wandering in tribes across glaciers in the last ice age 50,000 years ago. it also reaches further back to species that weren't homo sapiens, like homo erectus, a million years ago. keep going long enough and you'll find grandmas who were small mammals living in forests.\n\nthe generations that led to you go way, way, way back (the video below from pbs does a wonderful job of laying out that line.)\n\nyoutube\n\nso who were your millionth-great-grandparents? they are back there somewhere in the deep time that makes up earth's braided history of life and change. all that struggle, all those moments of hunger, fear, satisfaction and calm: it all happened. and for this one brief moment you represent the tip of that spear. you are the current generation, not just of humans, but also of all life on this lovely blue marble.\n\nseems like we should all try to enjoy it as much as we can.\n\nadam frank is a co-founder of the 13.7 blog, an astrophysics professor at the university of rochester, a book author and a self-described evangelist of science. you can keep up with more of what adam is thinking on facebook and twitter: @adamfrank4
week in politics: gop debate, democratic town hall\n\nnpr's robert siegel speaks with our regular political commentators, e.j. dionne of the washington post and brookings institution and david brooks of the new york times about the week's political news.\n\nrobert siegel, host:\n\nwell, now to our friday political commentators, columnists david brooks of the new york times, who's with me in the studio, and e.j. dionne of the washington post, who's at iowa public radio in ames, iowa. hello to both of you.\n\ndavid brooks, byline: hello.\n\ne j dionne, byline: good to be with you.\n\nsiegel: we have two competitive races for the presidential nominations on the republican side. we have donald trump, of course, plus two cuban-american freshman senators in their mid-40s - ted cruz of texas...\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nted cruz: my friend, sen. rubio, chose to stand with barack obama and harry reid and chuck schumer and support amnesty, and i stood alongside jeff sessions and steve king, and we led the fight against amnesty.\n\nsiegel: ...and marco rubio of florida.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nmarco rubio: this is the lie that ted's campaign is built on, and rand touched upon it - that he's the most conservative guy, and everyone else is a - you know, everyone else is a rino.\n\nsiegel: rino means republican in name only. marco rubio and ted cruz showed up at last night's fox news channel debate. donald trump didn't. and, david, let's start with you. how much is riding on monday night's iowa caucuses, especially for those three candidates?\n\nbrooks: not much (laughter). you know, it'll winnow the field, but iowa's become more polarized and more unrepresentative. so i'm - i'm a believer this thing is going to go on till april, may. and so, you know, this'll be a chapter. and it will be a chapter where i suspect - and this is my bold prediction - i can continue my consistency in being wrong - that we will report on tuesday that trump and sanders underperformed. i think that it's just risky having a big part of your support being nonvoters. nonvoters tend to not vote, and i think that's going to happen.\n\nsiegel: do you still believe in the wisdom that they always cite in iowa that there are three tickets out of iowa? if you come in first, second or third, you're still alive.\n\nbrooks: i think it'll be five. just out of 11, you can't cull that much. if you look at the polls, i'm wildly over-interpreting the last three days - three or four days of polls. but trump and cruz have been sinking, and cruz really got hit, i thought, in the debate. and rubio and some of the others have been rising. even ben carson has been rising. and so i think if that momentum continues, it may not look as clean as a cruz-trump race as it does right now.\n\nsiegel: and, e.j. dionne in iowa, according to nielsen, more than 12 million people got to watch a gop debate minus trump. do you think that debate is likely to affect the outcome?\n\ndionne: well, i think the big question about the debate, as david suggested, is whether cruz, who got hit very hard during that debate, was hurt by it because i think that iowa really, really does matter to ted cruz. i think he needs to win here to go on. and he still has a decent shot because he has some of the most important evangelical organizations. and i was down near the missouri border in a town keosauqua city - a little city where you saw some supporters of the socially conservative candidates who were really lagging - santorum and huckabee and ben carson - coming behind cruz, at least in that area, because they see him as the person closest to them who can beat trump. if for some reason trump actually wins this, i think it becomes much harder for ted cruz to return - to go on. i think, similarly, it is very important to bernie sanders to win here because his chances over the long-haul, i think, depend on having a one-two punch against hillary clinton - winning here and winning in new hampshire. and the one advantage hillary clinton has at this point is, a couple of months ago, she was expected to sweep here. now, it's much closer. you can argue that the clinton people shouldn't have let it get away from them. but in letting it get away from them, they lowered the bar on what counts as victory. i think a couple of votes will be enough.\n\nsiegel: i think, months ago, we all expected that, on the eve of the iowa caucuses, we'd be talking about hillary clinton. i don't think we expected we'd be talking about bernie sanders. so the question is, what do we make of this phenomenon? david, what do you make of sanders?\n\nbrooks: you know, robert putnam wrote a book called our kids. charles murray wrote a book called coming apart. it's about how the country is bifurcating along class and other lines. and we - a lot of us read those books and thought they were really important. but, at least in my case, i didn't make the connection to the presidential race as much as i should have. and the coming apart of the country and the segmentation of the country has affected both parties, and that's one of the reasons bernie sanders is doing so well - because he represents the disaffected people, or at least speaks about the disaffected people in the working class, as does donald trump. and hillary clinton, if you watch her and bernie sanders back-to-back, sanders just talks with so much authenticity and force, and clinton has not been able to match that. it's too much calculation and hesitation.\n\nsiegel: e.j., bernie sanders likes to cite somebody else who went into iowa and who surprised everyone, surprised hillary clinton - barack obama. is he another barack obama?\n\ndionne: i think the big - the big talk here is, is bernie sanders closer to howard dean in '04, where dean generated a lot of energy in the antiwar left of the party? a lot of volunteers came in for dean, and it turned out he didn't have the depth on the ground. or is he barack obama? i think it's already very clear that bernie sanders is stronger than howard dean in 2004. and the question is, how close does he get to where barack obama is? i think dean - sanders, rather - speaks for a very odd feeling a lot of democrats have toward the president, which is they approve of him; they're happy he's there, but they still wish, at times, that he had been more progressive and had taken on the republicans harder. and i think sanders speaks for that and speaks for an idealism among the young that's really captured in that ad where - called america, which uses the simon and garfunkel song and really doesn't have any words at all. it doesn't have any words about policy in it at all. it's about a feeling of change.\n\nbrooks: yeah, and i would say that on both sides there's a debate about systemic thinking. barack obama came in promising to change the system and clearly did not, as he himself admits. how do you change the system? bernie sanders and donald trump promise some sort of abstract systemic change. i happen to think there's a lot of magical thinking there. clinton is more - i'll be a fighter within the system. so it's, how do you change the basic structures of power?\n\nsiegel: but when you contrast, on the one hand, the republican rage at washington and, on the other hand, bernie sanders calling for washington to take over all healthcare and, presumably, to start regulating public colleges and universities to compensate them for lost tuition costs. that's a lot of political energy for a couple of completely irreconcilable views of the federal government. is it - is it just the polarizing effect of the nominating process, david, or are we that divided as a people?\n\nbrooks: we're that divided. there's a lot of mars and venus going on. on the other hand, the parties - sanders and trump say it's more about the organization of hatreds than the actual delivery of policy. and who are you against? you're against wall street. you're against the establishment. both parties share that. and i would say, finally, i do think there's a lot more flexibility about government. people are feeling hurt, and they're willing to let government - even some republicans, if it'll give them a hand up.\n\nsiegel: that's all the time we have. david brooks - i'm sorry, e.j. - david brooks of the new york times and e.j. dionne of the washington post and author - also author of why the right went wrong. thanks to both of you.\n\ndionne: good to be with you.\n\nbrooks: good to be with you.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
coronavirus is making it even harder for the census to count every u.s. resident\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption yuki iwamura/bloomberg via getty images yuki iwamura/bloomberg via getty images\n\nupdated march 15 at 6:47 p.m. et\n\nalready saddled with cybersecurity risks, hiring challenges and wavering public trust, the 2020 census now must contend with a growing public health crisis.\n\nnpr has learned that at least one u.s. census bureau employee — who was recently hired as a supervisor for a group of door knockers, spokesperson michael cook says, and has not interacted with the public on behalf of the bureau — has tested positive for covid-19 and has been quarantined.\n\nthe employee is following guidance of the iowa department of public health, cook said in an email.\n\nbecause of the coronavirus pandemic, the bureau has decided to delay starting its early round of door-knocking by census workers in college towns to april 23. the bureau is also waiting until early april, instead of late march, to begin its outreach effort to send out representatives with computer tablets to help people submit their census responses online. that program, which is expected to cost at least $100 million, is designed to target people in high-traffic locations, from public transit hubs to grocery stores.\n\nthe uncertain timeline of the coronavirus outbreaks, however, could further complicate the constitutionally mandated head count of every u.s. resident. major disruptions could derail the census bureau from gathering accurate numbers used to determine how many congressional seats and electoral college votes each state gets for the next 10 years. the data also guide the redrawing of voting districts and the distribution of as much as $1.5 trillion a year in federal funding for healthcare, schools, roads and other public services to local communities.\n\nhere's what to look for as the count — scheduled to continue through july — rolls out around the country:\n\nthe safest way to do the census is on your own\n\nwithout leaving home, you can take about 10 minutes now to submit a response on behalf of your household — either online at my2020census.gov or over the phone.\n\nif you prefer paper, all households that haven't responded by early april are expected to receive a physical questionnaire in the mail. some households in areas with low internet subscription rates, and communities with higher shares of residents over age 65, are set to receive paper forms by march 20.\n\nthose would be the safest ways to do the census because they involve little to no person-to-person contact, says john thompson, a former census bureau director who left the agency in 2017.\n\nbut the key is to turn in your household's legally required response as soon as possible, thompson adds. otherwise, your home address is likely to be added to the list of places for census workers to visit in person beginning may 13. college students living off-campus may get a door knock starting april 23, instead of april 9, cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells npr.\n\nit is critical that households understand that self-responding to the census can help alleviate additional burdens to the bureau, brought on by covid-19, arturo vargas, a longtime census advocate and ceo of the national association of latino elected and appointed officials educational fund, says in a written statement.\n\nas of saturday, 3 million households have submitted an online response to my2020census.gov since it was soft-launched on monday, according to cook.\n\nthe census bureau is ready for you to do the same, commerce secretary wilbur ross, who oversees the bureau, said in a written statement. if you do, there will be no need for census takers to knock on your door.\n\ncan the census be delayed?\n\nthe census bureau has been planning to conduct the national head count through july 31. but this week, some democratic members of congress have been calling for the counting to be extended.\n\nreps. alexandria ocasio-cortez and adriano espaillat — both of new york — along with 10 other congressional hispanic caucus members, are urging the bureau to continue the count for an additional three months through october. a separate group of new york lawmakers led by rep. yvette clarke wants the bureau to extend counting at least through september due to the social disruption caused by covid-19.\n\nsocial distancing will make enumeration practically impossible during the current allotted time frame, clarke and the other lawmakers wrote in a letter to ross.\n\nin response to the coronavirus, some tribal nations are increasing their security by limiting who can enter tribal territories, according to lycia maddocks, vice president of external affairs at the national congress of american indians.\n\nsome nations actually have physical guard stands where they can check to see if you're a tribal citizen, maddocks, a citizen of the quechan tribe, said during a news conference friday.\n\nthat could exacerbate the undercount of american indians and alaska natives, who had the highest net undercount rate among all racial and ethnic groups in the 2010 census, according to the bureau's estimates. the delivery of census mailings could be delayed and census workers may not be able to travel in indian country, where there is often limited or no high-speed internet service.\n\nthe bureau told the house oversight and reform committee this week it's watching to see how many households respond on their own before deciding whether to continue counting past july. the bureau has said it is prepared to delay sending out census workers to specific areas where there is an outbreak.\n\nstill, the bureau is under pressure to meet a critical deadline: under federal law, the census bureau is required to deliver the latest population counts of each state to the president by dec. 31.\n\nif they have to delay too long, then they would have to work with the congress and see if they would pass a new law to extend the deadline for the census, thompson, the former bureau director, says.\n\nasked by npr on thursday whether the bureau is considering making such a request to congress, the bureau's current director, steven dillingham, said: i wouldn't take anything off the table, but that's the first mention i've heard of that possibility.\n\nwill the census bureau be able to hire and protect a half-million census workers?\n\nthe bureau is currently trying to hire and train as many as a half-million census workers to follow up with households that don't fill out a form themselves. these workers are critical to the bureau's strategy for making sure historically undercounted groups — including communities of color, rural residents and immigrants — are included in the country's population count.\n\nhistorically, black and latino households, among others, have lower self-response rates, which means the census bureau needs enough manpower in the field to collect census information in-person in these communities, terri ann lowenthal, a census consultant who once served as the staff director of the former house oversight subcommittee for the census, says in an email.\n\nthe bureau told the house oversight and reform committee this week there has not been a significant drop in staffing since the outbreak.\n\nbut cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells npr that the bureau learned on friday that the newly hired census field supervisor, who is now quarantined, tested positive for covid-19. while that employee, who was expected to be based from home, has not engaged with the public on behalf of the bureau, cooks says the individual interacted with other recently hired census workers and trainers during a new employee training session.\n\nthe very limited number of employees with whom the individual was in contact have been notified by public health authorities and are in self-quarantine, cook says in a written statement to npr. we will continue to provide support to any and all impacted employees and follow all public health authority guidance.\n\ncooks adds the bureau is not aware of any work-related public activity by the employees in self-quarantine.\n\nthe bureau told lawmakers that it's planning to conduct more online training sessions and give workers safety equipment. cook tells npr the bureau is working on including social distancing techniques in trainings for door knockers, known as enumerators, and other on-the-ground census workers. those who feel sick are strongly encouraged to stay at home, cook adds. enumerators do not get sick leave, but cook says the bureau is looking into ways to pay them for a work-related injury or illness.\n\nstill, on friday, the commerce department office of inspector general, an internal watchdog group for the bureau, asked the agency to provide more details by march 20 on how it plans to conduct the count at a time of unprecedented turmoil and uncertainty.\n\nthompson, the former bureau director, worries that trying to convince people to work for the census could be a particularly sensitive issue, especially among retirees over the age of 60. given the low employment rate, they've been among the groups targeted by the bureau's recruiting efforts. but now they are at higher risk than younger age groups of becoming seriously ill with covid-19.\n\nkevin dowd, 62, a retired accountant who applied for a 2020 census job and lives near milford, pa., says he recently decided not to attend a training session for prospective enumerators because he was worried about getting sick.\n\nhow many people would be in how big a room? dowd says he wondered. many people have come back from vacation, from places that have more cases, and so i decided that i didn't need the $16 an hour.\n\nhow will the homeless population be counted?\n\nthe bureau may decide next week to push back its schedule for counting people experiencing homelessness who are staying in shelters, cook, the bureau spokesperson, tells npr. that count is currently set for march 30 through april 1.\n\nthe agency is also evaluating whether to delay its april 1 count of homeless people living outside of shelters and in public parks, under bridges and other outdoor locations.\n\nshelters can choose to have a census worker visit their facility to interview residents and other people who use their services. but rising health concerns about covid-19 raise two potential challenges, thompson, the former bureau director, says.\n\nworkers could be reluctant to go to a place where the homeless receive services, thompson says. the places could be reluctant to let people in.\n\ncook says the agency is trying to contact facilities that had planned for an in-person count to ask whether they can switch to paper forms instead.\n\nin new york city — home to the country's largest homeless population — census workers are not expected to visit city-owned shelters because the local department of social services is transferring records about the shelters' residents to the census bureau, julie menin, the city's census director, tells npr.\n\nwhat this really does is ensures that every single homeless person in new york city is properly counted, menin says. we don't want anyone to be overlooked. we don't want anyone to be invisible.\n\nhow will college students, nursing home residents and prisoners be counted?\n\ncook says the bureau is trying to encourage 68,000 nursing homes, prisons and other group living facilities, excluding college dorms, to send in information about their residents online or by paper, rather than waiting for a census worker to do in-person interviews starting in early april.\n\nclose to 12,900 dorms had chosen earlier this year to have the bureau drop off paper forms for each of their student residents to fill out individually. given the chaotic situation at many campuses, however, the bureau is reaching out to the administrators to see if they want to change those plans.\n\nthe canceling of in-person classes and dorm closures at a growing number of colleges and universities have also raised concerns about whether students who live away from their families' homes will be counted in the right place.\n\nin general, the bureau says all u.s. residents should be counted where they usually live and sleep, even if they're away on census day (april 1). this week, the bureau confirmed to npr that students who have left their college town because of coronavirus should still use their address at school when filling out a census form.\n\nbut it's not clear if that guidance will reach students who have scattered around the country, some scrambling to find last-minute housing. in a letter to the department of education, the bureau suggests that schools contact their students who usually live off-campus about how to get counted on their own using my2020census.gov.\n\nhow will community groups help promote the census?\n\nfor decades, the bureau has relied on parades, street festivals and worship services as opportunities for local community leaders to encourage participation in the census.\n\nthe person-to-person contact can be much more effective than a letter in the mail, says nancy potok, a former deputy director at the census bureau who recently retired as the chief statistician of the u.s.\n\nbut the coronavirus is forcing census advocates to pivot away from in-person outreach activities. john park, executive director of the minkwon center — a community group based in queens, n.y. — says his organization has been scaling down door-knocking and ramping up texting and phone-banking to encourage households to fill out the census on their own.\n\nwe've created multi-lingual t-shirts with qr codes that link to the census self-response url, which will let people keep their distance but still access the survey, park says in an email.\n\nstill, for now, the bureau plans to move forward with its outreach efforts through its mobile questionnaire assistance program after delaying the initial rollout from march 30 to april 6, cook tells npr. by april 13, census workers are expected to fan out with computer tablets around the country in areas with low census response rates to help people get counted online.\n\nwill the coronavirus shut down census call centers and processing centers for paper forms?\n\nwhile the bureau hopes most households use my2020census.gov, it's still collecting paper questionnaires, which are a critical backstop in case of any major technical breakdowns with the online census form.\n\none area that people tend to overlook is the importance of the processing centers, potok, the former deputy director of the bureau, says about the two data processing centers in phoenix and jeffersonville, ind., which is across the river from louisville, ky., for the 2020 census. people need to be there to check in the questionnaires.\n\nthe centers can receive, separate and scan as many as 30 million paper questionnaires for the 2020 census, according to the bureau's plan for its paper data capture operation. processing those paper forms will help the bureau figure out where they need to send workers to follow up with unresponsive households.\n\ndeb stempowski, an assistant director at the bureau who's in charge of operations and schedules for the 2020 census, says if there are any interruptions at one of the sites, the other center could pick up the extra work. stempowski adds the bureau is tracking paper forms that are mailed back as soon as they enter the mail stream, and the agency is prepared to ask employees to work longer shifts or on the weekends if needed.\n\ni don't believe that we have an issue if we have one or two people who can no longer support the work in one of the centers, stempowski said.\n\nstill, there is a risk of both facilities having to close because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nthe pandemic could also complicate staffing at the call centers that are receiving census responses over the phone and answering questions about the count in 13 languages. the 10 census questionnaire assistance centers are located in tempe, ariz.; pueblo, colo.; jacksonville, fla.; tamarac, fla.; kansas city, mo.; new york city; blytheville, s.c.; el paso, texas; irving, texas; and nashville, tenn.\n\nwe have a significant contingency budget in place, which enables us to move offices if needed, cook tells npr, referring to a $2 billion budget set aside for 2020 census emergencies.\n\nwill the coronavirus force the bureau to rely more heavily on government records to fill in missing information?\n\nif the outbreak ultimately makes it impossible to gather self-reported information from certain households in time, the bureau may have to turn to alternatives to fill in the gaps, including a cache of existing government records from other federal agencies such as the internal revenue service and the u.s. postal service.\n\nit is possible that administrative records will have to enumerate a much larger share of the population as the virus spreads, kenneth prewitt, a former census bureau director who oversaw the 2000 count, wrote in an op-ed this week in the new york times.\n\nsome critics worry that relying on records to complete demographic profiles of certain households may not produce accurate census information.\n\nwe find these records work well in matching records for the white and higher-income populations but racial/ethnic minorities, lower-income persons, and other htc populations are likely to be missed, members of a working group of census bureau researchers and advisors to the bureau wrote in a 2016 report.\n\nbefore the outbreak, the bureau estimated that about 7.9 million households — or just over 5% of the around 147 million home addresses it's planning to include in the 2020 census — will be counted using administrative records, according to a regulatory document filed in january with the white house's office of management and budget.\n\nbureau officials said in the document that if the bureau does not have confidence in the records for an unresponsive household because of missing or inconsistent data, they plan to continue sending census workers to knock on the door.\n\naccording to the bureau's plans, workers are generally supposed to try to gather information in person in up to six days in total. at a time of outbreak, however, it's hard to say how many visits will actually be possible later this year.

how misinformation lit the fire under a year of political chaos in michigan\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jeff kowalsky/afp via getty images jeff kowalsky/afp via getty images\n\nthe day michigan's electors gathered in the state capitol, gov. gretchen whitmer paused briefly on the checkered marble floor before entering the state senate chamber.\n\nobviously [we] never could've imagined... she paused to laugh, emphasizing her next word, anything... about this year. but it's an honor to play a role here in finalizing this vote, respecting the will of the people and making sure michigan's voice is heard.\n\nthat day, electors were escorted in by the state police. the building itself was closed to the public and other lawmakers because of credible threats of violence after more than six months of political turmoil in the state.\n\nthat evening, after weeks of rampant allegations of election fraud by president trump's supporters, the republican state senate majority leader mike shirkey tweeted that the michigan senate had not discovered material proof of malicious behavior thus far. if sidney powell or anyone else has concrete proof that voting machines were manipulated, it's past time they share it.\n\nbut the damage was already done. outside, state police blocked a handful of republican state representatives who tried to gain access to the building in order to seat an alternate slate of electors as the state's 16 electoral votes were cast for joe biden, who won the state by 154,188 votes.\n\nin the dumpster fire year of 2020, michigan has had its own political storm going all the way back to the march primary when the state detected its first cases of covid-19. the weekend before, vermont sen.bernie sanders drew thousands to rallies in ann arbor and grand rapids and president-elect joe biden gathered large crowds in detroit.\n\nprotests and the alleged plot to kidnap the governor\n\nin the spring, frustration with gov. whitmer's stay-at-home orders manifested in the country's largest so-called gridlock protest in lansing, followed by protests that rippled into the spring. rallies became a place where extreme views and conspiracies could grow. rally attendees who alleged whitmer was a tyrant mingled with anti-vaxxers and heavily-armed protesters.\n\nat a june protest, as an fbi criminal complaint later revealed, men linked to the militia movement who believed some state governments were violating the u.s. constitution, allegedly attempted to recruit others to attack the state capitol and join their plan to kidnap whitmer and try her for treason.\n\nanytime you're in a position of uncertainty, you're going to be more willing to accept things that are false or misleading, so long as they just make you feel better, says dustin carnahan, who studies misinformation as an associate professor of communications at michigan state university. and i don't think that was unique to us.\n\nbut carnahan says being a swing state made michigan vulnerable to those who wanted to influence or sow doubt in 2020 politics.\n\ncarnahan says that misinformation wasn't central to the alleged plot to kidnap the governor or the protests, but kernels of misinformation were allowed to grow into larger conspiracies.\n\nwhat becomes dominant is the conspiracy — this overall kind of belief that this is part of some larger plot to seize control, says carnahan.\n\nthe election\n\nimmediately after the november election, misinformation was warped — some unwittingly, some in deliberate disinformation campaigns — into broader conspiracy theories. one theory alleged that widespread voter fraud had occurred at the absentee counting board in detroit. another claimed a clerical error in a rural michigan county was evidence of a dominion voting system software manipulation. in wayne county, some argued that disagreements should have prevented the certification of election results.\n\nunderneath those, though, some say it was the failure to change state law around absentee ballot processing that created a post-election environment ripe for informational manipulation.\n\nby law, michigan's more than 3 million absentee ballots could not be counted until election day. that night, it appeared as if president trump had the lead, but by wednesday as absentee ballots continued to be counted, biden pulled ahead and republican groups began recruiting supporters to flood the tcf center in downtown detroit where absentee ballots were being counted. protesters banged on glass windows chanting stop the vote.\n\nthe american people need to have confidence in our elections, declared republican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel, standing in front of a wall emblazoned with red, white, and blue trump-pence 2020 and keep america great signs. right now, we don't have that because across the country democrat officials are shutting down transparency, especially here in the state of michigan.\n\nthe press conference was just the beginning. what followed were countless lawsuits, affidavits from aggrieved republican poll watchers and clerical errors that were touted by senior party officials as evidence of irregularities in the state.\n\nover the following weeks, the president repeatedly tweeted false claims about the election in michigan and other states. after one board of county canvassers voted not to certify their election results (a move they reversed before their meeting adjourned) trump falsely announced, wow! michigan just refused to certify the election results! having courage is a beautiful thing. the usa stands proud!\n\nin fact, at their scheduled meeting nearly a week later, the board of state canvassers certified the results that president-elect joe biden won the state by 154,188 votes.\n\nyet republicans in the state say they continued to field calls from angry supporters who believed assertions of widespread fraud, even after they were thrown out of state and federal courts. the republican-controlled state legislature held oversight hearings into alleged irregularities allowing witnesses, many of whose affidavits had been tossed out of court, to testify in blockbuster hours-long hearings.\n\nformer director of elections, chris thomas, who served a long tenure under both democratic and republican secretaries of state, explained it this way while testifying under oath:\n\nfew elections are perfect. there are mistakes for sure. however, it is an unreasonable leap to equate mistakes with fraud. quite simply fraud is not a mere mistake. fraud requires intent.\n\nit isn't unusual for misinformation that begins with some small element of truth to make way for a larger conspiracy with the power to erode faith in the democratic process, says carnahan, the associate professor of communications at michigan state university.\n\nto what extent do we allow these people to have a platform to make their points, no matter how unfounded or misleading they are? he asks.\n\nfallout from giuliani in lansing\n\nwhen rudy giuliani, president trump's lawyer, appeared in lansing with witnesses to present allegations of election fraud, state rep. cynthia johnson, a democrat who represents detroit, asked why witnesses weren't testifying under oath and why there were no democratic election workers testifying.\n\nthe world is watching us right now, johnson said, pressing the republican committee chair to answer her questions before he gaveled her down for being out of order.\n\nafter the hearing, clips of johnson circulated on conservative media. johnson received lynching and death threats, some of which she made public. when she posted a facebook live video urging her supporters to do right. be in order. make them pay, edited clips made the rounds on the conservative social media site parler. johnson was later stripped of her committee assignments by republican leadership for making threatening statements.\n\njohnson told the michigan advance she viewed the backlash as a digital lynching. at later hearings, the ceo of dominion voting systems and a former longtime elections director were put under oath.\n\ndays before christmas, senate majority leader mike shirkey told bridge michigan, our investigation, which has been very intense, discovered none, none of the allegations and accusations against dominion [are] true.\n\nthe legislature had the right and responsibility to review election systems and air-out serious claims of fraud, says republican public relations consultant john sellek, which gave clerks an opportunity to lay out the facts.\n\nbut in attempting to wage peace with angry trump voters state legislators also allowed, giuliani and his team put on an embarrassing show that ultimately exposed the clear lack of evidence of voter fraud and likely backfired with somewhat-questioning voters who then saw the entire thing turned into a skit on saturday night live, says sellek.\n\nhe says after a year rife with misinformation and conspiracy, frankly, it is what comes next as far as election security and conspiracy busting that will matter most.
sunday politics\n\nthe president's declaration of a national emergency is headed to the courts, where its future is uncertain. in the mean time, is he able to declare a political victory?\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nthe president is in west palm beach at his golf club this morning while lawmakers and landowners react to his controversial declaration of a national emergency. npr national political correspondent mara liasson joins us now.\n\nhi, mara.\n\nmara liasson, byline: hi, lulu.\n\ngarcia-navarro: this was a real will he or won't he kind of thing on the part of the president. do you think he was going to do this all along?\n\nliasson: i do. as it was described to me, unless he got the full amount of funding for the wall that he was demanding, he would do this because this is a way for him to keep faith with his base, to say that he did everything possible to build the wall, even if it's stopped in the courts. his advisers really believe - he really believes that the wall is absolutely key to his re-election. now, of course, now he has to convince the courts that a national emergency is whatever a president says it is. and he really undercut himself in that speech in the rose garden, where he said, i didn't need to do this. in other words, he's doing this for expedience not necessity. he said, i just wanted to build the wall faster. he's also said at various times that the wall is already being built. so if it's already being built, why do you need to declare a national emergency to build it?\n\ngarcia-navarro: so i want to take us back a little bit because the coverage of congressional democrats - how they were perceived as presenting a strong and united front, how cool and steely house speaker nancy pelosi was. you know, they seemed to be winning the day on this. but trump said this in the rose garden on friday.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\npresident donald trump: i got almost $1.4 billion when i wasn't supposed to get one dollar - not one dollar. he's not going to get one dollar. well, i got 1.4 billion. but i'm not happy with it.\n\ngarcia-navarro: i mean, we always have to do this, i think, a little bit - winners and losers. we've seen him declare victory over nothing in the past. but does he have a point here?\n\nliasson: well, do what - you mean do i think the democrats gave him something. yes, they...\n\ngarcia-navarro: yes.\n\nliasson: ...gave him something but not very much and, certainly, not as much as he wanted. and he is kind of all over the place. he won but he's not happy. the wall's being built, but he has to declare a national emergency to build it. you know, the interesting thing is this is often put into the context of he is keeping a campaign promise. but what people forget is during the 2016 campaign, he signed something called the contract with the american voter, where he pledged that he would obtain reimbursement from mexico for the full cost of the wall. so he's actually breaking a campaign promise.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that's right. i mean, it's going to get taken from the department of defense and possibly from funding things like the opioid epidemic. if lawmakers are uneasy with this national emergency - and they are. democrats and republicans alike have said that they consider it a bad idea. why didn't congress put actual language in their compromise legislation to avoid it?\n\nliasson: republicans would've never agreed to that. they know this is something very popular with the president's base. and that's their base, too. they don't want to get in between the president and his base. of course, now we're going to see how many republicans vote against it because the house will pass a resolution opposing this. it will go to the senate. and it will have to be voted on. and there are republicans who have objections to this on many different levels. on one reason, they don't like, as you said, money being taken from the pentagon for important projects in their districts some - in some cases to be spent on this.\n\nnumber two, they don't like the precedent that's set that a future democratic president could declare a national emergency around gun safety or climate change or health care. they also don't like the constitutional clash that the president is setting up, where he's challenging the separation of powers and congress's power to appropriate money. and also, congress, who has allowed its power to wither, is further emasculating itself in the mind of many lawmakers. republican senator lee of utah said recently because we don't want to make the judgment calls that made people angry, we leave it to the executive. it's almost as if congress doesn't want to go through the difficult task of lawmaking.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and now it all goes to the courts. that's npr national political correspondent mara liasson. thank you so much.\n\nliasson: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
what are the most popular baby names?\n\nnoah is the most popular name for boys while emma is the top name for girls. npr's lulu garcia-navarro talks to laura wattenberg, founder of babynamewizard.com.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\na note now on this mother's day for soon-to-be moms. if you're looking for a boy's name, looks like the bible is still a popular source of inspiration. according to the social security administration, noah topped the list for most popular boy name in 2016. for girls, though, emma came in number one.\n\nlaura wattenberg: there is less consensus in baby names than ever before.\n\ngarcia-navarro: laura wattenberg founded babynamewizard.com.\n\ngarcia-navarro: names used to be very much object of tradition. today, they are pure object of style, and they change faster than ever before. for example, michael is one of the most popular names in u.s. history, but it's now out of fashion with fewer than 14,000 baby boys so named last year - the lowest on record. the fastest rising boy's name on the list...\n\nwattenberg: kylo - a name of a character from a recent star wars movie. don't want to give any spoilers, but not the kind of character you would expect people to want to name their kids after.\n\ngarcia-navarro: i'll spoil it. he kills his father in the film. for girls, the biggest climber was kehlani - possibly a nod to kehlani parrish, a singer nominated for a grammy this year. so, ok, how did lulu fare? laura wattenberg says, don't look for it at the top of the list.\n\nwattenberg: lulu and kiki - those short names like that - coco - are names that americans love as nicknames and are scared to give as given names.\n\ngarcia-navarro: ouch, that hurts.\n\n(soundbite of song, name game)\n\nshirley ellis: (singing) very good. let's do marsha. marsha, marsha, bo-bar-sha bo-na-na fanna fo-far-sha (ph)...\n\ngarcia-navarro: you could also name your baby b.j. leiderman. he wrote our theme music.\n\n(soundbite of song, name game)\n\nellis: (singing) a little trick with nick. nick, nick, bo-bick, bo-na-na fanna fo fick, fee fi mo-mick. nick. the name game (ph).\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

game 1 of the wnba finals: la sparks beat minnesota lynx 78-76\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jessica hill/ap jessica hill/ap\n\nupdated: 1:20 a.m. et. monday\n\nthe los angles sparks won game 1 of the wnba finals on sunday, 78-76, over the minnesota lynx at the target center in minneapolis. the sparks hold a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five series. game 2 will be played tuesday night in minnesota.\n\naccording to the wnba, minnesota's maya moore passed diana taurasi of the phoenix mercury, who held the record at 262 points, to become the all-time leading scorer in finals history.\n\noriginal post:\n\ntoday in minneapolis, the minnesota lynx and los angeles sparks meet in game 1 of the wnba finals.close\n\nthe league got what it wanted.\n\na new post-season format threw out the old and brought in the new. up until this year, the wnba like the nba, created a playoff bracket by taking the same number of teams from the western and eastern conferences. those teams would play the other teams in their conference and ultimately a conference champion would emerge. the finals would pit the west champion against the east.\n\nproblem was, sometimes the two best teams would be in the same conference, and they wouldn't be able to meet in the finals.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption kamil krzaczynski/ap kamil krzaczynski/ap\n\nthe new format hoped to change that.\n\nit took the top eight teams at the end of the regular season, regardless of conference affiliation, and seeded them 1-8 based on regular season won-loss records.\n\nminnesota (28-6) and l.a. (26-8) were the top two seeds. they also were both in the western conference. and here they are in the finals.\n\nthis is what our fans have been waiting for. no. 1 vs no. 2, says renee brown. she's been the wnba's chief of basketball operations and player relations since the league started 20 years ago. i think these finals are going to be exceptional, she added. high scoring with some of the greatest players playing.\n\nhistoric finals?\n\nthose players include veteran forward/center candace parker and forward nneka ogwumike of the sparks. ogwumike was this year's wnba most valuable player. those two alone give l.a. a chance in any series.\n\nbut they are going up against the closest thing to a wnba dynasty. with history in its sights.\n\nminnesota is in its fifth finals in the last six years. if the lynx beat l.a. in the best-three-out-of-five game series, it'll be their fourth championship and tie the houston comets for most wnba titles.\n\nthe core four\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption stacy bengs/ap stacy bengs/ap\n\nso what makes minnesota so good?\n\na roster that includes the core four, a core group of players that's been with the lynx since their first wnba title in 2011. forward maya moore was a star at college powerhouse uconn and she didn't skip a beat when she was drafted first by minnesota in 2011. she was named rookie of the year that season. she was league mvp in 2014; point guard lindsay whalen, born in minnesota, a star at university of minnesota and now, according to longtime women's basketball reporter mechelle voepel, the emotional core of her hometown professional team; forward rebekkah brunson, a gritty inside player; and guard seimone augustus, who's been with minnesota since 2006.\n\nadd to this core center sylvia fowles, reserve forward nastasha howard and reserve guard renee montgomery, both of whom easily could start for other teams, and you've got a collection of players that's been hard to beat.\n\nbut perhaps the most important member of the lynx doesn't wear high tops come game time.\n\nthe coach is the thing\n\ninterestingly, when asked to explain minnesota's success, the first thing espn.com's voepel says is [the lynx] have a very, very, very good coach.\n\ncheryl reeve came up through the ranks of the wnba as an assistant coach. she started in charlotte in 2001, did stints in cleveland and detroit, and ultimately became the minnesota head coach in 2010. she really learned the in's and out's of being a professional coach, says voepel, which is different than being a college coach.\n\nover the years, reeve not only learned how to motivate professional athletes, but she became a top strategist as well. that, says voepel, represents a major change in wnba coaching over the league's 20 years.\n\nwhen the league started [in 1997], you had players who were professionals overseas, voepel says. but you didn't have coaches who were used to coaching professionally. a lot of the coaches they got came out of the college ranks or the nba. nba players, not coaches. honestly, you had a hodge podge of coaches [in the wnba] and some of them weren't very good. they weren't as good at coaching as their players were at playing.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption kamil krzaczynski/ap kamil krzaczynski/ap\n\nthat changed. coaches like reeve benefited from the wnba's link to the nba. even though not all wnba teams are affiliated with nba teams, the coaches talk to each other.\n\nit's opened up the world of women's basketball to some of the great coaching minds on the men's side, voepel says, which doesn't really happen in college [with the men's and women's basketball teams], even though they're on the same campus.\n\nin detroit, reeve got to work with wnba head coach bill laimbeer. he was a key member of the nba's detroit pistons championship teams in 1989 and 1990, and one of the former nba players who successfully made the transition to coaching. between 2003 and 2008, laimbeer led the detroit shock to three wnba titles.\n\nvoepel calls cheryl reeve exhibit a of the evolved wnba head coach. great at working with talented professional players and getting them to play together, and an outstanding strategist who understands nuances of the game such as defending the pick and roll, or deciding when her team should gamble defensively. reeve has become, says voepel, the premiere coach in the league. reeve was honored accordingly this year – she's the 2016 wnba coach of the year. also during this postseason, she passed her detroit mentor bill laimbeer for most playoff victories in wnba history.\n\nfans responding\n\nwith the evolution of coaches and players, the wnba at 20 is a much-improved product. fans are responding. this season the league had its highest overall attendance in five years. the wnba's chief operating officer, jay parry, happily trots out the positive numbers.\n\nattendance this year was up 4.6% over last year, parry says. there's so much attention about the league in its 20th season. we're proud of that stat.\n\nparry notes tv viewership is up 11 % as well. there are positive digital and social media metrics too. the league surpassed 12 million likes and followers, parry says, with facebook, twitter, snap chat and instagram. that's up 3 million fans over last season, she says.\n\nbut.\n\nthis year's increased average game attendance, 7,655, is the sixth lowest in the league's 20 years. it's more than 3,200 per game less than the league's top average attendance in history, in 1998.\n\nand the new york times reported earlier this year that half of the wnba's 12 teams lose money.\n\nwhen asked if the wnba, even though it's supported by the wildly wealthy nba, ever worried about survival during its 20 years, longtime executive renee brown bristles a bit.\n\ni'm going to say this as nice as i can put it, brown says, when the nba puts their name on anything they do ... on anything they do ... there was no way when we started 20 years ago that that word ever came up.\n\nwhile the idea of survival might not've come up, the wnba still has to work hard to try to get noticed in a very crowded, and male dominated, sports landscape.\n\nleague c.o.o. jay parry likes the may thru october schedule. we believe the timing of the season really works for us, she says. espn.com writer mechelle voepel says however, some sports fans still haven't gotten used to the wnba being a summer basketball league. it's not regular basketball season, plus the league's playoffs are happening the same time as the major league baseball postseason, as well as pro and college football.\n\ntoday, in fact, there's direct competition in the lynx' hometown. the nfl's minnesota vikings, undefeated and one of the surprise stories of the young season, kick off in minneapolis two hours before the lynx and sparks begin game 1.\n\nthey start on an nfl sunday and that always worries me, voepel says. but i hope people give the finals a chance. i hope if people get a chance to watch this matchup, that they appreciate how far this sport has come in 20 years. just the level of athlete and the level of people we're talking about.

man admits abducting and killing jacob wetterling in 1989\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption sherburne county sheriff's office via ap sherburne county sheriff's office via ap\n\nanswers are finally emerging about the abduction of an 11-year-old boy in minnesota in 1989, as danny heinrich has admitted kidnapping and killing jacob wetterling. in a minneapolis courtroom, heinrich also said he kidnapped and sexually assaulted another boy.\n\nheinrich made the statements as part of a plea deal related to child pornography charges, on which he was indicted last december. all but one of those counts were dropped as part of the deal.\n\na sentencing hearing for heinrich was scheduled for november; the agreed-upon plea deal calls for him to serve a maximum prison term of 20 years.\n\njacob wetterling was taken at gunpoint by a masked man who allowed jacob's brother and a friend to get away. the three children had been riding bikes near their house in a rural area in central minnesota.\n\nheinrich aired disturbing details about the case during a change-of-plea hearing tuesday that saw the 53-year-old acknowledge his crimes against jacob and against jared scheierl, who was 12 when he was kidnapped months before jacob was abducted.\n\njacob's parents were present at tuesday's hearing; toward the end of the proceedings, patty wetterling said it was painful to learn about the last minutes of her son's life, according to minnesota public radio's brandt williams.\n\nwilliams followed the proceedings from the courthouse. from his story about today's hearing:\n\nheinrich said he confronted the children with a snub-nosed revolver. he handcuffed jacob behind his back and drove away as jacob asked, 'what did i do wrong?' heinrich admitted sexually abusing jacob and then shot him twice. heinrich said he left jacob's body and went home and went back later to hide the body, using a bobcat to dig a hole. he returned to the site a year later to discover jacob's jacket partially exposed. he picked up jacob's remains and took them to a new spot.\n\nthat spot is evidently the same one heinrich led authorities to last week, according to the ap. human remains were recovered there that dna analysis confirmed were jacob's over the weekend.\n\nheinrich had been suspected in the two abductions, as well as in a string of eight sexually motivated assaults on young boys in paynesville, minn., where he lived. but at the time, the physical evidence wasn't considered to be enough to link him to the crimes.\n\nfederal prosecutors say that after dna tests linked heinrich to the scheierl case last year, investigators carried out a search that resulted in the discovery of collections of child pornography within multiple three-ring binders. that discovery evidently created the legal opening the u.s. attorney's office needed to compel heinrich to talk as part of a plea deal.\n\nin a tweet, williams relays that heinrich had never met jacob wetterling or jared scheierl before he abducted them.\n\nscheierl, who's now 40 and has three children, told cbs minnesota that the authorities told him the statute of limitations had run out on his case.\n\nthey said the good news is we have your guy, the bad news is the statute of limitations exists in your case and we cannot prosecute him. there was a level of anger that came up, he said.\n\nscheierl has said he'd like to talk to heinrich; in court tuesday, he said that he now finds purpose in helping others, according to mpr's williams.\n\nwilliams also relays u.s. attorney andrew luger's explanation for how tuesday's hearing came about, from an initial message from heinrich's defense team to a meeting with the families in the case last week about a possible plea deal.

trump supporter in indiana: race is over, party's healing can start\n\ndespite the tempestuous primaries, republicans will come back together to support the party's candidate, says vigo county party chair randy gentry — give it some time.\n\naudie cornish, host:\n\nwe're going to turn now to a supporter of donald trump. randy gentry is the republican party chair of the vigo county, ind. welcome to the program.\n\nrandy gentry: well, thank you for having me.\n\ncornish: so your reaction to donald trump's win tonight...\n\ngentry: it's huge. it's huge. the excitement has been building. we've seen just a very, very large increase in the number of people participating in the voting process, which is really nice to see. and we're just really ecstatic with the results tonight.\n\ncornish: you know, donald trump was heading into this day ahead in the polls. and there was little evidence that the, say, stop-trump movement was really materializing or that ted cruz was gaining traction. and yet this morning, you know, donald trump really went after ted cruz based on this national enquirer story that has no corroborating evidence. why do you think he decided to make that final attack on cruz? do you think that was wise?\n\ngentry: i have no idea. i think that this campaign on, you know - from everybody's standpoint has seen a lot of people talking back and forth and making comments. so as far as, you know, what he's saying - i'll leave that to him.\n\ncornish: given the level of this attack, what concerns do you have as a republican party chair about party unity and whether or not this is damaging that?\n\ngentry: i don't think it is. i think this has been a very, very unique campaign cycle. we started with a lot of people in this process. and what we're seeing is a end of where we all need to come. we've got to get to the point where we have one person standing, and i do believe the party will unify behind one person.\n\nand while it's not been your traditional campaigning and there's been a lot of things said and so forth, i do believe at the end of the day, we will come together. we will unite behind the winner, which is going to be donald trump. and we will focus on making sure he becomes the next president of the united states.\n\ncornish: randy gentry, what reason do you have to believe that? you have john kasich who's vowed to stay in. you've had groups that are central to the stop-trump movement who say they're not going away. are you still not looking at a fight over the nomination at the convention?\n\ngentry: i don't think so. i think tonight sets the standards. i think at this point, i think that the race is going to be over and donald trump will actually reach cleveland with the 1,237 he needs. and i don't think it will be a contested convention. i think that this is a - it's over, and i think probably for the first time in history, indiana has been the contributing factor to this. i mean, we've been used to years and years of not being in play...\n\ncornish: (laughter).\n\ngentry: ...because we're so far down the calendar. but yeah, i think it's over, and i think that the healing process will start as it does in every presidential cycle. there's always an amount of healing that has to occur, and i think we're going to do fine. i think as a party - i think we're strong, and we're going to make it through this.\n\ncornish: what do you think donald trump has to say to offer that olive branch? i mean, what would you like to hear?\n\ngentry: i don't think donald trump's going to change. i think donald trump is who donald trump is. i think that we're just going to coalesce around this, and i think our focus will shift to taking on the democrat nominee, which i guess one could assume at this point that will be hillary clinton.\n\nso give it some time. i don't think it has - any particular thing has to be said. i think everybody, again, is going to get fired up, and i think our motivation at this point is we've been shut out of the white house for some time. and i think republicans are going to get really excited about an opportunity to put a president back in the white house.\n\ncornish: that's randy gentry, the gop chair of vigo county, ind. he's a supporter of donald trump. trump won today's indiana primary. thank you for speaking with us.\n\ngentry: thank you for having me.\n\ncopyright © 2016 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump announces u.s. withdrawal from paris climate accord\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption andrew harnik/ap andrew harnik/ap\n\nupdated at 5:45 p.m. et\n\npresident trump has announced that the u.s. will be withdrawing from the paris accord — the historic global agreement reached by 195 countries in 2015 to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in average global temperatures.\n\nduring a news conference thursday in the rose garden at the white house, trump said the withdrawal is aimed at keeping his campaign promise to put american workers first. but he added that the u.s. would begin negotiations to possibly re-enter the paris accord or a similar deal that, he said, would result in a better deal for american workers.\n\nthe agreement is a massive redistribution of united states' wealth to other countries, trump said. it's to give their country an economic edge over the united states. that's not going to happen while i'm president. i'm sorry.\n\nhe later added: our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of american workers' sovereignty.\n\nduring his campaign, trump vowed to cancel u.s. participation in the deal. world leaders and business figures had recently urged him to reconsider, but by wednesday morning, reports began to surface that trump had decided to leave the pact.\n\nbarack obama had used his authority as president to join the paris accord without a vote in congress. that means trump can remove the u.s. from the accord without a vote. but it will take awhile: under the terms of the agreement, he wouldn't actually be able to withdraw until november 2020.\n\nleaving the underlying treaty — the united nations framework convention on climate change — would be faster and could be completed within a year. but that treaty was ratified by the u.s. senate. presidents have unilaterally exited senate-ratified treaties before, but it's rare and controversial.\n\nurged to stay, urged to leave\n\na wide chorus of voices had called for trump to recommit to the paris agreement: other world leaders and hundreds of scientists, of course, but also ceos of major energy companies and other big u.s. corporations. even many of trump's own advisers support the deal, according to the new york times.\n\nbut those supporting a departure won out. more than 20 republican senators had called for trump to leave the deal. influential trump advisers, reportedly steve bannon and environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt, also urged him to withdraw.\n\nand then, of course, there was the argument advanced by candidate trump. on the campaign trail, he criticized the agreement that the u.s. formally signed on to last year. he called the deal unfair to the u.s., objecting in particular to the requirement that wealthy nations help developing countries build renewable energy sources.\n\nhe remained consistent with those criticisms thursday.\n\ni cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the united states, which is what it does, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters, trump said — singling out china and india by name.\n\nin short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of america and the united states and ships them to foreign countries, he added. this agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the united states.\n\nthough in his announcement trump referred to himself as someone who cares deeply about the environment, he has signaled, more broadly, that fighting climate change is not a priority for his administration. he has denied the existence of climate change and appointed as the head of the epa a man who doesn't accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. and he has already overturned several obama-era efforts to reduce emissions.\n\na hard-fought diplomatic agreement\n\nthe paris accord was reached in 2015 after lengthy negotiations. the deal relies on voluntary cuts in emissions by all member nations.\n\nthe agreement also, significantly, sets a global target to keep the rise in the average temperature to no higher than 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels. and it calls for some $100 billion a year in funding from developed countries toward developing countries to support green energy sources.\n\nstill, it fell short of what some parties had hoped for. island nations — which face an existent threat from rising seawaters — had pushed hard for a target of 1.5 degrees celsius. (why not even lower? well, as of 2015, the global average temperature had already risen by 1 degree celsius, and even with robust efforts to cut emissions, some further increase is essentially inevitable.)\n\nand the agreement relies on voluntary cuts in emissions, seen by some critics as a major weakness.\n\nstill, the fact that the world managed to agree on a target was celebrated as a diplomatic achievement, one that multiple world leaders have emphasized as crucial to support. after the recent g-7 meetings of leading industrial nations, indian prime minister narendra modi met with german chancellor angela merkel and vocally supported her commitment to action on climate change.\n\nmodi said failing to act on climate change would be a morally criminal act. merkel had previously vowed to convince the doubters among world leaders that protecting the climate matters to all of us.\n\nthe doubters are in the minority. only two countries — syria and nicaragua — have completely rejected the deal.\n\nseveral dozen countries have signed but not fully approved — including iran, turkey and, most significantly, russia, which is a major emitter of greenhouse gases. but three-quarters of the countries on earth have fully committed to the accord.\n\na pact in name or in deed?\n\nit is important to note that the paris accord is only as strong as each nation's actual reduction in emissions. that means leaving the agreement isn't the only way to weaken it: trump could have kept the u.s. as a signatory but continued to slash the programs that would actually make it possible to reach the target for emissions.\n\nthe opposite is also true: u.s. greenhouse gas emissions could continue to go down, at least in the short term, even as trump withdraws from the accord.\n\nas npr's christopher joyce recently reported, emissions in the u.s. have declined by about 12 percent since 2005.\n\nenvironment market forces may impact emissions more than climate agreements market forces may impact emissions more than climate agreements listen · 3:38 3:38\n\nthe u.s. has successfully bent its greenhouse gas emissions curve, kate larsen, of the economics research team rhodium group, told christopher. and we are going to continue to reduce emissions over the next 10 years, likely regardless of trump policy.\n\nbut while the paris accord isn't synonymous with u.s. emissions cuts, that doesn't mean trump's decision on the accord is meaningless.\n\neconomist marc hafstead, who is with resources for the future, told christopher that exiting the deal could potentially have political ramifications — to the extent that our pulling out of the agreement is going to cause other countries to do less.\n\nit would also threaten the $100 billion a year pledged to help developing countries achieve emissions cuts, as bloomberg has reported.\n\nmeanwhile, many analysts see a u.s. departure from the deal as paving the way for china to take the lead on climate change.\n\nit's not just a question of intangible moral leadership or even of the potential profits from green energy that would be on the table. the atlantic reported last year that a u.s. departure would likely result in less-transparent mechanisms for actually enforcing the paris accord — because chinese faulty and unreliable energy statistics could play a prominent role.\n\nby staying in the deal, the u.s. would have kept a spot at the negotiating table — and potential influence over how the agreement is enforced.\n\nreaction in the u.s.\n\nobama decried trump's decision in a statement released thursday.\n\nthe nations that remain in the paris agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created, the former president said.\n\nhe added: i believe the united states of america should be at the front of the pack. but even in the absence of american leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; i'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.\n\njohn kerry, obama's secretary of state and a key player in crafting the paris agreement, also denounced the u.s. withdrawal as a self-destructive step that puts our nation last.\n\nthis is an unprecedented forfeiture of american leadership which will cost us influence, cost us jobs, and invite other countries to walk away from solving humanity's most existential crisis, he said in a statement thursday. it isolates the united states after we had united the world.\n\neven before trump announced his final decision, democrats in the u.s. decried withdrawal as a low point in modern american leadership, as rep. john garamendi, d-calif., put it.\n\non wednesday, sen. kirsten gillibrand, d-n.y., wrote on twitter that it would be catastrophic for the president to cede our leadership on this issue.\n\nsome republicans in congress, including several representing districts particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, also rebuked reports of trump's decision. climate change is a serious issue, tweeted rep. vern buchanan of florida — with a photo of development near a florida beach.\n\nin a tweet thursday, tesla founder and ceo elon musk announced that trump's withdrawal from the deal means musk will be withdrawing, as well — from the president's business advisory council.\n\nbut gop sen. james inhofe of oklahoma strongly defended the decision to leave the accord.\n\nthe main thing is, it's something that we couldn't do; it'd be impossible to do, he told here & now. it's necessary, then, to make sure that we don't have a bunch of people out there suing us because we're not doing what the president said we're supposed to do.\n\nand in a statement, house majority leader kevin mccarthy applauded the move, calling it the right call:\n\nthe previous administration refused to recognize that private innovation and american natural gas have achieved more than government mandates and misguided international agreements — and that naiveté led president obama to sign a climate deal that will impose great costs with little gain. president trump made the right call in leaving a deal that would have put an unnecessary burden on the united states.\n\nreaction from beyond u.s. borders\n\nimmediately after trump's speech, france, germany and italy issued a joint statement announcing that the accord could not be renegotiated, as trump said he would try to do.\n\nfrench president emmanuel macron spoke to trump briefly by phone, expressing that fact directly to him and saying france would no longer be working with the u.s. on climate issues, the associated press reports.\n\na spokesman for u.n. secretary-general antónio guterres called trump's decision a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.\n\nthe secretary-general remains confident that cities, states and businesses within the united states — along with other countries — will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low-carbon, resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity, the spokesman said in a statement.\n\nthe united states' northern neighbor weighed in as well.\n\ncanada is deeply disappointed at the u.s. position, the country's environment minister, catherine mckenna, told reporters thursday. the paris agreement is a good deal for canada, and it's a good deal for the world. no one country can stop action on climate change.
ira flatow, host:\n\nyou're listening to talk of the nation: science friday.\n\ni'm ira flatow. this hour, we'll be talking about two seemingly different worlds, one the world of the super-big, like our universe, and the other world of the super-small, like subatomic particles.\n\none, we have particle physicists looking the tiniest bits of our world with their science-fiction-like names. you have quarks and leptons and bosons and things like that that sound almost made up and sort of are sometimes.\n\ncosmology, at the other end of the spectrum, looks at the big picture, the really big picture, how the universe, with its stars and planets, came to be. it also has some strange nomenclature. they talk about something called wimps, and they have dark energy, and they have dark. they're doing pretty well in making those kinds of interesting names up.\n\nbut these two fields, though, do have some things in common. you can't really know about one without knowing about the other. so this hour, we're going to bring them together for you and get an update on what's happened at the frontiers of both fields.\n\nwhat parts of the puzzle are still missing, and what can the large hadron collider tell us? we're waiting for that come online, possibly by the end of the year. also, how does string theory fit into all of this?\n\nwe've got some of the biggest names in the universe here to talk about it at the campus of arizona state university, broadcasting from the first annual origins symposium, and if you're here in the audience, i invite you to step up to the mike.\n\nwe have a microphone right here in the middle - to come down to the aisles on the side and wait for us to give you a little signal, you can come right up to the mike and ask a question.\n\nalso, you can phone it in, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-talk. also, you can go to our group that's twittering us. that's twittering at @scifri, if you'd like to send us a note, @scifri, or in second life or any other way that you think you can reach us, and we'd love to hear from you.\n\nour guests, let me introduce them. lawrence krauss is foundation professor in the school of earth and space exploration and the physics department at arizona state university. he's also the inaugural director of the origins initiative here at asu. good to see you again, larry.\n\nmr. lawrence krauss (foundation professor, school of earth and space exploration, arizona state university): nice to see you, ira.\n\nflatow: thanks, lawrence. next to him is michael turner. he's professor in the departments of astronomy and astrophysics and physics at the kavli institute for cosmological physics at the university of chicago. welcome back to science friday.\n\nmr. michael turner (professor, departments of astronomy and astrophysics and physics, kavli institute for cosmological physics, university of chicago): good to be here.\n\nflatow: next to him is brian greene. he's professor of mathematics and physics at columbia university in new york. he's also the author of many books and tv shows and stuff. you know, i'm sure he needs no introduction. brian, good to see you again.\n\nmr. brian greene (professor of mathematics and physics, columbia university): thank you.\n\nflatow: also with us is steven weinberg. he's a professor of physics and astronomy at the university of texas at austin. he won the nobel prize in physics in 1979 for his work in quantum mechanics. welcome back, steven.\n\nmr. steven weinberg (professor of physics and astronomy, the university of texas at austin): hello, ira.\n\nflatow: good to see how. let me begin at that end of the table. steven, let me begin with you. what don't we know?\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nflatow: just a simple little question. what don't we - and we only have an hour to talk about it, so…\n\nmr. weinberg: we understand the way particles and forces work down to a certain scale of distances, maybe a hundredth or a thousandth the size of an atomic nucleus, but when you get to distances smaller than that, we just - for example, light waves with a wavelength less than that, we really don't know how they behave. the laws of physics are not well understood.\n\nthat's the sort of thing that will be explored at the large hadron collider. it's also the sort of thing that you need in order to understand the early universe because in the early universe, times were very short.\n\nthe size of the universe doubled in a tiny, tiny fraction of a second. light, in the time that the size of the universe doubled, could only go a very tiny distance, and you're getting into distances that small that are beyond our understanding and in fact even much smaller.\n\nso in that realm of the very small, very short distances, very short times, very high energies, we don't know the rules that govern matter.\n\nflatow: brian greene - but you - all four of you are theoretical physicists. you just get up there at the blackboards and write those equations, and there are a lot of stories about…\n\nyou were theoretical physicists versus experimental physicists, which we won't get into at the moment, but how do theoretical physicists then attack the problem that steven weinberg is talking about?\n\nmr. greene: well, it's a really tough problem, and one of the approaches that we have been very successful at in the last 20 or 30 years is taking little baby steps.\n\nso we have some well-established theories, einstein's general relativity is the one that we use for describing the large objects, galaxies and the entire universe, the real big scales where gravity matters. and quantum physics, in various guises is the structure that we use to describe the small things that we've been talking about - the molecules, the atoms, the subatomic particles.\n\nand we have been trying to increase the domain within which those theories can be made to work through various approaches known as quantum field theory.\n\nstring theory is, perhaps, the most ambitious of these approaches, which tries to whole-hog put together the laws of the big and the laws of the small into one theoretical framework that might be able to go way beyond the scales that steven was referring to, and perhaps allow us insight into the physics of the very, very early universe, the physics of the big bang. so we try to go step by step.\n\nflatow: michael turner, is it possible for us to test out these theories? i mean, we talk about the large hadron collider coming on now. will that help us examine whether these theories or particles exist?\n\nmr. turner: i think so. when you asked our don't-know list, it's much easier to describe. we don't know what 96 percent of the universe is. that's the dark matter and the dark energy. and the dark matter - we think it's a particle, and we actually think that particle could be produced at the lhc and so if you're a cosmologist, you actually call the lhc the dmf, the dark matter factory.\n\nflatow: what particle would that be that you're talking about?\n\nmr. turner: well, we think it's a particle implicated at the scale that steven weinberg was talking about, a particle that weighs maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand times what the proton does, and one name for is the neutralino, the lightest super-symmetric particle.\n\nflatow: there's that name again. how did you come up with the name, a neutralino?\n\nmr. turner: well, we're going to change that eventually.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. turner: the focus groups don't like it so much.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. turner: but i think the goal is - i think we've got a very good chance at the lhc to produce the dark matter particle. and that would end this 70-year-old mystery that started with astronomers, fritz zwicky, showing that there just wasn't enough mass in the stars to hold the universe together - going through this period where this connection between the very big and the very small came together, and dark matter was a central focus point, recognizing that there's not enough atoms in the universe - that's the four percent we do know about - and that implicating a new particle. and the lhc could be the place where we tie that story up, produce that particle and give it a better name.\n\nflatow: will we ever know what this dark energy is?\n\nmr. turner: so i think that's what gets everyone excited in cosmology. that's the next big problem. and there we feel like the solution may be a lot longer out, so we're not so focused in what it is. it might be something as simple, and i put this in quotes, as the energy of nothing, quantum vacuum energy. or it might be something as complex as the breakdown of general relativity. and right now, if you asked any one of the panelists, we could wax poetic about either solution.\n\nflatow: lawrence, do you want to wax poetic?\n\nmr. krauss: well, i did want to add that the neutralino is italian, which is one of the reasons that we call it that.\n\nflatow: you have to explain that a little bit.\n\nmr. krauss: well, it comes from - neutrino was actually - it's a long history. it was an italian version of the neutron, when it was first invented - named by enrico fermi. but - and so we tend to follow those baby steps in general.\n\nour nomenclature isn't always the best, as we said, but the ideas are fascinating, regardless of the names. and dark energy is, as michael said is - actually, i wouldn't say it's the next big problem. it's the biggest problem, i think.\n\ni think we'd all agree on that, that the biggest mystery in particle physics and cosmology is why empty space appears to weigh something. that's literally the case. most of the energy in the universe - you get rid of stars, you get rid of galaxies, you get rid of all the radiation, you get rid of dust. empty space appears to have energy, and that's just crazy.\n\nit's crazy if you think about it in a general sense, but from a physics perspective, it's kind of crazy except when you apply the laws of quantum and special relativity together, empty space isn't so empty.\n\nso it's a bubbling, boiling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence in a time so short you can't see them. so you might say okay, well that's fine. it's just due to them.\n\nbut the problem is when we apply our naïve ideas to that energy of empty space, we come up with a prediction, which is wrong by 120 orders of magnitude, which is probably the worst prediction in all of physics. and that's why we're excited because getting it wrong means there's a lot we have to understand.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nflatow: i remember the last time i talked to steven weinberg about this, he said one of the great mysteries is that there should be a lot more of that stuff, right?\n\nmr. weinberg: yes, exactly, and that's a problem that faced a lot of us for decades, and many of us assumed, well, we know it's 120 orders of magnitude smaller than we would naively expect. so clearly it's zero, for some reason that we haven't yet been smart enough to figure out.\n\nand then in 1998, two groups of astronomers discovered it's not zero, it's just very small. and that compounded the puzzle, but the puzzle is not simply that there is energy in empty space, the puzzle is why there's so little of it and yet not none at all.\n\nflatow: does it mean we need new physics?\n\nmr. weinberg: well, we don't know. it may be - oh undoubtedly we need new physics of some kind or other. the question is how new. how much of a revolution in physics will be required?\n\ni can just say that a lot of very bright people have broken their heads over the years, trying to understand the dark energy. at first, we tried to understand why it was zero, when we thought it was zero, and now the problem is to understand why it is what it is, and there are no very good explanations. there are some that have been offered, but none obviously is correct.\n\nflatow: well hang on. we have a lot to talk about. we have a whole hour to do it. we have to take a break and pay some of the bills here. so we're going to take a break and come back and talk more with lawrence krauss, michael turner, brian greene and steven weinberg.\n\nour number, 1-800-989-8255. we encourage you to step up to the microphones here if you're here with us at arizona state university. also, twittering. please send those twitters in, and phone number, as i say, 1-800-989-8255. stay with us. we'll be right back after this short break.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nflatow: you're listening to science friday from npr news.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nflatow: you're listening to science friday from npr news. we're at the campus at arizona state university, at their origins symposium with guests: lawrence krauss, who is the driving force behind the symposium; michael turner, kavli institute for cosmological physics at the university of chicago; brian greene, professor of mathematics and physics at columbia; steven weinberg, professor of physics and astronomy at the university of texas at austin and winner of the 1979 nobel prize in physics.\n\nour number, 1-800-989-8255. lawrence, you wanted to say something.\n\nmr. krauss: yes. to jump in to what steve was saying, one of the things we're actually going to have a discussion, if not a debate, at this meeting about is that one of the explanations that's been proposed is one that many scientists distasteful, but it may be true.\n\nand that is this energy of empty space is such that if you added a little bit more, just a little bit more, galaxies wouldn't form, and if galaxies wouldn't form, then stars wouldn't form, and if stars wouldn't form, then astronomer's wouldn't form.\n\nso the argument is the universe is the way it is because there are astronomers here to observe it.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. krauss: and that may sound ridiculous, and some scientists think it is, but nevertheless, it's become a possibility, and in fact, some string theorists in particular have argued that that may be the prediction of - well, if there's any predictions at all.\n\nflatow: i'm having a senior moment about what's-his-name, the famous physicist who recently died who was the first proponent of that, in texas. i'm forgetting what his name is.\n\nbut we're here because we see the universe.\n\nmr. krauss: yeah, and you know, the point is - well, many physicists find it distasteful because for 400 years, physics has tried to explain why the universe is the way it is rather than why it isn't, but at the same time, and for another reason, whenever we've gotten to a point where something really strange has come up, the anthropic principle has been proposed as an explanation.\n\nbut in this particular case, it's such a dramatic and difficult thing to understand, and it's also there are theories which provide a natural mechanism for many different universes, and string theory is one such possibility, that give that additional strength. and so there's a huge debate in the physics community about that.\n\nflatow: gentlemen, feel free to jump in at any point if you want to add something. hey, i'm struck by what you said about the dark - the holy grail now is the dark energy because just a few years ago, we talked about uniting the forces of nature as the holy grail, you know, uniting gravity with the other forces, and that's sort of gone into the background, michael, and it sort of faded a bit.\n\nmr. turner: you can't always choose the problems that nature gives you. so we're still very interested in looking at hints for the unification of the forces from the early universe, and one of our other big holy grails in cosmology right now is to test this idea of inflation, the idea that the universe went through a growth spurt and that this growth spurt, very early on, which explains a lot of the features of the universe today, including the galaxies and astronomers that we know exist, by blowing up quantum fluctuations, that would be or could be a big clue and piece to this unification.\n\nand so that's one of the other major threads is, did the universe really go through this growth spurt. and thanks to the instrumentation we now have, particularly measurements of the microwave background, we're starting to test this idea. and what we might do in the next 10 years, probably more likely than solving dark energy, is to figure out when and if inflation took place. and if it really did take place, it could be a clue to this unification of the forces.\n\nflatow: brian, when the large hadron collider does get up and running - what is it, slated for november or something like, somewhere around there, when they get it fixed - what particles - michael mentioned a particle - what particles will it help you in your string theory ideas? what would you like to see come out of that?\n\nmr. greene: well, there's a class of particles that string theory naturally gives rise to, that are called super-symmetric particles. i mean, the full name of string theory is super-string theory, and the super refers to this feature called super-symmetry.\n\nand the idea is that for every known particle species - electrons, quarks and neutrinos - there is a partner particle that we haven't yet seen: for the electron, the super-symmetric electron or the selectron; for quarks, squarks; neutrino; sneutrino.\n\nflatow: is that because we think nature is symmetrical or likes to be symmetrical?\n\nmr. greene: well, there are a number of pathways that lead to this idea, and one is this notion of unifying all the forces. so string theory is an approach that naturally does unify all the forces, but what comes along with that unification is this super-symmetric quality.\n\nso, that's sort of one approach. there also are some experimental hints that this actually is a better way of describing existing data. so there are a number of avenues of thought that lead to this idea, and we'll look for the particles and see if they're found.\n\nflatow: what about this thing called the higgs boson?\n\nmr. greene: higgs boson is another important particle that i'd say the majority of physicists think we will find at the large hadron collider, and it's the particle that gives mass to the conventional other particles in the world around us.\n\nso the reason why the electron has the mass that it does, according to this approach, is that we're all immersed in a kind of higgs ocean, a higgs field, a misty higgs molasses, if you will, and as the electron tries to go through this higgs molasses, it experiences a resistance to any acceleration, and that's usually what we call mass.\n\nnow if this higgs molasses is around, you should be able to hit it really hard, which we'll do at the large hadron collider, and chip off a little piece of it. and the little piece will be a higgs particle, and we'll look for that.\n\nflatow: steven, do you think we'll be more upset if we find it or more upset if we don't find it?\n\nmr. weinberg: well, i think it'll be a lot more exciting if we don't find it.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. weinberg: some of us are dreading that what the lhc will find is a single, electrically neutral higgs boson where it's expected with a mass of, oh let's say, 130 or 150 times the mass of the proton, and nothing else. i think that would be the worst possible outcome.\n\na much better outcome would be if they didn't find it at all.\n\nflatow: why? if they're going to look for it, why is that…?\n\nmr. weinberg: then we have to go to the theoretical drawing boards. i mean, there are theories that manage to explain masses and explain why the different interactions don't have the same properties, so-called broken symmetries.\n\nthere are theories that don't have a higgs boson in them, and those theories might turn out to be right, although they have problems. they're not as popular as the theories in which the higgs boson appears.\n\nbut it would be exciting to be sent off in a new direction, but it would be really boring just to find the higgs boson.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nflatow: lawrence - i want to move back to you all in a second. why - this is something i haven't heard from…\n\nmr. krauss: well no, but i mean, i think it's the biggest misconception about science is that somehow scientists are happy understanding things. in fact, if you're a theorist, you're happiest when you don't understand things because there's a lot more to understand about nature.\n\nand in fact, that's the other thing that i think michael was referring to. nature surprises us, and that's the great thing. i mean, if we didn't - if nature wasn't more imaginative than we were, we could just sit in closed rooms and just come up with theories of everything.\n\nbut in fact, nature surprises us, and every time we put a new window on the universe, almost every time, it's surprised us. dark energy just came out of nowhere, and so that's what makes science exciting, is in fact, the search - is not understanding.\n\nand for many people, that's uncomfortable. for a scientist, that's the best. to be perplexed is the best state of mind to be in.\n\nmr. weinberg: just to add to what lawrence said. i think steven is saying that particularly illustrates it because the higgs particle finishes his story, his unification of the electromagnetic and the weak force.\n\nand so here we have steve weinberg, instead of saying oh, all i want for christmas is the higgs from the lhc…\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. weinberg: …what he really wants is clues about where to go next and new puzzles, and i think that's what scientists are all about.\n\nflatow: brian, tell us a little bit more about it.\n\nmr. greene: yeah, i mean, i think this is a really important point, but it's one that really even has an important implication for how we go forward with funding.\n\ni mean, if you find nothing at the lhc, that would be really exciting to us, but imagine going back to the funding agency and saying you know what? here's what we found: nothing.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nflatow: i hate it when that happens.\n\nmr. greene: but if you have a public that really is attuned to what science is about, which is going into the unknown and not finding what you expected, and that's what really gets the juices flowing, then a result such as we didn't find anything at all and therefore we need to build the next machine, which will take us to the next frontier, that would be completely understandable.\n\nflatow: very interesting. 1-800-989-8255. yes, sir.\n\ngene(ph) (audience member): i'm gene. you know me as genius(ph) on twitter. it's starting to remind me of in iowa, one day the wind stopped, and all the chickens fell over. so not finding…\n\nback in the early '60s, i learned - studied physics, and then i was told to get close to the speed of light, it takes a little bit more energy. a little bit closer, it takes a whole lot more energy. a little bit closer again, a whole lot and whole lot, a lot more. in other words, you never get there.\n\nmy question is with this idea of inflation, i see that as the universe expanding faster than the speed of light. is it possible that, you know, under those conditions, if things really were sent out, wherever out is, to us faster than the speed of light and just that the light hasn't had time to get back to us?\n\nmr. greene: actually, you have to be - we lie to you in school. we lie a lot, but you have to be like a lawyer and parse it a little more carefully. nothing can travel through space faster than the speed of light, but as far as we know in general relativity, space can do whatever the heck it wants.\n\nand in fact, inflation or not, there are regions of the universe right now that are expanding away from us faster than the speed of light. locally - in fact, in general relativity, you can be moving at the speed of light and still be standing still. you're doing it now, in this room, you know? i'm moving -unless you had a lot of coffee, you're not moving very fast. but relative to a radio audience at the other end of the universe, which isn't moving fast in their local surroundings, we're moving away at the speed of light.\n\nand that has profound implications, by the way. in fact, one of the biggest implications of dark energy - and i find it poetic - you ask me to wax poetic -i think one of the most poetic things is that it means the universe is speeding up.\n\nand actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared. the entire universe will disappear before our very eyes, and it's one of my arguments for actually funding cosmology. we've got to do it while we have a chance.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. weinberg: what's a billion years here and there?\n\nmr. turner: that'd be the dark energy beyond.\n\nflatow: dark energy you can't see. all right, thanks for your question. 1-800-989-8255. and not to mention those things that - the spooky action-at-a-distance thing that people think - try to understand, right?\n\nmr. weinberg: the weird quantum mechanics.\n\nflatow: the weird quantum mechanics.\n\nmr. turner: quantum mechanics is, i mean, a lot of people have said it that if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't. i mean, general relativity is easy in a sense, and special relativity is easy because the mathematics isn't even that difficult in special relativity. but conceptually, quantum mechanics is just completely beyond our intuition. and it fascinates people. we can understand how to write down on a paper, but to truly conceptualize it is really where it ends.\n\nthere's a lot of fascinating experimental physics going on right now that try and use quantum mechanics for fancy things like sending messages and cryptography and all of that.\n\nflatow: a great compliment to the panel coming in on the twitter from somebody who says - (unintelligible) says, i finally know what a higgs boson particle is. thanks.\n\nnot many times we've talked about this, but you folks have.\n\nmr. turner: every time i get out of the taxi cab, that's what the guy says.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nflatow: there should be a tv show about stuff like - you know, like reality shows, where, you know, not just the csi. we should have something with physicists looking for…\n\nmr. turner: we talked about that. i share this before the panel, we all be stuck in a house and people get to vote us off and…\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. turner: yeah. dancing with physicists.\n\nflatow: well, if the woz could be on there, there's hope for anybody. do we have another question from the audience here? please, if you're asking a question, step up to the mike. 1-800-989-8255.\n\nlet's go to the phone to see who's got a question there. let's go to steve(ph) in modesto, california. hi, steve.\n\nsteve (caller): oh, hi.\n\nflatow: hi, there.\n\nsteve: my question is what happens when photons collide in deep space.\n\nflatow: what happens…\n\nsteve: this is after…\n\nflatow: go ahead.\n\nsteve: after 13 billions years of - and almost infinite number of photons, i expect some of them have collided with each other. what happens to that energy?\n\nflatow: all right. we'll see what we can do. let me just remind that everybody that this science friday from npr news. i'm ira flatow here at arizona state university. michael, you had your hand up first then go to lawrence.\n\nmr. turner: that doesn't happen very much anymore. so…\n\nflatow: what do you mean anymore?\n\nmr. turner: the universe today is very, very big. and so, the space between photons is quite large. and so, the probability of two photons colliding is not very big. but if you go back to the past when the universe was much smaller, then the same number of photons occupy a lesser space. and so, the chance for collision was greater.\n\nand in fact, we'll be talking about this this afternoon. this is one of the barriers to looking back to the very beginning. because when we look at these photons in the microwave background, the most abundant photons, they haven't collided for the last 13.7 billion years. and that seems like a very long time, but they last collided when the universe was about 380,000 years old. and because of that, we can't look with our eyes any further back. and so it's one of the barriers we have to studying the earliest moments of the universe.\n\nmr. krauss: but at the same time, it provides an opportunity because, in fact, that's what so wonderful about the universe is that the photons haven't collided, that the microwave background gives us a picture of what the universe look like almost 13.7 billions years ago. that's why two nobel prize - in fact, one of the people who won them is in this room.\n\nflatow: right.\n\nmr. krauss: but that's why it's so important, because it gives us a baby picture of the universe.\n\nflatow: did you want to jump in, brian?\n\nmr. greene: i like to say that it's also good to think about scale, though. i think when one says that the photons are very far apart, we need to have in mind how small the photons are. i mean, in any cubic meter of space, there are roughly 400 million of these guys running around.\n\nso, there are a lot of them. they just interact so feebly that it's rare in those environments that they would actually interact much.\n\nflatow: mm-hmm. yes, steven?\n\nmr. weinberg: well, i have to, though, support the questioner. every once in a while, even now, a couple of photons in intergalactic space collide, but their energy is so low that the only thing that can happen is two photons go in, two photons go out.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. weinberg: the different thing in the early universe is, when you go back to the very early universe when the temperature was something like 10 to the 13 degrees kelvin, that when photons collided, electron-positron pairs could be produced, charged particles could be produced. that can't happen now because there isn't enough energy.\n\nflatow: but don't we have photons in this room colliding all the time?\n\nmr. weinberg: sure. sure.\n\nflatow: yeah, because they're light particles.\n\nmr. weinberg: but not much - i mean, they collide and…\n\nflatow: right.\n\nmr. weinberg: …who cares?\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nflatow: if two photons collide out in the universe, is there anyone around to know it happens, you know, like the trees in the forest, they still make a noise. yes, lawrence, did you want…\n\nmr. krauss: i was going to say that there is - there are, however, photons that do collide. and they're another one of our windows in the universe. there are objects out there, perhaps black holes colliding or stars exploding that are producing very high energy cosmic rays, which produce very energetic particles. some of them may be very energetic photons, and they collide in the atmosphere and we use those photons which then produce particles in our atmosphere to try and learn about objects from extreme distances in space. it's a very exciting area of physics right now.\n\nflatow: mm-hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. we - better than to get into another topic of discussion, let's get ready for a break because we have less than a minute to go. let me reintroduce the panel: lawrence krauss with arizona state university, michael turner, university of chicago, brian greene of columbia, steven weinberg, university of texas at austin. our number: 1-800-989-8255. we're getting some of the best questions we've ever had coming in from the audience today. i'm just happy to sit here and not even look on my notes because your questions are better than ones that i would ask.\n\nalso on twitter at scifri, and also in second life. your avatars are hanging out there and sending in some good questions. we'll get to those. you can get free science friday t-shirt for your avatar in second life. so don't be bashful. stand up and put your hand in the box, pull out a t-shirt. we'll be right back after this break. i'm ira flatow at arizona state university. stay with us.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nflatow: you're listening to science friday from npr news.\n\n(soundbite of advertisement)\n\nflatow: you're listening to science friday from npr news. i'm ira flatow here at arizona state university, talking with - talking about physics, cosmology, particle physics, all kinds of stuff. gone into interesting side trips. and i mentioned before, i couldn't think - i had a senior moment. i couldn't think of the name of the person i was trying to think of before. it was john wheeler who had mentioned that - his idea was that the reason the universe exists is because we are here to observe it. it needs the process of observation to create the objects in the quantum world.\n\nalso with me is lawrence krauss of arizona state university; michael turner, university of chicago; brian greene of columbia university, also he's head of the science festival in new york. it's happening this year, right?\n\nmr. greene: yeah. june 10th to june 14th, the world science festival, yeah.\n\nflatow: world science festival. great. also, steven weinberg, professor of physics and astronomy in university of texas at austin, and winner of the 1979 nobel prize in physics.\n\nsteven, was i right about john wheeler? from another fellow texan - i know you came, like, to texas pretty late there, but…\n\nmr. weinberg: yeah. well, he - yes, you are right about his views, but his views were very different from those of most astronomers and physicists today. john really thought that things - the only things that can exist are things that we observe, and they exist so that we can observe them.\n\ni remembered, he had an argument, the universe will live forever. it has to be eternal, because otherwise there wouldn't be time for us to observe everything. now, john, was a great physicist and he was my professor at princeton, but i think that was sort of crazy.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. weinberg: and most of us take a very different point of view. for us, this whole anthropic business only makes sense if what we call the universe, the big bang, the galaxies expanding out to billions of light years in all directions is just one part of a much larger multiverse.\n\nflatow: mm-hmm.\n\nmr. weinberg: and in which the different parts have different values for constants of nature, like the dark energy. then, the anthropic idea just becomes common sense. it's just like trying to understand why water is liquid on the surface of the earth.\n\nif the earth was the only planet in the universe, then it really would be amazing that with just the right business from the sun to make water liquid and how intense life to be possible. and john wheeler might say, well, it has to be that or else we wouldn't be here.\n\nbut most of us would feel a bit, you know, that was kind of theological. on the other hand, if there are countless planets which we now know there are, then -and many of them are not close - are either too far from their planet for water could be liquid or too close to it…\n\nflatow: you mean, there sun.\n\nmr. weinberg: yeah. i mean, i actually mean from their respective stars.\n\nflatow: right.\n\nmr. weinberg: in that case, it's natural that we are on one of - the minority of planets which are at the right distance from this star. it's just common sense.\n\nflatow: yeah.\n\nmr. weinberg: that's what where we would be. and there's nothing in the formation of planets that has anything to do with us.\n\nmr. turner: and it's not - it's also, and steve forgot to mention something very important. it's not theological. a lot of people think that somehow the anthropic principle suggests the universe is fine tuned so we could exist, and that's evidence for - but it's exactly the opposite. it's just like evolution. it's, you know, why does a bee so fine tuned to be able to see the flowers? because if it wasn't, they wouldn't survive. and in this case, it's cosmic evolution.\n\nm: yeah. but john wheeler probably did think it was fine tuned.\n\nmr. turner: yeah. yeah, he did, i think. and that's why we disagree in stuff.\n\nflatow: speaking of fine tuning, michael, did you…\n\nmr. turner: some of us chaff at using the word anthropic and common sense in the same sentence.\n\nflatow: i can see that.\n\nmr. turner: and when we have so much in front of us to try to understand about the universe - i mean, if you - the metaphor for cosmology right now is that we know a tremendous amount about the universe. and we understand a lot less. and so, some of us feel like we ought to concentrate on our own universe before we imagine a multiverse.\n\nflatow: well, let's go to our own universe, and a question right here in the front row, yeah.\n\nunidentified woman: you guys briefly mentioned the importance of public understanding of the value of scientific discovery, the idea that a non-finding can be equally as important, if not more important, than a tangible discovery. this is something that's clearly important to you, gentlemen, because you're participating on a public forum. how do you feel that academics in general are addressing this issue in terms of funding and also in terms of just increasing public understanding of science?\n\nflatow: can you be more specific and give us an example of what you're talking about?\n\nunidentified woman: well, specifically, you guys were talking about the hadron collider.\n\nflatow: right.\n\nunidentified woman: and you can read in scientific articles that people think that scientists, in general, will be creating a black hole and kill us all.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nflatow: mm-hmm.\n\nunidentified woman: and that this is not good for anybody.\n\nflatow: well, we all hate it when that happens. yeah. yeah.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nunidentified woman: so how do physicists in general address this question, that i think has - it has its roots in public - the public not understanding what you physicists are doing in general.\n\nmr. krauss: you really hit a really important point that i think the scientific community is partly responsible. we tend to sometimes hype things so much. and we have to be aware. you know, we've got to be careful about saying what is likely to happen, and we want to promote things. after all, the large hadron collider costs a lot of money and we try to convince people to spend money to do something. and we often like to say it's going to recreate the early universe. it's going to - and sometimes that comes back to bite us.\n\ni think it's very important that scientists try, of course, to get people interested in what we're doing but not over-hype the situation because it's always bad. and in fact, it's exactly that if we say we're guaranteed to discover all these new particles of large hadron collider and we see nothing, then how can we come back and later say, you know, that was what we really wanted. okay.\n\nmr. greene: although i might just add one thing to that, i don't think it was by design but this notion of creating a black hole that could eat up geneva and the rest of the world was perhaps the greatest pr ploy that one could ever have imagined for the large hadron collider.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. greene: i can't tell you the number of television and radio shows i did where they ostensibly said they wanted to talk about the physics of the large hadron collider. the only reason they had me there was to discuss black holes eating up the earth. and it was actually a wonderful opportunity to then jump off from that and talk about the bill signs and how exciting it is.\n\nbut getting back to your question more generally, i think there was a time when there was a resistance on the part of the scientific academic community to be out there talking about ideas in the public setting. and when i was writing my first book, there was definitely a fear that i don't know how my colleagues are going to respond to this. but i was really pleasantly surprised, there was great support among the people who - at least in my face - there is great support.\n\nand i really get a sense from doing this world science festival and other activities that there's a willingness and even an enthusiasm on the part of so many scientists to try to get the real message of science out there. so i think things are going in the right direction.\n\nmr. turner: and i should say that, you know, for programs like this there's some perception of some people in media that people aren't interested in science. but lots of people listen to this program and we have an event associated with this meeting, yesterday at a high school, 1,000 teenagers spent two hours in the afternoon, and there was no basketball players there. there's you know, three physicists. and it was really gratifying.\n\ni think the public really is interested. and probably the people we have to commit the most maybe are from the media people because i think the public is fascinated by what's going on in front of science.\n\nflatow: yeah. we have 12 million downloads of our podcast, so it's pretty - you've given them the opportunity to listen to it as much as they can.\n\nmr. weinberg: this is an old story when galileo wrote his dialogue concerning the two chief systems of the world, in which he presented his discoveries about astronomy. he wrote it in italian rather than in latin. latin was the language that would reach scholars throughout europe. and italian was a language that would be read by ordinary people. and he wanted it to be read by ordinary people. unfortunately, it got him into some trouble.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nmr. weinberg: but we don't face that problem at least.\n\nflatow: while we have a large audience here, brian, let me ask you about string theory and what do you think is happening with it. it's been many decades now, old - are you still is confident in it as you've always been, or what - about answering everything?\n\nmr. greene: sure. yeah. that's a great question. and i think it's worth just clarifying what confidence means. i'm often asked, do you still believe in string theory. and i'm glad you didn't frame it that way because my response to that question would have been i don't believe in anything until it's experimentally proven. i have confidence that this is the best approach currently on the table for answering this deep question of putting together einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity and quantum physics. if there were a better theory on the table, i'm sure all of these string theorists would turn their attention toward it. it is the best thing we have. and over the last few decades, the math has come together in such an incredibly compelling way. the pieces have locked together in a way where as you work on it, you feel that it has to be leading me toward a true, deeper understanding of the world. but that is not how you judge a theory. you judge it whether it makes predictions that are going to be confirmed by experiment, and we are working hard in that direction. so, yes.\n\nmr. turner: i suspect lawrence maybe wants to…\n\nmr. krauss: yeah. brian and i have talked about this publicly in the past. but, yeah, it's been, i think, however, unfortunately, the direction has demonstrated that it's less and less likely they've be able to predict anything. in fact, instead of a theory of everything it would be a theory of anything in that sense that, right now it looks like that it predicts a multitude of possible universes in which almost anything can happen. and science is sort of based on falsifiability, and if you could predict anything, then you really predict nothing. and so it is still promising, although i see my friend frank willcheck(ph) in the audience and he says it's been promising and promising and promising. so, we'll see.\n\nflatow: okay. did you want to get a rebuttal in, brian?\n\nmr. greene: well, the only thing i would say to that is, you know, when you're trying to answer questions that are this deep; questions that are in one form or another we've been asking for thousands of years, questions that could indeed lead to resolutions of how the universe began, where it all came from, the origin of time - these are big issues. and if you're working on a theory for a few decades and it matures in various unexpected ways, you go with it and you try ultimately to extract some predictions from it.\n\nso, i would say that trying to judge string theory today is like trying to judge a block of wood that hasn't yet been turned into a violin. you know, it's in an infant stage. it's a very difficult problem. the progress has been astounding. there are questions that we've resolved in the theory that i, 20 years ago, and i think my colleagues would agree, would think we would never get this far in certain domains. but we've not made enough progress in the other direction which is making the experimental predictions, and that's just the state of being at the cutting edge.\n\nflatow: well, and it also looked to me as a journalist and as someone who'd deal with the public, it goes back to the question you were saying before. whatever you say just spell its name right. you know, the fact that there is a controversy about it and gets people to talk about it, you know, and even think about the controversy of it. and they begin to talk about it and there can't be anything wrong with people talking about science.\n\nand speaking of which, this is science friday from npr news. i'm ira flatow here at the arizona state university as part of the - excuse me - as part of my - i have to drink a water - as part of symposium we're having here. and we're going to go to audience - a question? go ahead right there. every week i have this same part of the show, i need a glass of water. go ahead.\n\nunidentified man #5: i wanted to say come back. you've mentioned about the expanding universe and then the cosmology and how your, lawrence, your pun that eventually we won't be able to see anything at all because of the rapid expansion of universe. and i want to know, like, in your professional opinion, whether we're misinterpreting this and that is it all possible that 96 percent that we don't know right now could be explained by it's too far away for us to see, it's moving too fast and we're in a localized universe now?\n\nmr. krauss: well, i mean, all right, your question went in different directions than i thought it would. i think the answer is no to that particular part. i think - i mean what we're measuring things we can see here now. we're measuring the acceleration of galaxies away from us. we're watching them speed up. and so we're seeing things in our universe. but what it does point out to me - and i think this is really - maybe we should be humble. because one of the things we've recently discovered, which i think is fascinating is that in the far future - because these dark energies persist, than astronomers in the far future will come up with a picture of the universe which is completely wrong. there every bit of the evidence will suggest they live in a static, empty universe, exactly the universe we thought we lived in the 1900.\n\nand so i'd like to say we're living in interesting times. maybe the only time in the history of universe when we can - when we know we're living in interesting times. but the more important point is, it suggests that if we're - if they're missing something then, maybe there are key parts of the universe that we're missing now. and while we have this incredible picture that there maybe things that are out there that are going to change it completely. and really that's what makes science so exciting.\n\nflatow: now, lisa randall was on the program a few weeks ago and she talked about the fact that the reason why gravity is so weak here is that it may be a part of another universe sitting right next to us, and was just leaking into here. what do you think? is that…?\n\nmr. krauss: it could be. i wouldn't bet on it. but it could be.\n\n(soundbite of laughter)\n\nflatow: it may not - but there could be other universes that are around us that we don't know about?\n\nmr. krauss: well, if she's talking about, in that context, they're talking about a possibility comes from string theory in which extra dimensions…\n\nflatow: right. right. yeah.\n\nmr. krauss: …not other universes in our space, but other universes in extra dimensional space which is sort of one of the requirements of string theory. and it's certainly possible. i don't personally think it's a very attractive picture, but we'll see. and we may… and there's some people who hope there may be evidence for it at the large hadron collider. if the extra dimensions are large enough, maybe we'll be able to bang things together so hard that some of the energy leaks in extra dimensions. again, i wouldn't bet on it.\n\nflatow: brian?\n\nmr. greene: yeah. which is a good point just to emphasize, we're talking about string theory in the fact that we've not been able to put on the table, do this experiment and find these results that theory is giving a result that's confirmed. and if you don't find that, the theory is ruled out. we can't get to that stage.\n\nbut it is possible with the large hadron collider, long-shot possibility, that some of the features of string theory could be approved(ph). it is idea of extra dimensions, you know, slamming these protons together at very, very high speed and some of the debris gets jammed in other dimensions and you recognize that by having a little bit less energy in our part of the universe, and it's leaked away. that would be great. finding these super symmetric particles, that'd be great. creating a little microscopic black hole, again an idea that really has its origin in string theoretic ways of thinking about things. that would be spectacular.\n\nflatow: yeah.\n\nmr. greene: so, all these little pieces of the puzzle, where they to happen - again, i consider it a long shot - but where they happen again, you would have much great confidence that this set of ideas was going in the right direction.\n\nflatow: michael, you can go about 30 seconds.\n\nmr. turner: okay. i was just going to get to the question asked, which sort of was, could this cosmic acceleration go away? it's such an extraordinary thing - we haven't used the word.\n\nflatow: do we know why it happened?\n\nmr. turner: well, we…\n\nflatow: why it kicked in at that point?\n\nmr. turner: we would say that dark energy has repulsive gravity. and so, i think the question is an interesting one. and that's an extraordinary thing, carl sagan used to say extraordinary results require extraordinary evidence.\n\nand 11 years ago, when this discovery was made, i don't think the evidence was there. and i think today i could tell the questionnaire that cosmic acceleration is not going away. the observations that have been made over the past 10 years have really nailed it. the universe is really speeding up and we have to deal with that. it's a big, big mystery.\n\nflatow: all right. and there's your take-home for tonight, talking around the dinner table, and well the universe is expanding and it's not going away.\n\ni want to thank our guests: lawrence krauss of arizona state university; michael turner of the kavli institute for cosmological physics at the university of chicago; brian greene, professor of mathematics and physics at columbia university, and also headed the world science festival coming up in new york this june; also steven weinberg, professor of physics and astronomy at the university of texas at austin, and winner of the 1979 nobel prize in physics. we'd also like to do a shout out to kjzz, our local science friday public radio station, right here in the neighborhood. and thanks also to arizona state university and the origins symposium for their hospitality and bringing us here.\n\ni'm ira flatow in arizona state university.\n\ncopyright © 2009 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

when biden takes office, undoing trump's health policies won't be easy\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption chip somodevilla/getty images chip somodevilla/getty images\n\neven with democrats technically in the majority in congress, the party split is so slim that passing major health care legislation will be extremely difficult.\n\nso speculation about president-elect joe biden's health agenda has focused on the things he can accomplish using executive authority. although there is a long list of things he could do, even longer is the list of things he is being urged to undo — actions taken by president trump.\n\nwhile trump was not able to make good on his highest-profile health-related promises from his 2016 campaign — including repealing the affordable care act and broadly lowering prescription drug prices — his administration did make substantial changes to the nation's health care system using executive branch authority. and many of those changes are anathema to democrats, particularly those aimed at hobbling the aca.\n\nfor example, the trump administration made it easier for those who buy their own insurance to purchase cheaper plans that don't cover all the aca benefits and may not cover pre-existing conditions. it also eliminated protections from discrimination in health care to people who are transgender.\n\ntrump's use of tools like regulations, guidance and executive orders to modify health programs was like an attack by a thousand paper cuts, said maura calsyn, managing director of health policy at the center for american progress, a liberal-leaning think tank. approaching the november election, she said, the administration was in the process of doing irreparable harm to the nation's health care system.\n\nreversing many of those changes will be a big part of biden's health agenda, in many cases coming even before trying to act on his own campaign pledges, such as creating a government-sponsored health plan as part of the aca.\n\nchris jennings, a health aide to former presidents barack obama and bill clinton, said he refers to those trump health policies as bird droppings. as in you have to clean up the bird droppings before you have a clean slate. republicans, when they take over from a democratic administration, think of their predecessors' policies the same way.\n\nthough changing policies made by the executive branch seems easy, that's not always the case.\n\nthese are issue-by-issue determinations that must be made, and they require process evaluation, legal evaluation, resource consideration and timeliness, said jennings. in other words, some policies will take more time and personnel resources than others. and health policies will have to compete for white house attention with policies the new administration will want to change on anything from the environment to immigration to education.\n\neven within health care, issues as diverse as the operations of the aca marketplaces to women's reproductive health to stem cell research will vie to be high on the list.\n\nwhy the changes are hard to reverse\n\nsome types of actions are easier to reverse than others.\n\nexecutive orders issued by the president, for example, can be summarily overturned by a new executive order. agency guidance can similarly be written over, although the trump administration has worked to make that more onerous.\n\nsince the 1980s, for example, every time the presidency has changed parties, one of the incoming president's first actions has been to issue an executive order to either reimpose or eliminate the mexico city policy that governs funding for international family planning organizations that perform or promote abortion. why do new administrations address abortion so quickly? because the anniversary of the landmark supreme court abortion decision roe v. wade is two days after inauguration day, so the action is always politically timely.\n\nharder to change are formal regulations, such as one effectively banning planned parenthood from the federal family planning program, title x. they are governed by a law, the administrative procedure act, that lays out a very specific — and often time-consuming — process. you have to cross your i's and dot your legal t's, said nicholas bagley, who teaches administrative law at the university of michigan law school.\n\nand if you don't? then regulations can be challenged in court — as those of the trump administration were dozens of times. that's something biden officials will take pains to avoid, said calsyn. i would expect to see very deliberate notice and comment rule-making, considering the reshaped judiciary with so many trump-appointed judges, she said.\n\nwhat comes first?\n\nundoing a previous administration's actions in a new administration is an exercise in trying to push many things through a very narrow tube in a short time. department regulations have to go not just through the leadership in each department, but also through the office of management and budget for a technical review, cost-benefit analysis and legal authority, said bagley. that can take time.\n\ncomplicating matters, many health regulations emanate not just from the department of health and human services, but jointly from hhs and other departments, including labor and treasury, which likely means more time to negotiate decisions among multiple departments.\n\nfinally, said bagley, for really high-profile things, you've got to get the president's attention, and he's got limited time, too. anything pandemic-related is likely to come first, he said.\n\nsome items get pushed to the front of the line due to calendar considerations, as with the abortion executive orders. others need more immediate attention because they are part of active court cases.\n\nyou have all these court schedules and briefing schedules that will dictate the timeline where they make all these decisions, said katie keith, a health policy researcher and law professor at georgetown university.\n\na high-profile example in that category is the trump administration's efforts to allow states to set work requirements for many low-income adults who gained medicaid coverage under the affordable care act's expansion of the program. the supreme court has agreed to hear a case challenging hhs approval of work requirements for arkansas and new hampshire in the next few months. some democrats are concerned about how the high court with its new conservative majority might rule, and the biden administration will have to move fast if officials decide they want to head off that case.\n\nbut court actions also might help the biden administration short-circuit the onerous regulatory process. if a regulation the new administration wants to rewrite or repeal has already been blocked by a court, biden officials can simply choose not to appeal that ruling. that's what trump did in ending insurance company subsidies for enrollees with low incomes in 2017.\n\nallowing a lower-court ruling to stand, however, is not a foolproof strategy. that raises the possibility of having someone [else] intervene, said keith. for example, democratic attorneys general stepped in to defend the aca in a case now pending at the supreme court when the trump administration chose not to. so, you have to be pretty strategic about not appealing, she said.\n\nadding on?\n\none other big decision for the incoming administration is whether it wants to use the opportunity to tweak or add to trump policies rather than eliminate them. is it undoing and full stop? asked keith. or undoing and adding on?\n\nshe said there is a full slate of ideologically neutral policies trump put out, including ones on price transparency and prescription drugs. if biden officials don't want to keep those as they are, they can rewrite them and advance other policies at the same time, saving a round of regulatory effort.\n\nbut none of it is easy — or fast.\n\none big problem is just having enough bodies available to do the work. there was so much that undermined and hollowed out the federal workforce; there's a lot of rebuilding that needs to done, said calsyn of the center for american progress. and trump officials ran so roughshod over the regulatory process in many cases, she said, even putting those processes back in place is going to be hard.\n\nincoming officials will also have other time-sensitive work to do. writing regulations for the newly passed ban on surprise medical bills will almost certainly be a giant political fight between insurers and health care providers, who will try to re-litigate the legislation as it is implemented. rules for insurers who sell policies under the aca will need to be written almost immediately after biden takes office.\n\nanyone waiting for a particular trump policy to be wiped from the books will likely have to pack their patience. but law professor bagley said he's optimistic it will all get done.\n\none of the things we've grown unaccustomed to is a competent administration, he said. when people are competent, they can do a lot of things pretty quickly.\n\nkhn (kaiser health news) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues. it is an editorially independent program of kff (kaiser family foundation) that is not affiliated with kaiser permanente.
latest news: capitol grounds are cleared; congress to continue electoral vote tally\n\nailsa chang, host:\n\nat this hour, we are still following the developments at the u.s. capitol. at least one person has died in connection with today's violence by pro-trump extremists. president trump has spoken only once since all of this began in his name, posting a video on twitter, where he urged his followers to leave the capitol. he also repeated his inaccurate statements about the election that have inflamed so many today and for the last two months. president-elect joe biden is calling for calm and criticizing the rhetoric of president trump, and lawmakers are set to resume the certification process of the electoral college votes at the capitol tonight. we're going to talk about all of this now with npr national political correspondent mara liasson.\n\nhi, mara.\n\nmara liasson, byline: hi there.\n\nchang: so, mara, i just want to get sort of a personal response from you because you have covered politics for such a long time. tell me just what has been going through your mind as you've been reacting to the events of today.\n\nliasson: well, it's just heartbreaking. you know, this is supposed to be the greatest democracy on the face of the earth. politics is the nonviolent way that we work out our differences, and today that didn't happen. i don't know if i ever could have imagined that i would live to hear a senior member of the republican party - in this case, mitt romney - say, what happened today was, quote, an insurrection incited by the president of the united states. i mean, it's just extraordinary. everyone i've talked to today has just been totally heartbroken. but it's a logical conclusion in many ways to president trump's repeated refusal ever since 2016 to not agree to a peaceful transfer of power, to not say he would accept the results of an election where he wasn't the winner.\n\nand what was happening inside the capitol today was that members of his party who were loyal to him were going to try to overthrow the will of the voters by trying to decertify the slates of electors sent to washington by the states. that was going to fail. but the armed insurrectionists, the extremist rioters who breached the capitol and - were first at a rally where the president addressed them and encouraged them to walk to the capitol and later in a video, said, we love you; you're special. but he encouraged them, of course, to please go home and be peaceful.\n\nchang: right.\n\nliasson: so he sympathized with the protesters, and many in his own party are saying he incited them. and now the question is, what happens next? will there be any consequences for the president?\n\nchang: well, let's talk about that.\n\nliasson: what happens to the republican party?\n\nchang: exactly. yeah. i mean, looking ahead - well, first, before we look ahead, let's look at tonight. they are going to resume the certification process. can you just talk about, like, the importance of this process, which, in so many other years, is a largely ceremonial process?\n\nliasson: it's totally ceremonial. it shouldn't have become an important moment. but because the president refused to accept the results of the election and continued to press this false narrative that somehow or other, there were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes cast, he encouraged his supporters in congress to challenge the election to see if they could overturn it. they know they couldn't. it was kind of a freebie for the republicans who were challenging it because they - in the end, they wouldn't be undermining the will of the voters.\n\nchang: they couldn't change the outcome.\n\nliasson: they couldn't change the outcome.\n\nchang: so what do you think, mara? what do you think are the long-term consequences of a day like today...\n\nliasson: well, first of all...\n\nchang: ...on institutions and on biden's presidency going forward?\n\nliasson: well, biden now has an incredible opportunity to unite the nation. that's what he ran on. he is the antidote to trump. that's why he got elected. in terms of the republican party, they already were getting branded as the party of voter suppression, the party that wanted to throw out - undermine the will of the people. now are they the party that believes in violent insurrection if you don't like the results of an election? - or at least one wing of the party might. we don't know that. but i think today is a turning point in american politics, and we're going to have to wait for it to shake out. but it's not good for the republican party.\n\nchang: that is npr's mara liasson.\n\nthank you so much, mara.\n\nliasson: you're welcome.\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
secretary of state mike pompeo embarks on reassurance trip to middle east\n\nsecretary of state mike pompeo began an extensive trip to the middle east on tuesday to try to resolve confusion about the trump administration's plans to withdraw troops from syria.\n\nari shapiro, host:\n\nthe trump administration is promising to coordinate with partners as it withdraws from syria. it's not an easy task. turkey's president snubbed national security adviser john bolton today while secretary of state mike pompeo began a week-long reassurance tour in the middle east. npr's michele kelemen is traveling with the secretary.\n\nmichele kelemen, byline: pompeo's first stop is jordan, a country that borders syria and houses hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees. the secretary of state calls jordan a durable partner, adding that he doesn't think a change in the u.s. tactics in syria should affect the u.s.-led coalition's fight against isis.\n\nmike pompeo: there is enormous agreement on the risk that that poses to jordan and to other countries in the neighborhood. and that battle continues. our - the president's decision to withdraw our folks from syria in no way impacts our capacity to deliver on that.\n\nkelemen: jordan's foreign minister, ayman safadi, says he's counting on close coordination with the u.s., especially in sensitive border areas.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nayman safadi: we've always coordinated, and we trust that we will continue to coordinate. and our security is something that has always been taken into account by our allies in washington. this is a solid partnership, particularly when it comes to defense and security against isis.\n\nkelemen: while jordan and the u.s. tried to get on the same page, turkey's president was railing against trump's national security adviser, john bolton. bolton had warned turkey not to mistreat kurdish fighters who turkey considers terrorists but who help the u.s. battle isis in northern syria. turkey's president, recep tayyip erdogan, accused bolton of making a serious mistake by demanding such concessions. pompeo has been far more careful in public not to talk about timelines for a troop withdrawal or any conditions for it. speaking to reporters on his plane on the way here, he denied that bolton and trump are giving mixed messages.\n\npompeo: the president said we're going to do it in an orderly fashion that achieves our objective and that the - our mission set in the region remains unchanged. those seem pretty consistent to me.\n\nkelemen: the mission is not just about countering isis. it's about building up pressure on iran. that will be a major theme as pompeo continues his swing through the middle east. he was promising this at his news conference here in jordan.\n\npompeo: and you'll see in the coming days and weeks, we are redoubling not only our diplomatic but our commercial efforts to put real pressure on iran.\n\nkelemen: he's going to be visiting iran's main regional rival, saudi arabia, and other gulf countries. in riyadh, his aides say he will also press the saudis to establish a, quote, credible narrative about the death of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi and hold those responsible to account. michele kelemen, npr news, amman, jordan.\n\n(soundbite of bomba estereo's tambora)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
wave of capitalist optimism sweeps across paris\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bertrand guay/pool photo via ap bertrand guay/pool photo via ap\n\nthe city of paris does not exactly have a business-friendly reputation. strikes, red tape and a rigid labor market have seen to that. but things are changing. france now has a young, pro-business president. and across the city there's a growing climate of capitalist optimism.\n\na renovated 1920s train station in the middle of paris is now a modern hub for startups. newly elected president emmanuel macron inaugurated station f last june, but the hub was actually conceived before he was elected.\n\nrachel vanier, communications director of station f, gives me a tour of the cavernous 366,000-square-foot space. there are giant art works by jeff koons and ai weiwei, and space for a thousand startups.\n\nbasically, we call ourselves a startup campus because we actually have 28 different incubators, but also a ton of services, vanier says. in a few months we're going to have a housing extension so entrepreneurs from everywhere in the world will be able to come, attend a startup program, live, eat, meet other entrepreneurs.\n\nstation f is privately financed by french telecom billionaire xavier niel, who invested about $300 million to acquire and renovate the train depot. microsoft and facebook are just a few of the multinational corporations sponsoring incubators here.\n\nbriton tom pullen is one of station f's 3,000 entrepreneurs. he says paris is booming these days.\n\ni think within europe at the moment it's the place to be, pullen says. look at the amount of investment that's been raised over the last year, which has hit record levels. look at the level of confidence for startups in france at the moment. i think what you see is a real wave of positivity, of optimism.\n\npullen says even a few years ago he would've never imagined london in such difficulty, with paris enjoying a business renaissance.\n\neurope brexit puts london's finance jobs at risk brexit puts london's finance jobs at risk listen · 4:53 4:53\n\nacross town, christian noyer describes how his job has gotten a lot easier since macron was elected last year.\n\nnoyer was once head of the banque de france and vice president of the european central bank. right after the u.k.'s 2016 brexit vote to leave the european union, the french government under then-president francois hollande put noyer in charge of convincing multinationals that were planning to leave london to relocate their operations to paris. the competition includes cities like dublin, frankfurt and luxembourg.\n\nat the beginning they were afraid to come to paris, noyer says. because of perceptions about a rigid labor market and an uncertain tax system. or they were saying, 'we'll increase a little bit, but we don't want to take the risk to make the hub (in paris).' now that's changing.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption eleanor beardsley/npr eleanor beardsley/npr\n\nnoyer credits the election of macron with much of the change. the french president is quickly following through on his promise to transform the country. he's overhauled notoriously rigid french labor laws, making it easier to hire and fire. and his government is preparing a raft of pro-business measures. noyer says today france has the highest labor flexibility in continental europe, and paris is now an obvious destination.\n\nit's the only big, comprehensive city where you find all sorts of activities — like in london, he says. good international schools, plenty of housing and adequate office space. and paris is the only place apart from london where you have the whole financial ecosystem — the banks, the insurance, the asset management, the fintech. there is no other place where you find that.\n\nwith its already-huge pool of talent, noyer says, paris is also able to attract the kind of young, talented workers that smaller or regional cities just can't.\n\nstation f is working to facilitate life for its young entrepreneurs. in answer to france's infamous business red tape, the hub has brought dozens of public administrations in-house.\n\nif you need to deal with taxes or visas, everything is here, vanier says.\n\nstation f, which is nonprofit, is also trying to give a boost to entrepreneurs from underprivileged backgrounds. it is launching a program called the fighters, which will provide a free incubator and home to those chosen. vanier says there were 2,500 applications from entrepreneurs in 50 different countries.\n\nkaren ko has raised about $1.2 million in france for her senior-care startup. but she says being in paris is about more than business.\n\ni actually spent 13 years of my life working in new york city before deciding i needed a change in lifestyle and came to france, ko says. and no regret whatsoever in doing that! from a quality of life standpoint, it is huge.\n\nko says there is a work-life balance in france that keeps entrepreneurs from burning out.\n\nbanker noyer says the appeal of paris might best be summed up in a recent tweet by goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein, who lauded the commitment of strong government and business leaders to economic reform and wrote: struck by the positive energy here in paris. ... and the food's good too!

columbine survivor on florida school shooting\n\nsamantha haviland was a student at columbine high school during the shooting in 1999. she's now director of counseling support services for denver public schools. she talks to npr's scott simon.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nthe man accused of opening fire on a school in parkland, fla., killing 17 people, was 19 years old. he'd been expelled from marjory stoneman douglas high school last year for disciplinary issues. and it's been reported widely this week that some of his classmates and teachers could see that he was a troubled young man - even the fbi was alerted. the chief public defender in broward county said every red flag was there. so why were so many signs ignored? what may have gone so monstrously wrong? samantha haviland was a student and a peer counselor at columbine high school in 1999 when two of her classmates killed 12 students and one teacher. ms. haviland is now the director of counseling support services for the denver public schools. and she joins us. ms. haviland, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nsamantha haviland: oh, thank you for having me.\n\nsimon: and i have to - forgive me - begin by asking, weeks like this bring memories back?\n\nhaviland: weeks like this remind me of why a community is so important - that you are responsible for each other as a whole community.\n\nsimon: would you give any advice to counselors who have seen troubled students - students who they think might create trouble - as to what they should do?\n\nhaviland: absolutely. you want to talk with parents. you want to make it a part of the conversation. you want to talk with administrators and make sure that the school environment is safe and always possible. you want to make sure that you've created a community among the students where the students - when they see something, they will tell you.\n\nsimon: do the schools in denver have live fire lockdown drills?\n\nhaviland: oh, yes. on friday morning, i was involved in a lockout drill at one of my high schools as i was sitting in a counseling office, talking with a student.\n\nsimon: and i guess as a parent, i have learned to be grateful that these drills are held. but i wonder if there are some students who aren't panicked by the drills in and of themselves.\n\nhaviland: it can be a very scary experience. it's a reality now that our students in our schools are preparing for. so when we do a drill, we don't tell our students they are drills because we need them to take everything seriously. and we want to normalize and help them feel calm during those things. and i've also wondered, what is the impact of doing these drills for our students?\n\nsimon: well, you're a gifted counselor. what do you think it might be?\n\nhaviland: i think it's triggering our students who have already experienced trauma and secondary trauma, and they've seen things. and we've seen students go through all kinds of emotional reactions during drills - panic and sadness and grief and fear because during those drills, you really don't know what's happening.\n\nsimon: given your history, given what you do now, given how close you come to some of these terrible issues, issues that are often too terrible to contemplate - if there are any one, two or three things you can change or say need to be done right now, what would they be?\n\nhaviland: i think our schools are doing everything they possibly can to make the environment safe. and i think one of the things that needs to change is it is not a conversation just for our schools anymore. what's happening is our world and our society are now entering our schools. and so we need to address our world and our society.\n\nsimon: samantha haviland, director of counseling support services for the denver public schools, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nhaviland: thank you.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

fidget spinners, pacing, note-taking: staying awake in the senate chamber\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption dana verkouteren/ap dana verkouteren/ap\n\naround dinnertime on tuesday, just about four hours into the impeachment trial of president trump, sen. jim risch, r-idaho, did not look enthralled by house democrats' presentations. in fact, he looked the opposite. eyes closed, he was slumped over and appeared to be snoozing.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., and sen. kirsten gillibrand, d-n.y., reportedly also dozed off briefly before jolting back awake.\n\nthe sleepy interludes demonstrate a struggle many senators are fighting during the trial's marathon sessions: resisting the urge to nod off as the tiring days test stamina and patience.\n\nit's constitutionally difficult for senators to be quiet and sit that long. it's not how we're built, sen. john cornyn, r-texas, told reporters on thursday.\n\nunder the trial's strict rules, the elected body must be engaged from the sessions start to finish with arguments revolving around accusations the trump held up military aid and put off a meeting with the president of ukraine in an effort to try to get an investigation into political rival former vice president joe biden and his son.\n\nevery day, the senate's sergeant-at-arms kicks off the session with a decorous reminder of the hush-hush guidelines, noting how violators could face a stiff penalty.\n\nhear ye! hear ye! hear ye! all persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, the sergeant-at-arms declares.\n\nindeed, they are not supposed to talk to one another. senators are also not allowed to pass notes. snacks are banned (but water and milk is ok). cellphones and other devices are to be stored in a cubby outside of the chamber. senators must attend the long trial sessions six days a week. and the whole time, coffee is not permitted into the chamber, a point creating stress from some senators.\n\ni drink coffee from the minute i wake up until bedtime, sen. kevin cramer, r-n.d., told the wall street journal. so my biggest challenge is to drink enough coffee to stay awake, but not drink so much that i, you know, that i'm, ah, uncomfortable in the chamber.\n\nundercaffeinated senators are devising creative ways to pass the time.\n\non thursday, sen. richard burr, r-n.c., provided weary senators with colorful fidget spinners, a handheld toy for restless children.\n\nsen. marsha blackburn, r-tenn., was spotted reading a book.\n\nsen. lindsey graham of south carolina wrote large notes on his notebook and then tilted them up toward his senate colleague, sen. john barrasso, r-wyo.\n\nsen. bernie sanders, i-vt., let out a big yawn.\n\nother senators needing to stretch their legs or craving a break, whether mental or otherwise, strolled to the cloakroom for brief respite.\n\nsen. cory booker, d-n.j., told the washington post that pacing in the back of the chamber helps him stay mentally stimulated and that he hoped the house managers do not take offense to his frenetic habit.\n\nit actually helps me think and stay focused, frankly, on what's going on, booker said.\n\nsenators voted on tuesday to allow the 24 hours of opening arguments to be spread over three days instead of two, but the sessions were still managing to test fortitude and patience, especially because, for most senators, the arguments are not likely to change their position.\n\na nearly party-line vote on the two articles of impeachment is expected, meaning the replay of arguments and testimony from the house impeachment inquiry is not likely to budge any opinions.\n\nthe subject matter is something we've all heard, sen. mike braun, r-ind., said to reporters.\n\nafter a nearly nine-hour day on wednesday, rep. adam schiff, d-calif., the lead house impeachment manager, acknowledged that staying engaged during the long days is no easy feat. presenting hours upon hours of arguments, he said, is also tiring.\n\nit was an exhausting day for us, certainly. but we have adrenaline going through our veins. and for those that are required to sit and listen, it is a much more difficult task, schiff said.\n\nit is made even more uncomfortable, cornyn said thursday, when the chamber's chairs are less than ergonomic.\n\nthey're not particularly built for comfort, i will tell you that, cornyn said. i keep sort of sliding out of it.\n\nnpr's brakkton booker, lexie schapitl and kelsey snell contributed to this report.
s.c. hands democrats a challenge: the strong job market\n\nthe most recent democratic debate started out with a question for sen. bernie sanders, but it was a question any democratic nominee would have to think about.\n\nwe haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. here in south carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower, said cbs moderator norah o'donnell. how will you convince voters that a democratic socialist can do better than president trump with the economy?\n\nnot all of the candidates call themselves democratic socialists, of course. but donald trump is running for reelection amid a strong economy — unemployment is low and consumer confidence has been high.\n\nread and hear the original story from npr's weekend edition.\n\nand the conventional wisdom is that a strong economy helps buoy incumbent presidents to reelection — for decades, election prediction models have factored in economic indicators like unemployment and gdp growth. (trump knows this, and he often trumpets it at his rallies and on twitter.)\n\nand the recently-strong economy is a particularly appropriate topic in south carolina, which is tied with two other states for the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, at 2.3%. and two of the other three early states, new hampshire and iowa, are also among the 10 states with the lowest unemployment. that has made these early states a test for democrats of their economic messages amid a good job market in particular.\n\nmaking the case for big changes\n\nsanders responded to that first debate question with the economic pitch that has been his standby for years now: the american economy has fundamental problems, chief among them inequality.\n\nyou're right. the economy is doing really great for people like mr. bloomberg and other billionaires, he said. but you know what, for the ordinary american, things are not so good.\n\neconomist jared bernstein says there is something to the idea that there are still underlying economic problems. he served as chief economist to former vice president joe biden but has not publicly endorsed a candidate.\n\nthere are far more families than you would think — given an unemployment rate that's at a 50-year low — that have tremendous difficulties making ends meet on what they earn, he said. these arguments about the gap between earnings and needs, i think, provide a real opening for democrats.\n\nand there is some evidence for this: workers are not sharing in growth nearly as much as they used to — more of that new income has gone to shareholders, for example.\n\ncandidates also often bring up the tens of millions of uninsured americans on the campaign trail, or the fact that some americans need to work multiple jobs to make ends meet, or a desire to raise workers' wages. indeed, in south carolina, an abundance of jobs exists alongside one of the lowest state median incomes in the nation.\n\none question then for voters is how squeezed they feel. attending an orangeburg county democrats meeting, kenneth mccaster said he isn't worried about his own economic well-being.\n\nsome of us, you know, like i would say for me, you know, i work three or four jobs, he said. so, you know, the economy is fine for me. but there's some other people that are actually suffering because of the economy.\n\ntalking about changing the economy structurally, as more-progressive candidates in particular often highlight, can also mean talking about persistent racial inequities. businessman tom steyer highlighted this at this week's debate.\n\nevery single policy area in the united states has a gigantic subtext of race, he said. we're talking about education. we're talking about criminal justice. we're talking about housing. we're talking about loans.\n\nit's not just policy that wins voters over, though; it's also old-fashioned retail politicking and showing voters you feel their pain.\n\nthat is why lawyer shireen carter said she likes elizabeth warren. she went to a warren event just ahead of the iowa caucuses, clutching a printout of her student loan information.\n\ncarter read the total aloud: two-hundred-and-eighty-thousand dollars, seventy-four dollars and fifty-eight cents.\n\ni printed it out just to show her today, she said. and i think that it matters to her. i think that she'll feel that for me — that it's a burden.\n\nit's possible that, for some voters, a strong economy provides an opening to tackle large-scale, underlying economic problems that progressives like warren and sanders talk about.\n\nyou can kind of see the structure and see the opportunity instead of drowning in your situation, said jessica bright, south carolina state director for sanders. so definitely the time is right to change structurally, change the systems that we're going up against.\n\nfor more moderate candidates, talking about big topics like inequality can also open the door to conversations that might appeal more to centrists. at a town hall ahead of the iowa caucuses, joe biden used the trump tax cuts to talk about fiscal responsibility.\n\nhow many of you really got boosted by that great tax cut? well, good for you, he said. but by and large, most people didn't do all that well by the tax cut. but it did increase this gigantic deficit.\n\nthe reality: the economy has been pretty strong\n\nall of this said, it remains true that some democratic voters simply know that the economy has been running along at a steady clip.\n\nthat doesn't mean they give trump credit, though. joyce delk, who knocked doors for biden in south carolina last week, gives him some credit for today's economy.\n\ni don't care what trump says now that the economy is doing well, but the economy is still rolling off president obama and joe biden — what they did when they were in office, she said.\n\ngiven that, some democrats are hesitant to nominate a self-proclaimed socialist who wants to overhaul entire segments of the economy. and they worry that that kind of a message would, at best, fall flat with general-election voters.\n\nit's also possible that the u.s. is now in a sort of post-economic election era. that's what political analyst charlie cook said at a washington economic conference this week.\n\nright now, the economy is not driving american politics, he said. you don't have unemployment at a 50-year low while at the same time you've got a president who has never ever had a 50% job approval rating in any credible national poll.\n\nwhatever is motivating voters, though, the economy for now underpins trump's reelection message. if the coronavirus (and fears about it) further rattle the u.s. economy, however, it could mean an entirely new backdrop for november's election.
parkland students return to school skeptical of clear backpacks\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption sun sentinel/tns via getty images sun sentinel/tns via getty images\n\nmarjory stoneman douglas high students returned to school from spring break this week facing a number of new safety precautions. district officials in parkland, fla., say that the school is a prototype for potential countywide security changes, following a shooting on feb. 14 that left 17 people dead.\n\namong the precautions are fewer entrances, with law enforcement posted at each point; identification badges that students and teachers are required to wear at all times; and clear, plastic backpacks the only bookbags allowed on campus.\n\nschool principal ty thompson sent a memo to parents about the precautions over the weekend, according to the associated press, comparing the process with entering a sporting event, or disney world.\n\nas a first step, we are looking to see if we can get the kids through these entrances in a timely manner. ... it is very difficult to balance both convenience/privacy with safety/security; if there is more of one, the other often suffers, but i will do my best to balance the two.\n\nmany stoneman douglas students took issue with the clear backpacks they're required to carry. the bags were donated to the school by walmart and the broward education foundation, the sun-sentinel newspaper reported.\n\ncarly novell, the school's newspaper editor, wrote on twitter: do you want me to take my shoes off when i walk into school as well?\n\nsome students also complained about the smell of the plastic backpacks. student kyrah simon tweeted that the backpacks were a waste of community resources:\n\nanother student posted a photo of his pack full of tampons:\n\nsophomore lauren hogg asked on twitter, is this what my high school experience is going to be like? 3 more years of this...\n\nan instagram account was also created dedicated to students angry over the backpacks.\n\nmany students from stoneman douglas have deftly harnessed social media to criticize and call for change in u.s. gun policy since the massacre, using it to organize the march for our lives, where hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in support of legislation restricting access to guns.\n\nin florida, gov. rick scott signed legislation raising the minimum age of all gun purchasers to 21 and banning rapid-fire devices known as bump stocks. the reforms also included fresh funding for school security, including at least one school resource officer in all schools.\n\nsheri kuperman, who has three children attending stoneman douglas high, tells the sun-sentinel she doesn't mind the new measures.\n\nwe go through metal detectors when we go the airport. ... i don't know if it's going to stop anything or not.\n\nmetal detectors and metal detecting wands are not currently in place on campus, but their use is being considered.\n\nanother parent, julie shinn, is less convinced and criticized the move as falling short. if we're not going to do anything about our lax gun laws, she writes on twitter, then my son needs a bullet proof backpack, not a clear one.

we're joined now by howard bryant of espn.com and espn the magazine. howard, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nhoward bryant, byline: hey, scott, good morning.\n\nsimon: morning. and, you know, before we go to the playoffs, i know you've talked - been talking about this all week, but i want to ask you about what happened at fenway park. monday, adam jones with the baltimore orioles heard racial taunts from a fan, bag of peanuts was thrown toward him.\n\nthen there were reports, i believe, on wednesday night of racial taunts directed at a woman who sang the national anthem. it's boston. there is history there. have the red sox done the right thing in response?\n\nbryant: you know, well, it's an old story with a new chapter, scott. and this is something that boston has - the fans and the organization obviously over the several decades, they've earned it. it's not hyperbole. the red sox, as we all know, have had incredible racial problems from going back to - from 1945 up to the present. and i think that equally old with a new chapter is the response from a lot of the fans and a lot of the talking heads in the media responding to this by saying, well, you know, this is just a few bad apples. and why do we all get lumped into this? well, because it's been happening for so long. and also to the players who play for the red sox.\n\nyou had david price, the pitcher who signed a $217 million contract earlier this january, saying that he was subjected to racial taunts from the home fans. and so when i heard all of this, i wasn't surprised. i think the good news in all of this is that the red sox finally after all of these years are starting to take this seriously.\n\nthey've decided to maybe even ban some of the people they've ejected for life as a way of finally saying, listen, this is not what we want to be. and that's not going to change until the red sox decide that, hey, we don't want this in our ballpark. and they're the ones - and i think the fans - if the fans don't want this, and if the red sox don't want this, then maybe it's time for them to join up and make it clear that this is not how they want to be represented.\n\nsimon: let's stay in boston for a moment to talk about the nba playoffs. the celtics lead the washington wizards 2 games to 1. the technical fouls are flying. isaiah thomas of the celtics says, quote, we don't like them, and they don't like us, that's just what it is. howard, why can't they get along?\n\nbryant: well, it is my favorite cliche - these two teams don't like each other. and here it actually does - it actually does fit. and part of the reason is is because you've got isaiah thomas who's the great 5-foot-9 - if that - point guard. i was out with charles barkley the other day who said he's not 5'9. and so i said...\n\nsimon: i'm sorry, you were out with charles barkley the other day? i can't let that pass. that's just, i mean, you hang together?\n\nbryant: oh, that's what i do for a living, scott.\n\nsimon: what?\n\nbryant: oh, yeah, we were hanging together. no, i was in the green room at the colbert show with him doing a story. it's nothing.\n\nsimon: all right.\n\nbryant: so anyway, but they're laughing about the fact that you've got him. and you've got this amazing point guard for washington, john wall. and they're going at each other. and it's good old playoff basketball, where some of these, you know, these teams, they battle with each other, and they fight. and then actually in this game, they're actually fighting.\n\nso it's very strange to not have, after all these months and all these years playing for a championship, to not have some bad blood. and these two guys - these - both these two players are fantastic, but these two teams really - they are not friends.\n\nsimon: you know what charles barkley said to me the other day?\n\nbryant: no, i don't.\n\nsimon: nothing. i've never met him.\n\nbryant: (laughter).\n\nsimon: but let me talk about the battle of the great lakes briefly, lebron and the cavaliers against the toronto raptors. the cavs seem to be getting back at the raptors for the war of 1812. there was concern they were in decline. what's happened?\n\nbryant: and remember how they did, they started the season very poorly. and once again, lebron james has proven he's just as good as we've ever seen. and when i watch him, i just realize that maybe, just maybe these comparisons to michael jordan aren't so crazy after all when it's all said and done.\n\nsimon: you know, even i will say that. and i'm going to add what all the little kids growing up on the skid say - cleveland rocks, cleveland rocks.\n\nbryant: (laughter).\n\nsimon: howard bryant of espn.com and espn the magazine. thanks so much for being with us, howard.\n\nbryant: thank you.\n\n(soundbite of the smiths song, the headmaster ritual)\n\nsimon: you're listening to weekend edition from npr news.\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
