5 things to watch as gop health bill moves to the senate\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption eric thayer/getty images eric thayer/getty images\n\nafter weeks of will-they-or-won't-they tensions, the house managed to pass its gop replacement for the affordable care act on thursday by a razor-thin margin. the vote was 217-213.\n\ndemocrats who lost the battle are still convinced they may win the political war. as the republicans reached a majority for the bill, democrats on the house floor began chanting, na, na, na, na ... hey, hey, hey ... goodbye. they say republicans could lose their seats for supporting a bill that could cause so much disruption in voters' health care.\n\nnow the bill — and the multitude of questions surrounding it — moves across the capitol to the senate. and the job doesn't get any easier. with only a two-vote republican majority and likely no democratic support, it would take only three gop no votes to sink the bill.\n\ndemocrats have made clear they will unanimously oppose the bill. trumpcare is just a breathtakingly irresponsible piece of legislation that would endanger the health of tens of millions of americans and break the bank for millions more, said senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y.\n\nit's the senate's turn house passage of the american health care act is just a first step. as this measure moves to the senate, it will face a new set of political and policy challenges. among them: medicaid: the house-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions.\n\nthe house-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions. uninsured rates: the congressional budget office initially estimated that the house bill would mean the loss of coverage for 24 million people. many analysts say this number is now likely higher.\n\nthe congressional budget office initially estimated that the house bill would mean the loss of coverage for 24 million people. many analysts say this number is now likely higher. tax credits: some gop senators are already on record opposing the bill's age-based tax credits, charging that they will make coverage unaffordable for older constituents. others, however, describe these credits as obamacare lite.\n\nsome gop senators are already on record opposing the bill's age-based tax credits, charging that they will make coverage unaffordable for older constituents. others, however, describe these credits as obamacare lite. planned parenthood funding: the house would defund this reproductive health organization for a year — a step that draws opposition from a handful of senate republicans.\n\nand republicans in the senate have their own internal disagreements, too.\n\nhere are five of the biggest flashpoints that could make trouble for the bill in the senate.\n\nmedicaid\n\nhouse leaders correctly point out that their bill represents the biggest changes to the federal-state health program for the poor since its inception in 1965 — a point that appeared to be drowned out during the most recent house debate that focused on coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions.\n\nfor the first time, federal funding for low-income people on medicaid would be limited, resulting in what house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., described at an event sponsored by the conservative national review as sending it back to the states, capping its growth rates. it's a longtime goal for many conservatives. we've been dreaming of this since i've been around, ryan said.\n\nbut it is not a consensus position in the party. some moderates support the current program, especially for children and people with disabilities. in addition, many gop governors took the federal government's offer in the aca of near-complete federal funding to expand medicaid to nondisabled, working-age adults, and they are worried about the impact on their residents and their budgets if the expansion goes away and the program's funding is restricted.\n\nthe house bill, wrote the republican governors of ohio, michigan, arkansas and nevada in a letter to house and senate leaders, provides almost no new flexibility for states, does not ensure the resources necessary to make sure no one is left out, and shifts significant new costs to states.\n\nthat pushback has also created doubts in the minds of some gop senators. rob portman, r-ohio; bill cassidy, r-la.; and shelley moore capito, r-w.va., are among those who have expressed concerns about the house bill, as has dean heller, r-nev., it's not clear whether any of the house changes have satisfied those senators.\n\nincrease in number of uninsured people\n\nthe congressional budget office's initial estimate that the bill could lead to 24 million more americans without health insurance within a decade spooked many senate lawmakers. you can't sugarcoat it, cassidy told fox news when explaining that it's an awful score. the final house bill passed without the score being updated, although most outside analysts said the changes were likely to increase the number who would lose insurance.\n\nand democrats have been using those initial numbers to score rhetorical points, even if they lack the votes in either the house or the senate to stop the bill or change it.\n\nthe cbo's estimate makes clear that trumpcare will cause serious harm to millions of american families, said schumer. tens of millions will lose their coverage, and millions more, particularly seniors, will have to pay more for health care.\n\ntax credits\n\non one hand, even with the additional $85 billion added by house leaders to help older people pay for their insurance premiums, many moderates feel the age-based tax credits in the bill replacing those in the affordable care act are too small, particularly for people in their 50s and early 60s. the cbo estimated that under the original version of the house bill, premiums for a 64-year-old with an income of $26,000 a year could rise from $1,700 currently to more than $14,000.\n\nthat brought a strong rebuke from the powerful aarp, which was an outspoken aca supporter. although no one believes the current health care system is perfect, this harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable, said a statement from the group.\n\nsen. susan collins, r-maine, has said she could not support the house bill in its original form because of concerns about the effects on older constituents.\n\non the other hand, some conservatives in the senate are ideologically opposed to offering any tax credits. ted cruz, r-texas; mike lee, r-utah; and rand paul, r-ky., have all expressed concerns about the bill being too much like the aca, with paul referring to it as obamacare lite. they worry that the tax credits amount to a new entitlement.\n\nfor me, it's a big stumbling block still that there's taxpayer money that's being given to insurance companies, paul told reporters in late april. and i'm just not in favor of taxpayer money going to insurance companies.\n\nplanned parenthood\n\nas republicans have been vowing for years, the house-passed bill would defund planned parenthood, although only for a year. that's likely because a permanent defunding would actually cost the federal government more money, according to the cbo, as some women who lose access to birth control would become pregnant, have babies and qualify for medicaid. birth control is vastly cheaper than health care for mothers and babies.\n\nbut while cutting funding for planned parenthood is overwhelmingly popular in the house, there are a handful of gop senators, including collins and lisa murkowski, r-alaska, who have said they are likely to oppose a bill carrying this provision.\n\nprocedural problems\n\nthe budget process republicans are using to avoid a democratic filibuster in the senate, called reconciliation, has very strict rules that require every piece of the bill to be directly related to the federal budget. it will be up to the senate parliamentarian, a republican appointee, to make those determinations.\n\nthat's why the bill does not wipe away all the aca's private insurance regulations, including the requirement that insurers not discriminate against customers who have pre-existing health conditions.\n\nsome analysts have suggested that the house amendment sought by conservatives to allow states to waive some of the health law's regulations might run afoul of the senate's byrd rule, which limits what can be included in a budget reconciliation measure.\n\nit could be argued that any budgetary effects of the waiver are 'merely incidental,'  said the committee for a responsible federal budget in a blog post.\n\neven rep. mark meadows, r-n.c., who negotiated that amendment that won the backing of conservatives, conceded that it could prove problematic in the senate. there's still a lot of work that needs to be done before we can celebrate and all go home, he said in an interview outside the house chamber.\n\ndemocrats say it is one of several provisions in the house bill that might not pass parliamentary muster in the senate.\n\nfor example, analysts have suggested that the gop replacement for the much disliked individual mandate requiring most people to have insurance or pay a fine might not pass byrd rule scrutiny either. that's because the 30 percent premium penalty that people with a lapse in insurance would have to pay under the bill would go to the insurance company, not the federal government, so it would have no budget impact.\n\na third potentially problematic element of the original house bill would allow insurers to charge older adults five times more in premiums than younger adults — up from a ratio of 3 to 1 under the affordable care act. that provision could be viewed as not directly affecting federal spending, some analysts predict.\n\nkaiser health news is a national health policy news service. it is an editorially independent program of the henry j. kaiser family foundation.
dr. martens footwear brand is planning london ipo\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption gareth cattermole/getty images gareth cattermole/getty images\n\nthe owner of dr. martens, the famed british footwear brand, is planning an initial public offering on the london stock exchange, according to a filing on monday.\n\nprivate equity owner permira is expected to sell at least 25% of the business. the brand, which evolved into a symbol of rebellious youth culture, has continued to thrive during the coronavirus pandemic. dr. martens sells more than 11 million pairs a year in more than 60 countries.\n\nthe boot, which became a counterculture style icon in the 1960s, was created in 1945 by a former german soldier, dr. klaus maertens. according to the company's official history, he designed a prototype with an air-cushioned sole to help his broken foot heal. larger-scale production began two years later, and, because of its comfort, the company says, the shoe was initially popular with older women.\n\nin 1960, england's griggs family, who were shoe manufacturers, bought exclusive licensing rights to the boot and began selling it to mail carriers and factory workers.\n\nthe image of the workaday boot began to change when skinheads decided to sport them in the 1960s. soon after, the who's pete townshend began wearing them to emphasize his own working-class pride — and the doc marten was on its way to becoming a cultural symbol.\n\nin the ensuing decades, various youth tribes embraced the boot, including punks and early goths as well as schoolgirls, american grunge musicians and celebrities including drew barrymore, miley cyrus and gigi hadid.\n\nin the early 2000s, however, sales declined so much the company had to close factories to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nin 2014, permira bought the brand for about $400 million. sales have surged from $220 million that year to more than $900 million in the year ending march 2020.\n\nthere have been some concerns about quality. in britain's guardian newspaper, some readers complained in 2019 about soles and stitching coming off, and suggested the problems were the result of offshoring manufacturing to china. but permira insists quality standards have not changed since the original owner, r. griggs group, moved production of the boot from england to china more than a decade and a half ago.
how to caucus with a baby\n\nrenee montagne, host:\n\nahead of the iowa caucuses this week, lyz lenz, a staff writer for the cedar rapids gazette, posed to readers this question. how do you caucus with a baby? she says parents want to caucus and participate in the frenetic atmosphere of rallies and politicking. but it's just not that easy with a child in tow. lyz lenz joins us from cedar rapids. welcome.\n\nlyz lenz: thank you for having me.\n\nmontagne: and tell us about what got you thinking about this question.\n\nlenz: well, i am a mom. i have an 8-year-old and a 6-year-old. and i've tried to caucus with babies. i tried to caucus with babies in 2016, and it was really, really hard. and so this time around, in 2020, with all the new caucus rules, i wanted to know how women were making it work. it's also a year, you know, where we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th amendment. and we have - we've had, you know, so many female candidates running for the democratic nomination. so i wanted to know how women were making it work.\n\nmontagne: you do declare in your column that iowa's mothers are - even after the 19th amendment, women got the vote but are still disenfranchised from caucusing. but, you know, let me just push you on this little. i know how hard it is. but considering that this caucus date is famous throughout the land, doesn't a mother or both parents have time to kind of save up and get a babysitter for that one important date?\n\nlenz: you know (laughter), you say that, but anybody with small children knows how hard it is to plan, how unpredictable it is. you know, some children are high needs. even in 2020, two-thirds of women are still the primary caretakers of their children. and it puts an additional burden on women, people with families to pay to play. and i think that's essentially, you know, what is at the heart of this - is that, at its nature, a caucus is a self-limiting process.\n\nmontagne: well, you know, i did scroll through a bunch of the tweets that responded to this. and there were - a lot of them were different. some telling their story, like, you...\n\nlenz: yeah.\n\nmontagne: ...just were talking about. but there's - some of those answers to how to caucus with a baby is cut out caucuses and give us a chance just to go to a ballot box for a minute and put in my ballot. i was a little surprised. like, change the system.\n\nlenz: well, that's the conversation that we're having nationally - that people are really coming to terms with how limiting this caucus is, how inaccessible it is for older americans, americans with children, americans with disabilities, americans who work multiple jobs who can't get time off. and so a lot of iowans are saying, why can't we just have a primary? but the answer to that is new hampshire. they would not be happy if we moved from our first-in-the-nation caucuses to a first-in-the-nation primary, which they are. so it's a small, local issue. but it also is reflective of the issues facing the democratic party nationwide.\n\nmontagne: so given all of this, what about you? are you going to be able to caucus yourself even though you're, you know, a columnist for a newspaper? i mean, what's going on?\n\nlenz: yeah. so because i am an opinion columnist, i am allowed to caucus. and i will be going to caucus. i do have two small children. but i'm also divorced. we have 50/50 custody. and my partner is a republican, and they have a very polite primary. so he will be taking the kids for the night. and i'll be caucusing and then working all night. so it works out for us. but i would like it to work out for every woman in america.\n\nmontagne: that was lyz lenz of the cedar rapids gazette in iowa. thanks for joining us.\n\nlenz: thank you so much for having me.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
(soundbite of song, sugartooth)\n\nbrandi carlile: (singing) he wasn't really known for breaking the rules when he arrived in the second year of my high school. he wasn't so...\n\nmary louise kelly, host:\n\nthe singer brandi carlile has a big voice. and at age 36, she has already enjoyed a big career. she's topped folk charts, earned grammy nominations, smashed nashville stereotypes. now carlile has other things on her mind.\n\ncarlile: (reading) whoever's reading this, your parents will die. you may have been hurt or loved by them - probably both. but can you forgive them for leaving in the end?\n\nkelly: that passage is from the liner notes of brandi carlile's new album, which is called, appropriately, by the way, i forgive you. and she joins me now from our new york bureau. welcome.\n\ncarlile: thank you very much for having me. wow, what an honor.\n\nkelly: it's a pleasure to have you. let me start with that topic of forgiveness. it's such a big thing to tackle. what made you decide to take it on?\n\ncarlile: well, it kind of appeared out of my record and my writing process like a sculpture would appear when you take the pieces of stone away that don't belong. it's really radical and ugly, difficult process that comes - great beauty comes from it.\n\nkelly: and you write about it specifically in regard to your parents in one of the songs on here. this is the song most of all.\n\n(soundbite of song, most of all)\n\ncarlile: (singing) i haven't seen my father in some time, but his face is always staring back at me. his heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms, and my colors change like the sea.\n\ni watched both my parents lose their mothers last year, and it was really interesting because throughout the process of growing up - my parents had me when they were real young, and i listened to all of their grievances and gripes about their mamas. and as soon as those women were gone, it was like all memory of any of that was immediately - had just evaporated. there are people that could criticize the way that we react towards our loved ones when they're gone and say that we make them inhuman or perfect, but then there is, you know, the argument to be made that suddenly we see things for real for the first time.\n\nkelly: or you let yourself forget, which is a line i loved in this song where you're writing about, you know, maybe forgetting is the first step to forgiving.\n\ncarlile: yeah, maybe.\n\n(soundbite of song, most of all)\n\ncarlile: (singing) but most of all, he taught me to forgive, how to keep a cool head, how to love the one you're with and, when i'm far into the distance and the pushing comes to shove, to remember what comes back when you give away your love. give away your love.\n\nkelly: you write about the process of becoming a mother and how that changed you. it's another song called the mother on here. let me - i wonder if we can hear a little bit of that.\n\n(soundbite of song, the mother)\n\ncarlile: (singing) welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind. you're tethered to another, and you're worried all the time. you always know the melody, but you never heard it rhyme.\n\nkelly: that very first line there, welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind...\n\ncarlile: (laughter) it's so true, man. curse it.\n\nkelly: why, 'cause she's always in there with you, your daughter?\n\ncarlile: yeah. it was actually - a really interesting woman called trina shoemaker, a good friend of mine, really mystical, crazy person - she told me when the baby was born 'cause i finished that record, like, 72 hours before the birth of evangeline, and...\n\nkelly: oh, my goodness, yeah.\n\ncarlile: yeah. and she said to me - she goes, welcome to the end of being alone inside your mind. you'll never be alone in there again. there'll never be a day where you don't wake up wondering what evangeline needs - not when she's 50. and boy is that the truth.\n\nkelly: it is. how old is evangeline now?\n\ncarlile: she's going to be 4.\n\nkelly: what's her reaction to that song when you play it for her?\n\ncarlile: she knows it's about her. she loves it. but any of the bad stuff she doesn't associate to her. she asks me things like, mama, who was the lady in the song that trashed your car?\n\nkelly: (laughter).\n\ncarlile: i'm like, you are the lady in the song that trashed my damn car.\n\n(laughter)\n\nkelly: who's thrown cheerios into every receptacle of my life.\n\ncarlile: oh, yes, just somehow you're just sticky. i don't know why.\n\nkelly: (laughter).\n\n(soundbite of song, the mother)\n\ncarlile: (singing) they can keep their treasure and their ties to the machine 'cause i am the mother of evangeline.\n\nkelly: i want to ask you about a different story. you took to social media recently and asked people to share stories of people they forgive or wish they could forgive. and you told a story of your own about a pastor.\n\ncarlile: yeah, that's true.\n\nkelly: would you share it with us?\n\ncarlile: that whole campaign is - by the way, shook me to the core, seeing the people - things that people are forgiving people for. i stopped reading it when i got to one that - woman forgave someone that ran over her 7-year-old little girl. and the one that you're talking about, you know, is a specific hurt to only me. but i was young, and i was in a baptist church - a pretty good one. i had committed myself to baptism. and the pastor let me go through the process. you know, there's kind of a process prior to getting baptized where you have to do a lot commitments and...\n\nkelly: right. you have to meet with the pastor and...\n\ncarlile: yeah, and then you get, you know...\n\nkelly: ...do some bible study.\n\ncarlile: right, and then your family and your friends come, and they sit in the church. and they wait. and it's, like, after hours. it's not on a church day. and you get, you know, dunked in the water (laughter), which i was always nervous about. and i just remember walking to the church with my bathing suit on under my clothes and pastor tim telling me that he couldn't do it.\n\nkelly: that he couldn't do it why?\n\ncarlile: he couldn't do it because i was gay and because i wouldn't say that i wasn't going to change that or that i could change that. and...\n\nkelly: and how old were you?\n\ncarlile: fifteen.\n\nkelly: and he waited till you had your whole family and your friends and everybody there?\n\ncarlile: he did, yeah. he called me for days and days afterwards begging for my forgiveness and said that he just struggled with it for so long that he just ran out of time and that he thought he was going to do it right up until the time but that he just couldn't. and it took me a long time to forgive him. and it threatened my faith and my self-worth. so i was like, well, if i'm asking other people to do it, i'm going to do it (laughter). so i did it, and it feels weird, and it feels weird right now.\n\n(soundbite of song, hold out your hand)\n\ncarlile: (singing) i run a lot of miles of life and crime of mountain climbs and quitting times, packing that load of lying rhymes and tired jokes and wooden dimes. i've been everybody's friend, everybody's friend.\n\nkelly: i want to ask about the song hold out your hand. you write about all - you have a big, long note when you write about a lot of the songs on this album paragraph after paragraph. for the song hold out your hand, you have one sentence you write, and i'm going to quote it to you. you write, sometimes when the weight of the world feels too much, i want to dance with a redneck and shotgun a beer. and i have to say, i read that, and i wrote down in my own handwriting, hell yes.\n\n(soundbite of song, hold out your hand)\n\ncarlile: (singing) hold out your hand. take hold of mine now. round and round we go.\n\noh, yeah. i love people so much, you know? i love people that don't think the same way i think. and i do want to hold out my hand and be joined to other people that are different than me at the end of the day.\n\n(soundbite of song, hold out your hand)\n\ncarlile: (singing) the hand comes around, and the trumpet sounds. and his number calls. and the moment he falls in the haunted halls of man, he will understand. he will comprehend. he will not pretend. he will not pretend\n\nkelly: thank you so much, brandi.\n\ncarlile: thank you so much. what a great chat.\n\nkelly: that was the singer brandi carlile talking about her new album, which is titled by the way, i forgive you.\n\n(soundbite of song, hold out your hand)\n\ncarlile: (singing) ...as you can take. the devil don't take a break. that devil don't take a break. the devil don't take a break.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
congressional republicans lobby trump to back down on tariffs\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption evan vucci/ap evan vucci/ap\n\nupdated at 3:00 p.m. et\n\nfears of economic and political backlash are motivating senior congressional republicans to move forward this week with public and private lobbying efforts aimed at getting president trump to change his mind about tariffs he intends to levy on steel and aluminium imports.\n\nwe are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the white house to not advance with this plan, ashlee strong, a spokeswoman for house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., said in a statement. the new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don't want to jeopardize those gains.\n\npresident trump downplayed congressional gop concerns. i don't think you're going to have a trade war, he said monday at the white house, where he defended his decision to crack down on imports. people have to understand, our country on trade, has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world whether it's friend or enemy. everybody.\n\nthe president noted that his efforts to renegotiate nafta continue as well. we are renegotiating nafta as i said i would, and if we don't make a deal i will terminate nafta, he warned.\n\ncongress is not ruling out possible legislative action to counter trump's actions, although party leaders have no immediate plans to act if the president moves forward this week as stated with imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.\n\nways and means committee chairman kevin brady, r-texas, and the panel's trade subcommittee chairman, david reichert, r-wash., have also drafted a letter to the president outlining concerns about new tariffs. they are seeking additional signatures from house republicans. aides said lawmakers were hoping to avoid a confrontation with the administration and instead work with the president to enact trade policies the broader gop can get behind.\n\nas the two chairmen have reinforced, the administration and congress must work together on trade policies that build off the momentum of the president's tax cuts, which is why any tariffs should be narrow, targeted, and focused on addressing unfairly traded products, without disrupting the flow of fairly traded products for american businesses and consumers, lauren aronson, a spokeswoman for the ways and means committee, said in a statement.\n\nsenate finance chairman orrin hatch, r-utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the gop's tax cuts. should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, american manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books, hatch said in a weekend statement.\n\nthe white house showed no indication monday that the president was considering changing his mind. the president is resolute about this, and no one should be surprised either at that resoluteness or the fact that it's going to happen, said national trade council director peter navarro, a top trump aide who, along with commerce secretary wilbur ross, has been the strongest administration advocate for new tariffs.\n\nunderstand that all the rhetoric that's being generated about this is being generated by the lobbyists on k street and the politicians who are fundamentally opposed to what the president wants to do on behalf of the american worker and on behalf of the country, navarro said. this is a very well-informed decision.\n\ntrump's decision is the starkest break from traditional gop economic philosophy on trade since taking office. the president has found few gop allies on capitol hill, but rust belt democrats up for re-election this year cheered the administration's decision. this welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of chinese cheating, said sen. sherrod brown, d-ohio. likewise, sen. bob casey, d-pa., called trump's decision a welcome step.\n\nrepublicans were frustrated and taken by surprise by the timing of the president's announcement last week that steel and aluminum tariffs were imminent. republicans generally support a more targeted approach to pushing back on cheap foreign imports — a message they delivered directly to trump in several recent meetings. south dakota sen. john thune, one of the top republicans in the senate, was among those who were caught off guard last week when trump made the announcement.\n\ni don't know how to explain it because i've been in meetings with him on trade, thune told reporters. everybody's been very clear that we think some of the decisions that they're talking about making and policies they're talking about implementing would be very harmful to the economy at a time when it's really taking off.\n\nsen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., has argued that a blanket tariff fails to directly punish countries like china for dumping low-cost steel in the american market. graham said sunday that trump would let china off the hook while punishing u.s. companies that sell goods abroad by inviting retaliatory tariffs from other global trading partners. the reason our steel industry has been decimated is because of china dumping, graham said in an interview on cbs's face the nation. china produces more steel than the world consumes for several years in a row. china is your problem, mr. president.\n\ncongress technically has legislative options to counter trump's tariffs if he moves ahead with them despite opposition, but it would require a somewhat extraordinary move on the part of republicans to craft legislation cracking down on their own president in an election year. republicans would also likely need vetoproof majorities in both chambers to have any effect. and any legislative move would also upend orthodoxy on trade policy, which is generally enacted with the view that the president should be given latitude to manage international trade.
internet memes spread viral amusement\n\nfrom the moment a carnegie mellon researcher figured out that a colon and a parenthesis could make a face, the internet has provided its own unique additions to popular culture. lolcats, rickrolling and star wars kid are just a few examples of an entirely new form of culture that came into its own over the past decade: the internet meme.\n\ninternet memes are basically nonsensical inside jokes that spiral off through the web. for example, you might have been sent a link to see a video of, say, nancy pelosi's cats. and right in the middle, the whole video might change to a 1987 video of rick astley singing never gonna give you up. that's the classic online prank known as rickrolling –- tricking the user into watching something they didn't mean to see.\n\nthe emoticon, that sideways smiley — that's kind of the first internet meme, kenyatta cheese tells npr's guy raz. cheese is co-founder of knowyourmeme.com. he says internet memes got their start in the early '80s with online bulletin board systems.\n\npeople would meet and kind of talk about stuff and jokes would emerge that only made sense in the context of the bulletin board, cheese says.\n\nthese days the most successful memes tend to cluster around certain subjects. cute babies, cute pets and violence, cheese says.\n\ninternet memes is a new space that kind of occupies a place that television can't. that newspapers can't, he says. it requires people to go out and create the culture themselves. and, honestly, i have a lot more fun creating culture and spreading it as opposed to the just sitting back and watching tv.
'news of the world' filmmaker wanted to explore the 'healing power of storytelling'\n\nterry gross, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm terry gross. i just watched a new movie that both transported me away from this time of covid and insurrection, yet seemed relevant to both. it's set in texas in 1870, five years after the civil war has ended, when many texans are bitter about defeat and reluctant to rejoin the union, which would require agreeing to the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, which includes the abolition of slavery.\n\none of the first images we see in the film is of a black man hanging from a tree. white settlers are fighting native americans. everyone is hurting. the film is a western called news of the world. it stars tom hanks. my guest is the director, paul greengrass, who previously directed hanks in the film captain phillips.\n\nin news of the world, hanks plays a former confederate captain, jefferson kyle kidd, who fought in the texas infantry during the civil war and surrendered in 1865. the film is set five years later, when kidd is a lonely man with unspoken regrets, eking out a living, traveling from one small, poor texas town and muddy settlement to another, reading aloud the news from newspapers around the country as a form of information and entertainment to gatherings of people, charging 10 cents a person.\n\n(soundbite of film, news of the world)\n\ntom hanks: (as captain kidd) good evening, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nhanks: (as captain kidd) it's good to be back with you all here in wichita falls. my name is captain jefferson kyle kidd, and i'm here tonight to bring y'all the news from across this great world of ours. now, i know how life is in these parts, working your trade sunup to sundown, no time for reading newspapers. am i correct?\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nhanks: (as captain kidd) but we do that work for you. and maybe just for tonight we can escape our troubles and hear the great changes that are happening out there.\n\n(crosstalk)\n\nhanks: (as captain kidd) starting local, then - our own houston telegraph from the 1 of february, this news. the meningitis epidemic continues to spread without prejudice across the panhandle and north texas region. so far, it has claimed 97 souls in just a two-month period. in federal news, our own dallas herald...\n\ngross: the director of news of the world, paul greengrass, started his career as a journalist and documentary filmmaker. he went on to make films based on real events, including terrorist attacks. captain phillips was based on the american cargo ship hijacked by somali pirates in 2009. 22 july was about the terrorist attack in norway in 2011 by a far-right extremist. united 93 was about the airplane passengers who fought back against the hijackers on 9/11 and died, crashing near shanksville, pa. greengrass also directed three of the blockbuster jason bourne movies. news of the world is in theaters now and will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow.\n\npaul greengrass, welcome to fresh air. and thank you for making this new movie.\n\npaul greengrass: oh, my pleasure. good to be here.\n\ngross: so although this movie is set in 1870, it's feeling so current to me, like i said. you know, america still hasn't reckoned with the ongoing racism and racial injustice resulting from slavery, and we haven't fully recovered from the divisions of the civil war. i mean, one of the images of the insurrection is a man inside the capitol building holding a very large confederate flag on a long pole. and of course, one of the first things we see in your film is a black man hanging from a tree with a sign attached to him reading, texas says no, this is white man's country. did the movie feel current to you when you were making it?\n\ngreengrass: it did. i felt when i read the novel that it's based on - paulette jiles' wonderful novel news of the world - that there was something about texas in 1870 in the shadow of the civil war, america bitterly divided, uncertain where she wants to go, desperately searching for healing, but not being able to find it. and this character of the lonely newsreader, a character who'd lost everything in the civil war - all he has is a satchel with some old newspapers. and he wanders, as you say, from town to town, reading the news for anyone who wants to hear it.\n\nand in a way, i think what he has is the healing power of storytelling. you know, by telling these stories - the local news, the news of the meningitis epidemics, the federal news, news from far, far away - he draws his audience into a relationship with him. and, you know, i think that telling stories is a healing activity. it draws the storyteller and the audience together.\n\ngross: a central part of the plot is that the man who he sees hanging from a tree at the beginning of the movie, he was transporting a 10-year-old girl to her aunt and uncle. the girl had been kidnapped six years earlier, kidnapped and raised by kiowa indians after they killed her parents. and now her kiowa family has been killed by white people, so she has been twice orphaned. and the black man who we see hanging from a tree, he was tasked with taking her to her only remaining white family and aunt and uncle. so now with that man dead, she has nothing and no means of getting anywhere on her own.\n\nhanks finds her, the captain finds her, and reluctantly takes on the responsibility of taking her, johanna, to her aunt and uncle. it's a pretty long and dangerous journey, and a lot happens to them along the way. and it's hard for him to communicate with her because she only speaks kiowa, and she identifies as a member of the kiowa. did you read a lot of history about that period?\n\ngreengrass: i did. i did. there's quite an extensive literature, actually, for these children who were kidnapped. it wasn't that unusual. and they were lost children, of course. but, you know, part of a wider landscape of lost people, i think. pretty much everybody in the movie has - lives in the shadow of the civil war, lives in the shadow of loss. and their journey, kidd and this little girl's journey, which begins wordlessly, is ultimately a journey towards finding a place to belong, i suppose, in this new landscape.\n\nand that, to me, felt inspiring and also was ultimately the reason why i made the film. you know, i wanted to make it because in lots of ways, it's a film about the journey to hope, and that's something that's very important, i think. as the world looks ever more dark, we have to keep our minds fixed, i think, on where the hope is.\n\ngross: so were there newsreaders like the character tom hanks plays, who actually were itinerant and read the news from town to town for people who didn't have access to newspapers?\n\ngreengrass: i think, yes. of course, many people were illiterate in those days, weren't they? i mean, i think...\n\ngross: oh, good point.\n\ngreengrass: the newsreaders, really, have a gospel route. in my country, they would have been the methodist preachers, the nonconformist preachers who weren't allowed to preach in the churches but went out into the town squares and brought the good news. and of course, that - later after the american revolution, they were a feature of american life, too. and of course, what starts as bringing the good news becomes bringing the news, you know. and they would leaven their gospel stories with local news, and so it became, steadily, the news.\n\ngross: if you're just joining us, my guest is paul greengrass, the director of the new film news of the world, starring tom hanks. we'll be right back. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. let's get back to the interview i recorded tuesday with film director paul greengrass. his new film news of the world stars tom hanks. it's a western set in texas in 1870, five years after the end of the civil war. greengrass got his start as a journalist and documentary filmmaker and went on to make films based on real events, including terrorist attacks. his films include captain phillips and united 93. he also directed three jason bourne films.\n\nyou've studied the work of john ford, who did a lot of westerns, including the searchers and my darling clementine, she wore a yellow ribbon, the man who shot liberty valance. you not only studied his work; you talked about him in the documentary series five came back, which is adapted from a book by the same name. and it was about five directors, including ford, who during world war ii basically joined the military and did documentary films about battles as they were happening. for ford, that included the battle of midway and d-day. like, he was there shooting footage from d-day.\n\nand when you were looking at those films that he shot during the war, could you imagine yourself doing that? i mean, you talk about how in the battle of midway, when the japanese are attacking midway island from the air, that john ford was standing on basically a pedestal, directing things so he could have a good vision of what was happening. and as you point out, if during an air war, you're standing in an elevated area, you are a target. could you imagine doing that?\n\ngreengrass: well, i don't think i could imagine being in the battle of midway. but, you know, when i was a young man, when i was in my 20s, that was my job. i mean, i went to conflict zones, many of them - middle east, central america, apartheid south africa, philippines during the revolution, after - as marcos fell. you know, that was what i did for the best part of 10 years.\n\nand obviously, they weren't anything like in scale, you know, world war ii. but the same principles apply if you see, you know, planes coming in - you get down and, you know, do the best you can. it was a young man's occupation. but it marked me, of course. any exposure to reality in film profoundly shapes you. it's profoundly shaped my life. it's profoundly shaped my aesthetic. it's profoundly shaped what i'm interested in.\n\ngross: you say it shaped your aesthetic. can you talk a little bit more about how it shaped your aesthetic? and i mean that in two ways. you know, in five came back, you talk about how the war footage that john ford shot, you can see the film, like, moving out of the sprockets because of all of the impact of the bombs. and you see the camera shaking. some of the footage looks like it's singed from all the bombs exploding. just on a film level, he kept that. you know, he - i think he wanted you to see, like, this is an example of even the damage it's doing to the film.\n\ngreengrass: the struggle to create and capture the image, the drama of the experience of the battle of midway. that's at the heart of it, and it's at the heart of all news reportage when you get down to it. what did we see last week? some cameras followed that mob into the capitol building, and you saw those men and women struggling to capture those images in order to bring them to us. your job is to move towards the trouble. that's what you have to do. and the best of those, they have an instinct to where to go.\n\ni mean, this was the key to ford in the battle of midway. he knew where to go, which is up high, to get those images. extraordinary - at great risk to himself, of course. but that's at the heart of it. and there are many, many, many children of papa ford, if i can put it that way, over the decades since who've taken that lesson, and you see it every day on television.\n\ngross: now, you've shot films based on real-life events, like the united flight 93 on 9/11 that crashed because the passengers were taking over the plane from the hostage-takers, and they prevented the plane from crashing into its intended target. you know, you did a film based on the somali pirates who took over, you know, a cargo ship. and then you've also done these, like, big, like, jason bourne movies, which are not exactly cinema verite (laughter). they're not exactly like documentary. they're action films.\n\nand then in the new movie, news of the world, the longest, like, action sequence in it is - it's a shootout between tom hanks and three kind of twisted, lost souls who want to basically buy the young girl from tom hanks and probably sell her into sexual servitude. but that scene, it's just like a really lo-fi shootout, you know, with tom hanks trying to hide behind rocks and use whatever he can as bullets to shoot at these three guys. can you talk a little bit about, like, the different kinds of action sequences that you've shot, after shooting real combat?\n\ngreengrass: well, you have to go back to my roots, as - you know, in britain, there wasn't - there isn't - wasn't then, anyway, certainly, a film industry. there was the television industry. that's where you went if you - you know, to work and cut your teeth and pay your dues and learn your craft. and what i was at a very young age was sent out into the world - you were sent out into the world with a crew, and you had to bring back a story from the world in action. and that meant going to places where, if it wasn't armed conflict, it was political conflict. and so that, i suppose, verite sense, that documentary eye, that instinct to capture images rather than to create them, you know, in a sort of curated way - which is really what drama shooting is - has never left me. that's my instinct.\n\nand i brought that to the bourne movies, too, by the way. you know, i think one of the reasons why young people particularly liked the bourne movies is because it was one of the first kind of movies that brought that kind - those kinds of images into the mainstream because that's what kids were used to. they were using - beginning to use their mobile phones and have all sorts of rough and raw and ready verite images, and that was their language. and bourne, i think, just brought that language into the mainstream of hollywood cinema. now it's much more normal to see it.\n\ngross: you know, i'm wondering, having been in so many conflict zones and shot documentaries there and now watching news footage from your home in england, news footage of an insurrection in the united states - in the united states - what is it like for you to watch that, to know that, you know, it's not an emerging democracy, it's not a country where there has been just a super long history of authoritarian governments and dictatorships - it's the united states?\n\ngreengrass: well, i first came to the united states when i was 18 years old. and it's not my home country. i'm british. but it's a place i love, as i think many people who are not americans do, you know. it's the great hope of our world, you know. so my feelings are of great shock and sadness, as i think most people's are.\n\nwhat did i think when i watched it? the last film i made was 22 july about anders breivik, who's a right-wing terrorist in norway who attacked the government and the young labour group as well. you know, it was an attempt to decapitate the state. the reason i made that film was because breivik, anders breivik, is a very important figure in the growth of the far-right, both in america and in the u.k. and across europe, because he's seen as a standard-bearer. if you look at charlottesville, all that trouble, a lot of the language that was being used by the white supremacists was breivik's words from breivik's manifesto - same in some of the other right-wing attacks across europe. you know, he's a profoundly important figure.\n\ngross: so you had to study, like, who he was and, you know, what he believed, what the manifesto was. what are some of the things that you started to believe about how somebody comes to believe lies, how somebody comes to believe that certain people are less than human, that certain people are worthy of being killed and how, like, the truth, reality, is incapable of talking them out of it? because that question is so relevant to right now.\n\ngreengrass: i think anders breivik is a dreadful - dreadful - contemptible human being guilty of the most heinous acts. that said, you mustn't ever misunderstand these people. it was not that they thought - that he felt that the people that he killed were not human. he actually understood - he's a pretty intelligent man, anders breivik. what he was - and this is relevant today - was someone who believed that you needed to have a fight, that the battle needed to be waged with violence.\n\nand that is common now. that is - the genie is out of the bottle, if i can use that expression. do you know what i mean? it's like, that is out there in chatrooms, in the dark web, in the meetings all across the west. and it's a big problem. and if you talk to anybody in law enforcement - fbi, you know, police, mi5 over here on the - you know, in europe - the growth of the far-right and their desire to give battle is a real - it's a reality. it's a reality, and it has to be dealt with.\n\nand i think you may be actually a little fortunate in the u.s. i don't know. i mean, obviously, i'm just an observer. but it strikes me that - i suspect that there may have been some overreaching, and law enforcement may really significantly go after these people and, you know, drive them back. but it's going to be a generational struggle, this - just as it is against, you know, violent islamist extremism. and it's part of the morbid symptoms of the failure of centrist politics.\n\ngross: my guest is director paul greengrass, his new film news of the world stars tom hanks. it's now in theaters and will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow. we'll talk more after we take a short break. i'm terry gross, and this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. i'm terry gross. let's get back to the interview i recorded tuesday with paul greengrass, who directed the new film news of the world, starring tom hanks. it will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow. greengrass started his career as a journalist and documentary filmmaker and went on to direct theatrical films based on real events. captain phillips, which also starred tom hanks, was based on the american cargo ship hijacked by somali pirates in 2009. 22 july was about a 2011 terrorist attack by a far-right extremist in norway. and united 93 was about the airplane passengers who fought back against the hijackers on 9/11 and died crashing near shanksville, pa. greengrass has also directed three of the blockbuster jason bourne movies.\n\ni want to get back to anders breivik because you did a dramatized version of him in your film 22 july. and he's the neo-nazi, you know, terrorist who attacked people in norway and had a manifesto that a lot of people on the far right have subsequently followed. i am sometimes surprised that people who are neo-nazis, white racists, that they're - i mean, they're proud of it. they believe - i mean, that really - this is how they think the world should be. and they don't mind people knowing that.\n\ngreengrass: well, the reason i made that film, 22 july, was because it was not about breivik. i mean, he was a central, important character in it. the film was about norway, as an exemplar, of how a democratic society faced with this menace of white supremacy, how they reacted to this immense threat. you know, i mean, he was a double attack. you know, he blew up the center of government. and then he went and killed the next generation of government leaders when he attacked the youth camp, you know? and it was deliberate. it was an attempt to decapitate the state. that was the whole idea behind it.\n\nand i chose a number of characters who had to respond to that, one of whom was the then-norwegian prime minister, now secretary general of nato, jens stoltenberg. another was the lawyer who represented - who became the state-appointed lawyer for breivik and had to ensure that he had a fair trial as best he could - and then, obviously, the principal character, the family who were caught up in it, the young man who had been grievously wounded by him. and it was about their journeys to face him down. that was what the film was about. and what did that look like and feel like?\n\nso in the end, this young man did face him down in court. but the healing, as far as you could have it after an event like that, was very partial and muted, inevitably, because of the damage he'd done. but it did leave me feeling intensely, as a parent - i mean, how are we going to get out of this? what is the road out of this going to look like? what are the qualities that we have to look to to get through this bitterness and division? that was what was going through my mind. and it was, as i say, six months later - i don't know - that i read news of the world.\n\nand when i read this beautiful novel about this lonely newsreader who embarks on this journey with this mysterious little girl to take her to her surviving family, that is that road out of this. that's - and then, they're just ordinary characters. they're not famous people. they're not in the eye of some enormous storm. they're just - what it says is an attempt to understand kindness, seeing it through, facing down bigotry, standing up, telling the truth. he's a journalist. he stands up, doesn't he? he stands up in the end and says, no, i'm not going to read lies and substitute truth for lies. i'm going to speak my truth. and if necessary, he's prepared to fight for it. and that's heroic and beautiful and exciting. and, of course, it's an adventure, as it should be in a movie, you know?\n\nand in the end, they find a way. and that's, you know, what i wanted. i wanted to make a film i could show my kids, you know, a family film. i've never made a family film. i wanted to do a western and i wanted to do a family film. but i wanted to have the world as i see it in it. but i wanted it to have a happy ending. that's actually, honestly, the truth of it. i wanted to make a film with a happy ending.\n\ngross: that's interesting. how did it feel to make a film with a happy ending?\n\ngreengrass: well, that was something that i had decided after i'd done 22 july, you know? i said, i want to make a film that has a happy ending. i want to - you know, not a schmaltzy, sentimental film because i wouldn't - it's not in my sensibility to do that. you know, these things turn around in your mind. it's - i don't know how other filmmakers do it. i can never really sort of go, oh, i need to do a story about x. or i need to do, you know, a science fiction movie, you know? to me, i sort of dwell on a question, a feeling. and one film, it's like a conversation you have with yourself. and you go, ok, well, i need to find a film with a happy ending. i need to find a film - but that feels earned from this world, you know? and, well, what's that going to be? i don't know. god knows.\n\nand then, you know, serendipity - six months later, you read this. and you go, that's it. that's it. and, of course, it's a western. i've never made a western before. that's fantastic, you know? oh, and it's john ford. it starts in reverse. and i did the john ford thing. you know, when you make films, you always have to have a eureka moment, i think, when you go, oh, it's that. this is it. this is the film. i know what to do with this. this is great. it's - all those threads that have been unconnected that i've been turning over in my mind for six months or whatever it is, suddenly, this is the way i can tie them together and get a film, you know? the film will answer that question.\n\ngross: what was your eureka moment when you decided to make the movie about - united 93 - flight 93 on 9/11, where the passengers fought back against the hijackers. but everybody on that plane died as a result because the plane crashed in pennsylvania. i'm going to be really honest with you. i made a decision not to see that movie because, i thought, i know how the story turns out. i've read about it. i don't want to experience the horror of being on that plane. i'm going to spare myself from that. so what was your eureka moment in thinking, like, i want to reenact that in a movie?\n\ngreengrass: well, it's difficult if you haven't seen the movie to sort of - i mean, i think it's about a lot more than that, if i can put it that way.\n\ngross: i don't doubt it. so you can tell us.\n\ngreengrass: the simple truth about when i decided to make it was when the 7/7 attacks, as we call them in the u.k., occurred some years later, when they bombed three subway trains and a bus in london. and my son, same for many millions of people, i'm sure, in london, he was out and about. when the word came through at 8, 9 o'clock in the morning that there'd been this attack, of course, you phone. where are you? and his phone didn't answer. and we didn't know where - we knew he was travelling across london to a friend. but we didn't know where he was. and that panic that you feel when you think - could he? can't possibly be - you know what i mean?\n\nand it turned out he was fine. he'd just gone to a friend's. and he was blissfully unaware and had his phone off. but we were the lucky ones. some people weren't lucky. and i remember when the shock of - i went to the office and said, i - i had thought about that i had wanted to address 9/11 in a film, but not really knowing quite how because it was the central event in our world. it was driving. it was clear - it was going to drive all our politics. everything was going to change. and, you know, i wanted to find a way of addressing it.\n\nbut that was the moment, truly, when i - because i remember i walked into the office and said, i'm going to make - i had thought about making what it finally became, which was really about - the air traffic control system is really what that film's about, which - 93 is one part of it. and it's really, ultimately, about the incredibly beautiful but highly vulnerable latticework that is a modern democracy and how easy it is to break it and what that looks and feels like, you know, what that's got to tell us. that was when i walked in and said, i'm going to make that film. and i did it. that must've been - that was july. and we were shooting it by october, november. i wrote it very quickly - in a couple of weeks, really.\n\ngreengrass: what kind of research did you have to do in order to write it?\n\ngreengrass: the first thing we did was go and see all the families and ask them what their feelings were. and they were very supportive - many, many different types of people with different opinions. why? you see it again and again, actually. i've seen it - i mean, all terrorist attacks, acts of political violence, are different, of course. but there are some common themes you see. one of the most common i have seen is that when these events happen, there is a deep desire on the part of those of us who survive, those of us who are bystanders, to want - after a necessary period of shock and mourning, we want to get on with our lives. we want normality to return.\n\nbut, of course, if you're caught up in these acts, your lives are forever changed. and you're propelled on journeys unimaginable and unwanted. why did this happen? what does it mean? we can't just go back to being normal now, you know? and they want to be heard. and i think, hopefully, when you make those - the film was made with great consultation and collaboration. i mean, i'm responsible for any of the failings of that film, you know? i'm not saying that. but you make it with them in an attempt to understand what it means. what does it mean as to what lessons can we draw from it? what does that have to say to this?\n\nand, by the way, i felt very strongly that that was a process, by the way that, necessarily, always would happen. and you see it in, you know, newspapers and in television and in documentaries and in books. what does this mean? but i felt that cinema has to be part of that conversation, too. the question is, how do you do it with discretion with dignity and in the right way?\n\ngross: my guest is director paul greengrass. his new film, news of the world, stars tom hanks. we'll talk more after a break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of james newton howard's kidd visits maria)\n\ngross: this is fresh air. let's get back to my interview with director paul greengrass. he started as a documentary filmmaker, shooting in wars and conflict zones. he's made several theatrical films based on real events, including terrorist attacks. his films include united 93 and captain phillips. his movie 22 july was based on the terrorist attack in norway by the far-right extremist anders breivik. greengrass also made three jason bourne movies. his new movie, news of the world, stars tom hanks. it's a western set five years after the civil war.\n\nso you know, you talked about how you wanted to make a movie with a happy ending, which you don't typically do, but you did with your new movie, news of the world. so after making many movies that are reenactments of really tragic events, terrorist events, now you've made a movie where there's a lot of trouble. everyone is broken. but there is, by its standards, you know, a happy ending. what do you want to do next? do you want to pursue something else that ends with some happiness, with characters being better off than they were when they started?\n\ngreengrass: i honestly don't know. i enormously enjoyed making this film. it was a dream come true, actually, honestly and truly. you know, to make a western, you know, you stand out in the desert. you know, you can feel, when you look out in the distance, the ghost of papa ford out there somewhere. you know what i mean? and you know you're going to scramble inadequately upon the shoulders of the giant and try and take a shot at a western. you know, it was a wonderful, wonderful experience. i don't know. i don't know what i'm going to do next. it'll pretty interesting to see. as i say, i'm already asking myself the question, you know, what is the question? and i think the question is, i heard somebody on television as that event was going on last week in d.c., say he was a very thoughtful person, some political commentator. he said the question is, is this the end of something or the beginning of something? and i thought, yep, that's absolutely right. that's going to be the question, i think, that will govern probably the next two or three years of our lives.\n\ngross: on a lighter note, how did you like working with horses?\n\ngreengrass: (laughter) loved it. i used to ride a little bit when i was young, but not now. but tom was really good on a horse. he was fantastic. but it was - it was thrilling, just what i mean (ph). you know, you go out in the desert, and you see the horses and the wagons and, you know, the way people dressed. and you're in the west. and it's mythic, and it's part of your boyish imagination, you know?\n\nand as i say, i loved it. i loved the experience of making it. it was physically demanding as a film. you know, it was a lot of heat and dust and freezing cold at night and climbing. i mean, that shootout when we had to climb up that bluff, it was - took two hours to get the crew up there. and you had to go up on ropes. and then there were rattlesnakes around the place, you know, and we had to have wranglers. you know, it was - but the adventure of it, i think, really brought people together. i think people loved that about it, you know?\n\ngross: you know, just a sidebar note - i don't think i've ever seen tom hanks in a western before, except for toy story, (laughter) where it's not a western, but he is, you know - he is a toy wooden cowboy in it.\n\ngreengrass: well, he's the real deal in this. and i thought he sat well in that landscape. you know, he looked the part to me. and i love tom when he's weathered and...\n\ngross: yes, his face is dirty most of the time.\n\ngreengrass: and has years and has experience behind his eyes - he's seen things; he's done things. it's a haunted quality to him, and it seems such an obvious thing to say. but i think we must take him for granted as a movie star because he is so consistently good in the things he does.\n\ngross: i want to thank you so much for talking with us. and thank you for making news of the world, which i enjoyed so much. paul greengrass, it's really been a pleasure.\n\ngreengrass: thanks a lot.\n\ngross: paul greengrass directed the new film news of the world starring tom hanks. it's currently playing in theaters and will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow. we recorded our interview tuesday.\n\nafter we take a short break, ken tucker will review an hbo documentary about the bee gees and a new album by barry gibb, the only one of the three bee gee brothers still alive. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of blanco's pull up (instrumental))\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
daylight saving time is here again. so is the debate about changing the clocks\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption charles krupa/ap charles krupa/ap\n\nthe dreaded spring ahead has finally arrived: on sunday, march 8, the clock will jump one hour forward at 2 a.m. to mark the official start of daylight saving time.\n\nin general, the time change gets a bad rap. an ap-norc center for public affairs research poll conducted last fall found that 71% of respondents want to end the practice of changing the clocks. in all, 40% favored year-round standard time, while 31% said they'd prefer year-round daylight saving time.\n\nsome politicians have similarly come out against the semiannual time change, including sen. marco rubio (r-fla.), who has proposed a bill that would move the entire country to permanent, year-round daylight saving time.\n\naccording to the department of transportation, which oversees the observance of daylight saving time, the uniform time act of 1966 established the practice of switching clocks as we know it today. the dot says moving the clock forward by an hour saves energy by providing an extra hour of sunlight in the evening, thus reducing the need to use household electricity for lighting. the agency says that it also prevents traffic injuries because more people are commuting during the daylight and that it helps cut crime because more people are out conducting their affairs during the daylight rather than at night, when more crime occurs.\n\nhowever, research on the effects of daylight saving time has also revealed drawbacks, and whether it truly helps conserve energy remains in question.\n\none 2009 study of miners, for example, found that in comparison with other days, on mondays directly following the start of daylight saving time, workers sustain more workplace injuries and injuries of greater severity due to tiredness.\n\nanother study, published in 2007 in the journal current biology, followed the sleep of 50 subjects for eight weeks across clock changes. it found that though human circadian rhythms — which control sleep patterns — generally adapt to the fall back change, they struggle to adjust to the spring ahead.\n\nadhering to daylight saving time is a federal mandate, but states can opt out as long as they pass legislation and receive federal approval, according to the transportation department.\n\nin fact, several states and territories have chosen to be exempt from daylight saving time, opting instead to follow standard time year-round. among them are arizona, hawaii, puerto rico, american samoa, guam and the virgin islands.\n\nother states, like washington, have been in the fight to opt out of the time switch.\n\nin may 2019, washington gov. jay inslee signed a bill that would #ditchtheswitch, putting the state on permanent daylight saving time. more than 30 states are considering similar legislation, according to the ap-norc center for public affairs research at the university of chicago.\n\nhowever, washingtonians will still spring forward on sunday with the rest of the country, as the state waits on congress to approve the change, according to the seattle times.\n\nmeanwhile, #ditchtheswitch has gained traction on social media, prompting both voices of support and backlash. it's a debate that won't be going away anytime soon, and unless you're in an exempt area, expect to be groggy on monday.
after attack, an uproar over a call for french jews to quit wearing yarmulkes\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption boris horvat/afp/getty images boris horvat/afp/getty images\n\na debate is raging in france over whether jewish men should avoid wearing the traditional yarmulke, so as not to identify themselves at a time of increasing violence by young radical islamists. the proposal was put forth this week by a jewish leader in marseille, following a knife attack on a local jewish teacher.\n\nzvi ammar, head of marseille's 60,000-strong jewish community, suggested it might be better if jews in marseille stopped wearing the yarmulke, also known as a kippah.\n\nfor the time being, ammar said, at least until these barbarians calm down.\n\nhe was referring to a kurdish immigrant from turkey, a high school student, who attacked a jewish teacher with a butcher knife and claimed to be inspired by islamic state. the assault on monday in marseille horrified the country. but there's also been a strong reaction to ammar's proposal.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption boris horvat/afp/getty images boris horvat/afp/getty images\n\nfrance's head rabbi, haim korsia, called it defeatist.\n\nto suggest this is like saying jews bear some responsibility for being attacked, said korsia. this is the same kind of thinking as those who would say a woman is guilty of a sexual assault because her skirt wasn't long enough.\n\nfrench officials on the left and right have denounced the proposal for jews to remove their yarmulkes. parliamentarian xavier bertrand spoke about it on a popular radio show.\n\nif the jews of marseille don't wear their kippahs, france is no longer france, he said. because it will mean letting those who want to change our way of living and values win. we can't let that happen.\n\nseveral of the recent terrorist attacks in france have specifically targeted jews. france, home to 600,000 jews, has europe's largest jewish population and the third largest in the world, after israel and the u.s. but in recent years, jews have been leaving the country. the daily newspaper le parisien reports that not since 1948, the year israel declared statehood, have so many jews left france. some have left for economic reasons; some out of fear.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption eleanor beardsley/npr eleanor beardsley/npr\n\nnational jewish community leader joel mergui says jews know that wearing the kippah could make them the target of young radicals. but we're not going to stop going to sporting events at stadiums or to concerts or cafes, he says. and so jews will continue to wear the kippah.\n\nafter last year's attacks on satirical newspaper charlie hebdo and a kosher supermarket, an israeli journalist secretly filmed himself walking through some of paris' rougher immigrant and muslim neighborhoods while wearing a kippah. broadcast on french tv, the clip shows him drawing some unsavory comments. one group of young men wearing hoodies can be heard comparing him to a dog.\n\nfrench interior minister bernard cazeneuve is in marseille, visiting the teacher who was attacked — said to be psychologically shaken but physically fine. cazeneuve is also there to reassure the city's jewish community.\n\nbertrand, the parliamentarian, said it is the french state's job to protect its citizens — and it would protect french jews.\n\nten thousand french soldiers are serving across the country, providing security along with police. nowhere is their presence more visible than in the marais, paris' traditional jewish quarter, where soldiers with assault rifles patrol the streets and stand guard outside the synagogues.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bertrand langlois/afp/getty images bertrand langlois/afp/getty images\n\nclothing shop owner stephan levy says he feels safe, but things have changed in the past couple of years.\n\nnow i think it's less risky sometimes to wear a baseball cap or a hat rather than a kippah, depending where you're going, he says. and not just in france, in other countries too. because, let's face it — these days, jews are targeted.\n\nteacher avraham scharbit is wearing his kippah. so is his 4-year-old son, who is buckled into a seat on the back of his father's bike.\n\nyeah, i sometimes wear a baseball cap instead of my kippah, scharbit says. the important thing is to keep your head covered. i do both. but it's not a big deal.\n\nscharbit says he's not afraid — and says france is a good place to raise his children.
former michigan gov. rick snyder charged in flint water crisis\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption carlos osorio/ap carlos osorio/ap\n\nupdated at 9:28 p.m. et\n\nformer michigan gov. rick snyder was charged wednesday for his role in the flint water crisis, an environmental disaster that contaminated the majority black city's drinking water with lead nearly seven years ago.\n\nsnyder is facing two counts of willful neglect of duty and if convicted he could face up to a year in prison and as much as a $1,000 fine.\n\nother former members of his administration are expected to face charges as well, according to the associated press.\n\nearlier this week, as reports began to surface that charges were looming, an attorney for snyder referred to them as a politically motivated smear campaign, according to the detroit free press.\n\nsnyder, a republican, was michigan's top executive when state-appointed officials decided to switch the city's drinking water source from detroit's water system to the flint river in 2014.\n\nit stems from a decision billed as a way to save money and only supposed to be a temporary fix while officials built a pipeline to nearby lake huron. but it turned out to be costly, both in lives lost and in a settlement worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\npending settlement for victims\n\nlast year nessel announced a $600 million-dollar settlement for flint families impacted by the water crisis last year.\n\nthe deal puts the needs of children first, she said during the august announcement.\n\nyoung people were especially vulnerable, at risk of suffering long-term cognitive challenges and other health issues from being exposed to lead contamination in the water.\n\nas npr's bill chappell reported at the time the settlement indicated that nearly 80% of the funds were earmarked to resolved claims filed on behalf of children and minors.\n\nthe remaining portion of the settlement is expected to be divvied up among other flint residents who fell ill from the contaminated water or suffered property damage, michigan public radio reports.\n\nbut a u.s. district court judge is expected to soon rule on whether to give the settlement preliminary approval, mpr reports.\n\nat least 12 died, more than 80 became sick\n\nthe station adds not everyone is happy with the settlement. that includes john mcclain, a pastor, who characterized the proposed settlement as disrespectful, because he said there are too many roadblocks for residents to access the money and it doesn't provide enough to cover damages.\n\nwe believe the proposed settlement as currently allocated is just as disrespectful as the injury caused by the water crisis tragedy itself, mcclain told mpr.\n\nat least dozen people died and more than 80 people were sickened with legionnaires' disease after water from the flint river caused lead to leach from old pipes, poisoning the water system city.\n\nsoon after the switch, residents began to complain that the new water in their homes had a foul stench, tasted different and was discolored, according to an mlive report from may 2014, a month after the change in water sources.\n\nofficials with the michigan department of environmental quality told flint city officials they did not need to use any corrosion control measures to treat the river water, at least not initially, michigan public radio reported in december 2016.\n\nthe wait-and-see approach was a really bad idea, experts told mpr, because without the necessary treatment the protective coating on the inside of the pipes that built up over the years from detroit's water likely disappeared. and that's what caused lead levels to spike in many homes in flint.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mark wilson/getty images mark wilson/getty images\n\nsnyder, who has been out of office for two years, apologized for his role in the environmental debacle during his 2016 state of the state address.\n\nyour families face a crisis, a crisis which you did not create and could not have prevented, snyder said. i want to speak directly, honestly and sincerely to let you know we are praying for you. we are working hard for you and we are absolutely committed to taking the right steps to effectively solve this crisis. to you, the people of flint, i say ... i'm sorry and i will fix it.\n\nmore than a dozen state and city officials were indicted for their roles in the crisis. several of them accepted plea deals to avoid prison time.\n\nin june of 2019 nessel announced that state prosecutors were dropping all criminal charges against a group of eight government officials, and moved to launch a more expansive investigation.\n\ni want to remind the people of flint that justice delayed is not always justice denied and a fearless and dedicated team of career prosecutors and investigators are hard at work to ensure those who harmed you are held accountable, nessel said in a statement at the time.\n\nnpr's dylan scott contributed to this report.
remembering peabody award-winning radio artist joe frank\n\nfrank, who died on monday, created the radio drama series work in progress and was known for his intimate on-air monologues, sketches and interviews. originally broadcast in 1989.\n\ndave davies, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. i'm dave davies, in for terry gross, who's off this week. many years ago, when fresh air was a three-hour local show with plenty of time to fill, terry was always happy when some new material was available from joe frank, a masterful storyteller whose syndicated radio show work in progress was a one-of-a-kind production that defies easy description. frank died monday in beverly hills at the age of 79. frank's shows combined interviews, personal monologues, dramas with radio actors - even tapes frank had surreptitiously recorded of friends, family and strangers.\n\nira glass worked as a production assistant for frank in the early '80s, and he credits frank as a major influence on his program this american life. terry spoke to joe frank in 1989, and they began with an episode of his program called rent-a-family, in which a woman named eleanor phones her ex-husband arthur, who's remarried. it's one of a series of desperate calls she's made, and arthur's begged her to stop calling.\n\n(soundbite of radio show, rent-a-family)\n\nunidentified actress #1: (as kathy) hello.\n\nunidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) hello. may i speak to arthur, please?\n\nunidentified actress #1: (as kathy) eleanor - eleanor, this has got to stop. i mean, this can't go on. surely, you're aware of that.\n\nunidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) may i speak to arthur, please?\n\nunidentified actress #1: (as kathy) eleanor, listen. i understand what you are going through, but what you've got know is that it's not working. none of what you are doing is working.\n\nunidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) may i speak to arthur, please.\n\nunidentified actress #1: (as kathy) ok.\n\narthur.\n\nunidentified actor: (as arthur) what is it?\n\nunidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) arthur, i've been thinking.\n\nunidentified actor: (as arthur) yeah, what?\n\nunidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) i would like to come and visit with you and kathy (ph) for a while. now hear me out. i won't be any trouble. i can do all the things i'm sure kathy has no time to do because she has her job. and i can cook nice things for you both. and i can clean the house. and i can do the gardening. and i can take care of all of the little things that you don't have time to do or that you don't like to do - you know, arthur, those things. and i'll stay - i'll stay out of your way. i won't say a word if i'm not - i'll be sort of a housekeeper - a silent housekeeper. you see the thing is that i need - i need a family, arthur.\n\nunidentified actor: (as arthur) eleanor, i feel for you. kathy feels for you. but you got to understand we have our own life. it won't work. how could you possibly imagine that the three of us could share a house together?\n\nunidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) but you don't understand. i could do all kinds of things for you. i could clean the house. i could keep the garden beautiful. and your life would be so much easier. don't you understand? it would be...\n\nunidentified actor: (as arthur) what you're suggesting is bizarre.\n\nunidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) why?\n\nunidentified actor: (as arthur) it's absurd.\n\nunidentified actress #2: (as eleanor) it could work. it could. it could.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\nterry gross, byline: an excerpt of rent-a-family, written and directed by my guest joe frank from his series work in progress, which is produced at public radio station kcrw in santa monica and is carried on many public radio stations around the country.\n\njoe frank, what's really eerie about that tape is how real it sounds. i'm usually not a really big - real big fan of radio drama. there's something about it that sounds very phony and actorly (ph) a lot of the time. and these sound like real phone conversations - real scary ones.\n\njoe frank: well, i agree with you entirely about radio drama. and i've never been able to listen to radio drama and believe in the credibility of the performances. and i'm always distanced from it, and it does seem artificial to me. and so the approach that i've taken in all the dramas that i've created is that in fact they're not written. it's not accurate to say it was written by joe frank because these are improvisations performed by actors, which are very carefully directed. and what this involves is a great deal of editing because you do a lot of - you create a lot of tape. you create a lot of - you do the telephone calls over and over again. and then i edit them in such a way that i hope creates a credible performance.\n\ngross: well, sometimes you do tell your own story. and i want to play an excerpt of a show in which you did that - at least i assume it was your story. and the show is called no show. and do you want to explain what this show is about?\n\nfrank: well, no show came out of an experience in which i was - i came into the radio station unprepared to do a radio show. i had had a horrendous week. everything seemed to had gone wrong that week. i'd had no chance to write or to work on creating a radio program. and so i decided since i had to go on the air, and there was no way of avoiding it, that i would simply explain to my listening audience why i had no show prepared.\n\ngross: and one of the many reasons why you had no show, in addition to having been out with a friend till 4 in the morning, having a sick cat, having a lonely friend come over - (laughter) in spite of your asking her not to - you were invited to a dinner party. and you had to go. and this is the part of your program no show in which you talked about that dinner party, which prevented you from producing your program that week.\n\n(soundbite of radio show, no show)\n\nfrank: well, the dinner party that i attended began with a group of people sitting and talking in the parlor living room of a woman's house - of the hostess who had invited us all - eating caviar and sour cream, liverwurst spread and cheese on crackers. and there was a table with a row of wine bottles and some glasses on it. i was compulsively eating the crackers and the cheeses and drinking wine - wishing that i could wake up from this dream, be back alone in my hotel room. but i was also thinking, this is good for you. this is good for you. get out. meet people. you could learn something. this will be nourishing. maybe you can get some good material out of it.\n\nbut, you know, it's hard to be a gatherer of material when you find yourself periodically tuning out to what's going on, when you lose track of the conversation, when you suddenly find yourself on dream street. you don't have the faintest notion of what anybody is saying - of what's being discussed. you're thousands of miles away. it's like the other people there are on television. they're characters in a sitcom with the volume turned off. and you can see them gesturing and talking and laughing, but you can't hear anything. and you're thinking of nothing. your mind is in brownout.\n\nand yet i was painfully aware of the fact that to some extent i was on trial. the party was being given - i was told, to my chagrin - in my honor. and everyone else here, i figured, was - were members of the jury. you know, they were all being very nice, and they were being pleasant. but i knew that at the end of the evening when they were walking and driving home with their friends, with their lovers, with their wives, they would discuss how the evening went.\n\nand my name eventually would come up at some point. and they'd say something like he seemed so intelligent, so outgoing on the air. but really he's rather disappointing, don't you think? george was so much funnier. george was so much cleverer. he was so much faster on his feet than joe frank was. i mean, did the man say one arresting thing all evening? no, he just sat there listening, laughing at what other people said - trying to avoid the limelight for all he was worth. he's obviously typical of so many performers - shy, neurotically withdrawn.\n\ngross: joe frank - an excerpt of his program work in progress, which is heard on many public radio stations around the country. joe, do you really make pacts with yourself to never go out again (laughter)?\n\nfrank: well, i don't go out, or i very rarely go out. and i certainly haven't been to a dinner party since the one that i described.\n\n(laughter)\n\nfrank: and that was at least a year ago. yes, i remember that party well. and i'm pretty much a loner and pretty much work-obsessed and spent most of my time working or thinking about the work that i'm doing.\n\ngross: well, let me ask you about the work obsession. you have to eliminate a lot of, quote, real life to stay home all the time and obsess on your work. do you think that that kind of real life is sometimes overrated as it's filled with stuff that you don't much enjoy anyways?\n\nfrank: no. i think i've been caught in a paradox, really, because in order to be able to create compelling radio programs, you have to have some experiences to base, you know, those programs on. and if you live the kind of life that i've been living recently, you're not living yourself. you're just - you're not gathering material from your own life.\n\nso what i have done recently, although i'm going to change that very soon, is i have drawn on the experiences of others. i interview people. i talk to people. people come to me with their stories. and we'll sit late at night for hours in my apartment with a tape recorder rolling. and then on the basis of that extended interview - and some of these interviews will go on for days - radio programs will be created.\n\nbut i'm beginning to find this approach too parasitic and not that personally satisfying. so i'm going to go out and begin to live as a normal human being or maybe an abnormal human being in order to gather my own material and sort of create experiences for my radio program out of my own life as opposed to drawing from other people's lives.\n\ngross: you know, a lot of your more personal shows deal with fears and insecurities - ones that, you know, we can all relate to. but i wonder if when you take your own insecurities and put them in a kind of persona and make them into an hour radio program, if they're easier to deal with than they are, say, when you're lying awake alone in the middle of the night.\n\nfrank: oh, yeah. as a matter of fact, by using those experiences for radio programs, you transcend them. you almost look for bad experiences or painful experiences. whatever tragedies might befall you, you can always, right away, think, well, that would make a great story for radio. and so that whatever happens, even if it has a great negative content, even if it's painful - because you can then tell it on the radio and share it with many listeners and move people or entertain people, it then takes on a positive value.\n\nand i remember distinctly that - coming to that revelation a number of years ago when i realized that i no longer wanted to avoid pain - that i could use it in a way that was very productive so that it was easier to experience whatever suffering that came my way.\n\ndavies: radio artist joe frank speaking with terry gross, recorded in 1989. we'll hear more after a break. this is fresh air.\n\n(soundbite of branco simonetti's sintetica)\n\ndavies: this is fresh air. we're listening to terry's 1989 interview with radio artist joe frank. frank died monday at the age of 79.\n\n(soundbite of archived broadcast)\n\ngross: i want to play another excerpt from one of your shows. and this is from a program that you did called let me not dream. and for this show, you called a lot of your ex-lovers. and explain what this was about.\n\nfrank: i'm constantly driven by the desire to do something that has never been done before on the radio or to surprise and astonish and amaze my listeners or just to kind of press the limits as far as i can carry them or press them. one thing that had occurred to me was to call up all my former lovers and girlfriends.\n\nit was 11 o'clock in los angeles. and all - they were all living on the east coast because that's where i was originally from. so they - it was late at night in new york and washington, d.c., which was where they all lived. and i called one after another after another after another and woke most of them up and just told them that i was calling them live on the air and engaged them in conversation. and at the end of each conversation, i sang the song i remember you.\n\ngross: let's hear an excerpt of this program.\n\n(soundbite of radio show, let me not dream)\n\namy: hello?\n\nfrank: hello, amy?\n\namy: joe?\n\nfrank: yeah.\n\namy: hi.\n\nfrank: hi. how are you doing?\n\namy: i was asleep.\n\nfrank: well, i guess...\n\namy: what time is it?\n\nfrank: your time - it's probably 2:30 now. do you know what i'm doing?\n\namy: you just finished your show?\n\nfrank: no, my show is still on.\n\namy: oh.\n\nfrank: do you know what that means?\n\namy: am i on the air?\n\nfrank: that's right. you're on the air now.\n\namy: oh, well, glad i'm so sleepy.\n\nfrank: that's all right. i just want to sing you a song.\n\namy: you do?\n\nfrank: yeah. you can sing with me if you want to.\n\namy: oh.\n\nfrank: you ready? here we go.\n\n(soundbite of vinson hill and rich mattheson quartets' i remember you)\n\nfrank: (singing) i remember you. you're the one who made my dreams come true a few kisses ago.\n\nyou can sing along if you want to.

newark police camera system relies on residents, stirring privacy concerns\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption marco jeurissen/getty images marco jeurissen/getty images\n\nnewark, new jersey's largest city, is taking the concept of a neighborhood watch to a whole new level.\n\nthe city is installing hundreds of surveillance cameras to create a virtual block watch.\n\nsome residents are concerned about the technology's implications for people's privacy.\n\nmayor ras baraka says the new cameras replace the old system that was wiped out during hurricane sandy. he says these cameras are different: these cameras are going to be watched, and, baraka hopes, not only by the newark police department. we're also recruiting our neighborhood and our residents to participate and engage with us, he says.\n\nbut that engagement goes well beyond the residents.\n\nnewark's virtual patrol, as the system is called, allows anyone with an email address and internet connection to watch whatever activities the cameras capture — cars driving through intersections, a young woman leaving a corner store, children hanging out on a street.\n\nsixty-two cameras are already in operation. by january, there will be 300 cameras — that anyone, anywhere can watch — like adam schwartz. he's a senior lawyer at the electronic frontier foundation, a civil liberties nonprofit in california.\n\nto access the surveillance system on the newark police department website, schwartz simply creates an account and signs in. then, within seconds, he sees a map locating the blue cameras. so i can click on one of these cameras and see what's going on, he says.\n\nsuch easy access to the cameras could have a chilling effect on civil liberties, schwartz says. there are people who — if they are invited to go to a demonstration and they see one of these blue cameras is up — they might decide they don't want to show up.\n\nthe new technology could put black and brown people at risk for being targeted. it's lower-income and minority communities where these technologies are deployed and they lead to more arrests, schwartz says.\n\nthat's a concern for newarkers like linda carter and josie gonsalves. on the block where raymond boulevard intersects broad street, one of the 62 blocks being monitored by a surveillance camera, carter and gonsalves are gathered in front of a tax office.\n\nas the camera pans back and forth, they watch the video play in real time on my iphone via the newark police department website.\n\nthen, they see themselves.\n\nthose white things — those are the cameras, carter says. i can see you. that's us ... there we are. there's my red coat.\n\nafter the initial thrill of spotting themselves on the phone screen, carter expresses dread. i'm very, very concerned, she says. people are collecting information on us — who are they sharing it with and what is our power in the situation?\n\nit's like we're taking our power away as citizens, she continues, because we don't get to opt out, and everybody else can use it for whatever reason, whether it's good or bad.\n\ngonsalves says the technology changes how newarkers like her will carry themselves in public. we as citizens, the whole way in which we interact with each other, we're watching ourselves, watching our neighbors — and everyone becomes a suspect, she says.\n\nnot everyone finds the cameras bewildering. some residents say violent crimes like murder are still common, and the cameras add a layer of protection.\n\nthis is taking 'see something, say something' to a whole 'nother level, says steve surfaro, who visits newark often for work. surfaro is an official with the security industry association, a trade group that represents companies that build security and surveillance systems.\n\nafter taking a look at the newark police cameras, surfaro says he doesn't think the video resolution is clear enough to cause concern. what you're able to do is to see people. you're able to see vehicles. you can see weather, he says. but you can't really see license plates. you can't really recognize faces.\n\nhe says the cameras can capture activities where the public can help, like identifying fire, or a crowd gathered around someone in distress. one down side, though, is that the public could misread what they're seeing — like mistaking someone handing off a book to someone else as a drug deal.\n\nmayor baraka says newark is installing signs to let the public and the criminals know they're being watched. and he says that's not so unusual these days, when cameras are in stores and on people's homes.\n\nwhat we're trying to do, is really compile and organize all of this to give us an opportunity to stay ahead of some the violence and crime in the city, baraka says.\n\nso far, the city says more than 1,600 people have registered on the police department's website. that's 1,600 more sets of eyes watching the streets of newark.
lego says it is changing its policy after ai weiwei controversy\n\na photo of ai weiwei covered in lego bricks was posted to his instagram account. 😄 a photo posted by ai weiwei (@aiww) on jan 12, 2016 at 10:42pm pst\n\nlego says it is changing its guidelines for the purchase of large amounts of its iconic toy bricks, a policy that had generated a social media firestorm when used to block sales to chinese artist ai weiwei.\n\nthe company said in a statement that it will no longer ask people who want to buy the bricks in bulk what they're using them for:\n\ninstead, the customers will be asked to make it clear — if they intend to display their lego creations in public — that the lego group does not support or endorse the specific projects.\n\nin october, ai said lego had refused to sell him the bricks he needed for an exhibition on free speech at australia's national gallery of victoria. he intended to use the bricks to create portraits of freedom advocates.\n\na frequent critic of china who was imprisoned by the government, ai accused the danish company of censorship and said it was afraid to offend beijing.\n\nafter the company's decision, supporters of ai set up donation points around the world for people to donate used bricks. ai also told npr that he was flooded with messages of support on social media:\n\nthey're not necessarily museumgoers, but they understand what is the most important meaning of art, which is to really express yourself successfully and to really defend the essential values.\n\nai said pressure from his supporters had pressured lego to change its policy on bulk orders, and he told the associated press that it was a good move:
treating opioid addiction with a drug raises hope and controversy\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ricky carioti/the washington post/getty images ricky carioti/the washington post/getty images\n\nscientists and doctors say the case is clear: the best way to tackle the country's opioid epidemic is to get more people on medications that have been proven in studies to reduce relapses and, ultimately, overdoses.\n\nyet, only a fraction of the more than 4 million people believed to abuse prescription painkillers or heroin in the u.s. are being given what's called medication-assisted treatment.\n\none reason is the limited availability of the treatment. but it's also the case that stigma around the addiction drugs has inhibited their use.\n\nmethadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids. a phrase you often hear about medication-assisted treatment is that it's merely replacing one drug with another. while doctors and scientists strongly disagree with that characterization, it's a view that's widespread in recovery circles.\n\nnow, the white house is pushing to change the landscape for people seeking help. in his 2017 budget, president obama has asked congress for $1.1 billion in new funding to address the opioid epidemic, with almost all of it geared toward expanding access to medication-assisted treatment.\n\nthe white house is also highlighting success stories. at the national prescription drug abuse and heroin summit held in atlanta in march, obama appeared on stage with crystal oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from ohio. oertle spoke of her spiral into addiction, which began with prescription painkillers and progressed to heroin. she tried unsuccessfully to quit on her own several times, before being prescribed buprenorphine a year ago. i personally couldn't get through the withdrawal symptoms, oertle said in atlanta. i couldn't tough it out. i know some people can. i couldn't do it. this last time has been the most successful recovery for me.\n\nher experience isn't unique.\n\ni've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says michael botticelli, director of national drug control policy at the white house. we wouldn't do that with any other disease. if one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption meredith rizzo/npr meredith rizzo/npr\n\nbotticelli says patients should consider the evidence for medication-assisted treatment and together with their doctors make a decision about what's best for them.\n\nmethadone and buprenorphine have been tested in scores of clinical trials. researchers have found that when combined with counseling, they significantly reduce opioid use and keep people in treatment longer.\n\nwe have tons of experience with patients who remain in treatment for months and years, who do very well on relapse-prevention medicines, says dr. marc fishman, medical director at maryland treatment centers in baltimore. he says among his patients, primarily young people, about half remain with the program six months into treatment. studies have shown far worse outcomes for patients who detox without follow-up medications, with relapse rates topping 90 percent.\n\nshots - health news we found joy: an addict struggles to get treatment we found joy: an addict struggles to get treatment listen\n\nstill, there are many people who stand by the so-called abstinence route — recovery without the use of medications. their views are informed by personal experiences and deeply held beliefs about what constitutes true recovery.\n\nfor years, juan ramirez, 56, led a high-risk lifestyle to support his use of prescription painkillers. when you start robbing drug stores and drug dealers because of your drug habit, your life is not working right, he says.\n\na friend told ramirez about a doctor in baltimore who prescribed suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. he liked the way suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. he stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. i was still an addict, he says. it was just legal.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption meredith rizzo/npr meredith rizzo/npr\n\nthat line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including david lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in hagerstown, md. the home has 10 beds for men who are transitioning out of intensive drug treatment back into daily life. in addition to beds, lidz offers the men work with his contracting business, refurbishing houses. the emphasis is on hard work, personal responsibility and purpose. it's what worked for lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.\n\nwhen he started his work as a recovery advocate, lidz knew little about medication-assisted treatment and had yet to form an opinion about it. soon, he started getting reports from the group home that someone's suboxone had been stolen, or someone looked high, or that people were trading, selling and snorting suboxone. that to me just looks like heroin, lidz says.\n\nso he made a decision: he wouldn't accept anyone on it.\n\ntoday, that stance is threatening the group home and his business. now we've been told by clinical settings that we're essentially blacklisted, that they can't even mention our program if we won't take people on opiates, on suboxone, lidz says.\n\nhe worries it could lead to missed opportunities for people like charles testerman, who came to lidz's group home after several months in drug treatment. testerman describes his years of drug use as doing everything to excess. he drank, smoked marijuana, and got hooked on prescription painkillers and later heroin. when he couldn't afford heroin, he bought suboxone on the street, hoping it would help him stop using other drugs. it didn't work.\n\ni was doing suboxone in the mornings, as well as adderall to bring myself up. then at night, i was taking xanax, smoking weed and drinking, just to go to sleep every night, testerman says. it was just a constant cycle.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption meredith rizzo/npr meredith rizzo/npr\n\ntoday, he has an apprenticeship with a master woodworker at a place called the stoner farm, anglicized from steiner, the name of the family who built the place. testerman is working to restore an early 19th century barn there. i feel great, happy to be out here doing this, he says. it's just nice to wake up in the morning and not have to do anything to feel normal.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption meredith rizzo/npr meredith rizzo/npr\n\nfishman, the addiction doctor in baltimore, knows there are people like testerman who find the strength to have what he calls a life-changing conversion without medications. but, he cautions, not everyone can do it, and it's not scalable. he wants to convince the doubters that medication-assisted treatment is the best tool available at the moment, and, in making his case, he's willing to acknowledge its limitations.\n\nthis doesn't change my claim that it should be the standard of care, he says. but we don't have the penicillin for addiction. these are not curative medications. in having a nuanced, thoughtful discourse with people who might disagree with us, acknowledging those limitations i think would make us more credible.

that email came one hour after oklahoma health officials issued an update saying that the number of tests for the public remains limited to the point of rationing and that health care providers are

dittmar says, of course, there was the formal exclusion of women from politics. women couldn't run or vote. since then, there's been the informal exclusion based on gender stereotypes, like women can't lead. also, men have just been doing this a lot longer.\n\ndittmar: men in party leadership, political leadership, those are the people who are tapping candidates - right? - who are recruiting candidates to run and deciding who gets on the ballot.\n\nfadel: and while nevada's milestone is remarkable, progress around the country has been slow. right now less than 30 percent of state legislators across the u.s. are women. less than 25 percent of congress is female. and the data show the only way to reach gender parity is to nominate more women. the democrats are doing that. about 70 percent of women state legislators are democrats. and overall, republican women lost seats in the last election. and that's because far fewer women were nominated from that party. jill tolles, a republican nevada assembly member, says she's working within her party to make sure there's recruiting and mentorship.\n\njill tolles: before i ran for office, i did look at the makeup and think, wow. there's just not as many females in the republican party. and how do we change that?\n\nfadel: tolles says women in particular are reaching across the aisle in nevada with a bipartisan, bicameral women's caucus.\n\ntolles: we were able to come together over the areas where we share common ground and be able to advance some access to women's health care, like breast cancer screenings and access to birth control.\n\nfadel: this milestone, she says, is a continuation of that work. both assemblywoman tolles and senator spearman are headed back to carson city. but selena torres is serving for the first time. she's 23 and a high school english teacher.\n\nselena torres: it's really exciting to be a part of this female majority but also to be a latina sitting in that majority. i mean, when you have students that are recognizing, maybe for the first time, that they too have the ability to be involved and run for office - and it truly highlights the importance of having us in office.\n\nfadel: she's only a few years older than her students in a largely latino district in southern nevada. over a quarter of the state is latino. torres says nevada has always been a pioneering state with women trailblazers.\n\ntorres: when you think about nevada, we think about the wild west. and i think in a lot of ways, nevada still is the wild west.\n\nfadel: she says this place isn't afraid to do things that others haven't. leila fadel, npr news, las vegas.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
'you couldn't get elected dogcatcher!' no, seriously\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption amy kolb noyes/vermont public radio amy kolb noyes/vermont public radio\n\na couple of weeks ago, npr's weekend edition told you about america's only elected dogcatcher, zeb towne. he's held that position in the town of duxbury, vt. for 15 years in a row.\n\ntowne told us he had never been bothered by that timeworn political insult: you couldn't get elected dogcatcher!\n\nthe story really hit home for me, because i cover politics, and i love dogs, so i've put a lot of thought into how you would run a campaign to be elected dogcatcher.\n\nin fact, i've always thought that of all the elected positions out there, dogcatcher was the one i was best-suited to run for. my campaign platform would center around my proven track record of catching multiple neighborhood dogs.\n\ncampaign brochures would feature otis, a stray who showed up in my neighborhood a few years ago in sacramento. he was a small, dirty schnauzer-esque mutt who took up residence in a nearby bush. otis looked friendly and happy, but he'd dash away the moment you got near him.\n\nand, i should clarify, otis is the name i decided on when i made it a personal pet project to round otis up and bring him to the shelter. this led to several days' worth of coyote-and-roadrunner situations, including one that had me sprinting down the back alley with a leash, a jar of peanut butter and a schnauzer just a few yards ahead of me.\n\ni had a lot of time to focus on this task, since my wife had moved across the country to washington, and i was still looking for a job out there. after day two or three, she gently suggested that perhaps the otis mission had just a little bit to do with the stress of a job search, and i conceded she may have been onto something.\n\na neighbor and i finally rounded otis up, and i confirmed — after repeated calls to the shelter — that he found a happy ending somewhere in the pacific northwest.\n\nbut i hate to tell you, america's only elected dogcatcher did not get that same happy ending.\n\nturns out, it is against vermont law for a town to elect its own dogcatcher. after our story aired, someone from duxbury got in touch with the vermont league of cities and towns. a lawyer there pointed out the bad news: dogcatcher is not an official elected position in the state. for now, dogcatchers can only be appointed.\n\ntowne still has a job though. someone moved to appoint him dogcatcher, and the vote was unanimous. he even got an assistant.\n\ni guess duxbury has a lot of dogs on the loose. but if the town ever does change its rules and get the ok from the state to bring back elections, i may just have to run a carpetbagger campaign and challenge towne.
establishment republicans scramble to top trump\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption matt rourke/ap matt rourke/ap\n\nnew hampshire republicans have a track record of picking presidential candidates who often go on to win their party's nomination. usually, that means bolstering establishment candidates. but this year, billionaire donald trump is polling far ahead of the rest of the pack. that leaves his rivals fighting amongst themselves in the hope that one of them can take down trump in the state that holds the first primary.\n\nthere's not much time left for establishment republicans to settle on a favorite. and with no clear challenger to trump's dominance in new hampshire, other candidates and their superpacs are lobbing attack ads at each other.\n\none ad from new jersey gov. chris christie opens with the words, marco rubio is attacking gov. chris christie. it's a response to the florida senator's criticism of christie's record on a range of issues, including gun control.\n\nthat back and forth continued on the campaign trail in new hampshire on friday. during a stop at a weapons factory in newport, rubio was presented with a hunting rifle before addressing a room full of plant workers.\n\ni'm gonna tell you what's really important, that our nominee be someone who is a strong supporter of the second amendment. and there are republicans running who are not supporters of the second amendment, in the way you and i want them to be, rubio said.\n\nin addition to attacking christie's record on gun control, which evolved over time, rubio has made an issue of christie's close working relationship with president obama after hurricane sandy battered new jersey. it's all meant to question christie's conservative credentials.\n\na few hours later in hollis, n.h., rubio himself was the target of attacks from former florida gov. jeb bush.\n\nthe senators sometimes get off into their world, their little ecosystem of washington, d.c.-talk. i don't know if you've noticed. it's mind-numbing, actually, bush said.\n\nbush joked that rubio, and sen. ted cruz of texas, live in an alternative universe. he also took aim at trump, after a member of the audience asked how bush could distinguish himself in a year when voters seem to favor big personalities. bush said he plans to stay the course, arguing that having the ideas and experience to be president should be enough.\n\nand if it isn't, i'm not gonna change who i am. i'm just not gonna do it. i'm not gonna play the game. i'm not gonna insult someone just because i'm told that's the way to connect with voters, bush said. really? really? i mean trump does this, and it sets me off.\n\nafterward as the crowd thinned, milt janosky and jim polus, both of hollis, stayed to chat about the race. janosky said he likes bush, but he's also considering christie, ohio gov. john kasich, and former hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina.\n\njanosky said he's definitely not voting for trump, calling him dangerous.\n\npolus is supporting bush, but said there are a lot of good establishment choices.\n\npeople like myself and milt – we have three or four candidates that we think could be good. so that vote is being split four different ways, he said.\n\njanosky said those voters could easily defeat trump — if they could just settle on one candidate they could all support.
small donors power and inspire the sanders campaign\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption scott olson/getty images scott olson/getty images\n\nwhen bernie sanders took the stage sunday night in madison, wis., the crowd of about 5,000 went wild. one of the biggest applause lines came when sanders talked about his campaign taking on the establishment.\n\nthese guys may have unlimited sums of money, the vermont senator said. they may control the media, they may control the economy, they may control the political system. but when millions of people stand up together united and demand change, we will not be stopped.\n\nsanders' supporters aren't just cheering him on, they are donating to the cause. one supporter at last night's rally, joe eichenseher, said he has contributed to past campaigns, but never with the frequency he is giving to sanders.\n\ni feel like it's a people's campaign, and it's what democracy should be, he said. it should be from the people.\n\nthe people are giving, again and again. in march, sanders raised $44 million.\n\nthat ability to raise large sums of money in tiny increments has enabled the sanders campaign to outspend hillary clinton on television advertising in more than a dozen states. it's also allowed him to claim purity, while implying clinton is beholden to big-money interests.\n\nwe have revolutionized campaign financing in the united states of america, sanders said over the weekend. i don't have a superpac. i don't get money from wall street or anybody else and i am proud of that.\n\nrevolution may be overstating things, according to julia azari, who teaches political science at marquette university in milwaukee.\n\nthe small-donors movement has been going on for a while now, azari says. obama also talked a lot about that in 2008. i don't know that sanders has caused that so much as he's coming in at a time where that narrative seems to be pretty popular.\n\nopinion polling reveals a widespread public disgust with the nation's campaign finance system. republican ted cruz boasts of his small-dollar donors. donald trump says because of his personal wealth he can't be bought. and clinton's campaign touts support from more than a million individual donors.\n\nbut clinton has also raised money in a more traditional way than sanders — with a mix of small online donations and big-dollar fundraisers in the homes of the rich and famous. she also has a superpac backing her. even so, clinton has, since the very first day of her campaign, criticized the system.\n\nwe need to fix our dysfunctional political system and get unaccountable money out of it once and for all, clinton says, even if that takes a constitutional amendment.\n\nhowever, the clinton campaign also said early on it wouldn't unilaterally disarm, with conservative superpacs lined up against her. clinton is also doing something sanders is not. she has raised nearly $30 million for the democratic party and state party committees. that money will be used to help elect candidates further down on the ballot as well as the democratic presidential nominee - whether that's clinton or sanders.
a biden cabinet secretary for arts? advocates are hopeful\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ann arnold-ogden ann arnold-ogden\n\narts and culture make up a huge, $877 billion industry that generates more than five million jobs across the country. but the amount of federal funding for the arts is tiny when compared with smaller industries like agriculture — so what are arts organizations hoping for under the biden administration?\n\nthe national endowment for the arts gives grants to organizations across the country — from big ones like lincoln center and npr to small ones like the wichita falls alliance for arts and culture. west texas wichita falls. we're not in kansas, says executive director margie reese, who adds that her group used one of their nea grants to commission regional artists to make murals in economically distressed areas.\n\nfor vernon, texas, 25 year old selena mize painted musician and native son, the late roy orbison. it was a name mize didn't know — until reese played her one of his songs, pretty woman.\n\nthe power of visual arts to bring a community back to life — this is what our attempt was with that mural.\n\nat first i didn't know that was roy orbison, mize laughs. i thought it was elvis presley. she says growing up she heard both singers while listening to music with her father and grandparents. her mural shows orbison with his trademark dark sunglasses, playing his guitar. she says the attention she got for the work was life-changing. the community was very excited and open about it, and it's just something i would never forget.\n\nthis bright, sunshiny mural is bringing pride back to vernon, texas, reese says. the power of visual arts to bring a community back to life — this is what our attempt was with that mural.\n\nwhen it comes to government support of the arts, reese is a veteran, having worked in the cultural affairs departments in dallas and los angeles. she's seen presidents and nea chairs come and go. when you have a change in administration and a shift in philosophy about arts funding, she says, the entire field begins to worry about what's going to happen, how is this change going to affect us?\n\nsteady is the word reese uses to describe federal arts funding under president trump. even though each of his budgets proposed eliminating the arts and humanities endowments — as well as the institute of museum and library services — congress rejected the cuts.\n\nthere's a lot of love for libraries and for museums inside the beltway, says crosby kemper, who was the trump administration's pick to head the imls. like the endowments, the institute distributes grants, conducts research and helps shape policies that affect museums and libraries. even though republicans often talk about cutting funding for the arts, kemper points out that all three budgets have increased slightly over the last three years: i think you have to look at what actually happens, and what actually happens for the imls, the nea and the neh is they have a lot of support in the political world — and including inside the administration.\n\nbut for actor kal penn, trump's rhetoric has been damaging to the arts. penn was appointed by president obama to the president's committee on the arts and humanities, an advisory group founded in 1982. he had planned to stay on, but after trump's handling of the deadly white supremacist rally in charlottesville, he and everyone else on the committee resigned.\n\nthe president's committee on the arts and humanities was then never relaunched under the trump administration, just to show you that it really wasn't a priority at all, he says.\n\npenn says he wants to see the biden administration give the endowments an astronomical increase.\n\ni think it's important now more than ever to be bold, he says, noting that the arts benefit education, innovation, mental and emotional health. plus, he says, it's a good investment.\n\nwhen you say, ok, well, why did you spend all this money to save this theater — yes, you're saving the theater, and maybe you're saving the 500 jobs that the theater provides for the local community, but you're also then saving the restaurants that people go to the night of the show, he says. you're saving the hotels that the visiting artists stay at. you're saving, you know, the the parking facility. and it may sound like very little, but when you when you start to multiply that by the numbers of businesses like this that exist around the country, you can see why investing in in the arts really makes economic sense.\n\nearlier this year, the bureau of economic analysis and the national endowment for the arts released a report that said the arts contributed 4.5 percent to the country's gdp in 2017. that's more than agriculture and transportation. arts advocate charles segars, head of the ovation tv network, says it's time for the arts to be taken just as seriously by the white house, by creating a cabinet level secretary of arts and culture.\n\nit centralizes, in the positive sense of the word, all of the leverage of the united states government. remember, you have arts pockets throughout the department of state, department of defense. even transportation and agriculture has a taste of that, of arts programs that they help support.\n\nsegars says the cabinet-level position would also handle intellectual property rights and exports. years ago, music producer quincy jones tried to get obama to create a secretary of arts; it never happened, but segars says he thinks it's a realistic goal. i think it's going to take time, he says, but we all have to talk about it.\n\ncrosby kemper of the imls says he can't predict what the next administration will do, but he thinks biden's personality points in that direction. i'd say the first and most important thing is that he's a great lover of irish poetry and therefore a clearly a civilized man.\n\n\n\nthe biden transition team did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nthis story was edited for radio by rose friedman, and adapted for the web by petra mayer
democrats unveil legislation to abolish the federal death penalty\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption michael conroy/ap michael conroy/ap\n\nsen. dick durbin, d-illinois, the incoming chair of the senate judiciary committee, and rep. ayanna pressley, d-mass., are unveiling legislation that would seek to end federal capital punishment, putting a focus on the issue as their party prepares to take over complete control of congress, along with the white house.\n\n\n\nthe democratic proposal, shared first with npr, comes as the party will have unified control of congress after victories in two georgia senate races, a change in fortunes for democratic legislative priorities. the legislation would end capital punishment at the federal level and require the resentencing of all federal inmates on death row.\n\n\n\nthere are three lives that hang in the balance this week alone, pressley said, speaking along with durbin in an exclusive joint interview. and this is why we reintroduced this bill this week and are urging congress to act immediately to pass it. state-sanctioned murder is not justice.\n\nformer attorney general william barr announced in july 2019 that the justice department would resume federal executions, ending what had been a nearly two-decade hiatus. at the time, barr and justice department officials said they were carrying out the will of judges and juries and providing justice for staggeringly brutal murders.\n\nthe federal government executed 10 prisoners last year, more civilian prisoners than all the states combined over the same period. and more executions are scheduled for the final days of the trump administration before president-elect joe biden takes office.\n\nhere we are in the closing hours of the trump administration, when they are in a mad dash to give pardons for federal crimes committed by their friends, and an equally mad dash to try to execute these people who have been on death row for years, if not decades, said durbin, who will take over as chairman of the senate judiciary committee in the coming weeks. that is just unconscionable.\n\n\n\nfor his part, biden has said he wants to work with congress to pass a law to eliminate capital punishment at the federal level and to incentivize states to follow that example.\n\n\n\nlast year, transition spokesman t.j. ducklo told npr that the president-elect opposes the death penalty, now and in the future, and as president will work to end its use.\n\n\n\npressley said she has been in active conversation with the biden-harris transition team about the issue, and that she is very optimistic about the chances for passage of the legislation. late last year, she led her colleagues in a letter to the incoming administration, calling on it to abolish the death penalty as well as to use executive action to end all federal executions.\n\n\n\ni'm calling on him to use that full authority with the stroke of a pen to halt all federal executions and save lives, pressley said. he should also require the department of justice to no longer seek the death penalty for future cases, and permanently dismantle the terre haute facility where those federal executions take place.\n\nbut ultimately, pressley said, passing the legislation is critical so that the end of capital punishment at the federal level has the force of law, preventing a future president from reinstating it.\n\n\n\ngive that the senate will be divided 50-50, with vice president-elect kamala harris as the tiebreaker, there will still be partisan hurdles to cross. it is unclear whether such a proposal would garner support among house and senate republicans.\n\n\n\ndurbin said that the senate will still take up a broader criminal justice reform package.\n\n\n\nthe senate judiciary committee, throughout our modern history, has always played a leadership role on issues of the moment, durbin said. it really was the focal point of a national conversation on issues of justice. it unfortunately, in the last few years abandoned that role.\n\n\n\ndurbin added that he hopes that as chairman, we can restore the role of this committee in the new congress on a bipartisan basis.\n\n\n\nsupport for capital punishment is at its lowest point over the past five decades, according to gallup polling. while there have been declines in support for the death penalty among democrats and independents, according to gallup's historical data, support among republicans has remained relatively steady.\n\n\n\npressley said she believes there was a very significant flashpoint in the debate over capital punishment when the justice department proceeded last month with the execution of brandon bernard. bernard spent more than half of his life on death row for a crime committed when he was 18. in the final days of his life, he pleaded with president trump to grant him clemency, and his case drew high-profile attention.\n\n\n\npressley, who introduced similar legislation in 2019, said that she saw an outpouring of support for ending federal capital punishment in the days surrounding bernard's execution.\n\n\n\ndurbin also acknowledged changing public sentiment.\n\n\n\nbecause of dna and other methods of investigation, we have discovered that many people who have been sentenced to death were innocent, durbin said. one-hundred seventy-three people in the last few years have been exonerated on death row. we got it wrong. the system of justice failed.\n\n\n\none of the longest-standing criticisms of capital punishment is the racial disparities in the united states. some studies have shown that defendants convicted of killing white victims are sentenced more harshly than those who have killed black victims.\n\n\n\nwhile we're in the midst of this national reckoning on racial justice, abolishing the death penalty must be a part of that discourse but also our legislative actions, pressley said.\n\n\n\ndurbin added, if we truly believe that all lives matter, and black lives matter, and brown lives matter and the lives of poor people matter, it's time for us to make sure that our system of justice reflects that.
ohio primary postponed at last minute due to coronavirus after legal struggle\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption gene j. puskar/ap gene j. puskar/ap\n\nupdated at 9:05 a.m. et tuesday\n\nafter intense legal wrangling, ohio postponed its tuesday primary election just hours before polls were set to open.\n\nearly tuesday morning, the state supreme court denied a judge's attempt to let the primary continue after gov. mike dewine had asked the court to delay the primary until june 2 because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nlate monday evening, dewine sought to bypass the judge by announcing that ohio health director amy acton would order the polls closed as a health emergency.\n\nthree other states — arizona, florida and illinois — are still holding primaries on tuesday.\n\nwe've had to make a lot of tough decisions over the past few weeks, but everything we've done has been about saving lives, dewine tweeted tuesday morning. if we don't take these actions now, it'll be too late. this is quite literally a matter of life and death.\n\nsecretary of state frank larose had issued guidance to all county boards of elections in ohio on monday that they must post notice on their websites, social media, at the board of elections, and at polling places that in-person voting for the march 17, 2020 presidential primary election is suspended.\n\nduring my service overseas, i've witnessed people risking their lives to cast a ballot, larose told npr on monday night. i've walked in the footsteps of heroes on the streets of selma, ala., where people had to fight for the right to vote. elections are something i don't take lightly. the only thing in the world that i think that takes precedent over conducting this free and fair election is the health and safety of ohioans.\n\nohio's initial announcement came at roughly the same time that president trump was laying out new guidelines for americans that include avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people for the rest of the month.\n\nin a joint statement, dewine and larose said monday that the public health warnings to limit gatherings means it simply isn't possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by ohioans.\n\nunlike many states, ohio's governor and secretary of state don't have the power to delay the election on their own. instead, with the approval of both political parties, they supported a lawsuit filed by people who believe they're vulnerable to the virus and did not plan to contest the suit.\n\npeople should not have to choose between their rights and their health, dewine said.\n\na number of voting-rights advocacy groups also supported the decision, including the league of women voters and the lawyers' committee for civil rights under law.\n\nalso on monday, kentucky postponed its may 19 primary to june 23. unlike ohio, kentucky state law allows the secretary of state and governor to jointly decide to change the date of an election due to a declared state of emergency.\n\na potential lifesaver\n\nin a statement on monday, larose said the sudden announcement less than 24 hours before the election was made after new information about the virus led the ohio department of health to recommend that all ohioans age 65 and older self-quarantine.\n\nunder the plan he is proposing, absentee voting would be allowed to continue until june 2, and all votes that have already been cast would be counted as normal.\n\npresident trump said monday that he thought postponing the primaries was unnecessary but also said the decision was ultimately up to the respective states.\n\nformer vice president joe biden's campaign said in a statement, we will follow the guidance offered by state public health officials for how to best ensure that their populations are looked after while encouraging participation in our democracy.\n\nohio is now the fourth state to postpone its primary because of the coronavirus. louisiana announced late last week that it would push its april primary to june, while georgia announced over the weekend that its march 24 primary would be moved to may. separately, alabama is considering postponing its march 31 u.s. senate primary runoff.\n\nin retrospect, it may be that we view these delays as being lifesavers, said charles stewart, an elections expert at the massachusetts institute of technology. on the other hand, it could be that we view the delays as being overreaches. we just don't know at this point.
how scientists trace new coronavirus variants\n\nnpr's ailsa chang talks with biologists pardis sabeti and sharon peacock about how genomic sequencing was used in the u.k. to trace a new coronavirus variant and what the u.s. can learn from it.\n\nailsa chang, host:\n\na new variant of the coronavirus has now been found in at least 10 states. the strain, known as b117, is thought to be more contagious. and u.k. scientists first alerted the world about it in december. in the meantime, we have heard reports of other additional variants found in south africa and in japan. so what does this say about the coronavirus' ability to evolve and our ability to fight it?\n\nwell, i have a couple of virus detectives with me now. pardis sabeti is a computational biologist at the broad institute in massachusetts, and sharon peacock is the director of the covid-19 genomics u.k. consortium. welcome to both of you.\n\npardis sabeti: it's a pleasure to be here.\n\nsharon peacock: thank you very much.\n\nchang: so dr. peacock, let's just start with you. you know, it was your team that helped track down this new covid variant. can you just explain - how did you first figure out that you found something new?\n\npeacock: well, there are many, many mutations in the viral population. and what you need to do is look for a signal in people for some different viral behavior. and so in december, what we noticed was that there were numbers of cases of covid-19 in people in the south of england.\n\nnow, they were under lockdown restrictions. and strangely, in other parts of the country, that same lockdown was controlling the disease very well. but in the south of england, it wasn't managing to control spread of the infection. and so at that point during the investigation - the outbreak investigation - it became very apparent this was associated with this new variant, which contained a large number of mutations, which we hadn't seen before. and that's what really set it off.\n\nchang: ok. and how different, exactly, is this strain - b117 - from the initial strain sequenced in china at the very beginning of the pandemic? like, how different both genetically and how different in the way the two viruses interact with us as human hosts?\n\npeacock: this virus is actually strikingly different, and it has 23 different mutations. and what concerns us is that some of those mutations are in part of the virus called the spike protein, which is the protein that interacts with humans and attaches to human cells and is part of the entry process into the body. and so this is actually very unusual. but in particular, it has mutations that could change the biology - the way that the virus interacts with humans.\n\nchang: well, ok. dr. sabeti, along with the u.k. variant, scientists have found other significant variants in south africa and in japan. is that all that surprising to you or were scientists expecting this to happen as we got deeper and deeper into the pandemic?\n\nsabeti: you know, these are viruses, and like everything on earth, they change over time. but viruses, in particular, they're replicating and spreading quickly, and they have high mutation rates compared to us. just the way that their biological machinery works is they're making more changes each time they replicate. so this is expected. we saw during the ebola outbreak, during the previous sars outbreaks, during every outbreak, you know, that happens, viruses are mutating all the time. that's what we expect.\n\nchang: so can tracking these sorts of variants help us curb the spread of the virus in some way?\n\nsabeti: it can. and, you know, i think it's very important to do - as the u.k. did - is to be able to scan at high resolution in real time, or near real time. because if you do identify something like the b117 mutation, and you notice, hey, there's something going on in this part of the country and oh, there's this new variant to pay attention to, we can scan for where that variant is occurring and try to then move our public health resources, which are inherently limited, but to take all the resources we can to stop that variant from going anywhere.\n\nchang: well, given that this u.k. strain appears to be more contagious, let me ask both of you this question. does our current public health guidance around social distancing and mask wearing, does that need to change?\n\npeacock: there's no reason to think that standard advice about infection prevention and control needs to change. so we still need to wash our hands, wear masks and distant - socially distance. and so it is more contagious, but there's every reason to think that if we follow the guidance, that disease transmission can be reduced and prevented.\n\nchang: and dr. sabeti?\n\nsabeti: yeah. i think that the guidelines that we have in place are very good. and they work for most viruses - you know, washing hands and social distancing, wearing masks. the more contagious a virus, the more it means we have to be really regimented about that. and any breaches at all, and you could have mass containment failure. and so it just makes us have to really ante up on those.\n\nchang: so, you know, this strain, as we keep saying, was first detected in the u.k. so let me ask you, dr. sabeti - how equipped do you think the u.s. is to detect these kinds of genetic changes in the virus moving forward?\n\nsabeti: the u.s. is very equipped to detect these kinds of mutations, and they have been doing across the board. the difference between the u.k. and the u.s. in this instance is the u.k., on a national level, really put down a lot of funds and support and made this a priority whereas - i'll say that my colleagues and i here in the u.s., most of this work is done on our discretionary funds, on very limited budgets. and so we're very poised and doing a lot of great and exciting sequencing across the u.s., but not at the level and the scale that's needed. and so we've been calling for some time - for many, many years - to have national funding to scale this up. we're poised and able to do it. literally, it's just about getting more sequences through the pipeline, which is more funding and support and prioritization of the need.\n\nchang: so as this pandemic continues to drag on, what else will you be watching for? like, are you going to be expecting more strains to emerge?\n\npeacock: i think it's very likely that we'll see new variants emerge. and what we're really watching for are variants that actually are transmissible, but that actually have the ability to escape immunity. so that's either the immunity that's acquired naturally if you have covid-19 once or immunity that's developed through vaccination. so in particular, looking for combinations of mutations that could allow a virus to be very fit and spread amongst the population, but that could also threaten the efficacy of vaccines.\n\nthe other thing we worry about is mutations that could affect the way that diagnostic tests can work. so some mutations can affect the ability of a diagnostic test to detect the virus. so also looking out for those types of mutations.\n\nchang: that is sharon peacock, director of the covid-19 genomics u.k. consortium, and pardis sabeti of the broad institute. thank you to both of you.\n\npeacock: thank you.\n\nsabeti: thank you.\n\n(soundbite of zalagasper's sebi)\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump's gunboat diplomacy in asia may prove quite different from syria\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption bullit marquez/ap bullit marquez/ap\n\npresident trump is responding to another tough foreign policy crisis with gunboat diplomacy, but the second deployment is likely to look very different from the first.\n\nu.s. pacific command has ordered the aircraft carrier uss carl vinson and its strike group, which includes a cruiser and two destroyers, to report on station in the western pacific ocean, instead of sailing for australia as planned.\n\nthe navy's official announcement about the decision did not mention north korea, but leaders in washington hope that leaders in its capital, pyongyang, will get the picture.\n\nthe strike group is heading back to korean waters — it also visited last month — following north korea's launch of a ballistic missile ahead of the recent visit by chinese president xi jinping to trump's golf resort in florida. something else also has happened since then: trump ordered u.s. navy warships on the other side of the world to attack a syrian airfield after warplanes based there used chemical weapons in an airstrike that killed scores of people in idlib, including children.\n\ntrump's choice to launch that missile strike was a surprise about-face after administration officials appeared to take the heat off syria's president, bashar assad, saying the u.s. would scrap its previous position that assad could no longer govern. as the world continues watching to see whether trump's attack was a one-time outing designed to send a message — or the first shot in a new war against assad's regime — north korea's regime has new reason for pause.\n\nor so washington hopes.\n\nnorth korea is looking for trouble, trump wrote on twitter on tuesday. if china decides to help, that would be great. if not, we will solve the problem without them! u.s.a.\n\nthe president's warning followed tough talk over the weekend by other administration leaders.\n\nthis is a rogue regime that is now a nuclear-capable regime, and president xi and president trump agreed that that is unacceptable, national security adviser h.r. mcmaster said on fox news sunday. the president has asked us to be prepared to give him a full range of options to remove that threat to the american people and to our allies and partners in the region.\n\nand before that, secretary of state rex tillerson said that all options are on the table as the trump administration calculates how to deal with the threats north korea poses to its neighbors and, potentially, the united states.\n\nin practical terms, however, trump and his aides may be able to do less than they did in syria. in that case, tomahawk cruise missiles launched from two navy destroyers destroyed syrian warplanes, air defense systems, fuel and other supplies. but nothing similar is likely from the carl vinson or its escorts — in fact, if any shots are fired it could be the start of a serious major conflict.\n\nin syria, the united states could hit a target with a low chance of it striking back, in the midst of a conflict that's already been raging for years. in korea, kim jong un has many potential ways to respond quickly and savagely by lashing out at a close u.s. ally, south korea, which hosts nearly 30,000 u.s. troops to help defend it.\n\nthat means the navy can't change the conversation by hitting north korea with a few cruise missiles the way it did in syria. north and south korea have tens of thousands of troops and huge arsenals pointed at each other on each side of the demilitarized zone that separates them. occasional flare-ups since the armistice in 1953 have claimed some lives, but the peninsula hasn't seen major combat.\n\nthe stakes, however, are higher than they've ever been: north korea is building nuclear weapons and marching toward the ability to fit them atop its ballistic missiles. that means it could hit south korea; another archenemy, japan; or potentially even the continental united states in a few years.\n\nnorth korea says that it would respond to any military action by ordering a full retaliation, putting millions of lives in immediate danger. pyongyang has further compounded the problem by deploying its ballistic missiles on mobile launchers. if a crisis reached a flashpoint, north korea watchers say there's no guarantee the u.s. military could find and destroy all the missiles quickly enough to stop a launch.\n\nthere's also no telling how north korea's youthful strongman, kim jong un, might respond to a serious military crisis, or how brittle his regime might prove. if kim and his top aides were killed in a u.s. attempt to decapitate north korea before it could order a ballistic attack, that might cause the whole government to collapse.\n\nnorth korea's patron, china, which supplies much of its food and fuel, would not look kindly on any such outcome, or on any military action by the united states. beijing faulted trump's attack on syria after xi's visit and although the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized korean peninsula, per the white house, china has given trump no commitment to rein in kim.\n\npyongyang, meanwhile, warned of catastrophic consequences if washington tried to follow up its syria attack in north korea.\n\nthat's actually a step down from north korea's rhetoric from the last time the carl vinson strike group sailed near the korean peninsula, when it said a knife will be stabbed into the throat of the carrier.\n\nbut despite all the supercharged rhetoric and intense regional scrutiny, the ships came and went then without incident, the way american warships have for decades. as the carl vinson and its escorts make their way north again now, the world is watching to see whether this visit also goes according to routine.
sanders supporter creates superdelegate 'hit list'; superdelegates not amused\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption super delegate list/screen shot by npr super delegate list/screen shot by npr\n\nto bernie sanders supporters, the idea that democratic superdelegates — elected officials and other party elites who can vote however they wish at the convention — could tip the nomination to hillary clinton seems terribly undemocratic.\n\nand so, they're trying to convince superdelegates, officially known as unpledged party leaders and elected officials, to change their allegiance.\n\nthere are several online petitions. one calls for the elimination of superdelegates altogether. another asks superdelegates to align their choice with regular voters, not party elites, and it has more than 200,000 signatures.\n\nat the moment, more than halfway through the primary process, this would favor clinton, who leads the popular vote by more than 2 million votes and has a more than 200-pledged-delegate lead (that is, delegates who align with the results of state primaries and caucuses).\n\nbut sanders supporters point to the senator's string of recent wins and figure by the time the last vote is counted in california, he will have the popular lead. and then, under this scenario, it will be up to superdelegates, who make up roughly 15 percent of total convention delegates, to decide who gets the nomination.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mary altaffer/ap mary altaffer/ap\n\nnobody is going to arrive in philadelphia with enough delegates to win the nomination, said jeff weaver, sanders' campaign manager. and the superdelegates don't vote until you actually get into the convention process. so there's been a lot of talk about how the republicans are going into an open convention. well, the truth of the matter is, it looks like the democrats are going into an open convention as well.\n\nit's true that no one will likely have the 2,383 delegates needed for the nomination strictly out of the pledged delegates. but that's also because that number is a majority of all the voting delegates, which includes superdelegates.\n\nthe sanders campaign still has its focus on winning as many pledged delegates as possible in the states still yet to vote, like new york, pennsylvania and california and the campaign is trying to direct supporters looking to help to volunteering or organizing in those states. in fact the campaign's website lists hundreds of organizing events, many posted by volunteers, but the campaign has moved to remove any events related to reaching out to superdelegates.\n\nbut this hasn't stopped sanders' enthusiastic supporters from taking matters into their own hands. this week, a sanders fan named spencer thayer created the superdelegate hit list, a website to compile and share the contact information of superdelegates, so they can be persuaded. it is not affiliated with the sanders campaign, but a campaign spokesman didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nthayer, who answered questions over email, later changed the name simply to superdelegate list.\n\nthe intent of the branding was to parody the famous clinton hit list, this was a tongue–in–cheek attempt at parody which i thought would encourage resharing, thayer said. the branding began to detract from the campaign's purpose, so it wasn't a hard decision to make the change once it was clear it wasn't working.\n\nthayer's goal with the site was to make it easier for voters to get in touch with superdelegates.\n\ntoggle caption super delegate hit list/screen shot by npr\n\nthe superdelegate system is rigged to protect establishment politicians and shut down populism, thayer said. superdelegates, by their very nature, diminish the value of the vote by giving an elite constituency of representatives, party leaders, and even lobbyists extra power. the superdelegate list exists to help voters challenge this undemocratic system. contacting our elected representatives and party leaders and holding them to account is an american tradition. this is the only way to keep the voter base from being patronized or ignored.\n\nsuperdelegates have been hearing from sanders supporters for months — and it's not always pleasant. akilah ross ensley is with the young democrats of america, and she's a superdelegate who plans to support clinton. she has to check her professional facebook page several times a day to deal with all the messages and posts.\n\nyou should be ashamed of yourself, ensley reads from a recent facebook message she received. maybe you will do some soul searching and have some integrity and think about the decisions you're making and its implications.\n\nensley said she's been called names, and there have been expletives.\n\nthey said, you know, you should go to hell, said ensley, describing another message. how dare you vote against your own interests as an african-american woman. i expected you would be smarter than that.\n\nwhen clinton-backing super delegate joyce elliott heard she was on, what at the time was called the superdelegate hit list, she was taken aback.\n\nthat is, that is very interesting, elliott said after laughing uncomfortably. as far as i know, this is probably only the second time i've been on a hit list, and the other one was not pleasant.\n\nelliott is a state senator in arkansas and the last time she was on a hit list, it was over legislation she had introduced. that time, she said, the fbi got involved. this list isn't as scary. although, she has heard from 20 or 30 sanders supporters trying to get her to switch.\n\nsome of them will tell me, you know, how awful hillary is, therefore, i should support bernie, and then tell me how great bernie is, said elliott, who has known the clintons since the 1970s. and that's the kind of thing i think that is not helpful.\n\nfor ken martin, the chairman of the minnesota democratic party, the flow of messages is constant — 20 a day, he said. his state went for sanders in its caucuses, and the pressure to switch from clinton to sanders is intense.\n\nsomeone received my cellphone number, and they posted that, and so i'm getting calls on my personal cellphone from people all over the country, martin said.\n\nwhen thayer, the creator of the superdelegate list, was told people were feeling harassed and unpersuaded, here's what he said:\n\nit's likely that most callers are actually polite. if a few people contacting superdelegates are being obscene they'll of course drown out reasonable voices and harden opinions. however, it's useful to look at what's causing some of the anger and outrage we're seeing. voters know they are being disenfranchised by superdelegate influence and these privileged voters are a reasonable target for frustration. and, let's be honest, if superdelegates aren't prepared to deal with the public, they shouldn't be party officials.\n\nbut all this freelance lobbying may be unnecessary. it has been the tradition of superdelegates, even in contentious primaries, to ultimately vote at the convention for the candidate with the most popular votes and pledged delegates.\n\ntad devine, a senior adviser to sanders' campaign, was actually involved in the creation of superdelegates, as a way to get party officials more involved in selecting the democratic nominee.\n\nthat was always done with the understanding that the voters would determine the outcome of this process, and i think they'll do it this time, devine said back in february when the superdelegate controversy was flaring up after the new hampshire primary.
in vermont, a town is divided over syrian refugees\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nina keck/vpr nina keck/vpr\n\nlast week, the first two of an expected 25 syrian refugee families arrived in rutland, vt., a scenic, blue-collar town of 16,000 people.\n\nnow that president trump is expected to call for a temporary ban on syrian refugees entering the u.s., these families may never be joined by the 23 others.\n\nfor some in rutland, that's welcome news. but others say this rural community desperately needs the youth and diversity refugees would bring.\n\nthe two syrian families — four adults and five children — arrived without fanfare, at night. they were exhausted after two days of travel from turkey.\n\nrutland mayor christopher louras, a champion of refugee resettlement, helped both families move in with host families. the newcomers hope to have their own apartments soon.\n\nas our new neighbors were fleeing for their lives, coming to a new home a half a world away to rebuild those lives, they needed to understand that they were welcome, he said.\n\nspeaking through an interpreter this week, members of one family said they felt relieved to be in vermont. at first, we came here, and we were surprised by the very, very, warm welcome by the people of rutland, one syrian said. the mayor, our caseworker, our host family, all came and welcomed us, and since then, it never stopped, and people have just welcomed us and helped us in every way.\n\nlast year, louras applied on behalf of rutland to receive the syrian refugees, beating out several other vermont towns to do so.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nina keck/vpr nina keck/vpr\n\nsince then, volunteers in town have been active for months, gathering donations and furniture for the new families, taking free arabic classes and attending seminars on middle eastern history and syrian culture. the local high school is planning a syrian dinner to help introduce the refugee families to their new community.\n\ndespite all the excitement and goodwill, there remains an uncomfortable divide over bringing syrians to town.\n\nyou get a sense of it at the local farmers market, where vendors sell everything from kombucha and winter vegetables to steaming cups of mulled cider.\n\nsome in the crowd worry about the vetting process for refugees — is it strong enough? others are more concerned about the cost of refugee resettlement and how it will affect city and school budgets.\n\nlocal school officials and the mayor have assured residents that the newcomers won't be a burden or cost local taxpayers more, but many are still not convinced.\n\nmichael spafford, 51, took a break from selling fudge to admit he's torn by the issue.\n\ni know the mayor and i know his family, says spafford. i know they were from greece. and my family was from italy. i get that america is open-arms to all the people from different countries and that we're a melting pot. but what i'm concerned about is, i know people who are living in the woods because they're poor and homeless, and i know veterans who aren't getting proper care.\n\nspafford says he can't forget something president trump said recently, that america is giving money out to so many other countries and so many areas. i can't help but think we should be taking care of our own first.\n\nspafford pauses. i know that comes across as selfish, he says, and my heart aches for the refugees. but my heart also aches for the locals, our own, first.\n\nrefugee proponents — and there are many in rutland — counter it's not an either-or dilemma. but it's a debate that's been raging for months.\n\nback in april, when louras announced plans to bring in the refugee families, many were surprised. rutland has never taken in refugees before. the mayor emphasized that helping syrians was the right thing to do. but he also believes refugees can help solve a problem: rutland's shrinking population.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nina keck/vpr nina keck/vpr\n\nlyle jepson, executive director of the rutland economic development corp., says the city's population is expected to decline by 10 percent to 16 percent by 2030. most of that drop will be among those younger than 50.\n\nwhat that means is we're entering a crisis period, says jepson. we are retiring, we are living much longer and there are fewer people coming in to replace us.\n\nvermont's median age, 42, is the second-highest in the country. only maine skews older. a report by the vermont chamber foundation projects that the entire state will need nearly 11,000 new employees every year until 2040 to replace retirees and fill new jobs.\n\nwe hear people say our children are leaving because there are no jobs here, jepson says. but we need to change that narrative — because there are jobs here.\n\nhe says young, motivated refugees would be a welcome part of the talent pool in rutland. the newcomers from syria include people who are multilingual. one of the refugees holds a degree in french literature.\n\ndepending on their skills, jepson says they might find work with local hotels, nursing homes, the nearby killington ski resort, the regional hospital or local ge plant.\n\nback at the farmers market, josh squire wraps up a sale at his vegetable stand. the 32-year-old farmer moved to rutland from delaware, which he describes as much more culturally diverse. rutland, he says, would benefit from more diversity.\n\ndifferent ideas can spur a new business, and that new business brings in money for the economy. those people who are working in that new business can now come to my business and, like, it'll spread. so having even a couple hundred more people in our little town, it's going to make a big difference for us, he says, smiling.\n\nbut his shoulders sag as he admits that he worries if the u.s. scales back its refugee programs, rutland's first two syrian families could be the last.
a weightlifting program gives ex-cons a chance at change\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jesse costa/wbur jesse costa/wbur\n\nit began with a simple idea: provide a safe place in boston where ex-cons and former gang members can work out, find support and maybe even get a job. the result is innercity weightlifting, a nonprofit also known as icw that connects them with job training, workout clients and a chance at a new life.\n\njust about all of the trainers have done significant time in jail. they've shot people and been shot at. dan royal grew up in boston and was 11 the first time he was arrested on a shooting charge.\n\ni got shot before that. my relative died right in front of my face. also, i've been shot eight times. i've been shot once in the middle of my head, between my eyes. i've got two brain surgeries, royal says.\n\nroyal is 36 and has been out of jail for three years. for that, he credits icw, where he works as a personal trainer. it gives him an income and a network of support.\n\ndan is someone who i consider a close friend. i was also told not to work with him, as i've been told not to work with a lot of our students, says jon feinman, innercity weightlifting's ceo.\n\nfeinman grew up in leafy western massachusetts, a world away from the inner city. he ignored warnings that guys like royal were too dangerous to work with. after college and a stint at americorps, feinman founded icw to help people break free of the cycle of crime and incarceration by teaching them to be personal trainers. it also gives potential clients a chance to connect with people like royal.\n\nthe program helps the trainers build what feinman calls social capital. for example, jay buchta, a business development executive who trains with royal, says he helped royal at his last court hearing by reaching out to a friend, a former prosecutor, and vouching for him.\n\nand it turned out that my friend and the prosecutor of dan's case had been office mates, so all of a sudden dan had an association ... with someone who wasn't frightening to this attorney, buchta says.\n\nroyal, who's off parole now for the first time in his adult life, says making friends with people like buchta has given him hope — and a lot more.\n\nallowing me to see that everything isn't the way i thought it was, you know what i mean? just thinking that a lot of people didn't care, or wasn't going to be anybody attempting to help you, royal says.\n\nabout 500 icw clients have a chance to connect with these former inmates — and i've been one of them for more than a year. i work with a trainer named angel lacourt, who grew up in roxbury, one of boston's toughest neighborhoods. his mother was a drug addict and his dad was in prison when he started selling drugs at the age of 8.\n\nall my friends' mothers was on crack. my friends' fathers were selling crack, lacourt says. they either got locked up, went to jail or mainly dead.\n\ndespite all of that, lacourt became a high school football star and boston college offered him a full scholarship. but then he shot and wounded a man, ended up in jail and lost the chance to go to college. when he came out, he went back to selling drugs again, was arrested and sent back to prison for 3 1/2 more years. lacourt says he felt trapped in a system that offered no way out.\n\nthe day you get out of jail, you're coming home with nothing and you have to start from scratch. you can't get a job at some of these places when they see the criminal background, he says. the only thing you want to do is, i'm going back to selling drugs. and that kinda gets people back into that same cycle: i'm failing, i'm failing, i'm failing. when am i going to succeed?\n\nfour years ago, a friend brought lacourt to icw to work out, and he's been there ever since.\n\nicw works with about 140 guys right now; some are certified to work as personal trainers like lacourt, earning as much as $40,000 a year.\n\nwhen they arrive at icw, recidivism rates are close to 90 percent. but for those who stay with the program that figure plummets to a tiny fraction of that. and staff members say they don't give up on anybody — even those who land back in jail.\n\ninstead, we go and visit them in jail. we write them; see what we can do to support their families, says mickey belaineh, who helps run icw.\n\nicw plans to expand to philadelphia next year, even though the staff is aware that a program designed in boston for boston might not work as well in other cities. but lacourt says it can work anywhere there are too many drugs and guns and too few post-incarceration programs like innercity weightlifting, which he says changed his life.\n\nyeah, it helped me out a lot. i think everybody needs to understand: all people need is opportunity, and everyone's willing to change with a little bit of hard work, lacourt says.
instagram account hit with shame campaign after it steals jokes\n\nstealing jokes is as old as comedy itself and it has become increasingly rampant and profitable on instagram. one social media campaign may be forcing a major instagram account to change its behavior.\n\nrachel martin, host:\n\nstealing jokes may be as old as comedy itself. and on instagram, it's particularly rampant and profitable. but as alexi horowitz-ghazi of our planet money team podcast reports, a social media campaign may be forcing one of the biggest instagram curators to change its behavior. and a warning here - this report contains sensitive language we have bleeped out.\n\nalexi horowitz-ghazi, byline: there's a certain kind of instagram account - millions of followers, mostly reposting memes, tweets or jokes from around the web, usually without offering payment, credit or even asking permission from their creators.\n\nmegh wright: these accounts have been able to run seemingly with no oversight. it's like the wild west. there's no rules.\n\nhorowitz-ghazi: megh wright covers comedy for the entertainment website vulture. she says there's been criticism of this over the years, but it hasn't stopped the problem.\n\nwright: maybe because memes are seen as silly and dumb. and who cares, right? but they've made a ton of money.\n\nhorowitz-ghazi: one account in particular caught her eye. we can't say its name on the radio. that's because it's called [expletive]jerry. they were cutting big ad deals. and when wright realized that even comedy central was sponsoring what she considered to be one of instagram's worst offenders, she decided to take action.\n\nwright: i basically just started tweeting a lot until enough comedians, enough people started paying attention and responding to it.\n\nhorowitz-ghazi: soon, big-name comedians like patton oswalt and john mulaney joined the pile-on, calling on their fans to unfollow the account. comedian tim heidecker even dropped a diss track.\n\n(soundbite of song, f*** f*** jerry)\n\ntim heidecker: (singing) [expletive] [expletive]jerry. run them out of town. they ain't nothing but two-bit thieves. shut those [expletive] down.\n\nhorowitz-ghazi: a big joke-theft shame campaign like this was relatively new to instagram, but not to comedy. chris sprigman of nyu law school says that in stand-up comedy, public shaming often works better than a lawsuit for two main reasons. the first is the way that copyright works. it can protect the specific expression or wording of a joke, but not the idea behind it.\n\nchris sprigman: you can take the specific wording of a joke, rewrite it, and you can escape copyright. you're free to take ideas, even if you can't take expression. so copyright has limited ability to protect jokes.\n\nhorowitz-ghazi: the other big reason is economic. it costs money to register the copyright for a given joke, and even more to hire a lawyer to enforce the copyright. it's rarely worth it. so sprigman says comedians developed their own de facto intellectual property norms to make sure their creative innovations are not for naught.\n\nsprigman: the comedic community can start bad-mouthing that person, and then, if that doesn't work, shunning them and refusing to work on a bill with them.\n\nhorowitz-ghazi: and sprigman says that's what's happening on instagram right now. in the weeks since the first tweet calling out [expletive]jerry, the account has lost some 300,000 followers. and comedy central announced it would no longer advertise with them.\n\nelliot tebele, the founder of the account, declined to comment for this story, but he did issue a public response on the website medium. he said he's been following the evolving standard practices of instagram. he wrote that when he started, there were no well-established ethical norms about reposting other people's content. he also apologized to anyone who feels they've been wronged in the past. and he committed to a strict, new policy of giving credit and getting permission for every new post going forward.\n\nmegh wright at vulture says she's happy that her campaign has helped to push norms in online comedy. she hopes that next, the joke writers themselves can start getting paid. alexi horowitz-ghazi, npr news.\n\n(soundbite of dj premier's dots)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.

why whole foods' small suppliers think amazon will be good for them\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption daniel acker/bloomberg/getty images daniel acker/bloomberg/getty images\n\nthe last few months have not been easy ones for the small companies that supply whole foods with quinoa and kale. as big investors demanded a shake-up at the company, maybe even a takeover by a much bigger supermarket chain, janey hubschman felt that the fate of her own company, epicurean butter, was also at stake.\n\nthe fact that their sales have not been great affects every single product that is in whole foods, and their reputation affects everything that is on the shelf, says the colorado businesswoman, who has been selling to whole foods since 2005.\n\nbrian nicholson, the president and ceo of red jacket orchards, which sells apples and juices to whole foods, was worried by rumors that private equity firms might acquire the food retailer.\n\nthen, on june 16, the long-anticipated takeover announcement came, with amazon as the winner, and many small food companies actually breathed a sigh of relief.\n\ndespite amazon's huge size, and its reputation for squeezing out small businesses in sectors such as bookstores, these food companies think the online behemoth's entry into their business could be a good thing.\n\nfor some, it's because amazon is familiar. robbie stout of ritual chocolate in utah uses amazon to buy parts for his factory. bebe goodrich of icebox coffee in alabama said amazon is a tremendous part of her life as an entrepreneur and mom of two kids. and hubschman says, i have a box with that little smiley face on my door four times a week. i love amazon.\n\nand paradoxically, many small food companies look at jeff bezos' company, which changed the way people shop, and see a hint of their own desire to shake things up in a food industry that is still dominated by powerhouse manufacturers selling to conventional grocery stores.\n\nwhole foods came in as an innovator and others changed to catch up, carrying natural and organic foods, said sylvia wyant, ceo of zest brands llc, which makes cakes and cookies that meet the paleo diet. i see jeff bezos and amazon as innovators, and i see the grocery business needing innovation.\n\nthe problem is, amazon-style innovation hasn't always been kind to small businesses or to the types of products whole foods peddles. searches for artisan or  local on amazon prime pantry pull up only a couple dozen results, mostly packaged items like white cheddar popcorn or crackers.\n\nin fact, little about amazon is local, save for the boxes arriving at your door. their mission is to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online. whole foods, on the other hand, built a regional purchasing model that gave stores considerable autonomy in finding local products. at least, that was the case until early 2016, when whole foods shifted all its nonperishable buying to its austin, texas, headquarters.\n\ni think amazon's track record in other sectors indicates they are not deeply invested in creating a decentralized model, says leah douglas, a reporter and analyst with the open markets program at the new america think tank.\n\namazon could help bring down prices at the stores known for taking your whole paycheck, but that is more likely to benefit customers and to come at a cost for producers.\n\ndespite all that, small suppliers persist in their hope, perhaps simply out of instinct. after all, they built their ideas and products from the ground up through optimism. potentially, they say, amazon will open new and better distribution channels, helping them sell products through an online platform with immediate name recognition. the cost of getting products from manufacturing to a retailer the traditional way eats away at profit for businesses like zest, wyant says.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption linda winski/courtesy of indea leo linda winski/courtesy of indea leo\n\nit is hard as a small company to go from a concept to the shelf and then from the shelf to the cart, says indea leo, the founder of lillabee, which makes allergen-free baking mixes in colorado. lillabee was discovered by a whole foods representative while selling at a farmers market and later received a product development loan from the company. we think there is going to be a lot of exciting possibilities of bypassing the shelf altogether and reaching a wider customer base.\n\nwhile suppliers remain optimistic, more information is still needed before the crystal ball of kombucha and asparagus water clears. the deal will be subject to regulatory approval before it is finalized, and neither amazon nor whole foods has said what will change once the two companies are married.\n\nnicholson, the third-generation apple grower, wonders what this means for the future of groceries. his family recently planted new trees to meet growing demand.\n\nhow might we be selling things when that fruit comes available in 10 years? he says. i don't know.\n\neditor's note: whole foods market and amazon.com inc. are two of npr's corporate sponsors.\n\nmollie simon

pelosi vows to bring coronavirus bill to house floor as republicans push for changes\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nicholas kamm/afp via getty images nicholas kamm/afp via getty images\n\nupdated at 5:25 a.m. et on friday\n\nspeaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., was unable to reach a deal late thursday on a package of measures to address the coronavirus pandemic amid pushback from the top house republican that the bill comes up short.\n\nnegotiations were set to resume on friday on the legislation, which does not include an emergency payroll tax cut — something that president trump has been pressing for congress to pass but that democrats and some republicans have rejected.\n\nhowever, the deal taking shape would include free coverage for coronavirus testing, extended unemployment insurance, paid sick leave and expanded food assistance as the pandemic takes a larger toll on the u.s. and global economies.\n\nwe have — are near — to an agreement, pelosi said at the capitol late thursday.\n\nwe've resolved most of our differences and those we haven't, we'll continue the conversation because there will be other bills, she said.\n\nher remarks came as republicans on capitol hill and in the trump administration pushed for changes to the measure. pelosi said house democrats had been negotiating with the white house throughout the morning.\n\nwe're dealing with democrats in congress, we'll see what can be done, trump said during an exchange with reporters thursday at the white house. he said democrats had included goodies in their bill that have nothing to do with what we're talking about. he did not give details.\n\nearlier thursday, the panel that sets rules for floor debate paused its meeting as its chairman, rep. jim mcgovern, d-mass., announced pelosi was discussing provisions with treasury secretary steven mnuchin.\n\nhe has some suggestions that we are going to evaluate to see whether these are things that we are going to agree on, mcgovern said.\n\nrepublicans have offered limited changes to the bill, according to several democratic aides involved in the talks. so far the gop proposals under consideration would not fundamentally change the implementation of the proposals, the aides said.\n\npelosi's spokesman tweeted that the speaker and treasury secretary talked twice about language for the bill.\n\nhouse minority leader kevin mccarthy of california told reporters the measure comes up short. he said proposals in the democratic measure such as sick leave would take six months to implement.\n\nmccarthy said that the white house, republicans and the speaker's office were working together and that lawmakers should postpone their recess by 24 to 48 hours in order to reach a deal.\n\nlet's do what we can do together right now, he said.\n\nwe don't need 48 hours, pelosi said. we just need to decide to help families right now.\n\noklahoma republican rep. tom cole complained that the bill wasn't released until late wednesday night and has had zero republican input.\n\nnobody's prepared to be rolled, cole said, adding, house republicans weren't ready to back the bill and indicated it would have trouble getting the support of gop senators.\n\nsenate cancels recess to address coronavirus\n\nas negotiations continued throughout the day on thursday, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., announced the senate would cancel its planned week-long recess next week so it could work on the legislation.\n\nnotwithstanding the scheduled state work period, the senate will be in session next week. i am glad talks are ongoing between the administration and speaker pelosi. i hope congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong, mcconnell announced on twitter.\n\ndemocrats push immediate aid; gop says it will take too long\n\nthe house democrats' measure includes paid sick leave, which pelosi called very essential, nutrition aid and assistance for states, including unemployment and medicaid costs.\n\nmccarthy listed some of his concerns at a press conference thursday. he told reporters that it would take too long to execute the program which, as written, would require companies with 50 or more employees to pay workers who are laid off, fired or are unable to work because of the coronavirus, or any public health emergency.\n\nrepublicans have privately raised additional concerns with the unemployment, medicaid and paid family and sick leave portions of the legislation. the unemployment section of the bill would add an extra 26 weeks of benefits for states that experience an increase of 10 percent or more in unemployment rate during the crisis.\n\ngop lawmakers also have objections to the scope of the paid family leave benefits. eligible workers, including people who would not be paid if they miss a day of work, would receive the benefit if they have to miss 14 or more days in a month because of the virus. it would apply to people with a coronavirus diagnosis, people who must self-quarantine, people caring for another person with coronavirus and people who must stay home because of school and child care closings.\n\nthe sweeping family leave benefits would extend for one year after the date the bill becomes law — meaning it would expire in the early months of the next presidential term. whoever wins the 2020 election would be responsible for allowing the benefit to lapse or finding a way to extend it.\n\nhill aide tests positive for virus; capitol campus access restricted\n\nthe virus affected capitol hill directly as a staffer to sen. maria cantwell, d-wash., became the first known confirmed case of coronavirus on the campus. the aide has been in isolation since developing symptoms, and cantwell closed her office for cleaning, according to a statement. the aide had no known contact with the senator or other members of congress, the statement released wednesday evening said.\n\nthe top house and senate law enforcement officials announced thursday that there would be a temporary closure of all tours of the capitol. they also said the capitol building and house and senate office buildings would be limited to members, staff, press and official visitors starting at 5 p.m. on thursday. the measures are in effect until april 1.\n\narkansas republican sen. tom cotton announced his washington office would be closed. sen. ted cruz, r-texas, who self-quarantined after he was exposed at a conference to someone who tested positive for the virus, also closed his washington office.\n\nnpr's claudia grisales contributed to this report
saturday sports: the astros' sign-stealing scandal; rule change in women's tennis\n\nscott simon, host:\n\njust when the week seems low, it's time for sports.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\nsimon: the houston astros say they're sorry, but it didn't make a difference. so come on. get over it. let's move on - while women's tennis will allow in-game coaching. we're joined now by npr sports correspondent tom goldman. tom, thanks for being with us.\n\ntom goldman, byline: thank you, scott.\n\n(soundbite of banging)\n\nsimon: tom...\n\n(soundbite of banging)\n\nsimon: i'm banging on a trash can.\n\n(soundbite of banging)\n\nsimon: i'm sending you a signal. what is it?\n\ngoldman: how many bangs were that - was that?\n\n(soundbite of banging)\n\nsimon: five.\n\ngoldman: oh, ok. then it's bj (laughter) leiderman, who writes our theme music.\n\nsimon: oh, my gosh, man. you got it. that's amazing.\n\ngoldman: but, scott...\n\nsimon: yes?\n\ngoldman: ...i want you to know your signal didn't have an impact on my answer.\n\nsimon: (laughter).\n\ngoldman: still - still, i'm sorry. let's move on. ok.\n\nsimon: oh, that was so nicely done. i mean, that was a brief apology tour - 90 seconds tops, right?\n\ngoldman: (laughter).\n\nsimon: will it be that the astros went on? is it enough for the fans or other players whose careers they might have harmed?\n\ngoldman: i know. it doesn't seem that way. that's the consensus right now. you know, this was intended to mollify the baseball world, including those fans and opposing players, which is still very angry about houston's illegal scheme to steal the signs of opposing catchers using trashcan bangs just like you and me, scott. this scheme was in full bloom during the astros championship winning season in 2017.\n\nthis apology tour, as you call it, on the first day of spring training two days ago - you know, it just made a lot of people angrier. the players and officials did say sorry. but they really didn't seem to have their heart in it. for the most part, players didn't talk details of what they did, why they did it, why they didn't do anything to stop it, even though they knew it was wrong. and there was no real acknowledgement of the other teams and players they hurt by doing this.\n\nsimon: major league commissioner rob manfred, i guess, is going to talk tomorrow. you're, of course - you're in florida for spring training, right?\n\ngoldman: the epicenter.\n\nsimon: should - (laughter) the epicenter of spring training. i'm going - he's got to worry about fans trusting the game. and does he also have to worry about houston batters getting routinely plunked this season?\n\ngoldman: yeah, because pitchers have been talking about that. you know, i don't think he was anticipating what he's going to get tomorrow, but - because things certainly have turned since thursday. he's heard the weak apologies. he's heard houston owner jim crane dig himself a hole with this comment that he didn't think the sign-stealing had an impact and then, a minute later, saying, he didn't say that. now, manfred will be asked about all this, whether he'll consider imposing any sanctions on houston players who he absolved in last month's report on the scandal. and yes. what will he say to convince fans they can trust what they're seeing on ball fields? and what will he say about this threat of opposing pitchers seeking retribution? - tough word there - retribution...\n\nsimon: yeah.\n\ngoldman: ...by throwing at houston batters this season. some pitchers are saying, yeah, they'll consider that.\n\nsimon: yeah. new rule in women's tennis goes into effect monday - coaching during matches. we remember serena williams at the - what is it? - 2018 u.s. open - penalized for taking a hand signal from her coach to move up a little closer towards the net. from now on, that'll be ok. remind us why it was ever banned.\n\ngoldman: oh, because tennis is a tradition-bound sport - and tradition says tennis is a one-on-one contest. and players should be able to figure things out and make decisions on their own without coaches helping. twelve years ago, the women's tour did start allowing coaches to visit players on court once every set. but now, as you mention, this new rule change will allow for the small moments of coaching from the stands, hand signals, etc. and a lot of people say this is good. it'll make matches more interesting for fans to be able to watch the - you know, the subtle player-coach interactions. for traditionalists who don't like this, the great billie jean king, who supports the rule changes, says, you know, players don't have to listen to the coach. they're still in control and make their own decisions. so it won't be cataclysmic what happens out there.\n\nsimon: i love billie jean king. npr's tom goldman, thanks so much.\n\ngoldman: you're welcome, scott.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
how the trump administration's tariffs on china have affected american companies\n\nnpr's ari shapiro talks with bloomberg reporter andrew mayeda about some of the big picture impacts as american industries have tried to adjust to the trump's administration's tariffs with china.\n\nari shapiro, host:\n\namerican industries have spent several months adjusting their business practices to deal with these tariffs, and numbers are just starting to come in that show us the real impact of the trade war on u.s. companies. bloomberg reporter andrew mayeda has been following this and joins us now. thanks for coming into the studio.\n\nandrew mayeda: thanks for having me.\n\nshapiro: there are a lot of factors that go into a company's bottom line. so how much can you actually tell right now about what these tariffs are doing to american companies?\n\nmayeda: i think there's no question that it's having an impact. we are starting to see companies report the effect on their earnings. a big one was apple. they said that they're selling less iphones in china. caterpillar said that this was having an impact. this is a company that makes construction equipment, the yellow stuff that you see at construction sites - nvidia, intel. so there's no question that this is rippling across the u.s. economy.\n\nshapiro: so you gave a couple examples, like apple and caterpillar, of american companies that aren't selling as much in china. what about companies that use raw materials imported from china to manufacture in the united states? are we seeing issues there?\n\nmayeda: yeah. probably the best example would be harley-davidson. recently they reported lower-than-expected results. their profit was hit by tariffs. but it's not just the china tariffs in that case. it's also global tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum by the trump administration.\n\nshapiro: when you look at the scale of the impact, is this more along the lines of an annoyance and inconvenience, or is it a real economic impact, something that could lead to slower economic growth, maybe even a recession down the line? how severe is it?\n\nmayeda: if you actually look at the big-picture forecasts of the impact - for example, the imf says that if we have a worst-case trade scenario, the global economy is going to be less than 1 percent smaller than what it otherwise would've been. that is not catastrophic. i think what people are concerned about is that there's some type of confidence shock. that is to say that, you know, businesses start investing less. consumers start spending less. and it gets into this negative feedback loop where reducing confidence leads to slower growth.\n\nand you're right. we are in about the 10th year of a global expansion. we're nearing the end of the economic cycle. investors are on edge. i mean, the music will end at some point, and we will have a recession. and if we have a serious, bruising trade war, that will not be good for the global economy.\n\nshapiro: is this affecting small businesses in a similar way to the giants - you know, the apple, caterpillar, harleys of the world?\n\nmayeda: yeah, absolutely. there are companies in the u.s. that are on the edge right now. big companies like apple, like caterpillar - they can shift their supply chains. they can move their supply chain from china to malaysia or vietnam. a smaller company doesn't have that flexibility, right? so if their input costs are rising, things can get very bad very quickly for some of these companies.\n\nshapiro: can you give us an example of one of those small businesses that's really feeling this?\n\nmayeda: well, we talked to a company that makes weather stations. so these are stations that people set up in their backyard. and this company is trying to decide how it can get around these tariffs. they can't just move their supply chain around asia. this ceo that we talked to is actually considering potentially moving production to mexico. so that's the exact opposite thing that president trump wants.\n\nshapiro: are you seeing a pattern in the way that companies are adapting to this?\n\nmayeda: i think that they're kind of running through a menu of options. one of the options, as i mentioned, is to move your supply chain to a place like malaysia or vietnam. there's no question that that is happening. some companies are actually engaged in what's called tariff engineering. so if i have a certain good that is hit by tariffs, as it stands now, i could slightly change the way that the good is manufactured so it is actually not covered by tariffs. and there's no question, as the president is actually hoping for, that some companies are reshoring to the united states.\n\nshapiro: we're talking about tariffs that have been in place for several months. but if the u.s. and china don't reach a deal, tariffs are scheduled to rise even more on march 1. what are companies saying they'll do then?\n\nmayeda: yeah, i think that if there is no deal to end the trade war, then i think that, you know, we're just going to see kind of this ongoing grind of hitting bottom lines. we're going to see, i think, probably the stock market take a hit. i think that if there is a total collapse of talks, if we were to see liu he walk out of the white house today in a storm...\n\nshapiro: the chinese negotiator.\n\nmayeda: yes, that's right, yeah. that would not be a good scenario, and i would expect stocks to sell off quite sharply from that.\n\nshapiro: that's bloomberg reporter andrew mayeda, who covers global economics. thanks so much.\n\nmayeda: thanks for having me.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
'the first conspiracy' details foiled hickey plot to assassinate george washington\n\nthe first conspiracy the secret plot to kill george washington by brad meltzer and josh mensch hardcover, 413 pages | purchase close overlay buy featured book your purchase helps support npr programming. how?\n\nin 1776, the governor of new york and the mayor of new york city conspired to assassinate george washington. and it might have succeeded if it weren't for a would-be counterfeiter and an iron mill foreman.\n\nit sounds like the plot of a mildly implausible historical thriller, but it actually happened and it's one of the more remarkable stories to come out of the american revolution, even if it's not one you learned in history class.\n\nthe bizarre plot is the subject of the first conspiracy, the fascinating new history book from thriller author brad meltzer and television documentary producer josh mensch. it's an intriguing look at the so-called hickey plot, the foiled conspiracy that, had it succeeded, might have killed the american dream before it even began.\n\nthe book takes place in 1776, during the first months of the revolutionary war. independence from great britain was far from a fait accompli in those days; indeed, it was considered the longest of shots — the british armed forces were some of the most powerful in the world, while the american army, populated by untrained neophytes, hayseeds, and former criminals, was very much not.\n\nthe colonies' best shot at independence relied on the military prowess of george washington, whom the continental congress named commander in chief of the young, ragtag military in 1775. washington shocked the world when his army took boston in 1776, after which the war moved to new york, which was seen as a british stronghold with a large number of loyalists.\n\nthe rebels were always doomed in the city, but the governor of new york, william tryon, and new york city mayor david mathews, both tories, didn't want to take any chances. tryon hatched a plot to either kidnap or assassinate (the goal, meltzer and mensch acknowledge, was vague) washington, thereby demoralizing the already disheartened americans. it was, the authors, write, a clandestine plan to strike a knife into the heart of the rebellion.\n\nit also wasn't a particularly good one. despite recruiting some of washington's life guards — soldiers who were responsible for personally protecting the general — it was foiled thanks to its participants' inability to keep a secret. two of the guards, jailed for possessing counterfeit money, spilled the plot to a cellmate, who had been arrested in a separate counterfeiting scheme. and an iron mill foreman, sent by his boss to track down some awol workers who were also in on the conspiracy, uncovered more details about the plan after pretending to be a british loyalist.\n\nthe assassination never happened, of course, and one of washington's guards, thomas hickey, ended up being hanged for his role in the conspiracy. it left a legacy of a different kind, however; as meltzer and mensch write:\n\nthe discovery of this plot, and the effort to investigate it, led colonial authorities to devise new systems of intelligence gathering and counterespionage. in many ways, this strange plot against george washington would lead to the establishment of a whole new field of american spy craft — now known as counterintelligence.\n\nit's a fascinating story, and meltzer and mensch do an excellent job explaining it. meltzer is the author of a dozen thrillers, and he brings a propulsive energy to the narrative — it can be difficult to create tension and suspense in a nonfiction book where the reader already knows how the story ends, but the authors do a great job keeping the reader turning the pages.\n\nthe book is also extremely well-researched. meltzer and mensch cite an impressive number of primary sources, including letters from washington and others, as well as a heroic number of history books. nothing about the book is phoned in; the amount of research behind it is genuinely remarkable.\n\nif there's one thing that doesn't quite succeed, it's meltzer and mensch's prose, which at times tends toward the breathless. writing about tryon, for example, the authors declare, he has money. he knows the city as well as anyone. he has friends in high places ... and low places. and on the declaration of independence, they write, in a few days, the congress will vote whether to ratify this document — and potentially change the war ... and the world ... forever. these kind of sentences, which always come at the end of their chapters, sound like a narrator of a television series dramatically teasing the next segment of the show right before a commercial break.\n\nbut that's a minor complaint — it's easy to overlook the occasional histrionic writing when the story is so fascinating. and you certainly can't accuse meltzer and mensch of being bloodless or boring. the first conspiracy is an excellent book, enthralling and beyond fascinating, and it's sure to delight both fans of thrillers and american history.
trump, pompeo, esper defend killing of soleimani; iranians vow revenge\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption dpa picture-alliance via getty images dpa picture-alliance via getty images\n\nupdated at 4:55 p.m. et\n\npresident trump and his top deputies offered a full-throated defense on tuesday of the american strike against iran's top foreign legion commander, stressing what they called the urgent danger of an attack he had been plotting.\n\nthe killing of quds force commander qassem soleimani last week has ratcheted up tensions between tehran and washington, prompting vows of retaliatory strikes.\n\ndefense secretary mark esper said tuesday that the attack soleimani was planning against americans or u.s. installations was a matter of days away, although there were few details about who, what, how and precisely when.\n\nbut the defense secretary, his colleagues and the president all said they believed they had done their duty to protect americans and now iran has an opening to step back from violence and opt for a return to the negotiating table.\n\nwe are prepared to have this discussion with them, but we are just as prepared to deliver a forceful response, esper said in a news conference at the pentagon.\n\nthe defense department is sending thousands more troops to the middle east as well as air force bombers and naval warships. american installations across the region have been placed on high alert and normal operations — including against the islamic state — have been paused. americans have been urged to leave iraq.\n\nall the same, and notwithstanding calls within iraq for american forces to leave and vows by iran for revenge, trump and administration leaders made clear they're standing by their decision to kill soleimani.\n\nit was the right decision. we got it right, pompeo told reporters during a briefing at the state department. he added that the strike fit perfectly within our strategy in how to counter the threat of malign activity from iran more broadly.\n\na step back from sensitive targets\n\nthe biggest change in tune on tuesday was over the prospective reaction by american forces to the response that iran has vowed.\n\ntrump had threatened to attack 52 sites inside iran, including religiously or culturally significant ones, as a way to try to constrain iranian retaliation.\n\ntrump and some supporters don't only want american forces to defend, for example, an embassy against an attack. they also want the united states to respond to an attack on an embassy farther afield in the middle east with a strike deep inside iran, either against a culturally important target or infrastructure such as an oil refinery.\n\nbut pompeo and esper both responded to questions about that on tuesday by stating that american forces would obey the laws of armed conflict, which preclude that kind of targeting.\n\nevery target that's being reviewed, every effort that's being made, will always be conducted inside the international laws of war, pompeo said.\n\nesper, for his part, said, i'm fully confident ... the commander-in-chief is not going to give us an illegal order.\n\ntrump tried to take a similar line with reporters at the white house but still make it clear that he is prepared to attack targets inside the islamic republic.\n\nif that's what the law is, i like to obey the law, trump said. but think of it: they kill our people, they blow up our people, and then we have to be very gentle with their cultural institutions. but i'm ok with it. it's ok with me. i will say this: if iran does anything that they shouldn't be doing, they're going to be suffering the consequences and very strongly.\n\nas npr reported on monday, the u.s. cannot legally target cultural sites, according to the hague convention the country signed in 1954, which mandates refraining from any act of hostility directed against cultural property.\n\nstrategic vision for the middle east\n\ntrump also sought to square what he calls his careerlong opposition to american operations in the middle east with his current orders to deepen the u.s. military presence in the region — and his threats to sanction iraq if it tries to eject american forces.\n\nthe united states should get out of iraq, he argued, but not now and not like this.\n\nat some point we want to get out, he said. but this isn't the right point. the other thing is, if we do get out, we've spent a tremendous amount of money on building airports and building one of the largest embassies we have in the world. and we want to be reimbursed to the various costs that we have had. they're very significant ... we don't want to be there forever.\n\nthe president emphasized how important iraq is as a platform from which the united states can combat iran.\n\nif baghdad tries to force out american troops now, trump said, i think it's the worst thing that can happen to iraq. if we leave, that would mean that iran would have a much bigger foothold, and the people in iraq do not want to see iran running the country.\n\niran vows vengeance\n\niranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif told npr in an interview tuesday that the u.s. will pay for the assassination of soleimani as well as iraqi militia commander abu mahdi al-muhandis. zarif called the drone strike an act of both terrorism and war.\n\nin that same interview, zarif told npr's mary louise kelly in tehran that the u.s. failed to issue him a visa so he could attend a gathering of the u.n. security council in new york.\n\npompeo was asked about that during his remarks but said he would not comment on visa matters. the secretary of state did seek to pour cold water on zarif's claim that at the time of his death, soleimani was traveling to baghdad on a diplomatic mission.\n\nanybody here believe that? pompeo asked sarcastically.\n\nzarif is a propagandist of the first order, he added. it's not new, we've heard these same lies before. it's fundamentally false.\n\nbriefing set for lawmakers\n\nmembers of congress are slated to get closed-door briefing on iran from top administration officials on wednesday.\n\npompeo is expected to be joined by cia director gina haspel and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mark milley. the session comes as house democrats are mulling ways to limit the president's authority to order military action in iran unilaterally.\n\nat tuesday's briefing, pompeo was also asked about his decision to stay on as secretary of state instead of leaving his post, as he was widely expected to, in order to pursue an open senate seat in kansas.\n\nno real news there. i've said that i'm going to stay serving as secretary of state so long as president trump shall have me, pompeo said.\n\nhe added: you can accuse me of being inconsistent elsewise, but not on that one.

market forces may impact emissions more than climate agreements\n\ntoday president trump is at the g-7 summit and high on the agenda is climate change. many world leaders are imploring trump stay in the global climate agreement, but emissions are going down already.\n\nscott simon, host:\n\nthroughout president trump's overseas trip this week, he's been getting an earful about climate and how important the paris climate agreement is. many foreign leaders say the u.s. should not abandon it, and president trump tweeted this morning that he will make a final decision next week. but as npr's christopher joyce reports, staying in or out of that paris deal may not make that much difference.\n\nchristopher joyce, byline: pope francis told president trump to stick with the paris agreement, so did france's newly elected president, emmanuel macron. the agreement they're so passionate about sets in motion a global effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that warm the planet. trump says it's a bad deal for the u.s. economy. nearly 200 other nations say it's a good deal for the planet. but climate experts point out that emissions in the u.s. are already going down without the paris deal.\n\nkate larsen: the u.s. has successfully bent its greenhouse gas emissions curve. and we are going to continue to reduce emissions over the next 10 years, likely regardless of trump policy.\n\njoyce: that's kate larsen with the rhodium group, which does research on climate economics. emissions in the u.s. have declined by about 12 percent since 2005. a new study by rhodium says that decline is likely to continue.\n\nlarsen: with current policy, including everything that states have committed to do and what president trump has indicated he is likely to roll back, we are on a path to reduce emissions below 2005 levels by about 15 to 17 percent in 2020.\n\njoyce: larsen and other energy economists say a big part of that is due to decisions made by companies, especially those that make electricity.\n\nlarsen: a lot of that is switching from coal to gas in the power sector and now increasingly from coal to gas to renewables. and that's a trend that we don't see stopping anywhere in the near future.\n\njoyce: in effect, larsen says, what happens over the next few years has already been set in motion. the picture beyond 2020, though, gets cloudy. by then, whatever the trump administration does to dismantle climate regulations would have kicked in. economist marc hafstead says that if the economy grows faster as well, the downward emissions trend could stall by 2025.\n\nmarc hafstead: and my analysis was, under the best-case scenario, we'd come in somewhere around 10.\n\njoyce: a 10 percent drop in emissions. president obama promised to cut emissions well over twice that under the paris agreement. in the end, though, the decision about staying in or leaving the paris agreement is not just about hitting numerical targets. hafstead, who's with resources for the future, says what the u.s. does sends a message to the rest of the world.\n\nhafstead: exiting paris could potentially have political ramifications to the extent that our pulling out of the agreement is going to cause other countries to do less.\n\njoyce: which could have far greater consequences for global warming than how far off the climate mark the u.s. ends up.\n\nchristopher joyce, npr news.\n\n(soundbite of sonna's these windows are pistons, pt. 2)\n\ncopyright © 2017 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
first woman to wear a boston bib races again, 50 years later\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption paul connell/boston globe via getty images paul connell/boston globe via getty images\n\nkathrine switzer, the first woman to officially enter the boston marathon, returned to the course 50 years after she made history — finishing in 2017 with a time of 4:44:31.\n\nwhen switzer ran in 1967, she was 20, and entered as k.v. switzer — so none of the race organizers would know she was a woman. when she was discovered, after the marathon had already started, the race director tried to rip her bib numbers off her back.\n\nswitzer finished anyway, and came back eight more times. in her later races, no subterfuge was necessary. and in 2017 switzer, now 70, was cheered, not met with rage.\n\nat the point where she was once confronted by that race official, she posted a facebook live video — smiling as she ran, with her bib number, 261, pinned safely in place.\n\nbefore the race, switzer spoke with npr about the day she made history.\n\nshe noted that a woman had already run the course once — without entering. bobbi gibb hid in the bushes by the starting line and snuck into the mass of runners as they passed, finishing in 3:21:40.\n\nstill, despite proof that women could clearly complete marathons, the athletic world generally assumed that women couldn't run and didn't want to run that far, switzer says.\n\nthe longest distance women were allowed to run in the olympics at that time was 800 meters.\n\nit was feared that anything longer was going to injure women, that they wouldn't be able to have children or they somehow turned into men, she told npr.\n\n 'you'll never have children,' they said. 'you're going to get big legs. you're going to grow hair on your chest.' it was hilarious, the myths.\n\nand, of course, when people hear myths, they believe them — because to try otherwise might mean damaging yourself. so people were afraid and they just went about their lives that way and restricted themselves.\n\nswitzer's coach in 1967 was a 15-time boston marathoner and didn't think a woman could do it — which energized switzer to try. (she changed his mind as she was training for the race, when she ran 31 miles during one session, sb nation reports.)\n\nso she entered the marathon, following all the proper procedures and just, well, neglecting to mention she was female.\n\nswitzer told npr's lulu garcia-navarro what happened when she was discovered:\n\nat about a mile and a half into the race, the press truck went by us, and they saw that i was a woman in the race wearing numbers and they began taking pictures. and alongside of the photographer's truck came the officials' press truck. and the race director [jock semple] was on the truck and the guys were teasing him. and he got so angry that there was a girl in the race that he stopped the bus and jumped off it and ran after me and attacked me in the race and tried to pull off my bib numbers, screaming at me, 'get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers.' and i was just blindsided by this. i was terrified. i was scared. and my boyfriend came along with a full streak and gave the official a cross-body block and sent him out of the race instead. you know, we laugh about it now because it's so funny when a girl is saved by her burly boyfriend. but ... i said to my coach immediately after the incident: 'i have to finish this race now because if i drop out of this race, nobody's going to believe that women are serious.' \n\nswitzer finished the race in four hours and twenty minutes.\n\nas the years went on she advocated for women to be admitted as full competitors — and kept running more and more marathons. she won the new york city marathon in 1974. and she competed in boston several more times, placing second in the women's race in 1975 with a time of 2:51, her personal best.\n\nswitzer said her return to the race in 2017 was a way to, celebrate the fact, first of all, that i can run — that i'm capable of doing it, amazingly enough, and i'm very, very grateful for that.\n\nand i'm also very grateful for the opportunity to thank a city and the streets that changed my life, she said, and help to empower millions of women all around the world and change the face of the sport.
one type of business that's thriving during coronavirus? locally owned grocery stores\n\ntoggle caption mikaela lefrak/wamu\n\nwhile many small business owners across the d.c. region are seeing their profits flatline, the owners of small food markets and grocery store chains are experiencing a boom in business.\n\nwe're trying to feed the world, and everyone else is trying to figure out how to survive, says scott nash, the owner of the mom's organic market grocery stores that dot the washington region.\n\n[read the latest updates about coronavirus in our region here]\n\nbusiness has doubled at all mom's locations over the past five days. nash says the increase is due to restaurants in d.c., maryland, and other states shutting down to slow the spread of coronavirus, and chain grocery stores' struggles with empty shelves and massive lines.\n\nkeeping shelves stocked\n\nsmaller chains like mom's can be more nimble, nash believes. as customer demand increases, he has been able to call up his suppliers — my meat guys, my chicken guys, my produce guys — to arrange extra deliveries and keep his shelves relatively full. he's also started texting his larger suppliers, urging them to put ads on craigslist for temporary truck drivers and pallet stackers, so they can deliver more products.\n\nbest world supermarket in mt. pleasant is experiencing a similar boom. owner in suk pak says his largely latino clientele has been stocking up on maseca (a brand of corn flour) water, rice, and sanitary products. and a few blocks down, staff at each peach market say they've been selling staples (milk, eggs and bread) and pre-made foods (soups and dips) as soon as they shelve them.\n\nbut because each peach partners with individual farmers rather than larger suppliers, it can't order more product at the drop of a hat. we're calling up, like, tim, the guy who brings us our eggs and saying to him, 'can you bring us twice as many eggs as you normally do?' says eleanor gease, the store's general manager.\n\ntim, a farmer in central pennsylvania, can't ramp up his delivery schedule even if he has the eggs supply available.\n\ntoggle caption mikaela lefrak/wamu\n\nfinding staff\n\nfor many local grocers, the biggest shortage is labor, not product.\n\nstaff are exhibiting signs of stress, says eleanor gease, each peach's general manager. they're interacting with hundreds of people a day.\n\nat mom's, nash has increased overtime pay to incentivize employees to work more hours. he's also been trying to hire temporary workers. every store could use 15 more employees today, he says. he's hoping to be able to hire restaurant workers who don't have shifts to take now that restaurants and bars have been shut down.\n\na few blocks away from each peach, employees at el progreso market were too busy to find the manager for an interview. lines to check out stretched down the already-tight aisles to the deli section in the back, where a butcher was hurriedly wrapping meat for customers.\n\ntoggle caption mikaela lefrak/wamu\n\nmanager? i don't know, i'm just trying to deliver bread, one frazzled man said as he stacked loaves of white bread onto a shelf.\n\nat best world, pak has had to turn away from his managerial duties in order to help stock shelves. he's also become the store's tech guy, figuring out how to fix glitches in the checkout machine software because he doesn't have time to call for support. meanwhile, his wife is jumping on a cash register to help with the growing lines between a failed bank run (the bank was closed) and a product delivery.\n\npak isn't too worried about running out of steam. he sees this as a short-term situation rather than a boom that will change his small business forever.\n\nit's busy, he says, but someday it's going to slow down. busy means nothing to us.\n\ndoes smaller feel safer?\n\nleaders of the nation's large grocery store chains say they are stocking up to meet demand and are increasing their sanitization practices to keep people safe. still, worries over being in the vicinity of hundreds of other shoppers had led some customers to return to their community stores where the crowds are smaller.\n\ni heard from a customer, 'i don't want to go to safeway,' said jeanlouise conaway, the owner of each peach. she says their loyal local customers trust her staff to prioritize health and safety over profits.\n\ndue to the small size of her business, conaway has been able to institute new practices like curbside grocery pickup and limiting the number of shoppers inside to eight at a time.\n\nnash says he's doing his best to keep his mom's stores clean, but acknowledges that there's a limit to how much he can control. all you can do is, don't touch your face and wash your hands and stay a few feet from everybody. you can sanitize all you want... he trails off.\n\nwe really ought to be grateful as hell that we're in this industry he picks back up after a beat. our problems are good problems. our jobs aren't threatened, at least not yet.
'the dispatcher' is a short stroll in a strange neighborhood\n\nthe dispatcher by john scalzi hardcover, 130 pages | purchase close overlay buy featured book your purchase helps support npr programming. how?\n\njohn scalzi's newest book, the dispatcher, is a strange one.\n\nand i don't mean the book itself, though it has its own streak of oddity alive in its pages. i mean the book as metaphysical object — book as book, as story and voice and concept and conceit. it's strange because, for starters, it's a backwards kind of book, done first for audible, the audio book people, and therefore written with an ear toward performance. it is a physical book only as an afterthought, arriving on the shelves months after it appeared on people's phones.\n\nit's strange because it is a novella — that most hybrid of forms, weightier than the drive-by punch of a short story, lighter than a novel with all its baggage — given the treatment usually reserved for longer works.\n\nand it's strange because it's scalzi walking around in a sub-genre that's not his usual neighborhood. he does space opera, mostly. military spec-fic. dabbles in the near-future. but the dispatcher is, for lack of a more artful term, hard urban fantasy (hurfancy?) and, just to tweak it a little further, it's got secondary sub-sub-genre genes as well, with the outward characteristics (rain, crisp dialog, a missing person, cop-and-consultant dialectics) of a gumshoe detective story.\n\nso here's the spine of the thing: in the very near future (like tomorrow-near) it suddenly comes to pass that anyone who is murdered comes back to life a second later, arriving naked, and generally rather confused, back at home in their own bed. it's a miracle. spooky. begging many deep and philosophical questions about the nature of existence and the existence of god.\n\nscalzi is a man with a fertile and weird imagination. a writer who makes his nickels by always asking, okay, but what else might happen?'\n\nbut it's also, you know, just a thing. because murders? there are a lot of them. and very quickly this completely unexplained phenomenon becomes a simple fact of daily existence. die of natural causes, you're done. lights out and goodbye. but if you're murdered? 999 times out of 1,000, you vanish with a pop and show up back at home in your birthday suit, reset to a few hours before your untimely demise.\n\nthe story follows tony valdez, a dispatcher who works operating rooms and ers murdering patients who are beyond medical help. because if they die on the operating table, they're just dead, right? but if tony is there to put a bullet in their brain just before they die, bingo! second chance. he saves lives by murdering the very-nearly-dead, resetting them to give the doctors a second chance.\n\nit's all very official in scalzi's world. tony went to school for this — he's a government employee, works with the insurance companies, does a lot of paperwork. but then one day a friend of his, another dispatcher who may or may not be involved in some shady side-gigs, goes missing, and we're off to the races. there's a police officer, lots of conversations at hot dog stands and greek diners, the questioning of a grieving spouse (with whom tony has a history), and some dealings with rich men and mobsters. like i said, hurfancy with a side of gumshoe. and that is amusing, at least for a bit.\n\nbut scalzi is a man with a fertile and weird imagination. a writer who makes his nickels by always asking, okay, but what else might happen? and with the dispatcher, the most interesting ideas come as asides, hints, hypotheticals. if murder victims come back but the naturally dead do not, what else might happen? what might certain ... less than scrupulous people do if they knew that almost every single murdered person will come back, right as rain?\n\nthey might stage deadly, underground, hammer-on-baseball-bat gladiator fights with a trained dispatcher standing by to cap every single participant when it's done. rich folks might have a fella like tony standing by when they do things like go skydiving (just in case) or stage dangerous movie stunts (just in case). dueling might come back into fashion. with broadswords. because why not? when death by murder is no longer deadly, the possibilities are both dark and endless — which is ideal scalzi territory.\n\nso yes, the dispatcher is thin. a quick romp to a strange zip code. the audiobook-first timing means that, as a book-book, it reads a little bit like a play — first-person, light on the scene-setting and long on dialog — but seeing scalzi work under these restrictions is kinda fun. the voice doesn't sound like exactly what you expect if you're a fan, but the brain running the show is obviously the same. and while the bench of characters is shallow and the main story feels a little bit rushed (because, you know, novella), it's the odd detours that make the book worthwhile. it's imagining a world where murder can be life-saving, where certain kinds of death get you a pass from the reaper, and how a little thing like that might change ... everything.\n\njason sheehan knows stuff about food, video games, books and starblazers. he is currently the restaurant critic at philadelphia magazine, but when no one is looking, he spends his time writing books about giant robots and ray guns. tales from the radiation age is his latest book.
trump's travel costs add up, setting him on path to outspend obama\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption joe raedle/getty images joe raedle/getty images\n\nordinary folks can fly from the washington, d.c., area to southeast florida for $200-300 round-trip, if they book in advance. for the president, the trip is a little more costly.\n\nexactly how much is not currently public, though. the conservative group judicial watch, which has been tracking the cost of presidential travel for several years, estimates that president trump's frequent visits to his palm beach resort mar-a-lago probably cost the government around $1 million each.\n\nmuch of the expense stems from air force one 747, which costs around $140,000 per flying hour right now, says judicial watch's president, tom fitton. the trips typically incur other expenses as well, such as lodging and travel expenses for the secret service, and reimbursements for local police.\n\nit's a snapshot cost, in the sense that there are other costs obviously involved that we could get, but the government just doesn't want to give it to us or they keep secret for some reason, fitton says.\n\nthe government accountability office has agreed to look into the costs and security concerns raised by democratic lawmakers about the florida trips.\n\ntrump has so far appeared to set a record for weekend travel, regularly shuttling back and forth between washington and florida.\n\nfor someone who complained about president obama traveling a lot, he's going to supersede president obama's travel, all eight years [of it], within a year, which is just absolutely ridiculous, says democratic rep. ruben gallego of arizona, who recently signed a letter to the pentagon asking about the costs racked up by the president's use of air force one.\n\npolitical hay has long been made over personal travel by presidents. republicans regularly excoriated obama for the cost of his trips to hawaii and africa, for example.\n\nrepublican sen. john barrasso of wyoming asked the government accountability office to look into the cost of a three-day, three-legged trip obama took from washington to chicago and then onto palm beach in february 2013. the report calculated the cost of the trip at around $3.6 million.\n\nin fact, judicial watch began monitoring travel costs during the obama administration.\n\nhe made a big show of taking his wife up to new york on a date night. and i thought to myself, 'well, that sounds like a pretty darned expensive date night,' knowing what it costs to move a president around, fitton says. because the obamas and their entourage flew on small planes, the cost of that trip was relatively low. press reports put it at around $25,000.\n\nthe obama administration was reluctant to answer questions about travel costs, forcing judicial watch to file freedom of information requests to get an answer (secret service documents show $11,648.17 in security expenses for that trip). so far, the trump white house hasn't been much more transparent, fitton says.\n\nthere has to be an awareness that it costs money to go down there, and they should justify the cost or explain to the american people why it's necessary, he says.\n\na million dollars for a weekend trip to florida is actually chump change for the pentagon, with its annual budget of $600 billion, but gallego says that isn't really the point.\n\nwe've had to stop hiring child care specialists in child care day centers on army bases because the president has done a hiring freeze, he says. if the president wants to ask the country to sacrifice and other government agencies to sacrifice, then he should be doing the same.
putting a roof on risk with a covid-19 vaccine jab\n\ntoggle caption bob mondello/npr\n\nit's 8:45 a.m. on a weekday in washington, d.c., and if anyone needs a reminder why the coronavirus vaccine is important, there's one arriving at the takoma metro stop: an almost empty train pulling up to an almost empty subway platform at the height of rush hour.\n\none year ago the world health organization held its first news conference on a new coronavirus emerging from wuhan, china. incredibly, i'm on my way to mark that anniversary by joining some six million americans who have already been vaccinated.\n\nas i board the train, there are five other passengers on a car with 62 seats. i take my place as far from each of the others as i can — much as they must have when they boarded — reminded of the importance of social distancing by a metallic voice emanating from overhead speakers: facial coverings are required at all times while riding metrorail and metrobus. everyone is, indeed, masked.\n\ni'm traveling across town to a location that's dispensing covid-19 shots two-trains-and-a-bus-ride away from my home: the washington senior wellness center. when i logged onto the district's vaccination website to make my appointment in the first hour that doing so was possible, the two dozen closer locations already had no reservations left. this is the first time people over 65 are eligible, and by day's end, all available slots had been snapped up, all across the district.\n\nso i'm lucky. as are the 17 people lined up before me when the center opens at 10 a.m. — opens being a relative term, since we're still lined up outside on this brisk january morning. until your appointment time is just a couple of minutes away, you stay outside.\n\ninside, things are bright and socially distanced. the pharmacists are dispensing the moderna vaccine (which does not have to be kept insanely cold), and the process at this center is so efficient it seems almost anticlimactic: a form to sign, a pinprick, and about 90 seconds after i enter the room, i get a sticker saying vaccinated. sort of an adult lollipop to take home.\n\ni'm told to come back in four weeks for a booster shot that will make me as protected as i'll ever be. and that, i guess, is that.\n\nit all reminded me of a friend's observation that the most important home renovation he'd ever done, replacing his roof, was also the least satisfying. before he did it, he had a roof. after he did it, he'd spent $30,000, and he had a roof.\n\nthis feels a little like that. i have not gotten sick with the coronavirus. and now that i've gotten the first of my two shots, the chances that i'll get sick are much diminished. that's good, because i'm old enough to be at heightened risk of dying.\n\nbut society is still at risk, so it won't change the fact that i'll need to wear masks, stay six feet away from people, and avoid crowds until most of the public has been vaccinated, too.\n\nit's enormously important, this protective roof i've put on my own risk. a miracle provided by medical professionals to whom i am profoundly grateful for putting me back where we all started.
amy schumer deftly challenges beauty standards in 'i feel pretty'\n\na woman with low self-esteem hits her head and suddenly sees herself as madly attractive. critic david edelstein says i feel pretty suggests the notion of what's pretty should be elasticized.\n\ndavid bianculli, host:\n\nthis is fresh air. the comedian amy schumer became a movie star with her 2015 comedy trainwreck, which she co-wrote. her third big screen comic vehicle, i feel pretty, opens today preceded by some noteworthy negative publicity. film critic david edelstein explains.\n\ndavid edelstein, byline: the internet backlash against the amy schumer comedy i feel pretty began early, based on the trailer. and it rested on the idea that the movie is about how an ugly woman becomes beautiful. that's an understandable mistake but a mistake nonetheless. it's a funny, deft, in some ways conventional rom-com about a woman with painfully low self-esteem who hits her head and suddenly sees herself as madly attractive. behaving as if she's the most gorgeous creature on earth might make her an object of hilarity. but her stratospheric sense of self-worth disarms everyone she meets.\n\nschumer didn't conceive i feel pretty. it was written and directed by the team of abby kohn and marc silverstein. but it fits into her tv show inside amy schumer's history of challenging men on their caveman aesthetic and those women who feel they have no choice but to accept male definitions of beauty. along with lena dunham, schumer has been on the front lines, as twitter jackasses have argued that a woman who looks like her shouldn't even have her own show, a criticism she transformed into an ingenious parody of 12 angry men in which a jury of overentitled male dweebs debated her hotness.\n\nher character in i feel pretty, renee bennett, stares forlornly into the mirror and attempts to compensate for not looking like a fashion model - the kind of women who walk around in micro-miniskirts at the corporate office in which she wants to work, an estee lauder-like makeup company overseen by michelle williams' blonde and beauteous avery leclaire. renee rewatches the movie big, in which a kid who longs to be a grown-up is magically transformed. and then she goes and wishes at a fountain to be, quote, undeniably pretty. it doesn't happen then. but the next day, she goes flying off the bike in spin class, bangs her head and thinks her wish came true. believing she's a guy magnet, renee banters at her dry cleaners with an unassuming bearded man played by rory scovel.\n\n(soundbite of film, i feel pretty)\n\namy schumer: (as renee bennett) you probably haven't been here before, but you have to wait in line and take a number.\n\nrory scovel: (as ethan) oh, all right.\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) i can grab it for you, yeah.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) oh, thank you.\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) i just - here.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) thank you.\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) and this guy just calls out, like, the number completely out of sequence.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) ok.\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) it's like a weird game of bingo.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) all right.\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) but no one wins. so yeah.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) what's your number?\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) so this is how it happens, just like that. wow.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) just like what happens? like what?\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) that is very clever.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) i don't know why that's clever. what is clever? i was just asking...\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) what's your number? and then i go, oh, 118. and then you're like, no, your phone number.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) oh.\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) yeah. you are good. how long have you been hanging onto that little nugget?\n\nscovel: (as ethan) i haven't. i haven't been holding onto that. that's not a nugget at all.\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) you don't hang out in a lot of dry cleaners and hit on perfect girls? that's - wow. all right. give me your phone.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) my phone?\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) give me your phone. i'm going to give you my number.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) are you still talking to me?\n\nschumer: (as renee bennett) don't chicken out now.\n\nscovel: (as ethan) i'm not chickening out.\n\nedelstein: that scene's loose, overlapping dialogue as two characters on different wavelengths do and don't connect is one of the movie's glories. rory scovel stays in the film and proves an inspired straight man for amy schumer's renee, a social outcast with little romantic experience who comes to see her as a life force. you can go with or shrug off such rom com contrivances, though co-directors abby kohn and marc silverstein are masters of them, having written the wonderful never been kissed with drew barrymore.\n\ni feel pretty is by leagues schumer's best film. her motormouth delivery has a high-wire quality, as if she's babbling for her life. and her pratfalls have a ballerina's precision, probably enhanced by the editor, tia nolan. when renee spontaneously enters a coney island bikini contest, the scene could be squirm-inducing. but instead, it's exhilarating because renee is at home in her body. as the shellacked and baby-voiced mogul avery leclaire, michelle williams has a lyrical melancholy. she's a smart, educated woman who feels as trapped in her body as schumer's renee does in hers and stuck with a voice she's unable to change.\n\nthe movie suggests almost no one has the appropriate level of self-esteem. i feel pretty can be criticized as too rosy on the grounds that the power of positive thinking can only get us so far. indeed, it can even reinforce the repressive social norms it claims to challenge. but renee's positive thinking has such a dizzy, life-affirming charge that she makes you believe if she's not quote, pretty, it's because the definition of pretty is inadequate. it needs to be elasticized or maybe blown to smithereens.\n\nbianculli: david edelstein is film critic for new york magazine. on monday's show, pulitzer prize-winning poet gregory pardlo. his new memoir is called air traffic: a memoir of ambition and manhood in america. some of the things that figure into his story - his father losing his job when reagan broke the air traffic controllers union, joining the marine reserves and then wanting out, and being on a reality tv show with his family. join us.\n\n(soundbite of the wee trio's belle femme de voodoo)\n\nbianculli: fresh air's executive producer is danny miller. our technical director and engineer is audrey bentham with additional engineering support from joyce lieberman and julian herzfeld. our engineer today is charlie kaier. our associate producer for digital media is molly seavy-nesper. thea chaloner directed today's show. for terry gross, i'm david bianculli.\n\ncopyright © 2018 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump's 'socialism' attack on democrats has its roots in cold war fear\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption chris kleponis/getty images chris kleponis/getty images\n\nthere's a huge 2020 democratic field forming for the chance to take on president trump. two more candidates officially announced over the weekend – sens. amy klobuchar of minnesota and elizabeth warren of massachusetts.\n\nand while those two potentially embody the core split within the democratic primary – pragmatism vs. pugilism – trump will be waiting in the general election with another distinction he hopes to make: socialism vs. greatness.\n\nthe democrat party has never been more outside of the mainstream, trump said in el paso, texas, on monday night in what was his first campaign rally of 2019. they're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime.\n\npolitics state of the union is trump's first major speech in 2020 election cycle state of the union is trump's first major speech in 2020 election cycle listen · 5:03 5:03\n\nit's a message he began trying out a week ago during his state of the union address. he tied the unrest in venezuela to domestic u.s. politics.\n\nhere in the united states, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country, he said. america was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination and control. we are born free, and we will stay free. tonight, we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country.\n\nthe denunciation of socialism and the attempt to tie the philosophy to democrats is trump's and his campaign's attempt to invert the argument that he is an extremist. the president's sluggish approval rating means he is going to have to try and pull democrats down with him — and given that surveys also show he would lose at this point to a generic democrat, trump also needs to show their candidates to be unelectable and out of step with the rest of america.\n\nhe's the first president to never crack 50 [percent approval] in his first two years, said bruce mehlman, a republican strategist and attorney who worked as an assistant secretary in the commerce department for technology policy. the resistance is really energized, and that's part of why you saw the highest midterm turnout since 1914 last november. the economy has been really strong, but it's showing some worrisome signs. mr. mueller's report and/or democratic oversight will likely make the waters choppier. and voters want change.\n\nrepublicans tried a version of trump's inversion strategy to no avail in the 2018 midterm elections. they tried to paint democrats as wanting to abolish ice (the immigration and customs enforcement agency) and create single-payer health care.\n\nrepublicans said if the election turned out to be about that, as opposed to a more nuanced discussion of border security and pre-existing conditions, they felt they could win or hold their own. it didn't happen. instead, in an election where trump was front of mind, democrats won over suburban voters and independents, and took back the house by flipping 40 seats.\n\nin 2020, trump gets to try to make the argument himself. and people close to him think he can make a winning one.\n\nat the end of the day, politics and elections are typically binary choices, said andy surabian, who worked in the 2016 trump campaign war room, was political director for tea party express and is now a political adviser to donald trump jr. the biggest gift to trump is for democrats to nominate what i call a 'kneeler,' someone who supports kneeling for the national anthem.\n\nmehlman added: if the dems are able to nominate a presidential nominee that appeals to the middle of the country, that's going to be very powerful. but if they go hard left, there is a path for donald trump to get re-elected.\n\nit is, in theory, an advantage a president has when he's up for re-election with a locked-down base and no primary opposition — yet. his potential democratic opponents will have to outflank each other, and that often can mean being the most stridently progressive (or conservative, in gop primaries).\n\nthe new debate over socialism\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption scott olson/getty images scott olson/getty images\n\nalready, many of the democrats running or thinking about it are embracing medicare-for-all and the green new deal. both of those ideas have been put forward by the party's two highest-profile democratic socialists — vermont sen. bernie sanders, an independent who caucuses with the democrats, and new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez.\n\nthis is a fairly new debate to be taking place within the mainstream of the democratic party rather than at the fringes. sanders caught fire in the 2016 primary race and gave a surprisingly strong challenge to democratic front-runner hillary clinton. sanders didn't prevail, but the boldness of his ideas did.\n\nit's going to be interesting to see how democrats walk and define the line when it comes to socialism. the word makes many americans — and some democrats, especially older ones — uncomfortable.\n\na remarkable shift has happened in just the past decade, since the 2008 financial collapse — more democrats now have a positive view of the word socialism (57 percent) than capitalism (43 percent), gallup found last year.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic? click here.\n\nthat diverges from the country overall, as only slightly more than a third (37 percent) of americans have a positive view of socialism. socialism also rates lowest when people are asked about it in a list that includes small business, entrepreneurs, free enterprise, capitalism, big business and even the federal government. since trump's election, however, socialism is the only one on that list to gain popularity.\n\nthere is a huge generational divide: a majority of young people, those aged 18 to 29, see socialism positively and have a dimmer view of capitalism. older americans have a more sharply negative view of the term — 41 percent of those aged 30 to 49, 30 percent of those aged 50 to 64 and just 28 percent of those 65 and older view it positively.\n\nthis younger generation, after all, are not cold war kids. someone who is 29 was born the year before the fall of the iron curtain. the word socialism just doesn't have the same meaning for them as for those who lived through the nearly 50-year, post-world war ii arms race with the soviet union and the underlying debate over the ideal society.\n\nloading...\n\ndon't see the graphic above? click here.\n\nas viewed by americans, that debate was between the free, capitalistic west on one side and the repressive communism and socialism of the ussr on the other.\n\nsome democrats are trying to find more nuance. sen. brian schatz of hawaii, for example, sparked an interesting debate on the left with his tweet that he's not a socialist but does believe that every american deserves health care, that college should be debt free, and that america must lead boldly on climate change.\n\nand schatz may be on to something. when younger voters respond positively to socialism in polls, they're not saying they want the country to become like venezuela or cuba. to them, socialism is synonymous with a strong social safety net and an economy where big banks and billionaires pay — proportionately — their fair share in taxes.\n\npresident trump is moving aggressively to define the democrats as old-fashioned, cold war-style socialists. now, it's up to the democrats to define what it is they are for.\n\nmuch of the difference comes down to semantics — the wording and view of what socialism really is.\n\nthe problem, though, is nuance doesn't usually play well in campaigns, especially in primaries.
democratic sen. doug jones endorses former vice president joe biden\n\nnpr's david greene talks to sen. doug jones of alabama, one of 14 states voting on super tuesday, about why he thinks a ticket with bernie sanders at the helm could hurt his own reelection bid.\n\nrachel martin, host:\n\nwe turn now to alabama, one of the 14 states that will host its primary contest today. hillary clinton beat bernie sanders by more than 55 points in that state back in 2016. that suggests that it is joe biden's to lose. david greene talked with alabama's democratic senator, doug jones, who has endorsed the former vice president.\n\ndavid greene, byline: so why is joe biden your pick?\n\ndoug jones: well, i've known joe for a long time - i mean, 40 years. i first met him as a law student here in birmingham about - gosh, it was in i think 1978. and i've just - he struck me then as someone who would make a great president. he's the kind of leader that i think the country needs, someone that has incredible domestic policy experience but also foreign policy experience and the kind of leader who brings people together to try to actually get things done.\n\ngreene: well, since you know him so well, can you explain some of the curious moments in this campaign? i mean, for one, there was this story that biden told about being arrested in south africa on his way to see nelson mandela. it was largely disproven. finally, biden is saying, ok, i wasn't arrested. i was actually just held up at an airport. can you understand why these moments cause some doubt for voters?\n\njones: well, you know, i can't speak for other voters. i think people that know joe for a long time are looking at his record. they're not looking at things like that, especially when we've got folks in the white house, in the administration today, who have no compunction whatsoever about saying things that are either blown out of proportion, hyper hyped or either just outright false. so i think...\n\ngreene: but does that make it - i'm sorry to interrupt. does that make it ok for joe biden to say something that's not true?\n\njones: well, i don't think that that is going to be the issue at the end of the day. whether it's ok or not i don't think is going to be the issue. the issue that people are looking for - they're looking for a leader that is going to help get things done. they're looking for people to be able to reach across the aisle but also bring people within their own party together to find the common ground to make sure this country goes forward in a positive way. and i think that's the main issue, and that's why you see the people of south carolina - they know joe biden. they know his fallacies. they know his positives. and that's why the people of south carolina overwhelmingly gave him the victory they did the other night and why i think he's going to do very well on super tuesday.\n\ngreene: but there are voters who have said that some of these types of missteps in the campaign have caused them to question. i mean, what do you tell voters who say what's going on here?\n\njones: look at the totality of the record and what he can do and how he can bring together. look at the people who've known joe biden for as long as they have. look at the number of folks around this country who are for him because they know the kind of leader he is.\n\ngreene: so, i mean, i'm sure you're aware he faces an uphill battle going into super tuesday. i mean, he is at a huge fundraising disadvantage compared to bernie sanders right now. he's been behind in the polls in some very big states like california and texas. how does he overcome that?\n\njones: well, i think he overcomes it by continuing to move forward with the momentum that he's got. this is a delegate count number right now. this field is going to winnow down, and i think as joe biden goes forward, if you look at the states that are beyond super tuesday, those are also going to be very good delegate rich states for joe biden. this race is far from over. i think, unfortunately, folks in the media, with all due respect, have anointed four or five different people now as who is going to be the eventual democratic nominee. we've had, like, four contests, but this race is still fluid. yeah, senator sanders is going to probably have a delegate lead, but if you look at the totality of the circumstances and where the votes for the democrats have been throughout this season, i think that they're going to all coalesce in my opinion - and it is strictly that, my opinion - around joe biden ultimately.\n\ngreene: if sanders emerges as the front-runner and ends up leading, possibly winning, the delegate count, are you ready to get behind him?\n\njones: you know, look, i disagree with senator sanders on many, many things. i think he's got to kind of try to pull people together. you know, one of the things that i'm looking for is whether or not that he can pull and make sure that all voices in the democratic party are heard. right now, i'm having a hard time seeing that with senator sanders. but that's not to say he can't do it. we have got such a long way to go. i still believe this race is far from over. instead of playing a speculation game, i think we need to let this matter play out. i think we need to let all the elections.\n\ngreene: well, what specifically worries you about bernie sanders? you said you're worried about him bringing all the - you know, a full coalition together. what are you specifically worried about?\n\njones: look, i think that senator sanders has a great number of supporters that are raising issues about poverty, about health care. but the way that they want to do things with medicare for all i just don't think is a viable option. and i'm not sure how senator sanders right now will try to bring people around to accomplish what we all want to accomplish, and that is health care for everyone in one form or another. that's just one issue. i think his issues on climate change are farther than they need to be at this point because we've got to make sure we do things to keep people employed and we do it smart. but my concern is whether or not there will be an ability to pull people together to try to get things accomplished as opposed to it's got to be this way or that way.\n\ngreene: democratic senator doug jones of the state of alabama. really appreciate talking to you, senator. thank you.\n\njones: always a pleasure, david. thanks so much for having me.\n\ncopyright © 2020 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
trump impeachment trial recap: republicans balk at mcconnell over session rules\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mandel ngan/afp via getty images mandel ngan/afp via getty images\n\nupdated at 1:57 a.m. et on wednesday\n\nafter more than 12 hours of action tuesday, the senate adopted the ground rules for the coming weeks in president trump's impeachment trial. it brought a reminder that even this highly scripted ordeal may include a few surprises after all.\n\nsenators did not agree to the first draft of rules proposed by majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., notwithstanding his party's control of the chamber and his reputation as a savvy counter of votes.\n\nhe had repeatedly insisted that the rules for the trial would be modeled on those for the 1999 impeachment trial of president bill clinton.\n\nmcconnell also said confidently last week that all the members of the gop conference backed his approach to have the prosecution and defense lay out their arguments and address written questions before turning to the issue of whether to subpoena witnesses or documents.\n\nwhen members of his own conference reviewed the details of his resolution, mcconnell was forced to do something he doesn't have to do often — change his plan under pressure from fellow republicans.\n\nloading...\n\nhis draft resolution stated that each side would present its case in up to 24 hours over two days. his last-minute revision expanded that timing to three days. he also allowed evidence from the house to be automatically entered into the record unless there were an objection.\n\nbut while mcconnell may have been forced to revise his plans for the overall structure for the trial rules, he was able to stave off several attempts by senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., later in the day and late into the night on tuesday. republicans voted down 11 amendments, mostly to subpoena documents from the white house, state department and other administration officials. they stuck with mcconnell's argument that the issue about witnesses and documents would be addressed after both sides made their case for and against impeachment.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alex wong/getty images alex wong/getty images\n\ncollins leads rebels in balking at rules\n\nmcconnell is frequently lauded for his political acumen and ability to see around legislative corners. he held firm as house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., demanded he set up a fair trial before she sent over the articles of impeachment. he prevailed — she was unable to extract any commitments.\n\nthe majority leader also ignored predictable calls from democrats such as schumer to allow more than two days for the impeachment managers to make their case.\n\nbut he couldn't ignore maine sen. susan collins, who was among a group of senate republicans who insisted that the time be extended.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption j. scott applewhite/ap j. scott applewhite/ap\n\nsenator collins and others raised concerns about the 24 hours of opening statements in 2 days and the admission of the house transcript in the record, her office said in a statement. her position has been that the trial should follow the [bill] clinton model as much as possible. she thinks these changes are a significant improvement.\n\nthe fate of mcconnell's initial proposed rules represented a very rare defeat at the hands of his own allies and underscored the desire, at least by collins and a few others, for the senate not to appear as a partisan rubber stamp.\n\ndems, white house spar over witnesses\n\non that point, at least, collins and the other rebels broadly agreed with the case made by house impeachment managers about a number of amendments to mcconnell's rules.\n\nrep. adam schiff, d-calif., the lead manager, urged senators to adopt a number of amendments offered by schumer that would have admitted witnesses and documents into the proceedings.\n\ntrump's fate in this phase of impeachment — whether he's convicted or acquitted — will have greater value if americans believe that the president truly underwent a full and fair trial, schiff said.\n\nand that means, he argued, that the senate must bring in former national security adviser john bolton, acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and others who schiff said would shed more light on the underlying events of the ukraine affair.\n\nwhite house counsel pat cipollone urged senators to reject schumer's amendments, and he repeated republicans' long-standing criticisms of the impeachment case generally and schiff in particular.\n\nit's outrageous! cipollone said.\n\nschiff and his compatriots, including democrats zoe lofgren of california and val demings of florida, made what were effectively opening arguments against trump, structured around the evidence they said should be brought into the matter.\n\ndemings, for example, detailed the material in the possession of the state department that she said would strengthen democrats' case that trump had abused his power or conditioned his policy toward ukraine last year on the expectation that its leaders would launch investigations that trump thought would help him politically.\n\ndebate continued until nearly 2 a.m. et wednesday as schumer continually offered amendments seeking testimony or material for the trial — and mcconnell and republicans continued to bat them down. the proceedings resume at 1 p.m. et wednesday.
rep. joaquin castro on trump's border emergency declaration\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nlet's turn now to congress and a democratic member there. he is representative joaquin castro of texas, and he joins us now on the line.\n\ncongressman, good morning.\n\njoaquin castro: good morning.\n\ngarcia-navarro: i'd like to start with venezuela. as you just heard, it's a very tense situation there in a part of the world where the u.s. doesn't have a lot of goodwill to expend. is this administration doing the right thing, in your view, in trying to directly influence venezuelan affairs?\n\ncastro: i think the administration has to be careful not to be too heavy-handed given the united states' involvement in latin america in the past. ultimately, the people of venezuela have to be able to choose who their leader is. but i think there's two things that need to happen immediately. first, we need to make sure that that humanitarian aid gets into the country because there's so many people who are starving and suffering. the second thing is that the united states congress should move right away and the president should move right away to offer temporary protected status to the people of venezuela to be able to come here to the united states at least temporarily if they need to.\n\ngarcia-navarro: what is your reaction, though, to secretary of state pompeo's tweet last night that the u.s. will take action? there is a lot of ambivalence among democrats about intervention.\n\ncastro: that's right. i hope that he doesn't mean military action. in fact, i'm on the foreign affairs committee. we just had elliott abrams, who's a special representative for venezuela, testify about a week-and-a-half ago. and he didn't give any indication that military action was imminent. that said, i think we've got to get with the lima group, with oas, with the united nations to make sure that that aid gets in and that elections are held as soon as possible.\n\nyou know, i was one of the folks that has supported sanctions against the maduro regime in the past. so you know, most folks would be fine if maduro left. i think people want change. but we also have to be careful to make sure that it's the venezuelan people who are choosing their new leader.\n\ngarcia-navarro: let's turn to something that you're sponsoring. the president declared a national emergency on the southern border over a week ago. you've introduced a resolution to terminate that declaration, which will get a vote on tuesday. does it have any chance in the senate?\n\ncastro: (laughter) well, it should pass the house of representatives. we have probably about 228 folks supporting it now, including a republican.\n\ngarcia-navarro: but just one republican.\n\ncastro: that's right. we have justin amash of michigan. and our appeal has been very bipartisan. we've made it an issue about the fact that the president is trying to usurp the power of congress. the constitution gives congress the power of the purse. and the president asked mexico to pay for this wall; they wouldn't. congress wouldn't pay for the wall. and now he's trying to unilaterally take the money, billions of it, from military construction funds. and so in communities like mine of san antonio, which is military city, usa, that's a big problem. but you asked the question about the senate. i think that we can get three more votes that we need to pass it in the senate and then send it to the president's desk. obviously, that's going to take a lot of work.\n\ngarcia-navarro: president trump has promised to veto.\n\ncastro: yeah. no, there's no question. there's no guarantee here. it's an uphill battle. but as i said when this started, if he declares a national emergency just to build a border wall that he said mexico would pay for, we're going to fight him in congress. we're going to fight him in the courts. and i believe that a large segment of the american public will fight the president on this.\n\ngarcia-navarro: representative castro, if the president vetoes it - if it doesn't pass in the senate, it seems like this is simply an action - like, a protest vote, if you will. is relying on the courts so heavily really the way you as a democrat want to advance your ideas?\n\ncastro: well, i think that it's an approach from different angles. right? it's an approach in congress, trying to pass legislation. and then you xavier becerra and 16 other attorneys general in other states who have filed suit. so yeah, i mean, we fundamentally disagree with a president doing something that no president has ever done before, which is to call a national emergency to try to deliver on a campaign promise that he said another country was going to pay for it. nobody's ever done that before. so yes, we're going to do everything that we can in congress and in the courts. and i hope that the american people continue to speak up.\n\ngarcia-navarro: democratic representative joaquin castro of texas, thank you so much.\n\ncastro: thank you.\n\n(soundbite of marley carroll's first thought, best thought)\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
how i moved my cat from israel to pakistan\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption diaa hadid/npr diaa hadid/npr\n\ni recently hunched over my desk lunch and typed: how to get a cat from israel to pakistan.\n\nthis is not a question that google easily answers. there are no holiday packages from israel to pakistan — no direct flights, and no diplomatic relations.\n\nbut here i was, asking the internet weird questions at npr's washington, d.c., headquarters in june. i was being trained there before i was to be dispatched as their islamabad-based correspondent. most of my worldly possessions — and my cat — were in israel and the palestinian territories, where i was previously based as a mideast correspondent for the new york times.\n\nforeign correspondents are famous for adopting cats. it's a quixotic proclivity, because of how frequently we travel. but no other correspondent i've heard of had tried something like this. and i asked all the cat-loving correspondents i could find.\n\nfinally, through the company animal airways, i reached eytan kreiner, an israeli veterinarian. i explained the pickle i was in.\n\ndon't worry. we are experts in taking animals to enemy countries, he said in a thick israeli accent. i imagined an aged mossad operative.\n\nwe just took a dog to iran, he said. we have an underground network of vets who help us. everybody is sympathetic to animals. even enemies.\n\nkreiner said he could fly my cat from israel to a third country. they would change his papers and then fly him to pakistan. i dutifully paid $350 to start the process.\n\nmy cat shawareb — arabic for mustache — was an accidental acquisition.\n\nin 2015, i lived in the palestinian city of ramallah in the west bank. there, one of my roommates brought him home: a stray, mewing, gray-striped fur ball with enormous green eyes. i liked him but i wanted nothing to do with him.\n\ni grew up with countless cats in the yard of my parent's home in canberra, australia. in the late 1980s, my father, a postman, went broke and the cats became a luxury. instead of cat food, we gave them scraps of meat from the sheep that dad slaughtered for halal meat.\n\nthe cats were a burden. dad abandoned a few at the local dump, but let two or three stay. i think he saw how much they meant to me. i didn't have many friends, and i spent my school lunchtimes in the library reading books. at home, the cats were reliable company.\n\nbut i developed nasty allergies as a teenager. cat hair triggered violent sneezing. my eyes watered and my skin itched. my parents gave the last cats away. i didn't touch another feline for two decades.\n\nthen i moved to ramallah. it's a fun place, with hipster bars and country outings, but i had few friends. i was lonely. my old childhood yearning for a friendly cat welled up inside. my roommate lost interest in the kitten and soon i was letting him sit on my desk as i wrote. i took two or three antihistamines a day to breathe. he slept curled into a ball near my shoulder. i took more pills. i took to calling him shawareb for his funny kitten mustache.\n\ni knew he was mine when he got sick — a tooth infection left him a smelly, mangy mess. i drove him to jerusalem to see a vet. he removed most of shawareb's teeth and charged me $400.\n\nwhen we went for a follow-up, demonstrations had broken out through the west bank. the main israeli military checkpoint was closed as soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at masked youths hurling rocks and flaming bottles. i tried to leave through another checkpoint. masked young men burning tires on the road stopped me.\n\nthe road is closed, auntie, one of them announced. he glanced into my car and i grimaced.\n\nmost palestinian residents of the west bank can only enter jerusalem with hard-to-obtain israeli military permits. here i was, cavorting about with a cat, no less, for a follow-up at the vet. i felt silly. it wasn't lost on me that my ramallah street cat may have more freedom of movement than the area's human residents.\n\ni called the vet in jerusalem. i'm late. there's a few problems on the road.\n\nwhere are you? he asked. ramallah, i answered. oy vey, he responded.\n\nover the next 18 months, i moved five more times — it was a procession of bad-luck apartments, from ramallah to jerusalem. shawareb came with me.\n\nhe grew into a friendly thing, always seeking out a lap to sit on. he meowed endlessly for attention. he left mauled birds under my bed. my cat allergy disappeared.\n\nin november 2016, i decided to leave the new york times — and jerusalem. i packed my things into boxes. but shawareb?\n\ni got in touch with an old friend, amit. he lived on a communal farm known as a kibbutz on the israel-lebanon border. he promised to care for shawareb until i could take him.\n\nlast february, i drove six hours across the country to deliver shawareb to amit in kibbutz misgav-am. shawareb settled into amit's tiny apartment. i thought about my life that had taken me across these enemy lands — for me a patchwork region of the middle east that i loved deeply. covering its conflict and suffering left me tired and broken hearted. the sun set into a gorgeous sky of pink and orange, and i said goodbye. i left jerusalem in march.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption diaa hadid/npr diaa hadid/npr\n\nthen during my visit to washington last june, i began thinking: could i find a way to move shawareb to islamabad?\n\nfor weeks, i plotted how to ship him to islamabad with ahava cohen, who works with kreiner, the israeli vet. we needed a third country that had direct flights to tel aviv and islamabad. we had three options: london, istanbul and bangkok.\n\nthe airline had to be cat-friendly. the third-country airport had to process shawareb quickly. we settled on bangkok.\n\ncohen cheerfully informed me that the company would do the move for $3,335 — over double the yearly wage of a cook in islamabad.\n\nthat's immoral, i thought. if i did it myself, it would be about half the cost.\n\nthere was a glitch: i had just moved to pakistan, but i only had a single-entry visa. if i left the country, i couldn't re-enter.\n\ni asked on a reporters' facebook group in jerusalem if somebody could take the cat to bangkok — i'd pay — causing a pileup of journalists cheerfully volunteering for the flight. but the problem was pakistan: getting a visa here is hard, and i feared problems for anybody coming from tel aviv.\n\nthen amit called with some pressing news. he moved apartments and his new landlord didn't want pets. shawareb had to go. i begged for more time.\n\ni finally received my pakistani multi-entry visa in october. i arranged for a week off in january.\n\nbut those days were planned for another big day: my wedding in australia. i eyed the dates. if i cut short our honeymoon, i could fly to bangkok and pick up the cat.\n\ni know.\n\nsuddenly i was spending money furiously on shawareb's big move. i paid for my flight, which included agreeing to pay $25 for every kilogram of shawareb. he's 8 kilos — 17 pounds.\n\ni paid for amit's trip to bangkok. friends in bangkok directed me to a cat-friendly hotel while we sorted his papers.\n\namit arrived in bangkok with shawareb. i arrived at 3 a.m. to the cat-friendly hotel. shawareb meowed when i open the door. i curled up with the cat on the couch and slept.\n\nthe next morning, i handed shawareb over to a travel company with the dubious job of transforming him: from a palestinian cat with israeli papers into a thai cat heading to pakistan. they only needed a few hours, they said, and they'd drop shawareb off at the airport.\n\nwith a few hours before my flight, amit and i caught up. he talked me through shawareb's epilepsy medicine, and gave me a tincture for his anxiety.\n\nwe lost track of time. i raced to a taxi.\n\ni sat on my suitcase at gate 4 as hundreds of people poured in through sliding doors. shawareb soon emerged on a luggage trolley, pushed by a representative of the thai travel company.\n\ntoggle caption a friend of diaa hadid's for npr\n\nin suvarnabhumi airport, traveling with a cat is like presenting a baby. shawareb was smiled at and treated gently, even when he was put through a scanning machine.\n\nthe representative gave me two envelopes: one with all shawareb's israeli documentation, another with his new thai papers.\n\nnearly a year after i drove shawareb to a kibbutz on the israel-lebanon border, my little palestinian cat made it home. amid the crowds and chaos of islamabad's benazir bhutto international airport, a luggage handler left shawareb's carrier near the baggage claim. a pakistani man on my flight carried him over to me.\n\nnobody asked for shawareb's papers. there seemed to be some security alert. airport staff were busy screening all the suitcases coming off the flights.\n\nshawareb is still adapting. he hisses at doodh, the elderly siamese cat that i'm taking care of for a friend. he wants constant belly rubs. when i video call my husband, he sits in front of the screen. he shredded the black foam of the recording studio.\n\nand when he jumps on my desk, crunching the keyboard with his paws and deleting my work, i cuddle him and bury my face in his fur.\n\ni'm so happy he's here. i hope we make it together, to our next destination.
boeing to pay $2.5 billion settlement over deadly 737 max crashes\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption mulugeta ayene/ap mulugeta ayene/ap\n\nboeing will pay more than $2.5 billion to settle a criminal charge related to the two 737 max plane crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nthe justice department has announced that it has reached a deferred prosecution agreement with boeing to resolve a charge of criminal conspiracy to defraud the faa.\n\nboeing admits to criminal misconduct for misleading regulators about the safety of the troubled jetliner, but the airplane manufacturer is not pleading guilty to the charge. if boeing complies with the terms of the settlement, in three years the government will drop the criminal charge. that's important for boeing, a huge federal defense contractor, because a criminal conviction would prohibit the company from getting future government contracts.\n\nunder the terms of the deal, boeing will pay a criminal penalty of $243.6 million, which is less than 10% of the $2.5 billion settlement. most of the rest, $1.7 billion, will go to airlines that purchased 737 max planes to compensate them for lost revenue during a lengthy grounding of the aircraft type while the cause of the crashes was investigated. another $500 million will be paid into a fund to help compensate the families of those who were killed in the crashes.\n\nthe agreement protects only the company from further prosecution, not employees who may have engaged in misconduct.\n\nfederal prosecutors say key boeing employees deceived the faa, misleading the safety regulators about a new flight control system on the 737 max called mcas.\n\nthat system activated erroneously, contributing to the deadly crashes, by forcing the planes into nosedives that the pilots could not pull the aircraft out of.\n\na 737 max-8 jetliner operated by indonesia's lion air plummeted into the java sea shortly after taking off from jakarta's airport on oct. 29, 2018, killing all 189 people on board. another 737 max-8 operated by ethiopian airlines crashed in a similar way into a field shortly after taking off from the addis ababa airport on march 10, 2019.\n\nthe federal investigation found that boeing employees misled the faa about the significance of the mcas system and didn't mention the flight control system in pilot training and flight deck manuals, so most pilots didn't even know the system existed before the first crash.\n\nthe tragic crashes of lion air flight 610 and ethiopian airlines flight 302 exposed fraudulent and deceptive conduct by employees of one of the world's leading commercial airplane manufacturers, said acting assistant attorney general david burns in a statement announcing the agreement.\n\nboeing's employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the faa concerning the operation of its 737 max airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception, burns added.\n\nmisleading statements, half-truths, and omissions communicated by boeing employees to the faa impeded the government's ability to ensure the safety of the flying public, said the u.s. attorney for the northern district of texas, erin neely cox, whose office led prosecution.\n\nboeing sought to downplay any corporate responsibility and placed blame instead on two former technical pilots who in documents uncovered during the course of investigations, were found to be mocking and misleading faa officials. ceo david calhoun said their conduct doesn't reflect boeing employees as a whole or the character of the company.\n\nthis is a substantial settlement of a very serious matter, calhoun said in a message to company employees. i firmly believe that entering into this resolution is the right thing for us to do — a step that appropriately acknowledges how we fell short of our values and expectations.\n\ncarl tobias, a law professor at the university of richmond who specializes in product liability law and who has reviewed the deferred prosecution agreement, said: there's some really damning language in there about sacrificing safety, you know, for profit, basically, and that's troubling.\n\nit did not find widespread fraudulent behavior in the company but these two central employees did engage, according to the government, in very bad conduct, tobias added.\n\nbut by singling out those two boeing employees accused of deceiving faa regulators, critics say the justice department is letting boeing off the hook.\n\ni find this fine to be inadequate given the egregious nature of the offense, said democratic congressman peter defazio of oregon, who chairs the house transportation committee, in an interview with npr. his committee's investigation into the design, development and initial certification of the 737 max found widespread evidence of engineering and management failures at boeing, as well as grossly insufficient oversight by the faa.\n\nthis settlement amounts to a slap on the wrist and is an insult to the 346 victims who died as a result of corporate greed, defazio added. i hope the doj can explain its rationale for this weak settlement to the families, because from where i sit this attempt to change corporate behavior is pathetic and will do little to deter criminal behavior going forward.\n\nmichael stumo, whose 24-year-old daughter samya rose stumo died in the ethiopian airlines crash, also sharply criticizes the deferred prosecution agreement.\n\nthis is a boeing protection agreement, stumo told npr. there's nobody

munich security conference reveals a growing rift between u.s. and its allies\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alexandra beier/getty images alexandra beier/getty images\n\nthe u.s.-led liberal world order is falling apart, according to the organizers of a gathering of world leaders and defense chiefs in germany that has met annually since the cold war.\n\nthe munich security conference report said the trump administration displays an irritating enthusiasm for strongmen across the globe and disdain for international institutions and agreements.\n\nfor much of this past week, the growing rift between the u.s. and its traditional european allies has been on display.\n\nfirst, in warsaw, poland, the u.s. organized a conference seeking to marshal international outrage over iran, and vice president pence urged france, germany and the u.k. to abandon the iran nuclear deal, accusing them of concocting a scheme to continue to business with iran. top european allies trying to keep the nuclear deal alive declined to send top-level diplomats to the conference.\n\nthen on saturday, in munich, german chancellor angela merkel addressed the security conference with several critiques of u.s. foreign policy – and received a sustained standing ovation.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alexandra beier/getty images alexandra beier/getty images\n\nshe resisted pence's calls to withdraw from the iran nuclear deal, arguing the deal can help countries pressure iran over issues that concern the u.s.: iran's ballistic missile development and its role in wars in syria and yemen.\n\nmerkel also criticized the u.s. decision to withdraw its troops from syria. is it a good thing to immediately remove american troops from syria, or will it not strengthen russia and iran's hand?\n\npresident trump's daughter ivanka, who was in the audience, did not join the applause that followed.\n\npence defended u.s. global leadership in a speech to the conference, saying nato member countries have boosted their defense spending thanks to trump's urging. that's what we call being leader of the free world, he said.\n\nthe end of speech was greeted with short, muted applause.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption alexandra beier/getty images alexandra beier/getty images\n\neuropean leaders are doing themselves no favors in bashing trump, wrote judy dempsey, a nonresident senior fellow at carnegie europe. even if trump was to be defeated (and that's a big if), a change in the white house is not going to fundamentally change the dynamics of what is happening in europe.\n\nshe noted china's interest in acquiring strategic assets in europe and the toxic combination of china and russia's ambitions to divide and break the west.\n\na power competition is emerging among the u.s., china and russia, and other countries are unwilling and incapable to step up as guardians of the liberal order, the security conference report argued.\n\na new pew research center poll, published in the report, suggests that germans believe russia's vladimir putin and china's xi jinping handle world affairs better than trump does.
brazilian president bolsonaro withdraws from u.n. compact on migration\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption evaristo sa/afp/getty images evaristo sa/afp/getty images\n\nin his second week in office, far-right brazilian president jair bolsonaro has pulled the country out of a u.n. migration pact, fulfilling a pledge he made before taking office.\n\nbrazilian diplomats told local media on tuesday that the country officially left the agreement. a diplomat also told reuters that brazil has exited the pact.\n\nbolsonaro appeared to confirm the withdrawal on wednesday, tweeting, no to the compact on migration.\n\ndefense of national sovereignty was one of our campaign's banners and it will be a priority of our government, he wrote. the brazilians and immigrants who live here will be safer under rules that we ourselves make, without external pressure.\n\nbrazil's departure from the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration marks the latest rejection of the non-binding agreement, which has drawn protest across the world, especially from far-right politicians in europe. nearly 30 countries, including the united states, refused to sign the pact in december.\n\nbrazil was among the majority of countries that signed onto the compact, under the country's previous administration.\n\nbolsonaro's decision to leave the agreement follows guarantees the president-elect and his foreign minister made last month, after a polarizing election and runoff.\n\nthe bolsonaro government will withdraw from the global compact on migration being launched in marrakech, an inadequate instrument for dealing with the problem, tweeted ernesto araújo, now the country's foreign minister, in december. immigration must not be dealt with as a global issue, but rather in accord with each country's reality and sovereignty.\n\nmore than 700,000 registered immigrants live in brazil, according to the migration policy institute, along with several hundred thousand more undocumented immigrants. by far the largest segment comes from portugal, followed by japan, italy, paraguay and bolivia.\n\nmeanwhile, brazil has become one of the primary destinations for an increasing number of venezuelans fleeing a political and economic crisis at home. at least 65,000 venezuelans have sought asylum in brazil over the last four years, according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees.\n\ngeoff ramsey, assistant director for venezuela at the washington office on latin america, told npr last fall that about a dozen tent camps were operating on the brazilian-venezuelan border.\n\nlast month, araújo tweeted that brazil would continue to welcome venezuelan asylum-seekers even when it withdrew from the compact, though it would also focus on the restoration of democracy in venezuela.\n\nthe u.n. accord has become a focal point for anti-immigrant sentiment, particularly in europe. marine le pen, leader of france's far-right national rally, called the agreement a pact with the devil. and in brussels last month, thousands of protesters took to the streets carrying anti-immigration banners as they rallied against the pact.\n\nthe trump administration refused to participate in the agreement more than a year ago, while other countries agreed to the pact last summer but pulled out before it was formally adopted, including austria, hungary, italy, chile and australia.\n\nbolsonaro's government, now just over a week old, has drawn comparisons to the current u.s. administration, including in its rhetoric on refugees. on wednesday, the brazilian president echoed president trump's language comparing national security to home security.\n\nif we decide who we let into our own houses, why would we do any differently when it comes to our brazil? he tweeted.\n\nin a televised address on tuesday night, trump argued for his proposed border wall by pointing out that wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes.\n\nbolsonaro has taken his victory as a mandate to change the country's foreign policy, according to an op-ed by his foreign minister published in bloomberg on monday.\n\nwe are convinced that brazil has a much larger role to play in the world than the one we currently attribute to ourselves, araújo wrote.
tax the ultrarich to solve poverty? easier said than done\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption nichole sobecki for npr nichole sobecki for npr\n\na new report from oxfam says that just 1 percent of amazon owner jeff bezos' fortune — estimated at $112 billion — would cover ethiopia's entire annual health budget. that's health care for 105 million people.\n\nso, oxfam proposes, let's tax the rich to help the poor.\n\nit's not a new idea. in fact, oxfam has been making the recommendation for a few years now, pegged to its annual report that compares the wealth of those in the top 1 percent of humanity — $8.4 trillion in 2018 — with the combined assets of the poorest half of humanity — $1.4 trillion. the reports coincide with the world economic forum, where elites gather in davos, switzerland, to discuss the world's most pressing problems.\n\nthe latest report — published on monday and called public good or private wealth? — says that in 2018, the world's 26 richest people had as much as the poorest 3.8 billion combined. in 2017, it was 43 individuals.\n\nbut would a 0.5 percent global tax on the wealthy solve inequality?\n\noxfam thinks so. its report says that if the world's richest 1 percent just paid an extra 0.5 percent in taxes, there would be enough money to educate all 262 million children who are out of school according to u.n. calculations and provide enough health care to save the lives of 3.3 million people who are likely to die from lack of proper treatment for medical conditions.\n\nthe rich are doing very well — thank you very much — and those on the wrong end are working harder and harder for less and less everywhere we look, says paul o'brien, oxfam america's vice president for policy and advocacy.\n\nreducing the wealth gap would be a boon to poverty eradication, oxfam argues.\n\nand that's certainly a pressing issue. even though the number of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 a day) has declined dramatically over the past few decades from 2 billion in 1990 to 705 million in 2015, the world bank has warned that progress is slowing. what's more worrying, according to oxfam, is that while the fortunes of billionaires grew by 12 percent last year according to forbes (or about $2.5 billion a day), 3.4 billion people who were living on less than $5.50 a day saw their wealth shrink by 11 percent.\n\nbut is a global wealth tax realistic?\n\no'brien agrees that it would take an enormous amount of political will among the world's leaders. but he is optimistic about the odds. major agencies like the international monetary fund are discussing the need for it, whereas less than 10 years ago, he was told at the world economic forum that it would never even become the subject of public conversation.\n\nbut until that day comes — if ever — there may be other ways that taxation could bring more funds to the poor. the oxfam report estimates that ultrawealthy individuals are currently hiding $7.6 trillion in offshore accounts.\n\naccording to alex cobham, chief executive of the tax justice network, many governments have repeatedly expressed a willingness to address this problem, and some have introduced measures as well.\n\nfor example, a couple of years ago, the tax justice network worked with the australian taxation office to challenge deals that multinational corporations had set up through singapore. oil and gas giant chevron ended up with a $1 billion tax bill.\n\nbut not everyone is convinced that taxing corporations and the wealthy is the solution.\n\nproper taxation is important, but it's one thing among many that we need to do to address poverty, says vijaya ramachandran, a senior fellow at the center for global development.\n\nramachandran says she is not sure that just addressing inequality is the solution to poverty and that a lot of pieces have to work together for poverty to disappear, including a functioning government that uses tax revenue appropriately and institutions that deliver health care, education, water, electricity and services. the oxfam report agrees that funding of public services — especially ones that protect and empower women and girls — is crucial to reducing inequality.\n\ncash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. the idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. india, kenya, finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. the stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nthen there are what harvard business school professor and co-author of the prosperity paradox clayton christensen calls market-creating innovations. christensen says that a lot of money right now is being poured into making good products or services cheaper through strategies like outsourcing, for example. but outsourcing can actually worsen inequality if there aren't new jobs for the laid-off workers.\n\non the other hand, christensen says, innovative types of businesses can solve social problems while creating local and global jobs — like a chain of one-stop-shop privately run diabetes clinics in mexico that are much cheaper than the public option for treatment. these types of business innovations, he says, have the potential to lift entire countries out of poverty by providing employment as well as social benefits.\n\nwhether through a global wealth tax or other practices, oxfam's o'brien just wants to see inequality reduced now.\n\nhopefully, we won't have to talk next year, he told me, because we'll have solved global extreme inequality!\n\njoanne lu is a freelance journalist who covers global poverty and inequality. her work has appeared in humanosphere, the guardian, global washington and war is boring. follow her on

voices from the southern border: perspectives of those who live and work there every day\n\npresident trump has called what's happening on the u.s.-mexico border a crisis. but what is it like for the doctors, judges, mayors and border patrol agents who live and work there?\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nto justify the need for a wall along the u.s.-mexico border, trump has repeatedly described the situation at the border as a crisis. but what is it like for the doctors, aid workers, judges, mayors and border patrol agents who live and work along the border every day? we talked to people from every single border state - california, new mexico, arizona and texas - and asked them, what are they experiencing? while the people we spoke with agree there is a crisis, they differ over the kind of crisis and how to solve it. here's what they said.\n\nnorma pimentel: i am sister norma pimentel. and i'm director for catholic charities here in the rio grande valley, overseeing the humanitarian response that we have here in our border. i believe that people that are not from here don't have quite a complete picture of what life is here at the border.\n\nand unfortunately, when we hear all these narrative of the importance of wall and sending out criminals and protecting us from crime and all these ugly people that are coming, i realize that they're failing to see a part of the immigration reality that we see on a daily basis - people who are just like us, who are suffering and hurting and in need of great help. i believe what our holy father speaks to us about - the importance of building bridges and not walls.\n\ndouglas nicholls: i'm douglas nicholls. i'm the mayor of city of yuma. we have had a long history dealing with immigration. and we're in a better position now that we have a barrier that was constructed in 2006. i believe it's - would be effective in most places, although i'm not completely convinced it's for every installation. a physical barrier is a very kind of first-step deterrent. immigration reform would be the primary (laughter) wish list item and then just more facilities, family shelters.\n\nthere - we have no ice family shelter here in arizona, so those individuals need to be moved to texas. so we need those kind of facilities here. and then immigration judges are on my wish list. if we had immigration judges that were available at the border, processing could happen quicker. and we could relieve some of the flow that's coming through.\n\nashley tabaddor: my name is ashley tabaddor. and i'm the president of the national association of immigration judges. the crisis we see is that we have an immigration court that is structured within the justice department, so the court has been repeatedly used throughout the years as an extension of law enforcement policies. and we believe that that's where the crisis lies.\n\nas long as we continue to have the immigration court within the justice department, we continue to have the problems that we have seen plague the court - the backlog, the compromise to the integrity of the court through the quotas that have been placed on the judges, the lack of adequate funding for interpreters or support staff, hiring a hundred judges and not having enough courtrooms or support staff for it. so we think it's really important to focus on fixing the court.\n\ntheron francisco: my name is theron francisco. i am a border patrol agent here in san diego. in san diego, we're seeing a pretty big increase in the amount of family units we're apprehending and the amount of unaccompanied children. we are averaging about 154 arrests per day just in san diego. we agree with needing a wall.\n\nsan diego has been a prime example of how walls work. in the late to mid-80s to early '90s when there was no infrastructure at all, we had hundreds of thousands of apprehensions. assaults were at all-time highs on agents. and through the addition of new infrastructure, updated, new technology coming in in addition to more agents, we were able to bring our numbers down. it can't be just one. it's the combination. it's that whole system that really is effective.\n\ndee margo: dee margo, the mayor of el paso, texas - the only large u.s. city on the mexican border. we need to control our borders. no, i do not believe that a fence will suffice when it comes to protection and homeland security issues. our fence that runs - was done during the bush administration. and it runs through part of downtown and on the west side of our city - hasn't been so much a stop for illegal immigration as it's been for, basically, criminal activity, where we used to have folks from mexico coming over and stealing vehicles.\n\nbut the rhetoric related to being unsafe or things like that or all this drug trade coming over, we don't have issues that - we don't have - i asked my police detail about ms-13 gang members the other day. and they thought they maybe could identify one here in el paso. right now we're just dealing with - primarily, the biggest challenge we have is this migrant community coming north, seeking asylum.\n\nand the bottom line is that's not going to change until they change our immigration policies in washington. and that's the responsibility of both sides of the aisle. and they haven't had the fortitude to deal with it for over 30 years.\n\nlucy horton: my name is lucy horton. i'm an infectious disease fellow at uc san diego. i've been working in tijuana at different shelters and camps that are currently housing the migrants. they're not able to process the asylum seekers and immigrants as quickly as they were before the shutdown, which means that they, potentially, could be facing prolonged times in the detention facilities.\n\nthe conditions are pretty squalid - people living in extreme crowding. sanitation is terrible. sometimes, there's no access to clean drinking water. the prolonged detention in these crowded conditions is really concerning for a spread of communicable diseases. it doesn't seem like it's as much of a security threat as a humanitarian crisis.\n\nesequiel salas: i'm mayor esequiel salas for the village of columbus, n.m. there are many crises. but i don't see it as a crisis as it has been described. the crisis is further south in honduras, guatemala because of their economy, because of countries interfering with their country, upsetting their political systems in order to benefit from them. it causes chaos. it causes gang wars. and some of these people are fleeing - of course, all that violence. and they're coming up here. and we're just getting the waves of the whole thing. and it won't be resolved by putting up a wall. i'll tell you that.\n\ngarcia-navarro: that was sister norma pimentel, yuma, ariz., mayor douglas nicholls, judge ashley tabaddor, border patrol agent theron francisco, el paso, texas, mayor dee margo, dr. lucy horton and columbus, n.m., mayor esequiel salas.\n\n(soundbite of music)\n\ngarcia-navarro: that segment was edited by caitlyn kim and produced by samantha balaban.\n\ncopyright © 2019 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
why north korea's kim jong un may be leaving the door open to nuclear talks\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption ahn young-joon/ap ahn young-joon/ap\n\nupdated at 1:08 p.m. et\n\nafter keeping the world waiting and watching, first for a christmas present to the u.s., and then for a new year's shift to a harder line on nuclear negotiations, north korean leader kim jong un delivered neither.\n\nsome analysts believe a key reason behind his calculations may be president trump's prospects for surviving an impeachment process and possibly winning a second term in the white house.\n\ndonald trump happens to be the first sitting u.s. president to view north korea as a source of political victory, for domestic purposes, says go myong-hyun, a research fellow and expert on north korea at the asan institute for policy studies, a seoul-based think tank.\n\npyongyang has said it has no intention of handing president trump any victories on denuclearization, but officials see trump's eagerness to tout achievements to his domestic audience as a source of leverage.\n\nin remarks carried by state media, kim on tuesday had plenty of tough words for the u.s. as he addressed a plenum of the ruling workers party central committee. he acknowledged the countries' current stalemate on nuclear talks, but insisted he would not passively wait for things to improve.\n\nwe should never dream that the u.s. and the hostile forces would leave us alone to live in peace, but we should make [a] frontal breakthrough with the might of self-reliance, he told the plenum as it wrapped up four days of meetings.\n\nhe also asserted that north korea is no longer constrained by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons and long-range missile testing.\n\nstill, kim said pyongyang had unilaterally halted nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests in order to build confidence with the u.s. and he appeared to leave the door open for concessions and further talks.\n\nnorth korea expert park hyeong-jung predicted that outcome even before the speech.\n\npark is with the korea institute for national unification, a government think tank in seoul, and says pyongyang will not take any action to damage its relationship with the u.s. irreparably.\n\npyongyang had warned it could take a tougher new way if the u.s. failed to meet its demands for concessions by year's end.\n\nkim jong un will have to stage some anger at the u.s. and chastise them for ignoring his year end deadline, park predicts, but could be willing to return to the negotiating table by summer if the u.s. shows signs of accommodating pyongyang.\n\nstill, a lot could happen in u.s. politics by summer. if they calculate that president trump won't be re-elected next year, says analyst go, then their approach is going to fundamentally change. at that point, go says, pyongyang could unleash provocations that leave little room for compromise.\n\nprolonged stalemate likely\n\nfor now, analysts see a prolonged stalemate over north korea's nukes as all but inevitable.\n\nnuclear weapons are very good for self-defense, and for preserving the existing status quo, argues texas a&m university political scientist matt fuhrmann. but he says they're not especially useful for forcing changes to the status quo, as in using nuclear threats to blackmail your adversaries.\n\nfuhrmann says that kim has been relatively successful in acquiring nuclear weapons in order to ensure the survival of his regime, and it is unlikely that he could be compelled to give them up.\n\nbut using nuclear threats to extract concessions from the u.s., such as security guarantees or the sanctions relief pyongyang seeks, would be far more difficult. this is because actually using the nukes would all but ensure the regime's extinction, fuhrmann says, even if they continue to build their arsenal.\n\nnorth korea's only remaining tool is nuclear brinksmanship — essentially bluffing opponents into thinking pyongyang might actually use atomic weapons, even though it is plainly evident that the cost of doing so is prohibitive for both sides.\n\nfuhrmann's theory has implications for policy: a nuclear-armed north korea is not the apocalyptic event some fear, even if we might prefer a situation where they were not to have nuclear weapons.\n\nhe advises that a complete and verifiable nuclear disarmament is somewhat unrealistic. better, he says, for the u.s. to look for a deal that allows us to place meaningful limits on north korean capabilities.
democrat sherrod brown tours early voting states\n\nohio democratic sen. sherrod brown hasn't decided to run for president yet. he's on a tour of early primary states, like new hampshire, testing out a message focused on the working class.\n\nlulu garcia-navarro, host:\n\nit's still just february of 2019, but the 2020 presidential race is already up and running. it's the most diverse field of democrats ever, some more known than others. and they all want to challenge president trump next november. they've also announced their candidacies in a variety of ways. here's senator elizabeth warren at a rally yesterday in massachusetts.\n\n(soundbite of rally)\n\nelizabeth warren: i stand here today to declare that i am a candidate for president of the united states of america.\n\n(cheering)\n\ngarcia-navarro: author and spiritual adviser to oprah, marianne williamson, announced her candidacy on stage in los angeles last month. and in texas...\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\njulian castro: and i'm proud to call myself a son of san antonio.\n\ngarcia-navarro: ...former mayor julian castro.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\ncastro: i am a candidate for president of the united states of america.\n\ngarcia-navarro: former congressman john delaney announced via a washington post op-ed back in 2017. and earlier this month, senator cory booker tweeted his news with a slick campaign video.\n\n(soundbite of political ad)\n\ncory booker: in america, we have a common pain. but what we're lacking is a sense of common purpose.\n\ngarcia-navarro: a new york tech entrepreneur announced by video, too.\n\n(soundbite of political ad)\n\nandrew yang: hello. i'm andrew yang. and i'm running for president as a democrat in 2020.\n\ngarcia-navarro: then there are the television talk shows. here's representative tulsi gabbard on cnn.\n\n(soundbite of cnn broadcast)\n\nvan jones: are you going to run?\n\ntulsi gabbard: i have decided to run and will be making a formal announcement within the next week.\n\njones: whoa.\n\n(cheering)\n\ngarcia-navarro: and senator kamala harris on good morning america.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, good morning america)\n\nrobin roberts: do you have an announcement you'd like to make?\n\nkamala harris: i am running for president of the united states.\n\ngarcia-navarro: senator amy klobuchar says she's making a big announcement this afternoon in minneapolis. what could it be? several more potential candidates have formed exploratory committees but haven't quite made it official, like south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg. and here's senator kirsten gillibrand on the late show with stephen colbert.\n\n(soundbite of tv show, the late show with stephen colbert)\n\nstephen colbert: how often does the exploratory committee go out and explore and come back and go, yeah, yeah, don't run?\n\nkirsten gillibrand: well, it's an important first step.\n\ncolbert: ok.\n\ngillibrand: and it's one i am taking because i'm going to run.\n\ngarcia-navarro: and then there's sherrod brown, the populist democratic senator from ohio. even though he's still mulling a run for the presidency, brown's essentially in campaign mode, visiting key early voting states. he's seen by some as the antidote to donald trump's popularity in the midwest. npr's asma khalid reports from his latest stop in new hampshire.\n\nasma khalid, byline: sherrod brown calls this trip his dignity of work tour. he's an evangelist for workers and better wages. at a bookshop in concord, he insisted, you don't win a state like ohio if you don't understand that.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nsherrod brown: democrats think you have to choose between running to the progressive base, as i believe we should, and talking to working families, talking to workers, that it's a choice. and it can't be a choice.\n\nkhalid: brown and his supporters will often point out that he's been talking about unfair trade deals and working class wages long before donald trump entered the political arena.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbrown: i look at the phony populism of donald trump, always dividing people with his rhetoric.\n\nkhalid: part of brown's goal is to reclaim populism.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbrown: real populism is never racist. it's never anti-semitic. it doesn't divide people. it doesn't give tax cuts to rich people. it doesn't do any of those things, real populism. and that's what this fight's about.\n\nkhalid: it's an economic message ripe for the democratic primaries. and a woman in the crowd, lizzie shackleford, tells brown she hopes he joins the race. she thinks he has what it takes to fundamentally shift the equation between corporations and workers. but then she raises an issue.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nlizzie shackleford: my biggest concern, though, is how you will win the primary at a time when democrats are really looking for change from white men.\n\nkhalid: there's a slight pause, a few mmm hmms in agreement, and some chuckles. brown acknowledges the awkwardness but then dives into an explanation.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbrown: that's rather blunt.\n\n(laughter)\n\nbrown: i think the race is about ideas. and i think democrats understand that.\n\nkhalid: he then points to his voting record in congress.\n\n(soundbite of archived recording)\n\nbrown: if we're in the race, i will be the only one on stage that's had a longtime f from the nra, only democrat on stage that voted against nafta. i'll be the only democrat on stage that voted against the iraq war. i'll be the only...\n\nkhalid: brown is highlighting both his progressive credentials and his experience. he's been in congress longer than most of his fellow democrats running for president. and his answer was convincing to voters like sally helms and her longtime friend gerri king.\n\nsally helms: he sounded like he really had an answer to that question.\n\ngerri king: i think he's asked himself that question.\n\nhelms: right, and he's got a wife who probably asked him that question.\n\nking: probably asked that question.\n\nkhalid: his wife is connie schultz, the spunky, pulitzer prize-winning journalist who introduced him at this event. she's got her own fan base among progressives. one of the things you hear from people who've supported brown for a long time is that he is the real deal. and that's how helms felt after hearing him.\n\nhelms: he's about the fifth or sixth candidate that i've seen. and he's my favorite.\n\nkhalid: brown is far less known than some of his colleagues in the senate who've already declared their presidential ambitions. it's not clear how he would compensate for low name recognition. but he has something few other democratic candidates have - midwest credibility.\n\npat clark: he comes from a state, a gritty state, ohio.\n\nkhalid: pat clark, like a lot of people who tell me they like brown, mentions the senator's roots in ohio.\n\nclark: one of those states that has a lot of industrial complexes, many of which have turned to rust. and he's been a champion and tried to bring back good jobs.\n\nkhalid: in the 2018 midterms, brown won ohio by nearly 7 points. in 2016, hillary clinton lost the state by about 8 points. brown's logic is that if he can win ohio, then he could also win nearby states that are more liberal, like michigan, wisconsin and pennsylvania. and if he can do that, then he could win the white house. asma

pediatrician who spotlighted lead in flint water weighs in on crisis\n\nex-michigan gov. rick snyder has been charged in the flint water crisis. npr's rachel martin talks to mona hanna-attisha, the pediatrician who nearly seven years ago, noticed something was wrong.\n\nrachel martin, host:\n\ntwo counts of willful neglect of duty - those are the charges against former michigan governor rick snyder and former flint, mich., public works director howard croft for their role in the flint water crisis. the misdemeanor charges carry a punishment of up to $1,000 and up to one year in jail. they come almost seven years after the city of flint began taking in water from the flint river in an attempt to save money. the water wasn't properly treated. it corroded the city's aging pipes, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. more than 100,000 flint residents were exposed to unsafe levels of lead. latricea adams is a community activist in flint. this was her reaction to the charges against snyder and croft.\n\nlatricea adams: it doesn't feel good.\n\nmartin: adams heads black millennials for flint, which advocates for the rights of flint residents still dealing with the effects of the water crisis.\n\nadams: accountability is great, but even with accountability, even if rick snyder was behind bars for a significant amount of time, that still doesn't compensate for the generations of irreversible damage that is and will continue to happen with flint residents.\n\nmartin: years ago, sometime after the city of flint switched to flint river water, pediatrician mona hanna-attisha started seeing something troubling. she treated a lot of children in flint, and her patients were showing twice the normal amount of lead in their blood since the change in the water supply. she called a press conference in september of 2015 and warned residents, especially kids, to stop drinking the water. more than five years later, dr. mona hanna-attisha is now the director of flint's pediatric public health initiative, and she joins us this morning. thanks for being here.\n\nmona hanna-attisha: rachel, it's great to be with you.\n\nmartin: can i ask you to take us back to that moment when you started to realize something was wrong? what was going through your mind?\n\nhanna-attisha: oh, i remember the exact moment. it was the summer of 2015. i was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. and she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that, mona, the water isn't being treated properly in flint. and because of that, there's probably lead in the water. and that's the moment that my life changed. when i heard the word lead, it was a call to action. i respect the science of what lead does. i understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. and i also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. it's the last thing our kids in flint needed. that's the moment i stopped sleeping. i stopped eating. i lost about 30 pounds. and i began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.\n\nmartin: which it was. i mean, so now here we are seven years later, it's hard to believe, these charges now against the former governor and another top official. what do you make of it?\n\nhanna-attisha: it's a bit of disbelief. it's been so long. and for so many people in flint, this justice delayed really felt like justice denied, that there was never going to be this level of accountability. and as a physician in flint, i never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. there was these criminal cases and civil cases. and as i began to practice more in flint and interact with the families of flint, i began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never close, and it stays open and open and open. and it's been open for about seven years. and having some level of justice is like a salve. it helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.\n\nmartin: you've written a book, and in it, you talk about the villains in this crisis as being more than a single person, more than one individual. can you explain how you see that?\n\nhanna-attisha: absolutely. so, you know, so many people ask me, like, who do you want in jail or who should go to jail? and there's not one villain. there's not 10 villains. there's many villains. and this is what i say in my book. i say there are lots of villains in this story. a disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. many people stopped caring about flint and flint's kids. many people looked the other way. people in power made tragic and terrible choices, then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. while charges have been brought against some of the individuals who are culpable, the real villains are harder to see because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. the real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism and even laissez faire neoliberal capitalism. and these are the villains that we don't usually notice and don't want to, and these are the villains that poison flint with policy. and i hope one day we can go after these systemic villains and bring forth justice.\n\nmartin: what is - what could that possibly look like now? i mean, even as you nod to the positive effect of these charges, where do you begin that larger level of healing and reconciliation to try to address some of those huge issues?\n\nhanna-attisha: yeah, and that has been my work since day one. from the moment of recognizing kind of this widespread lead contamination, this population-level trauma and this broken trust, our work has been in a very holistic way to mitigate the impact of the crisis and bring forth healing and recovery. you can think of what happened in flint as a case of science denial and our science helps speak truth to power. and we're leaning on that incredible science of child development and what kids and families need to bring forth healing and recovery. so what that looks like right now are these long-term interventions to support flint families, like child care, like medicaid expansion, like literacy support, like nutrition access - all of these critical ingredients to keep families healthy, including things like behavioral health services and trauma-informed care. because what flint was, by and large, was this population-level trauma. and people to this day are stressed and angry, and they feel guilt and they feel betrayed by the folks that were out there to protect them.\n\nmartin: would the crisis have happened had flint been a white suburb instead of a predominantly black city?\n\nhanna-attisha: of course not. flint is this egregious example of environmental injustice. it never would have happened in a richer, whiter community. there's a long history of racism in flint, and it was also perpetuated during this crisis.\n\nmartin: you, as the director of the initiative to mitigate the impact, tell us where your focus is in just a couple of seconds remaining.\n\nhanna-attisha: sure. my focus is to make sure that the kids of flint have the brightest future possible, that we not only recover but thrive after this crisis, and that we can share our best practices with so many other communities where children are suffering from the same sort of injustices.\n\nmartin: dr. mona hanna-attisha - she's a pediatrician, the one who first called attention to the water crisis in flint, mich., all those years ago. she's the author of the book what the eyes don't see: a story of crisis, resistance, and hope in an american city.\n\nthank you so much for talking with us.\n\nhanna-attisha: thank you, rachel.\n\n(soundbite of we came from the north's border monument)\n\ncopyright © 2021 npr. all rights reserved. visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.\n\nnpr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm, inc., an npr contractor, and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr. this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future. accuracy and availability may vary. the authoritative record of npr's programming is the audio record.
'atomic blonde' director brings stuntman skills to his 'punk rock spy thriller'\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jonathan prime/focus features jonathan prime/focus features\n\nin the new film atomic blonde, british agent lorraine broughton (charlize theron) shows up in 1989 berlin and gets a very violent reception. the film shows lorraine punching, stabbing and shooting her way through the murky world of cold war espionage — not exactly surprising considering atomic blonde was directed by former stuntman david leitch.\n\nleitch did stunts for fight club, 300 and the bourne ultimatum, among many other films, before jumping into the director's chair. he describes his new feature as a punk rock spy thriller.\n\ninterview highlights\n\non how he assesses an actor's ability to do their own stunts\n\nwe start showing them sort of like choreography, fight moves, with the idea to see their aptitude and checking up their ability to match motion or to remember choreography. and then you start to build sequences based on their ability, and obviously there's a training progression that goes along with that.\n\non charlize theron's aptitude for stunts\n\nshe's incredible. she's off the charts — in the top 1 percent of all the actors that we've worked with. you know, there are actors, like keanu [reeves] and hugh jackman, who can just remember this choreography like insane, and she's one of them. you know, 25 moves and you can change the one in the middle on the day and she still remembers it. ...\n\nshe really wanted to bring the physicality to it, and she really challenged us to challenge her. and so it was a great collaboration. i mean she showed up every day committed to train hard and to put the body mechanics behind it and not just make it sort of window dressing for a fight scene. it's like she's selling every single punch. and i have to say that that's rare. i mean, people come in and there's a little lack of confidence. you're intimidated standing in a room full of stunt people who do it for a living. and she would, you know, get over that and just go to work and has an aptitude for it.\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jonathan prime/focus features jonathan prime/focus features\n\non how a woman might fight differently than a man\n\nthere was a section of the movie we really wanted to ground in some sort of reality where the consequences felt real. and i guess in terms of having someone her [theron's] size fight a 6-foot-4, 230-pound russian, you know, there are techniques that you would use that obviously you don't always see in movies, but elbows and knees, you know, body weight throws, leverage techniques. you know, punching with your fists is not optimal when the guy's head is made of granite. so it's better to use weapons of your body that are more resilient and that have a stronger force.\n\n... punching with your fists is not optimal when the guy's head is made of granite.\n\non pitching his vision for the film to theron, who owned the rights to the graphic novel atomic blonde is based on\n\nit was based on a graphic novel which was like sort of cold war noir, very like the third man dark noir. ... as i opened up the script and as i read about berlin and the city — and having done six movies there — i thought about: this is nothing like '60s noir; this is '89 berlin. there's rock 'n' roll; there's graffiti. if you were a spy there, you'd be living in this crazy underworld of clubs. and then music started to jump off the page at me that i wanted to infuse into the movie.\n\nso i put together a song list and i put together a series of images that were really sort of based in, like, the street art and the graffiti movement and punk rock. and i said, i want to take this sort of stuffy noir and make it a punk rock spy thriller. and i think that's what sold her.\n\non the film's soundtrack, which includes songs by george michael, the eurythmics and duran duran\n\ni think music transports you immediately. ... as i was reading the script, certain songs spoke for certain scenes and certain set pieces — some to play sort of a juxtaposition to the violence there, you know, to lighten the tone; and others to dive in deeper into really where the spies were in their own personal stories in the movie. ... the other goal of atomic blonde was to create this protracted music video vibe throughout the movie. ... how do we make this feel like a contemporary version of [an] '80s music video the whole way through?\n\nenlarge this image toggle caption jonathan prime/focus features jonathan prime/focus features\n\non how james mcavoy's broken arm made it into the movie (mcavoy plays a fellow spy in berlin)\n\nhe was going to come onto the movie after christmas break and i get a call over the holidays. he's like, i broke my arm. i'm like, what? and so there was some shuffling around and then everyone panicking for a second, and then i came up with this idea that we make it part of his character. so the cast in the movie does play a story point. ... and it becomes part of his spy craft at the end of the day, which is fun. you know, the things that happen in production that you just have to react to. the show must go on, as they say.\n\non what he wanted to accomplish with this film\n\nfor me it was really to try to take the [spy movie] genre and give it a different spin. i feel it needed to be dusted off, or at least try to push the boundaries a little bit. i think the infusion of music, the infusion of the type of martial arts action took it in a different direction.\n\nand then obviously the female protagonist of it all isn't seen that often and quite frankly needs to be seen more. i think we have this opportunity on the heels of wonder woman's success that maybe more films with female protagonists in the action space can enter theaters and can get made and greenlit into production.\n\nsarah handel and jordana hochman produced and edited this interview for broadcast. nicole cohen adapted it for the web.
