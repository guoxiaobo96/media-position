greene: well, what specifically worries you about bernie sanders? you said you're worried about him bringing all the - you know, a full coalition together. what are you specifically worried about?
already, many of the democrats running or thinking about it are embracing medicare-for-all and the green new deal. both of those ideas have been put forward by the party's two highest-profile democratic socialists — vermont sen. bernie sanders, an independent who caucuses with the democrats, and new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez.
there is a huge generational divide: a majority of young people, those aged 18 to 29, see socialism positively and have a dimmer view of capitalism. older americans have a more sharply negative view of the term — 41 percent of those aged 30 to 49, 30 percent of those aged 50 to 64 and just 28 percent of those 65 and older view it positively.

this is a fairly new debate to be taking place within the mainstream of the democratic party rather than at the fringes. sanders caught fire in the 2016 primary race and gave a surprisingly strong challenge to democratic front-runner hillary clinton. sanders didn't prevail, but the boldness of his ideas did.
greene: but there are voters who have said that some of these types of missteps in the campaign have caused them to question. i mean, what do you tell voters who say what's going on here?
here in the united states, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country, he said. america was founded on liberty and independence, and not government coercion, domination and control. we are born free, and we will stay free. tonight, we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country.
j. marshall shepherd: how does bias shape our perceptions about science?
kate larsen: the u.s. has successfully bent its greenhouse gas emissions curve. and we are going to continue to reduce emissions over the next 10 years, likely regardless of trump policy.
throughout president trump's overseas trip this week, he's been getting an earful about climate and how important the paris climate agreement is. many foreign leaders say the u.s. should not abandon it, and president trump tweeted this morning that he will make a final decision next week. but as npr's christopher joyce reports, staying in or out of that paris deal may not make that much difference.
pien huang is a global health and development reporter on the science desk. she was npr's first reflect america fellow, working with shows, desks and podcasts to bring more diverse voices to air and online.
this younger generation, after all, are not cold war kids. someone who is 29 was born the year before the fall of the iron curtain. the word socialism just doesn't have the same meaning for them as for those who lived through the nearly 50-year, post-world war ii arms race with the soviet union and the underlying debate over the ideal society.
larsen: a lot of that is switching from coal to gas in the power sector and now increasingly from coal to gas to renewables. and that's a trend that we don't see stopping anywhere in the near future.
larsen: with current policy, including everything that states have committed to do and what president trump has indicated he is likely to roll back, we are on a path to reduce emissions below 2005 levels by about 15 to 17 percent in 2020.
hafstead: exiting paris could potentially have political ramifications to the extent that our pulling out of the agreement is going to cause other countries to do less.
as viewed by americans, that debate was between the free, capitalistic west on one side and the repressive communism and socialism of the ussr on the other.

joyce: that's kate larsen with the rhodium group, which does research on climate economics. emissions in the u.s. have declined by about 12 percent since 2005. a new study by rhodium says that decline is likely to continue.
she's a former producer for wbur/npr's on point and was a 2018 environmental reporting fellow with the groundtruth project at wcai in cape cod, covering the human impact on climate change. as a freelance audio and digital reporter, huang's stories on the environment, arts and culture have been featured on npr, the bbc and pri's the world.
part 2 of the ted radio hour episode bias and perception.
that diverges from the country overall, as only slightly more than a third (37 percent) of americans have a positive view of socialism. socialism also rates lowest when people are asked about it in a list that includes small business, entrepreneurs, free enterprise, capitalism, big business and even the federal government. since trump's election, however, socialism is the only one on that list to gain popularity.
a remarkable shift has happened in just the past decade, since the 2008 financial collapse — more democrats now have a positive view of the word socialism (57 percent) than capitalism (43 percent), gallup found last year.
joyce: larsen and other energy economists say a big part of that is due to decisions made by companies, especially those that make electricity.
jones: well, i think he overcomes it by continuing to move forward with the momentum that he's got. this is a delegate count number right now. this field is going to winnow down, and i think as joe biden goes forward, if you look at the states that are beyond super tuesday, those are also going to be very good delegate rich states for joe biden. this race is far from over. i think, unfortunately, folks in the media, with all due respect, have anointed four or five different people now as who is going to be the eventual democratic nominee. we've had, like, four contests, but this race is still fluid. yeah, senator sanders is going to probably have a delegate lead, but if you look at the totality of the circumstances and where the votes for the democrats have been throughout this season, i think that they're going to all coalesce in my opinion - and it is strictly that, my opinion - around joe biden ultimately.
jones: well, i don't think that that is going to be the issue at the end of the day. whether it's ok or not i don't think is going to be the issue. the issue that people are looking for - they're looking for a leader that is going to help get things done. they're looking for people to be able to reach across the aisle but also bring people within their own party together to find the common ground to make sure this country goes forward in a positive way. and i think that's the main issue, and that's why you see the people of south carolina - they know joe biden. they know his fallacies. they know his positives. and that's why the people of south carolina overwhelmingly gave him the victory they did the other night and why i think he's going to do very well on super tuesday.
today president trump is at the g-7 summit and high on the agenda is climate change. many world leaders are imploring trump stay in the global climate agreement, but emissions are going down already.

the denunciation of socialism and the attempt to tie the philosophy to democrats is trump's and his campaign's attempt to invert the argument that he is an extremist. the president's sluggish approval rating means he is going to have to try and pull democrats down with him — and given that surveys also show he would lose at this point to a generic democrat, trump also needs to show their candidates to be unelectable and out of step with the rest of america.

some democrats are trying to find more nuance. sen. brian schatz of hawaii, for example, sparked an interesting debate on the left with his tweet that he's not a socialist but does believe that every american deserves health care, that college should be debt free, and that america must lead boldly on climate change.

it's going to be interesting to see how democrats walk and define the line when it comes to socialism. the word makes many americans — and some democrats, especially older ones — uncomfortable.
the democrat party has never been more outside of the mainstream, trump said in el paso, texas, on monday night in what was his first campaign rally of 2019. they're becoming the party of socialism, late-term abortion, open borders and crime.
joyce: a 10 percent drop in emissions. president obama promised to cut emissions well over twice that under the paris agreement. in the end, though, the decision about staying in or leaving the paris agreement is not just about hitting numerical targets. hafstead, who's with resources for the future, says what the u.s. does sends a message to the rest of the world.
christopher joyce, byline: pope francis told president trump to stick with the paris agreement, so did france's newly elected president, emmanuel macron. the agreement they're so passionate about sets in motion a global effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that warm the planet. trump says it's a bad deal for the u.s. economy. nearly 200 other nations say it's a good deal for the planet. but climate experts point out that emissions in the u.s. are already going down without the paris deal.
republicans tried a version of trump's inversion strategy to no avail in the 2018 midterm elections. they tried to paint democrats as wanting to abolish ice (the immigration and customs enforcement agency) and create single-payer health care.
president trump is moving aggressively to define the democrats as old-fashioned, cold war-style socialists. now, it's up to the democrats to define what it is they are for.
and schatz may be on to something. when younger voters respond positively to socialism in polls, they're not saying they want the country to become like venezuela or cuba. to them, socialism is synonymous with a strong social safety net and an economy where big banks and billionaires pay — proportionately — their fair share in taxes.
jones: always a pleasure, david. thanks so much for having me.
doug jones: well, i've known joe for a long time - i mean, 40 years. i first met him as a law student here in birmingham about - gosh, it was in i think 1978. and i've just - he struck me then as someone who would make a great president. he's the kind of leader that i think the country needs, someone that has incredible domestic policy experience but also foreign policy experience and the kind of leader who brings people together to try to actually get things done.
greene: but does that make it - i'm sorry to interrupt. does that make it ok for joe biden to say something that's not true?

greene: democratic senator doug jones of the state of alabama. really appreciate talking to you, senator. thank you.
jones: well, you know, i can't speak for other voters. i think people that know joe for a long time are looking at his record. they're not looking at things like that, especially when we've got folks in the white house, in the administration today, who have no compunction whatsoever about saying things that are either blown out of proportion, hyper hyped or either just outright false. so i think...
at the end of the day, politics and elections are typically binary choices, said andy surabian, who worked in the 2016 trump campaign war room, was political director for tea party express and is now a political adviser to donald trump jr. the biggest gift to trump is for democrats to nominate what i call a 'kneeler,' someone who supports kneeling for the national anthem.

joyce: in effect, larsen says, what happens over the next few years has already been set in motion. the picture beyond 2020, though, gets cloudy. by then, whatever the trump administration does to dismantle climate regulations would have kicked in. economist marc hafstead says that if the economy grows faster as well, the downward emissions trend could stall by 2025.

about j. marshall shepherd's ted talk
there's a huge 2020 democratic field forming for the chance to take on president trump. two more candidates officially announced over the weekend – sens. amy klobuchar of minnesota and elizabeth warren of massachusetts.
and while those two potentially embody the core split within the democratic primary – pragmatism vs. pugilism – trump will be waiting in the general election with another distinction he hopes to make: socialism vs. greatness.
greene: so, i mean, i'm sure you're aware he faces an uphill battle going into super tuesday. i mean, he is at a huge fundraising disadvantage compared to bernie sanders right now. he's been behind in the polls in some very big states like california and texas. how does he overcome that?

why do many people dismiss issues like climate change, despite strong scientific evidence? climatologist j. marshall shepherd examines how different forms of bias shape how we perceive science.
republicans said if the election turned out to be about that, as opposed to a more nuanced discussion of border security and pre-existing conditions, they felt they could win or hold their own. it didn't happen. instead, in an election where trump was front of mind, democrats won over suburban voters and independents, and took back the house by flipping 40 seats.
he's the first president to never crack 50 [percent approval] in his first two years, said bruce mehlman, a republican strategist and attorney who worked as an assistant secretary in the commerce department for technology policy. the resistance is really energized, and that's part of why you saw the highest midterm turnout since 1914 last november. the economy has been really strong, but it's showing some worrisome signs. mr. mueller's report and/or democratic oversight will likely make the waters choppier. and voters want change.
in 2020, trump gets to try to make the argument himself. and people close to him think he can make a winning one.
jones: look at the totality of the record and what he can do and how he can bring together. look at the people who've known joe biden for as long as they have. look at the number of folks around this country who are for him because they know the kind of leader he is.
we turn now to alabama, one of the 14 states that will host its primary contest today. hillary clinton beat bernie sanders by more than 55 points in that state back in 2016. that suggests that it is joe biden's to lose. david greene talked with alabama's democratic senator, doug jones, who has endorsed the former vice president.
huang's experiences span categories and continents. she was executive producer of data made to matter, a podcast from the mit sloan school of management, and was also an adjunct instructor in podcasting and audio journalism at northeastern university. she worked as a project manager for public artist ralph helmick to help plan and execute the founder's memorial in abu dhabi and with stoltze design to tell visual stories through graphic design. huang has traveled with scientists looking for signs of environmental change in cameroon's frogs, in panama's plants and in the ocean water off the ice edge of antarctica. she has a degree in environmental science and public policy from harvard.
much of the difference comes down to semantics — the wording and view of what socialism really is.
marc hafstead: and my analysis was, under the best-case scenario, we'd come in somewhere around 10.
mehlman added: if the dems are able to nominate a presidential nominee that appeals to the middle of the country, that's going to be very powerful. but if they go hard left, there is a path for donald trump to get re-elected.
it is, in theory, an advantage a president has when he's up for re-election with a locked-down base and no primary opposition — yet. his potential democratic opponents will have to outflank each other, and that often can mean being the most stridently progressive (or conservative, in gop primaries).
jones: look, i think that senator sanders has a great number of supporters that are raising issues about poverty, about health care. but the way that they want to do things with medicare for all i just don't think is a viable option. and i'm not sure how senator sanders right now will try to bring people around to accomplish what we all want to accomplish, and that is health care for everyone in one form or another. that's just one issue. i think his issues on climate change are farther than they need to be at this point because we've got to make sure we do things to keep people employed and we do it smart. but my concern is whether or not there will be an ability to pull people together to try to get things accomplished as opposed to it's got to be this way or that way.
the problem, though, is nuance doesn't usually play well in campaigns, especially in primaries.
jones: you know, look, i disagree with senator sanders on many, many things. i think he's got to kind of try to pull people together. you know, one of the things that i'm looking for is whether or not that he can pull and make sure that all voices in the democratic party are heard. right now, i'm having a hard time seeing that with senator sanders. but that's not to say he can't do it. we have got such a long way to go. i still believe this race is far from over. instead of playing a speculation game, i think we need to let this matter play out. i think we need to let all the elections.
npr's david greene talks to sen. doug jones of alabama, one of 14 states voting on super tuesday, about why he thinks a ticket with bernie sanders at the helm could hurt his own reelection bid.
greene: well, since you know him so well, can you explain some of the curious moments in this campaign? i mean, for one, there was this story that biden told about being arrested in south africa on his way to see nelson mandela. it was largely disproven. finally, biden is saying, ok, i wasn't arrested. i was actually just held up at an airport. can you understand why these moments cause some doubt for voters?
joyce: which could have far greater consequences for global warming than how far off the climate mark the u.s. ends up.
market forces may impact emissions more than climate agreements
