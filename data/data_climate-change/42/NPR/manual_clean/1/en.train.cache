I'm relieved that he didn't become governor earlier, Paul Saffo says, adding that Newsom's eight years watching political master Jerry Brown will give him a better sense of when to lead and when to follow. I suspect going into this governorship he's gonna understand that timing better than ever.
The move has drawn extra scrutiny because that plant buys coal from a company headed by a large campaign donor to Trump, Murray Energy Corp. Chairman, President and CEO Robert Murray.
But while Trump claimed in his speech that he had terminated the GCF, Melanie Nakagawa, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy transformation at the U.S. Department of State under Obama, notes that the $1 billion that the U.S. did provide is already in the system. The check is in and it is already having an impact.
In the early 21st century we, too, are headed toward some destination we cannot know, but we can at least get a handle on the direction we are moving. Will we know by the end of these conversations which way the arc of history is bending? Maybe not, but it's worth trying.
But many scientists and public health groups warn that the new approach will instead put the health of Americans at risk by excluding rigorous studies.
To date, the former vice president has won 15 states, while the Vermont senator has won or led the popular vote in eight. Biden currently has a delegate lead of around 150, with a favorable map of states ahead.

Last year, scientists counted 51 grizzly bear mortalities in northwest Montana, making it the deadliest year since they started keeping track.
We're about halfway there, which means we have work to do, he said.
It's worth talking about because it already is a politically powerful idea among Democrats.
Breaking with tradition, Trump was a no-show at the annual White House Correspondents' Association Dinner Saturday night in D.C. It was the first time in 36 years that the president has not attended the event. Back in 1981, President Ronald Reagan did not attend because he was recovering from an assassination attempt. President Jimmy Carter did not attend in 1978 and in 1980. President Richard Nixon did not attend the dinner in 1974 and 1972.
Davenport was devastated by 2019 floods in the Upper Mississippi. How are local business preparing for future floods, and what role does climate change play in their voting?
SANDERS: I am glad to see a little bit of snow does not intimidate those of us from Northern New England, right?
But the dotted line comes from computer models — from scientists reconstructing Earth's surface temperature. This gives us very, very coarse information. It averages Earth's temperature over hundreds of years. So we can see temperature fluctuations that occur only over longer periods of time, like a thousand years or so. Any upticks, spikes or dips that occur in shorter time frames get smoothed out.
But in late 2016, they had a daughter.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And Nancy Pelosi, of course, is in Puerto Rico. So it's not like, you know, she's here right now talking to the president either. So I guess, you know, this leaves him taking his case to the American people. He tried to do that when he actually went and gave an address in the Oval Office. Did that move the needle?
Meanwhile, many analysts see a U.S. departure from the deal as paving the way for China to take the lead on climate change.
Sure, life can be done on $400, $450 a month, but I would challenge others out there to buy diapers, groceries and all the things that you need for a family of three on $400.
You don't want to curl up in a fetal position, says Sawyer. You do want to say we've got to move on this and we need help.
That kind of involvement by young people isn't new, Taft says. But what has changed, she says, is that today's social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other. With their phones set to retweet, they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away.
Last year, the association co-signed a letter opposing the new rule, along with more than 50 medical, environmental and scientific groups including the American Medical Association, the American Heart Association and the American Public Health Association.
GROSS: So this was in the 1960s. That was a hit. This is a version that you recorded in 1973. I think that this was in performance at the 92nd Street Y.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So you saw specifically, I think, in the shallower parts quite a bit of damage. Tell me what you saw there.
Moniz, now CEO of Energy Futures Initiative, agrees that the U.S. needs to pick up the pace of its shift away from carbon, but he calls the decade-long time frame impractical. He worries it could turn off key constituencies needed in the climate effort, including labor unions, oil companies and the business community.
So in a way the graphic is really comparing apples and oranges: measurements of the recent past versus reconstructions of more ancient times.
The agreement also, significantly, sets a global target to keep the rise in the average temperature to no higher than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. And it calls for some $100 billion a year in funding from developed countries toward developing countries to support green energy sources.
It's a big legislation because it's a huge [expletive] problem! We're all going to die, said McElwee. Every week it seems like the risks of climate change become more real, and the amount of devastation it is going to wreak upon humanity becomes larger, and that means we have to do bigger things.
McGinnes left his job at a big law firm to help launch a legal response to the spill. He would go on to become a key figure in the environmental efforts that grew out the event as well as a faculty member at UCSB.
So Nixon signed the environmental legislation, even though many in his own party opposed it.
But those supporting a departure won out. More than 20 Republican senators had called for Trump to leave the deal. Influential Trump advisers, reportedly Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, also urged him to withdraw.

We're going to call on President-elect Biden to lean into the agenda that he ran on, which was bold with a vision for addressing climate change and racial and economic justice, said Saenz. We know that our job will continue to be to hold him accountable to his promises, to support him and support other elected officials when they do right, and to campaign hard against those that would stand in the way.
Rather than attending the annual dinner — where the president traditionally is the opening act for a well-known Hollywood comedian and is also the butt of many of the event's jokes — Trump opted to take a short trip from Washington to Pennsylvania where he visited a tool manufacturing company in Harrisburg and signed two executive orders focused on trade. One of the orders directed the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a review of existing U.S. international trade and investment agreements and another created a new White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing to be led by Trump adviser Peter Navarro. Then Trump held a rally in in the Pennsylvania city and gave a nearly hourlong stump speech.

Yes, there's some energy for it on the left — some House Democrats have already said they will support the bill. However, there are indications House leadership isn't prioritizing the idea as much as those more liberal Democrats would like — Speaker Nancy Pelosi frustrated Green New Deal proponents by not giving them the kind of committee they wanted to put the policies together.
And it's always fun. I don't know how to say that without sounding goony, but it's true. Whatever else is going on in our lives, sitting together in a room and writing a song is always a good time, even when it's - even when our work is bad.
The U.K. has also announced plans to merge its Department for International Development into its Foreign Office, a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing U.K. aid. These shifts by the U.S. and U.K., two of the world's largest aid donors, could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world, says Konyndyk. — Joanne Lu
Listen, the four most powerful words in a democracy are: 'The people have spoken.' The people of Georgia spoke very clearly on Nov. 3, when they elected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and gave them our 16 electoral votes, Warnock said on NPR. We counted those votes three times. It is clear, when you look at the swing states all across our country, Joe Biden is the president-elect. Unfortunately, there are enablers of this nonsense in the United States Senate. And that's why the people who I'm running into all across Georgia are frustrated with politics.

While scientists disagree about what's behind the sluggish ocean current, the shift could mean bad news for the climate. The Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation [AMOC] – often called the conveyor belt of the ocean – exchanges warm water from the equator with cold water in the Arctic.

The U.S. Virgin Islands were devastated by hurricanes Maria and Irma, leaving homes collapsed and trees toppled on land. But there was also a great deal of damage under the water. In St. John, the storms churned up parts of the lush coral reef, depositing chunks on the beaches. Joining us now to talk about it is marine biologist Peter Edmunds of California State University, Northridge. He's been studying those reefs in St. John for more than three decades. Welcome to the program, sir.

Predictably, Trump spent roughly the first 10 minutes of his remarks bashing the media. A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation's capital right now, the president told the enthusiastic crowd of supporters. He added that back in D.C. they are gathered together for the White House correspondents' dinner — without the president. Trump then told the crowd he was thrilled to be with them instead, many miles away from Washington.

In 1965, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.
It's not just a question of intangible moral leadership or even of the potential profits from green energy that would be on the table. The Atlantic reported last year that a U.S. departure would likely result in less-transparent mechanisms for actually enforcing the Paris accord — because Chinese faulty and unreliable energy statistics could play a prominent role.
We have 12 years, according to science, if we're going to meet the challenge of the climate crisis. And to do that we have to tackle fossil fuels head-on. And the resolution just doesn't quite get us there, says Nicole Ghio, senior fossil fuel program manager at Friends of the Earth.

History Of Our Time: Making Sense Of This Moment
Before turning his attention to what his administration has done since his inauguration, Trump rendered his verdict media critic in chief. The media deserves a big fat failing grade, the president said.
Thank you, Bill. So it really was a great year - really, at least in one-hour weekly increments or, to be strictly accurate, in certain parts of one-hour weekly increments - usually when we got to talk to somebody cool.
While government funding remains vital, Espinosa said, this kind of support is crucial for the work of the Secretariat to assist nations in their efforts to implement their commitments under the Paris Climate Change Agreement.

This, I believe, is the reason why so many scientists (with, of course, brave exceptions), many of them in the public media, condemn the humanities as useless — or seem not to understand why we should bother with them at all. As a consequence, many scientific ideas are presented as having conquered some of the deepest questions we have been asking for millennia, when they haven't. Point in case, the origin of the universe, something we can't truly address within the scientific framework as we know it, is often presented as solved and understood. God isn't needed. Case closed. Boom.

GONYEA: It could be. There won't be many more opportunities like a debate. But Biden's lead and his momentum will be extremely tough for Sanders to overcome, even with a lot of primaries to go. Sanders himself is admitting that his broad movement of especially young voters has not been showing up at the polls quite as he expected. Last week, he gave a speech that really made it clear, A, he is not dropping out. But there was also a shift in tone. He's not pushing for Biden and the Democratic Party to address the issues he's been running on and those issues that are so important to young voters. And he says to the future of the party. On Wednesday, he even gave Biden a heads up of how that would go.

It is important to note that the Paris accord is only as strong as each nation's actual reduction in emissions. That means leaving the agreement isn't the only way to weaken it: Trump could have kept the U.S. as a signatory but continued to slash the programs that would actually make it possible to reach the target for emissions.

It's certainly the case that every administration tries to control information, but I think that what we're seeing here is much more sweeping than has ever been done before, said Andrew Light, the distinguished senior fellow in the Global Climate Program at the nonpartisan World Resources Institute.

According to Jesse Jenkins, a postdoctoral environmental fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School, that may be an unreachable goal.

Number two, they don't like the precedent that's set that a future Democratic president could declare a national emergency around gun safety or climate change or health care. They also don't like the constitutional clash that the president is setting up, where he's challenging the separation of powers and Congress's power to appropriate money.

There's a growing concern in the scientific community and among environmental organizations that the new administration might take aim at climate change research in particular. Trump has previously called climate change a hoax created by China to hurt the U.S. economy, though he later said he had an open mind on the issue.

I'm learning. I think that really what I hope we're able to do as a party and as a nation is rediscover the power of public imagination. I think that this is a very special moment and frankly that is something that that I think the President did do. In that he was able to take his profile and say here's this hugely impossible thing that seems ridiculous but I'm going to seriously push for it. And for him that's his wall. And obviously I'm diametrically opposed to it but I think that the reason he's so attached to this thing despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the American people want, is that it's the only vision he has. He has no other picture of America except an America with a huge wall on the southern border. And I think that what we have a responsibility to do is show what is another America looks like.

Ninety-five percent of all the avocados Americans eat are Hass, a variety discovered in California in the 1920s.

Under the Paris accord, the U.S. sent some $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund that is guided by the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change — the body that coordinates international climate policy. The U.S. was supposed to provide an additional $2 billion, but Trump has balked at that idea, and his proposed budget includes cuts to international climate programs.
ROTT: You know, and it's important to note most fire ecologists would tell you we're already way behind in that regard.
INSKEEP: Although, I do have to say, you mentioned the Republican tax cut. They said the same thing about the tax cut - let's do this tax cut. The economy will grow. It's going to be great. It's going to pay for itself. Hasn't turned out to be true at all.
So far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short-term needs — like giving their families enough food each day — rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way. But these families were also able to give their children more schooling. And now that the kids are aging into the workforce, it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty. If so, says Evans, that will be an exciting thing to find. — Nurith Aizenman
House Republicans preferred to force votes to approve debt ceiling increases in an effort to bring more accountability and political pressure to reduce the nation's deficit and debt. However, that decision never resulted in reducing spending and only added to a culture of brinksmanship in recent years that often threatened the U.S. into default on its debts and increased economic uncertainty around the globe.
his efforts to drain the swamp in Washington through prohibitions on lobbying after government service;
Our World in Data, an online publication based at Oxford University, also expects the number of people around the world with higher-education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis projects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100, compared with 725 million in 2015. Although the improvement isn't in every country, Green says the rise in the global average is still a striking win. — Joanne Lu
SAGAL: But we have asked you here to play a game that this time we're calling...
The GCF estimates that the 43 projects for which it has started to disburse funds will impact a total of 128 million people. And it still has more than $6 billion left to disburse. During the initial fundraising round in 2013, the GCF agreed not to start its next round until it had allocated 60 percent of the money it had raised in the first. Though no timeline was set, many people expected this would take four to five years.
JONES: Yeah (laughter). I think a giant cockroach-y (ph) bug thing. I did a movie, a horrible movie called Bug Buster.
Claire Grandadam, also from Water Integrity Network, says it happened in Costa Rica three years ago. With the data and citizen pressure, the water board set up water meters to check supply and billing, she says.
Every day [SEIU members] confront the crisis of climate, as well as environmental racism and economic inequality, so the Green New Deal is not something that is abstract to them, said Rocio Sáenz, the executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union. For our members the Green New Deal means clear air, clean water, safe communities, good jobs and a growing economy. So this, for us, is why we are part of this network. What we see, especially now more than ever, is that we cannot think about these issues in siloes.
GROSS: I saw the revival of the revival (laughter) with Alan Cumming last year.
At least one anti-Mercer demonstration has taken place outside the Renaissance office. And earlier this month, Mercer was dragged into the spotlight when he was sued by Renaissance partner David Magerman, who claims he was fired for publicly criticizing his co-CEO's political views in a Wall Street Journal article.
We can no longer ask people to stop wasting water. We must force them, the mayor told reporters. The mayor also announced the city moved Day Zero up a day because of the overuse of water.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: The shutdown clearly isn't helping that.
And the 1999 production never made it to Broadway. You were revamping the production when Fred Ebb died in 2004. The song is called He Always Comes Home To Me, and I think this is, like, a married woman singing to her maid. And the married woman knows that her maid has probably had an affair with her husband. Do I have that right? I've never seen the show.
SHAPIRO: You're talking about limiting global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius.
In contrast to development banks and rich country governments, the GCF also has a governing structure that gives developed countries a say over which projects get approved. The GCF was set up within the umbrella of the United Nations system expressly for this purpose. And its governing board is equally divided between representatives of developed and developing countries — winning valuable buy-in from the recipient countries, says Brown, a former international climate finance negotiator at the U.S. State Department.

But he can't do it alone. He'll need help from people like Democratic Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.
Bernie Sanders is staying in the race for president, but he made it obvious on Wednesday that he sees Joe Biden's clear path to the nomination.
The bird count first launched in 1998, and over time, Brown said scientists can get a big picture idea of what's going on with the avian population, especially when combined with data from other popular bird counts, such as the National Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Count.

When asked if climate change fit into that, he repeated that they'll focus on the core mission.
For the Beringians who stayed behind, Potter says, it would have been a rough living as the last ice age drew to a close. They're dealing with climate change that we can only imagine now — major changes from [the] ice age, to extinction of a wide range of mammal species, including mammoth, he says. And these are the people that adapted in this region.
Improving sexual harassment training. We are replacing our bi-annual, online sexual harassment training module with mandatory, in-person sexual harassment training provided annually and more frequently if warranted.
Over the past few years, thousands of public school teachers in Oklahoma, like Sheehan, have left the state for better pay and less stress (fewer classes, smaller classes, less instruction time). It's gotten so bad that the state department of education has had to issue emergency teacher certifications to replace teachers as quickly as possible.
BIANCULLI: This is FRESH AIR. Composer John Kander turns 90 years old tomorrow. With his lyricist partner Fred Ebb, he wrote the music for the Broadway musicals Cabaret and Chicago, as well as for the Martin Scorsese movie New York, New York. The first time Terry Gross spoke with John Kander was in 1991, when she asked about the origins of his songwriting partnership.
In Alaska, scientists have uncovered something they say is remarkable: the remains of two infants dating back more than 11,000 years.
Raised in New Mexico, Mercer early on developed a love of computers, getting a job at the weapons lab at Kirtland Air Force Base.
Someone's going to have to prove to me how that can be accomplished because it looks to me like for the foreseeable future we're gonna be using a substantial amount of fossil fuels, said Rep. Francis Rooney, R-Fla., co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, speaking to NPR before the Green New Deal's text was released.
Mobilize — that's the key word here, says Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy and environment at the U.S. Treasury in the Obama administration. The term was specifically chosen to underscore the understanding that only a portion of the $100 billion per year would come directly from rich country governments. The plan is to motivate mostly private sources of capital — for example, for-profit corporations — to invest in efforts that help poor countries deal with climate change.

DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Hi, glad to be here.
Some of Happer's scientific critics, though, see it as something more: a visceral distrust of scientists who study environmental risks.
In a statement offered by de Leon's office, Holder said he was honored to help the Legislature as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California's residents and policy priorities. I am confident that our expertise across a wide array of federal legal and regulatory issues will be a great resource to the legislature.
So the agency is really taking the language of civil rights to do something that's fundamentally inconsistent with the original intent of that language. says Borné. The result, she adds, would be to exacerbate lending discrimination, cloaking it in this language of civil rights.
The disaster, which made headlines across the nation, helped create the modern environmental movement. It also led to restrictions on offshore drilling — restrictions the Trump Administration is trying to loosen.
It's also not abnormal for administrations to restrict access to government scientists. In 2013, a statement by the Society of Environmental Journalists called the EPA under former-President Obama one of the most closed, opaque agencies to the press.
Still, the fact that the world managed to agree on a target was celebrated as a diplomatic achievement, one that multiple world leaders have emphasized as crucial to support. After the recent G-7 meetings of leading industrial nations, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and vocally supported her commitment to action on climate change.

On Friday, the company announced it would bereviewing structural options to best position the company to meet customer and operational needs. In addition, PG&E said it is searching for new directors for its board to augment its existing expertise in safety.
Additionally, says Umrbek Allakulov, Research and Development Officer at Water Integrity Network, government agencies and research centers in developing countries may not have the ability to monitor and test water quality. Under such circumstances, citizen-led water quality monitoring can offer a supporting hand to help ensure that water is safe for human consumption.
I love boleros — I've really fallen in love with them over the past few years, learning more about them and their history. I wanted to put a touch of that in the song. This one is pretty autobiographical: the story of me meeting my lady and that feeling of being like, 'Oh my gosh, this person is so special.' And the fear that comes with that, of 'I don't want to screw it up.'

While we have enacted these changes, the NPR Board of Directors has also retained the law firm Morgan Lewis to investigate sexual harassment at NPR and review NPR's related processes and procedures. The Board will issue recommendations based on the report and we will incorporate them into our work.
Technological change is intensifying. We're becoming terrified by social media, by information, and in this state of high anxiety, we're looking to attach that anxiety to something, he says. And cultural change, demographic change, is what we're attaching it to.
A key part of the overturning circulation, this AMOC, is the formation of dense water, he tells Here & Now's Lisa Mullins. The problem is that freshwater isn't very dense and it stops you forming those dense waters.
BIANCULLI: Today, we celebrate the birthday of Broadway composer John Kander, who turns 90 years old tomorrow, with excerpts of two interviews he recorded with Terry. Along with his longtime lyricist, the late Fred Ebb, John Kander wrote the songs for such Broadway shows as Cabaret, Chicago and Kiss Of The Spider Woman, and as well as the songs for Martin Scorsese's 1977 film New York, New York. The title song was a big hit for Frank Sinatra.
Monday was the first day of Dartmouth's Spring term. So, as I often do at this time, I started teaching my course for non-science majors called Understanding the Universe: From Atoms to the Big Bang.
A number of training academies and workshops have been canceled or put off, which means firefighters might not be able to get a specific qualification in time for the next season. Perhaps more concerning than lost training, though, is lost time for projects that would reduce fire risk.
I'm a pastor. I lead Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served. He said that we're tied in a single garment of destiny, caught up in an inescapable network of mutuality, whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly, Warnock said. And so whether we're talking about health care, or we're talking about a livable wage, there's a way in which we have to look out for one another.
In an emailed statement, Murray Energy Corp. reached the opposite conclusion of TVA staff and said, In the interest of the TVA ratepayers, the remaining coal-fired unit at the Paradise Plant must remain in operation. The power will be more reliable and lower cost.
There needs to be a limit placed on carbon emissions from the power sector, Williams said. We're talking about setting a firm statewide limit on the CO2 emissions coming from the power sector that would then incentivize the development of a cap-and-trade program.
Grizzly populations in the Yellowstone region and northwest Montana flourished. Today, there are an estimated 1,400 to 1,700 grizzly bears in the contiguous U.S.
The company in November said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines. And the ratings agencies, Moody's Investor Service and S&P, have downgraded the company's credit rating to near junk status.

Scientists are worried about the AMOC shutting down because evidence from the past suggests that it actually did happen during the last ice age, and it is possible that it could happen in the future, although at the moment we consider it very unlikely, he says.
TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: John Kander, welcome to FRESH AIR. It's such a treat to have you back on the show. I love this new collection. I'm so glad that it was produced. It's so much fun to hear that first draft of New York, New York and compare it to the anthem that you finally wrote. Tell the story of why this version was rejected.
McCauley has brought me out to Platform A on a boat, which circles the rig as he talks.
That reputation was cemented by Happer's confrontation with Gore's staff over risks posed by the ozone hole. The incident was widely covered in scientific publications — Physics Today ran an article headlined Happer Leaves DOE Under Ozone Cloud For Violating Political Correctness.
It was an extraordinary step that some worried would set a dangerous precedent.
Internally, Pacific Gas & Electric has dubbed this strategy Project Falcon. Under the plan, the company would sell its natural gas division this spring. After years of deadly errors and safety violations, the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy, a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell NPR.
Lindsay Harper, the national coordinator for Arm in Arm, a group organizing to end the climate crisis through fighting for racial and economic justice, said that she views this as an opportunity to focus on local fights that have real, true national and international implications.
1) The GCF was created to exclusively serve low- and middle-income countries.
GROSS: Yeah, because you were basically set up by the music publisher Tommy Valando, who had been publishing both of you independently. And - what? - he suggested that you get together? Is - do I have the story right?
Court says many financial firms are getting more focused on environmental, social, and governance — or ESG — issues.
Introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the Green New Deal sparked a fierce political debate on how to best combat climate change. The plan drew significant attention from President Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have panned the plan as costly and unrealistic and used the policy to cast Democratic supporters of the framework as socialists. The Green New Deal was introduced as a nonbinding resolution, written with out some specifics, making it challenging to specify a price tag. Supporters say the plan will pay for itself through economic growth, and that the urgency of the climate crisis requires a bold and immediate response.
Instead of carrying out many of its current functions, the agency would primarily support States and Tribes in their important role protecting air, land, and water in the 21st Century, the document adds.
Hog Island is also opening its own oyster hatchery in Humboldt Bay to improve the reliability of the supply chain.
Gore was annoyed, and Happer lost his job.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: This was a real will he or won't he kind of thing on the part of the president. Do you think he was going to do this all along?
On Thursday, the chairs of four different committees in the House of Representatives sent a letter to President Trump expressing concern about recent reports that the National Security Council (NSC) is planning to assemble a secret panel, led by a discredited climate change denier, to undermine the overwhelming scientific consensus on the nature and threats of climate change.
Bad News was written two Novembers ago, but I think it's only gotten more timely as release day was approaching. I wrote it to be heard almost from the perspective of Mother Earth — like, I'm on fire, I can barely keep it turning. But it's also all of us in this moment of relentless, 'Yo, can I catch a break? Please?' But we have to keep marching forward and waking up the next day and going back at it. ... Ride With Me is another climate change song. It's classic gospel sort of imagery — the train is at the station, you can hear the diesel humming and we can't afford to miss it. It's an issue I think a lot about, and stress out a lot about.
Can we use parts of nature that we already know are important – seagrasses – to actually benefit people and protect them from some of these impacts? she says.

MARTIN: That's Dan Bush. After the disaster, he started a coalition of business owners to advocate for better flood prevention.
Kander and his partner, Fred Ebb, wrote the songs for a number of musicals, including Chicago, Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cabaret. Kander spoke to Terry Gross in 1991 and 2015.
GONYEA: And he worries if someone like Joe Biden wins the nomination then all the enthusiasm Democrats have in 2020 could fade. There's something else he likes about this Sanders crowd.
GROSS: So that was a 1965 demo recorded with the composers John Kander at the piano, lyricist Fred Ebb singing. John Kander, what impact did writing the songs for Cabaret have on you as a secular Jew? Because it's - you know, it's set in Germany as the Nazis are coming to power.
ANNIE STOPULOUS: I get a call from my sister-in-law that said, I got to drop the kids off. I have to go downtown. The levee broke.

2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world, and according to some experts, the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020.
SAGAL: Right. And in The Shape Of Water, you had a particular challenge because not only did you have to be otherworldly and alien, but you had to be attractive.
Meet The White House's New Chief Climate Change Skeptic
The opposite is also true: U.S. greenhouse gas emissions could continue to go down, at least in the short term, even as Trump withdraws from the accord.
EDMUNDS: Absolutely. It's a situation where you've got slow challenges playing out over decades and centuries. And you've got short-term challenges playing out overnight. And one playing out over the night were the hurricanes. And the longer-term things are rising sea water temperature and declining pH of the ocean. And so since there are now fewer corals on adjacent islands, it will slow the rate of which the reefs recover. And I think that is very worrying. But that's quite different from saying that they won't recover. And I think in addition, the kinds of coral that live there are changing dramatically, as well.

Ericksen's comments come just days after Trump's team ordered agencies to limit their external communications to the public. Employees at the EPA, the Department of Agriculture and the Interior Department, among others, have been instructed not to post on social media accounts. At the EPA, the staff was told not to speak to the news media.
In an environmental assessment signed Monday. TVA staff proposed retiring the coal-fired plant. The report says, As a large coal unit with medium operating costs and a high forced outage rate, as well as the need for significant repairs, PAF Unit 3 does not fit current and likely future portfolio needs.

Those who know Mercer say he has long held strong views on government spending, the environment and civil rights.
We need help, says Terry Sawyer of Hog Island Oyster Company. That 'canary in a coalmine' analogy drives me crazy, but that's what we are.
It also ignores the fact that the Endangered Species Act has been incredibly successful at accomplishing its main goal: preventing extinction. Ninety-nine percent of the animals that have been listed under the act still exist today.
For a man who often struggled to win Brown's praise or even his attention, it's an attempt to promise fresh ideas and perhaps a willingness to embrace issues the outgoing governor left for others, such as single-payer health care.
GONYEA: Outside, it's been snowing hard since people started arriving hours earlier.
He is a damn good scientist, says Steven Koonin, a prominent physicist who is now a professor at New York University and who has known Happer for 30 years. There are two really significant contributions associated with him.
Warnock, 51, won his race by over 50,000 votes, according to The Associated Press, which is outside the 0.5 percentage point margin that would enable Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler to request a recount.
For his part, Rooney is in favor of a carbon tax, a policy he helped propose with a bipartisan group of lawmakers in November. Information from Ocasio-Cortez's office says that the Green New Deal could include a carbon tax, but that it would be a tiny part of the total package of policies.

Humanities students, on the other hand, are (with, of course, brave exceptions) typically those who eschew the sciences or, at least, math. Their training is also technical, involving lots of reading and critical writing. You can often tell, when you teach this kind of class, who the scientists and the humanists are. All you have to do is write an equation on the blackboard and look at the class. Humanists' eyes will quickly glaze over. The scientists will perk up. As you read from Aristotle's Metaphysics, the opposite will happen. To bridge this gap is the challenge.
4. Reviving a rule that requires 72 hours before major legislation can get a vote in the House to ensure all lawmakers have time to review the bill.

We encourage policymakers, including Gov.

Over the last 12 months, the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers — HIV, malaria and tuberculosis. But other illnesses, some of them easily preventable, stole the limelight.
During a news conference Thursday in the Rose Garden at the White House, Trump said the withdrawal is aimed at keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first. But he added that the U.S. would begin negotiations to possibly re-enter the Paris accord or a similar deal that, he said, would result in a better deal for American workers.
Over the past decade, Happer has waged a fierce campaign aimed at debunking fears of global warming caused by emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
In the heart of New York City, the obvious birds one might first expect to spot are pigeons, or perhaps more accurately, rock doves. But through their binoculars, the Brooklyn Bird Club managed to spot 43 different species of bird.
Rebekah Mercer, the second of Robert and Diana Mercer's three daughters, has arguably become even more powerful, with direct ties to Trump senior strategist Steve Bannon. She ran the pro-Trump super PAC Make America Number 1 and served on the Trump transition team.
The coalition is also taking lessons from past attempts at climate actions including the comprehensive climate package, known as Waxman-Markey, that attempted to create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions. The bill, colloquially named for then-Rep. Henry Waxman of California and Sen. Ed Markey, then a representative, passed the House in 2009 and died in the Senate. Leaders of the effort say that one of the reasons that effort collapsed was that it was too much of an insider play and did not engage organizers and workers in the field, mistakes that organizers say they won't repeat.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So it could be quite dangerous. And, Nate, hasn't President Trump tweeted repeatedly that there needs to be more forest management to prevent megafires?
In her fieldwork across India over the last few years, activist Latha Sankarnarayan says she's often seen scarcity or quality [of water] as a core issue.
That has given both Mercers a strong foothold in the Trump White House, and last year Politico called Rebekah Mercer The Most Powerful Woman in GOP Politics.
So far the plan's biggest success may be that it's energizing thousands of young activists.
Michael Bloomberg is pledging to fill a funding gap created by President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, offering up to $15 million to support the U.N. agency that helps countries implement the agreement.
Economist Marc Hafstead, who is with Resources for the Future, told Christopher that exiting the deal could potentially have political ramifications — to the extent that our pulling out of the agreement is going to cause other countries to do less.
The blueprint was designed to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong-power administration, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney explained on Wednesday as he previewed the document in a briefing with reporters.

GROSS: John Kander, it's been wonderful to talk with you. Thank you so much.
JONES: Through his hee-haw (ph). Yeah.
There's no question this is a hard-power budget, Mulvaney also said Wednesday. It is not a soft-power budget. This is a hard-power budget. And that was done intentionally.

That tolerance, scientists and wildlife officials say, is key to the grizzly bears' future as the effects of climate change harden, the West gets more crowded, and bears spreads into areas they haven't been in more than 100 years.
Some of what Sanders dared Biden on wasn't too challenging. He asked Biden, Are you really going to veto a 'Medicare for All' bill, if it is passed in Congress?
EDMUNDS: Most folks who visit the Virgin Islands and snorkel around the Virgin Islands will snorkel in water that is five, 10 to 20 feet deep. And those are the areas that are most prone to the damage. And sure enough, when we swam over those areas, we saw the damage, the toppling and the scarring. But once we got below about 20, 25 feet, it was a different story. And certainly, you can find broken corals and toppled sea fans and the damage. But I think what was remarkable was the amount of coral and soft coral that survived.
And echoing some of the rhetoric of his inaugural address, Trump told the crowd that regardless of race, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, that we are all made by the same Almighty God, and that we are Americans and the future belongs to us.
PG&E has had serious safety problems with both its gas and electric operations for many years, the California Public Utilities Commission said in a statement.
We all stand to lose from this gulf between the sciences and the humanities. The sciences run the risk of being decontextualized from their moral and social consequences, pursuing technologies that should be regulated and scrutinized. Artificial intelligence research, for example, as many philosophers and, thankfully, scientists have recognized, needs to have safeguards so as to guarantee that, in the advent that we do build machines more intellectually capable than ourselves, they would still be willing to work with us and not against us. The same with CRISPR/Cas9 biotechnologies, that can effectively and specifically change genes within organisms, thus allowing us to engineer life following target goals. On the other hand, the humanities run the risk of becoming disconnected from the pace of scientific discoveries and myopic to how they are effectively transforming the world we live in.
Noyer credits the election of Macron with much of the change. The French president is quickly following through on his promise to transform the country. He's overhauled notoriously rigid French labor laws, making it easier to hire and fire. And his government is preparing a raft of pro-business measures. Noyer says today France has the highest labor flexibility in continental Europe, and Paris is now an obvious destination.
Advocates for the environment have countered with op-eds in defense of the fund. Even comedian John Oliver jumped into the fray. In his Sunday night HBO show, Oliver offered a point-by-point rebuttal of numerous incorrect statements that Trump made about the fund, including the erroneous claim that the GCF, which is funded through voluntary contributions, would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars.
While the WEF report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment, which could be possible in as soon as 12 years, progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding. By that metric, parity is a lowly 57.8% and will take 257 years to overcome. — Emily Vaughn
KANDER: This was very early in our collaboration. And Fred had an idea for writing a comic song about a coloring book. And my memory of it was that I think when he suggested it, for some reason I had some sort of mild annoyance. And I think I said to him, why does everything have to be funny? And we started talking about how you could take a song about a coloring book and make it real, poignant, somehow or other truthfully emotional. And so we went in that direction. I have to preface this by saying Freddy I wrote a lot. We were pregnant all the time. So the idea of writing a song...
Green and his organization, through its Social Progress Index, have been tracking this every year since 2014. Higher education has traditionally been concentrated in wealthy countries, says Green, but many countries are making significant leaps, both in terms of enrollment and quality, and it's leading to a growing global middle class. Some of the biggest improvers, according to their data, include Morocco, Slovakia and Turkey.
GROSS: So what happened to this song? It's a beautiful song. Actually, let me play the song. And then we'll find out what happened to it. It troubles me when a song this good (laughter) hasn't had - hasn't had the life it deserves. So here's Linda Emond singing a song by John Kander and Fred Ebb.
Today, Santa Barbara is much better prepared for an oil spill than it was in 1969. There's a 46-foot fast-response vessel in the harbor. And animals exposed to oil are cared for by a statewide group called the Oiled Wildlife Care Network.
The Environmental Protection Agency adopted a new rule restricting the types of scientific studies its own regulators can use to rein in pollution, in the Trump administration's latest effort to undercut the use of science in establishing public health standards.
JONES: OK, Lane. I'm rooting for both of us here.
All great American programs, everything from The Great Society to The New Deal, started with a vision for our future, said co-sponsor Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
What To Watch For In Sanders And Biden's First 1-On-1 Debate
And then a strange thing happened, he told the audience. Instead of running the old computations in one-one hundredth of the time, the powers-that-be at the lab ran programs that were 100 times bigger.
KANDER: It's - I guess because it's terrible.
And then, of course, there was the argument advanced by candidate Trump. On the campaign trail, he criticized the agreement that the U.S. formally signed on to last year. He called the deal unfair to the U.S., objecting in particular to the requirement that wealthy nations help developing countries build renewable energy sources.
The Biden administration could remove or rewrite the rule, but it would take months, if not years. Because the rule gives the EPA administrator the power to override the limits on which scientific studies EPA regulators can use, the incoming administration could essentially sidestep the rule while it works to undo it.
Ultimately, we're going to be left holding the bag, says Michael Wara of Stanford University. If PG&E can't pay all of these costs, then it's the California taxpayer that ultimately will.
He says he'd love to get his hands on avocado varieties that grow well in the Central Valley. If they could come up with a variety that's similar to the Hass that we could plant down at ground level instead of having it on the hills, I'm sure a lot of people would plant them, Stearns says.
Bloomberg reported last year that the Mercers attended and funded a conference run by an Arizona physician who suggested that elements of the government were behind the San Bernardino massacre.

A renovated 1920s train station in the middle of Paris is now a modern hub for startups. Newly elected President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated Station F last June, but the hub was actually conceived before he was elected.
They were very, very conservative. Libertarian. If I wanted to use a prejudicial word I would probably say they were reactionary, says Nick Patterson, who helped hire Mercer at Renaissance in 1993 and is now a senior computational biologist at the Broad Institute.
The four Democrats called it deeply concerning that Dr. Happer appears to be spearheading that effort.
The effect on marine life was profound.
The rule was proposed in November after President Trump lost his reelection bid. And Court says it appears that the Trump-appointed acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is scrambling to enact it before the Biden administration begins next week.
Ocasio-Cortez To Unveil Ambitious Plan To Combat Climate Change
Hazell believes you can't put a dollar amount on teaching children. It's a privilege that he's been doing for more than 30 years.
INSKEEP: Well, I get that. But deficit spending is borrowing money that has to be paid back eventually through taxes.
SHAPIRO: Let's start with that Green New Deal that we were just hearing about. It calls for eliminating the U.S. carbon footprint by 2030, just over 10 years from now. Does that goal seem attainable to you?
'No Scrubs' In The White House: Steyer Gets A Boost From TLC
JONES: Well, I will say this - they sculpted me a sexy-ass body. I mean, like...
Barack Obama had used his authority as president to join the Paris accord without a vote in Congress. That means Trump can remove the U.S. from the accord without a vote. But it will take awhile: Under the terms of the agreement, he wouldn't actually be able to withdraw until November 2020.
As birds flitted on and off colorful feeders in a flicker of flapping feathers, and chattered in chirps — punctuated by the occasional trill — a band of birdwatchers offered a cacophony of their own.
Democrats will revive the Gephardt Rule, introduced in the late 1970s by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., that automatically raises the debt ceiling — the nation's borrowing limit — once the House passes a budget.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: No. (Laughter). I think that a part of where I am right now is that I'm learning. I think that really what I hope we're able to do as a party and as a nation is rediscover the power of public imagination. I think that this is a very special moment. And, frankly, that is something that I think the president did do, in that he was able to take his profile and say, here's this hugely impossible thing that seems ridiculous, but I'm going to seriously push for it. And for him, that's his wall. And obviously, I'm diametrically opposed to it. But I think that the reason he's so attached to this thing, despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the American people want, is that it's the only vision he has. He has no other picture of America, except an America with a huge wall on the Southern border.
Let's say you run a government agency in a low-income country and want to identify the poorest 10% of villages — or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito-borne diseases. Satellite imagery can help you answer those questions, Burke says, in a way that's much less expensive and time-consuming than traditional boots-on-the-ground surveys. Cars, large buildings and well-tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space.

In Washington, thousands of demonstrators braved sweltering heat approaching 90 degrees and marched down Pennsylvania Avenue from near the U.S. Capitol to Trump's new home, the White House.
GROSS: Right. Lotte Lenya and Kurt Weill fled the Nazis, so they - they really know - they know the story. They know the climate in which Cabaret is set. So I want to play a song that you wrote for her character that she does such a wonderful job with in the original cast recording and that Linda Emond did such a great job with in the revival. And the song is, What Would You Do? And this character that she plays is a tough but lonely older women who runs a boarding house. There's a Jewish man who wants to marry her. But when it's clear the Nazi's are coming to power, she rejects him to save herself. And she sings this song, What Would You Do? as if to ask, if you were in her position, would you stand up for your principles or save yourself? Let's hear a little bit of the song.
As Brown prepares to exit, he's leaving the state flush with cash, including a rainy day fund of $14 billion. Brown's parting piece of advice for Newsom? Don't screw it up.
Today, I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country, Sanders said. And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.
KANDER: Sometimes you know it right away. Usually it takes about 24 hours. And then I'll come back the next day, we'll look at it, we'll both stick our fingers down our throats and tear it up and go to work again. But it's - that's never a terrible moment. I think it's very important - at least it always has been important for us to stay very loose, which allows you to write badly as well as to write well. But we write a lot and we tear up a lot.
The other reason we're not anywhere is that Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, is nowhere to be seen. He is the guy who, in the past, has gotten presidents out of a lot of tight corners. He thinks of creative solutions.
Democrats took exceedingly narrow control of the Senate on Wednesday after winning both runoff elections in Georgia, granting them control of Congress and the White House for the first time since 2011.
JIM KARELS: You know, if you miss a whole month of the prime time, it's hard to catch up those acres at least for another year.
Saikiran Gaddam, an engineering student in Hyderabad, was one of 11 Akvo volunteers who spent 10 days last year in the field — in the rural Nalgonda district about 60 miles from the city — testing 240 wells, streams, ponds and water filtration plants. Armed with gloves and a small kit the size of four decks of cards, they did basic tests for five hours a day out in the hot sun. The Akvo app on their mobile phones let them log, map, and upload data on contamination and chemical run off.
The main trade group for payday lenders, INFiN, said in a statement that it supports steps by the OCC to protect legal businesses from discrimination under the proposed fair access rule.
Once TLC finished performing, Steyer took the stage and emphasized his core messages of climate change (We need to rebuild America in a climate-smart way) and the economy, saying he's the only candidate who can go after President Trump on the economy and win.
I smelled it long before I saw it; it really stank around here, says Marc McGinnes, a lawyer who came down from San Francisco. And when I looked at the oil on the beach, I cried.
Named for the sweeping proposal for cutting U.S. contributions to climate change over the next decade, the coalition has already raised more than $20 million, organizers say.

Scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency who want to publish or present their scientific findings likely will need to have their work reviewed on a case by case basis before it can be disseminated, according to a spokesman for the agency's transition team.
In a speech to a 2015 conference organized by the Heartland Institute, which has railed against restrictions on emissions from fossil fuels, Happer scoffed at these fears, calling them an Alice-in-Wonderland fantasy. When I got into this area and started learning about it, I learned that when I looked at CO2, I should assume that it caused harmful warming, extreme weather, Noah's flood, you know. I remember thinking, 'Are they mad?' 
Mercer has contributed heavily to political groups that support Republican candidates, such as the Freedom Partners Action Fund. He backed Texas Senator Ted Cruz in last year's GOP primary race; after Cruz's defeat, he switched his support to Trump.
Democrats Unveil Changes To House Rules On Debt Ceiling, Ethics
SYMMES: If I choose not to vote then I feel like that abstaining helps Trump. And there's nothing about me that wants to help Trump.
SIMON: A Bernie Sanders rally has kind of a loose, homemade feel to it. Often, they start with a local band to warm up the crowd, like last weekend on a freezing cold Saturday night inside a middle-school gym in Manchester.
That's a really big — potentially impossibly big — undertaking.
Bender says he wouldn't do it now, though. It's partly because of the scientific dispute, because he thinks Happer is misreading the evidence. But it's also because of Happer's style — he's labeled climate science a cult and accused other scientists of whipping up climate fears to boost their own careers. Most offensive for Bender: Happer once said the demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the Jews under Hitler.
Perhaps the most important thing I learned is that I really loved everything about computers. I loved the solitude of the computer lab late at night. I loved the air-conditioned smell of the place. I loved the sound of the discs whirring and the printers clacking, he said in his 2014 speech, before the Association for Computational Linguistics.
When Cape Town reaches Day Zero, residents in the popular tourist city of 3.7 million will have to line up to collect 6.5 gallons of drinking water per person per day at some 200 distribution stations. Those restrictions adhere to the World Health Organization's guidelines for the minimum amount of water needed in emergencies.
There's one song in particular I want to listen to, which reflects a lot of what we've been hearing lately. Can you tell me what Bad News is about?
I would like to see the Endangered Species Act do exactly what it was written for, she says. And when a species is recovered, it's done. And then it goes to the state to manage it.
THE DOOBIE BROTHERS: (Singing) Takin' it to the streets.
KANDER: And the doors closed on the 535th floor of this building. And a gooey, string version of My Coloring Book started. And nobody else was on the elevator. And we were going down fast. And I thought, I am going to die.
MARTIN: Well, so I'm thinking about the fact that physicians are actually well-represented in the current administration and have been in Congress for some time. I'm thinking about President Trump's nominee for Health Secretary - Tom Price is a physician. Former Congressman Ron Paul was a physician. His son Rand Paul, the senator, was an ophthalmologist. All of them are conservatives, and I'm wondering why is that?
GROSS: And you said it would've been dangerous to listen. And I assume you mean you didn't want to risk imitating him.
ANDREW LOPEZ: All the water started coming through the drains.

Her data, pooled with that of participants around the world, will give scientists a better idea of how weather and climate change may influence bird populations or migration patterns.
The new president also sought to explain his decision in the past 100 days not to label China a currency manipulator by pointing to the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula and China's critical role in dealing with the North Korean regime. Trump called Chinese President Xi Jinping a good man, adding let's see what happens.

The avocado industry is also interested in Arpaia's research. Tim Spann, the research program director at the California Avocado Commission, says new varieties producing at different times of the year could widen the California avocado market.
You brought in a wide range of musicians to record: members of the Memphis Boys, who backed icons like Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin, but also some younger artists. Tell me about that dynamic and what they brought to the album.
In his latest effort to boost the coal business — and in the process help a major supporter — President Trump has called on the Tennessee Valley Authority to, essentially, ignore the advice of its staff and keep a large coal-fired power plant operating.
Wall Street wants to see hard thinking, too.
We don't want to have Congress becoming the arbiters over the fate of species, Ashe says. The longer this lingers, the more likely it is that people will try to find a political solution.
Grizzly bears used to live from Alaska to central Mexico, ranging from the Pacific Coast to Missouri. Today, they only inhabit 2 percent of that historic range, living in isolated pockets.
Depending on how you interpreted Gavin Newsom's campaign slogan Courage For a Change, he either has more courage than Jerry Brown — his campaign says that's not what they meant — or that Newsom has the courage needed to bring about big changes.
Holder was attorney general in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2015. He's currently a partner in the law firm Covington & Burling. According to the Associated Press, the firm will be paid $25,000 a month for three months starting in February. The deal will be renegotiated afterward.
What we don't really know is: Are we close to one of those tipping points where runaway processes could suddenly allow the mark to weaken much quicker than it has been doing? Thornally says.
JONES: No. At my dorm that I lived in at Ball State, I was a freshman, and a senior is the one who ran the mine troupe. The mime troupe was called Mime Over Matter. Get it?
After the deal's Thursday release, she also cast the plan as simply one of any number of environmental proposals the House might consider.

Now a cartoon from Randall Munroe, a former roboticist at NASA and founder of the website xkcd, helps put the numbers into perspective.
So why tip Biden off to how you're going to challenge him on Sunday? Maybe Bernie Sanders wants Joe Biden to succeed.
The qualifier is an easy out for Biden. If Sanders' single-payer, Medicare for All system passed Congress, that would mean the political winds had shifted dramatically — that at least some Republicans and moderate Democrats who opposed that plan came on board, because their constituents were also on board. That's an unlikely reality in 2021 if Biden were the new president.
For Yellowstone-area bears, the goal was 500 bears. When they were listed as threatened in 1975, there were as few as 136 bears left. Today, scientists estimate there are more than 700 bears in the ecosystem.
And Mercer has made clear he's not afraid to strike out in an independent direction if GOP leaders pursues goals he disagrees with.
The classroom is the ideal place for this conversation between the sciences and the humanities to unfold. By exposing students to the two sides of the cultural divide, we stand a chance of building bridges that will actually close the gap. Scientists should read from original sources, and humanists should grapple with scientific concepts such as relativity, quantum physics, evolution and natural selection, plate tectonics, climate change, and the expanding universe. Scientists should recognize that some research topics — AI, biotechnology, climate change, life extension, the nature and pervasiveness of faith, and many others — need to be investigated together with humanists as a joint effort; inasmuch as they impact society as a whole, they are not just scientific research projects.

So far, state regulators and lawmakers have been kept out of PG&E's planning loop for Project Falcon, named for a group of peregrine falcons nesting on the roof of the company's headquarters.
But this is the campaign in Las Vegas.
Importantly, it's a nonbinding resolution, meaning that even if it were to pass (more on the challenges to that below), it wouldn't itself create any new programs. Instead, it would potentially affirm the sense of the House that these things should be done in the coming years.
Mainstream (FAKE) media refuses to state our long list of achievements, including 28 legislative signings, strong borders & great optimism!, Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon.
They conclude that the ancestors of these infants started out in East Asia about 35,000 years ago. As they traveled east, they became genetically isolated from other Asians. At some point during the last ice age they crossed a frozen land bridge from Siberia to Alaska called Beringia.

In India alone, 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020, according to a government report. And an August report from the World Resources Institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one-quarter of the global population — including Botswana, India, Iran and Mexico — are using as much or more water than they can replace.

Asked shortly before the Pennsylvania rally what his message was for the climate protesters back in D.C., the president responded, Enjoy the day. And the weather.
At the time, PG&E spokesman Matt Nauman said in an emailed statement to NPR that the company is committed to accurate and thorough reporting and record-keeping, and we didn't live up to that commitment in this case.
The Santa Barbara oil spill really helped to take an issue that was growing and really convert it into legislative action and a whole body of environmental law at the federal level and also at the state level that we still have with us today, says Peter Alagona, a historian at UCSB.
Many more animals survive now than they would have back in the '60s or '70s or even the '80s, says Julie Barnes, a veterinarian and vice president for animal health and care at the Santa Barbara Zoo.

And some of the Green New Deal's goals are indeed aggressive. For example, Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that in 10 years, we're trying to go carbon-neutral.
There's been a lot of talk about how the election of Donald Trump has sparked a new energy and engagement in politics on both the right and the left. We're going to hear now the story of a mobilization of scientists concerned that the Trump administration could upend years of work on climate change. Some scientists are worried about President Trump's Environmental Protection Agency administrator who's criticized EPA rules on climate change, clean air and water, and those concerns are prompting some scientists to move beyond just advocating for science to organizing and even running for office.
KANDER: The interesting thing is that I listened to everybody but Kurt Weill because I knew that was a dangerous area to be walking into. I listened to lots and lots and lots of German jazz and German vaudeville music of the '20s. But I stayed away zealously from listening to Weill at all. What I think happened is that the kind of Kurt Weill musical pieces that we hear in our heads were influenced by the same thing that I was sort of digging into. His early music and more serious music is in many ways in a totally different style and quite wonderful and slightly academic. When he comes to writing to his musicals or operas, if you will, he's reflecting the sounds of those vaudeville houses and German jazz and that sort of sleazy world that I was trying to reflect, also. But the actual influence of Weill's music itself was nonexistent.
While there is an ongoing dispute about what is causing the slowdown, scientists agree that it could have a dramatic impact on ocean ecosystems, such as coral reefs and deep-sea sponge grounds.

Jon Hazell, this year's teacher of the year, says he would ask Sheehan: If more teachers leave, who is going to teach Oklahoma's children?
Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us to our country, to the world. And so while carbon taxes are nice while things like cap and trade are nice, it's not what's going to save the planet. It could be part of a larger solution but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. And so that's really what we're trying to accomplish.
And Nakagawa says it's entirely possible that by the time the GCF is in need of its next cash infusion, it could find better favor from the U.S. Four years from now, another administration could decide to put the money in, she says.

It's important for the data to get the right kind of attention, proponents say. Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires serving the unreached and underserved in remote and difficult areas, says Allakulov. Walking the last mile and extending safe drinking water to those at the base of the pyramid may be just the avenue that will benefit greatly from citizen-led water quality monitoring
A group called the Sunrise Movement held a Web meeting with supporters around the country Tuesday. Jeremy Ornstein, 18, says he deferred going to college to work with the organization.
Yeah, I think that's right. I think Dan tried to get me to a place of accessing my intuitive songwriting because, like you said, Carole King, Curtis Mayfield, those are such finely crafted songs. Each one is like a watch, or something. We both love 45s, these singles that sound raw and from the gut. I think the idea of this record was to find a midpoint between something that feels good in the brain and something that feels good in the gut and in the ear.
I'm really energized by Steyer, she said. He's for everyone. I really believe that race, along with climate, have to be the top priority, and he seems to be the candidate that is putting it first and foremost.
Grants to Meals on Wheels would also likely be eliminated as part of the cuts to the Community Development Block Grant program, and Mulvaney defended those cuts Thursday afternoon, claiming the block granting program was not showing any results.
The GCF is designed to do this in a range of ways, says Martinez-Diaz, who is now global director of the Sustainable Finance Center at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank. For example, if a private company is leery of investing in climate projects because of political and financial risks, the GCF will offer it loans, loan guarantees, or other forms of insurance.
The question of what constitutes recovery — how many bears there needs to be and where — is at the heart of the grizzly bear delisting debate and it's a difficult thing to answer, because it involves much more than just science.
The budget also proposes eliminating the Appalachian Regional Commission, which promotes economic development in the region stretching from northern Mississippi to western New York. Many counties in that swath heavily supported Trump in November.

Of the $10.3 billion that donor countries pledged to the GCF during that initial fundraising round back in 2013, the U.S. promised $3 billion. Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. has already handed over $1 billion in two installments of $500 million. The last one was disbursed in January, just before Obama left office. (The money is paid out of a general State Department fund over which the president has broad discretion).
From anthrax outbreaks in thawing permafrost to rice farms flooded with salty water, climate change seems to play a bigger and bigger role in global health each year.
The ambitious proposals addressing climate change and health care and other domestic priorities touted by Biden and Harris will be difficult, if impossible, to advance with more moderate Democrats — especially those facing competitive 2022 midterm reelection campaigns — reluctant to sign onto partisan proposals. The much smaller-than-anticipated House Democratic majority compounds the challenge for the party.

Happer became a physicist. He taught at Columbia University and joined the faculty at Princeton University in 1980.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Yeah. And I think it - I think that is always the crux of it. So when we decide to go into the realm of deficit spending, we have to do so responsibly. We ask, is this an investment or is this actually going to pay for itself?

Forty-three countries pledged a total of $10.3 billion to get the ball rolling for the first several years — though no exact time period was specified for how long that money is supposed to last. So far, the GCF has committed $2.2 billion to 43 projects.
The groups coming together to back it now include the Center for Popular Democracy, Climate Justice Alliance, Grassroots Global Justice, Greenpeace, Indigenous Environmental Network, Indivisible, the Movement for Black Lives, MoveOn, People's Action, Right to the City, Service Employees International Union, the Sierra Club, Sunrise Movement, US Climate Action Network and the Working Families Party.

In late December, state regulators said they were considering several proposals in response to ongoing concerns about the utility's role in a deadly gas explosion in 2010 and in the more recent wildfires.
But don't forget; this whole shutdown started when McConnell passed - unanimously - a compromise bill through the Senate for - to open the government not fund the wall. Trump originally said he would sign it. Then Trump changed his mind, and the shutdown happened. And now McConnell says he's not going to put anything on the floor of the Senate if the president won't sign it.
INSKEEP: You're talking about things that obviously would cost a lot of money. I know you'd rather think of it as an investment rather than a cost, but it is just certainly a lot of money. You don't specify where it's going to come from, other than saying it will all pay for itself.

At the time there was really no place or process to care for the oiled wildlife that was showing up on the beaches, says Nancy McToldridge, the zoo's director. So the zoo closed its doors and concentrated its time and energy into taking in these oiled birds, treating them and then rehabbing them back out into the wild.
Recently we heard from an adviser in the Trump administration. Michael Anton's official title is deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications at the National Security Council. He says he's been so consumed by the day-to-day, he's had little chance to focus on the long term — despite that he came to prominence as a man who was trying to think long term. In 2016, while working at an investment firm, Anton anonymously published essays that sought to make sense of the Trump phenomenon. The most famous was The Flight 93 Election. Anton compared Trump voters to passengers on the plane hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, who were choosing to rush the cockpit. They might still die but it was their only hope.
To me and to us, this is a moral imperative, said Mitchell. We don't have another shot at this. So if the science, if the wildfires in California, if the increased intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes... if all of this isn't enough for you, you don't deserve to be in office.
Recent high-profile measles outbreaks in the U.S., Europe, the Philippines and Samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year. To prevent outbreaks, the World Health Organization says that roughly 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles. More than half the countries in the world, including the U.S. at 94%, haven't reached that threshold, according to UNICEF. Where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020? Afghanistan, Angola, Bolivia and Haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40%.

In very broad strokes, the Green New Deal legislation laid out by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey sets goals for some drastic measures to cut carbon emissions across the economy, from electricity generation to transportation to agriculture. In the process, it aims to create jobs and boost the economy.
BUSH: You know, the science shows, the statistics shows that this is going to progressively get worse and that we actually didn't - it didn't get as bad as it could have got this year. The last big event was in 1993. I don't expect it to be another 25, 27 odd years before it happens again.
This year, expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when Western countries colonized poor countries, stripping them of resources and autonomy. People who work in the field know that much of the money, influence and decision-making about how to help low-income countries still comes from wealthy countries — with little input from the people who receive the assistance.
John Kerry, Obama's secretary of state and a key player in crafting the Paris agreement, also denounced the U.S. withdrawal as a self-destructive step that puts our nation last.

The rally was the capstone of a past week the White House spent holding events, putting out press releases and otherwise seeking headlines intended to highlight what it views as the new administration's successes in the last 100 days. Even before his rally Saturday night, the president himself seemed keenly aware that the day is historically a symbolic moment for the media, pundits, the country and perhaps even much of the world to assess his young presidency.

At the time, in 1993, the Princeton professor was taking a break from academia to direct scientific research at the U.S. Department of Energy. He turned a skeptical eye toward one of then-Vice President Al Gore's favorite issues: the risks posed by chemicals eating away at ozone in the stratosphere and letting in dangerous ultraviolet radiation. As the story goes, Happer went to the White House and told Gore's staff he saw no evidence that the ozone hole actually was hurting anyone.

LIASSON: Republicans would've never agreed to that. They know this is something very popular with the president's base. And that's their base, too. They don't want to get in between the president and his base. Of course, now we're going to see how many Republicans vote against it because the House will pass a resolution opposing this. It will go to the Senate. And it will have to be voted on. And there are Republicans who have objections to this on many different levels.

LIASSON: What happens next is that House and Senate negotiators from both parties start talking to each other. The president has said that at the end of three weeks, if he doesn't get money for a wall, he will either declare a national emergency - in other words, build the wall himself with unobligated Pentagon funds - or shut down the government again. But no one I've talked to on either side of the aisle thinks that he will actually shut down the government again. Some people do think that declaring an emergency is still his endgame. But many Republicans are against that because they say it'll set a precedent. And a future Democratic president could declare an emergency for gun safety or health care or climate change. And these Republicans say that any kind of an emergency declaration would be tied up in court, and he would end up getting no wall after all.
Currently, most California avocados are grown in the southern part of the state and on a narrow strip along the coast.

I know that the moment when Sally makes a decision to have an abortion was a moment which, I think, had not yet been properly musicalized. I'm just trying to remember this now. I don't know if it's all correct. But we wrote a song which did exactly that. It was a song which starts out very jaunty and nasty and cheerful all at the same time, sung by a girl who's just been insulted by her lover and who's found out that she's pregnant and is in - actually is in misery. And in the middle of the song, our intention, without tipping it lyrically, was that she make her decision to get rid of the baby. I think it works really well on the stage. The interesting element in that song is that all the sort of popular versions of it - most of those performances are of a very jaunty, cheerful, hey mate, come in from the rain and let's have a good time. And, of course, that's the opposite of the intention of the song.

Negotiations usually have a couple things associated with them - first of all, round the clock talks, a willingness for both sides to find a deal where both sides would win or maybe a creative solution that makes the problem bigger, like exchanging a path to citizenship for the DREAMers with $25 billion for a wall. That was a deal that was tentatively made over a year ago, but Trump walked away from that.
Happer, 79, joined the staff of President Trump's National Security Council last fall. And according to documents first leaked to The Washington Post, he appears to be pushing the White House to mount a challenge to the government's official assessment of climate change, which calls climate change a serious national security threat.
INSKEEP: That's NPR's Domenico Montanaro. And he speaks on this day, when some Democrats will release a Green New Deal resolution.
How will Democrats and Republicans in Congress react to the signature proposal from the freshman congresswoman from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez?
2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality: It's the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women's rights. The global community will be taking stock of progress — and lack thereof — at gatherings such as that of the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women in March.
This is what students like to call a physics for poets class — a class that explores the history of how humanity has confronted some of the deepest questions we can ask about the material world and our place in it, without the math. It is a class that tries to capture the true spirit of the liberal-arts education, mixing the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences as different and complementary ways of knowing the world and why we matter. In fancier words, as an intellectual history of physics and astronomy, the class requires that scientific thinking be contextualized culturally, so that students can situate the ways in which some of the most revolutionary ideas in the past 2,000 years emerged when they did.
I think the environment in general, and climate change in particular, is an area of Will's irrationality. But nonetheless, I think he can accomplish something in his current job, Socolow says.
The sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators.
KANDER: That's part of the reason. The story of how the other one got written is Fred and I were writing songs for a film called New York, New York. Martin Scorsese was directing it. And it starred Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro. We wrote five or six songs and went down to Marty's (ph) office to play them. And Liza and Marty were there. and then in the background - I don't know if we got introduced or not - was Robert De Niro sitting on a couch. I'm not sure I even knew that at the time. Anyway, we played the songs for them. and everything was all set until suddenly we saw this arm waving from the couch. And Marty went over and said excuse me, De Niro wants to speak to me. And then we watched what was a very animated conversation. and we couldn't hear anything. And Scorsese came back and in a very embarrassed way said that De Niro had felt that the title song, which was very much attached to him in the film, was just too lightweight compared to the song that was attached to Liza, which was The World Goes Round. And would we consider taking another crack at it? And of course we left and thought, some actor is going to tell us how to write a song? And we could not have been more internally pompous, I think. Anyway, we went back to Fred's apartment.
Immediately after Trump's speech, France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement announcing that the accord could not be renegotiated, as Trump said he would try to do.
Nixon himself was no environmentalist, Alagona says, but he realized during a time when there were many other extremely controversial, divisive issues like the Vietnam War for instance, that as American public concern grew about damage to the environment that this could potentially be a winning issue for him.
I mean, here you are sitting couple hundred feet away from the riverbank - The Mississippi.

Obama decried Trump's decision in a statement released Thursday.
KANDER: Right. We - Fred lives about four blocks from my house. And he likes to stay home to work, I like to go out to work. And at 10 o'clock or so in the morning, I'll go over to his house and we will sit around the kitchen table and have some coffee and gossip a little and then go to work. And we - if we're working on a moment in a show, for instance, we'll be talking about the characters and the situation that we're about to musicalize (ph). And Fred may have an idea or a phrase, and from that phrase maybe we'll develop a rhythm.
Despite concerns about coal's significant contributions to climate change, President Trump has made his support for the coal business a key point during his election campaign and presidency.
Conducting a climate survey. This project is being led by a cross-functional employee team who will work with a vendor to conduct an evaluation of the corporate culture, provide recommendations to strengthen the work environment, and provide skill building for all employees.
This is the type of information that researchers can't collect enough of on their own. Ray Brown, host of the radio show and podcast Talkin' Birds, told NPR's Scott Simon that the data collected through the count is extremely useful.

Ancient Human Remains Document Migration From Asia To America
David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard University who studies ancient DNA, says genetic material like this tells a more detailed story of how people came to America, but not the whole story. There were presumably many related populations like this, he says, one of which split to form these two lineages that have diversified into Native Americans today.
Carbon dioxide is actually good for the planet, Happer claims; it's like fertilizer and makes crops more productive.
And she says that could be what's needed to address a problem as daunting as climate change.
For the past three months NPR's Chief Operating Officer Loren Mayor has been meeting with groups of employees to hear their concerns and ask what NPR could be doing better to rebuild trust and improve workplace culture after revelations of sexual harassment forced us to reexamine our workplace. Supported by staff input, NPR has instituted several workplace improvement initiatives, including the following:
Over the years, Newsom has shown a tendency to get out in front of issues.
While the gas sale would cover some liabilities, the legislature also may be asked to step in. State lawmakers partially shielded the company for liability claims in 2017 with a bill that critics called a bailout.

OCASIO-CORTEZ: Yeah. I think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for a hundred percent of government expenditure. It's just not how government expenditure works. We can recoup costs, but oftentimes you look at, for example, the GOP tax cut, which I think was an irresponsible use of government expenditure. But government projects are often financed by a combination of taxes, deficit spending and other kinds of investments - you know, bonds and so on.
Our energy future will not be found in the dark of a mine but in the light of the sun, said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., as he announced the legislation on Capitol Hill.

Any review would directly contradict the agency's current scientific integrity policy, which was published in 2012. It prohibits all EPA employees, including scientists, managers and other Agency leadership from suppressing, altering, or otherwise impeding the timely release of scientific findings or conclusions.
Scientists eventually identified the main culprit: acidifying seawater.
LIASSON: Well, do what - you mean do I think the Democrats gave him something. Yes, they...
INSKEEP: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat representing the Bronx and Queens, was in her office across the street from the Capitol here in Washington.
Now look a bit closer at the bottom of the graphic. See how all of a sudden, around 150 years ago, the dotted line depicting average Earth temperature changes to a solid line. Munroe makes this change because the data used to create the lines come from two very different sources.
The company sources who spoke to NPR and provided supporting documents say the planning for Project Falcon began shortly after the 2017 wine country fires and picked up again in earnest this past June, when Cal Fire determined that PG&E was responsible for at least a dozen Northern California fires. The planning, the sources say, has accelerated since the Camp Fire.
PG&E was convicted of felony safety violations in a gas line explosion in 2010 in a San Francisco suburb that killed eight people and destroyed a neighborhood. The federal judge overseeing the utility's five-year criminal probation in that case had asked Becerra's opinion on whether PG&E's possible role in the recent wildfires constitutes a probation violation.
GONYEA: Afterward, Sanders doesn't hang around long, taking selfies like most other candidates do. He works the rope line for a bit then exits out a back door. But the audience is clearly energized by this 78-year-old candidate.
And we're going to give our elected officials a deadline. They've got to get an answer to us by Feb. 26 or face the consequences, warns Ornstein. He says activists around the country will occupy members' offices in what the group calls a nationwide day of action.
The Trump administration is trying to push through a last-minute rule that could force banks to offer loans to gun-makers and oil exploration companies or to finance high-cost payday lenders.

EDMUNDS: The classic corals of the Caribbean you might have seen there in the 1950s, 1960s would've been towering elkhorn and staghorn corals and beautiful, massive star corals. And unfortunately, those are the corals that have suffered particularly acutely from diseases and rising temperature and previous storms. But in their place are corals that are growing that are a more weedy species in the sense that - of a weed in your garden. They're small. They're perhaps a little drab. There's lots of them. They grow fast. And they die fast, as well. But they are a shadow of the kind of corals that used to be found there 50 years ago.
The debate seemed vicious, Arce said. I'm hoping Tom just stays on message, which he seems very consistent on that and so I think things will go his way.

Mercer and his daughter have also been enthusiastic backers of the conservative website Breitbart News, where they formed ties with key figures in the Trump White House such as Bannon and Kellyanne Conway. They own part of the data mining company Cambridge Analytica, which played a role in Trump's victory last year.
Mercer's influence hasn't been confined to the United States: He was a key supporter of Leave.eu, which spearheaded last summer's successful Brexit campaign.

Now, a Trump-appointed banking regulator is pushing for a rule that considers that an unfair, discriminatory practice.
This is an unprecedented forfeiture of American leadership which will cost us influence, cost us jobs, and invite other countries to walk away from solving humanity's most existential crisis, he said in a statement Thursday. It isolates the United States after we had united the world.
I haven't decided what the state ought to be doing, Wolf said.
Until recently, the best people could do to try to draw attention to such problems was to tweet pictures to the government or write letters to the newspaper — hoping someone with the power to make changes would take note.
Wolf said it's important that natural gas production to fuel facilities like Shell's cracker plant is done responsibly.
The power dynamic doesn't go unnoticed by ranchers though, many of whom are already suspicious of the federal government.
Durand Jones & the Indications, we're starting our next album, this weekend and we definitely have a couple of moments on there that were born from what we all shared and went through together this year. I think that this year will affect things to come for a while, as so many past past moments of political chaos and other kinds of chaos have been reflected in folklife, whatever form you define it. I think a lot about Gil Scott-Heron's H2Ogate Blues and how much it maps onto today.
Newsom is taking over a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world, and he has ambitions to match. California has the nation's highest rate of childhood poverty, which Newsom wants to address. He also wants to reform the health care system and provide government-subsidized child care.
JONES: And so he saw how I talked with my hands and how lanky I was and said, you know, you should come see one of our shows and think about auditioning for our troupe. And that's how the mime thing started with me.
After months of stalemate over the size and scope of a coronavirus relief package in the closing weeks of the last Congress, a group of centrists from both parties, led by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, unveiled a $900 billion compromise plan that became the basis for the legislation that ultimately was approved by the House and Senate and signed by President Trump.
The Green Climate Fund has been thrust into the spotlight of late.

The promise with that - problem with that is he did win the 2016 election. But he lost the 2018 election, and he really hasn't absorbed the changes that that's brought. He also tweeted, quote, there's almost nobody in the White House but me. And I think that really sums it up. It's just him, almost all by himself, making it up as he goes along.
It seems we're returning to the bad old days of the Cold War when we used aid as a glorified payoff for [political] friends and allies, says Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and former U.S. foreign disaster assistance chief under the Obama administration.
Matt Deitsch, a graduate of the school and an organizer of the March For Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C., told NPR in an interview in 2019: If we're not standing up and organizing ourselves, then we're not doing enough to save lives in America. — Pien Huang
Those second-tier diseases include measles and dengue, which did gangbusters in the tropics. Cholera raged in Yemen. Polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat. In Pakistan, polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018. In a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort, a dozen countries that had been polio free (including China, Angola and the Philippines) reported cases of vaccine-derived polio in 2019. Venezuela reported its first yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country's health care system continues its downward spiral. Despite efforts to rein it in, a few cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the Middle East, and that will probably continue in the coming year.
Brown and Mercer eventually were named to head Renaissance.
LIASSON: I think some of the dynamic on that has changed a bit because he took a big hit with his base this week. He went into a macho standoff and lost to Madam Speaker. And some of his base is angry with him because they think he had no strategy. They think he wimped out. And don't forget this was a kind of two-step capitulation. First, he played brinksmanship (ph) on the State of the Union address, then retreated on that. And Nancy Pelosi had a strategy. As she reportedly told a group of columnists this week, she says, you start with a feather. Then you get to the sledgehammer. So her Art Of The Deal was smarter and more strategic than the president's. His critics say his strategy was more whining than winning.

GROSZ: The same way a drug dealer likes to get on the street, you know, and, like, ropes him in.
A military person doesn't underestimate the enemy. A business person doesn't underestimate the competition, Socolow says. And even if, as Happer insists, there's uncertainty about the course of climate change, the U.S. can't afford to underestimate those risks.
LIASSON: That's right. His longtime friend Roger Stone, who is a self-described dirty trickster. I can't think of another president who's had a fixer and a dirty trickster in their orbit. But Roger Stone was invited - indicted. That increases the number of close associates to the president who have pled guilty or been indicted. Stone says he won't plead. He won't cooperate. He won't turn on the president. Maybe he's banking on a pardon. But what it seems like is that Robert Mueller is doing what most organized crime prosecutions do, working their way up the food chain, starting with small fry like Papadopoulos and then going up the ladder to people who are closer to the president. So it was a bad day for the president. But on the other hand, his capitulation on the shutdown took some of the attention away from the Robert - Roger Stone indictment. It was a bit of a distraction.
INSKEEP: So you're saying borrow the money, make the investment. The economy will grow. It will pay off the debt.
SAGAL: The first fake elevator is free.
Given that so many artists who have come before me, especially artists of color, have given me so much, I feel like I have a platform and I want to use it.

That's what my heroes did: They made time to, on their records and in their lives, express all the dimensions of themselves in that way.

You may get a good price, but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk, Miller says. There's no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders, either.
JONES: And I had a huge fight scene with Randy Quaid. But I was a giant insect that was guarding my pile of eggs, and he was coming to kill us. So we had a big knockdown drag-out in a cave. He came in there with weapons.
INSKEEP: So if you get this resolution passed, of course, it's a framework, it's an idea, it's a proposal and then you would need specific legislation to encourage wind power, to encourage solar, to do any number of things - efficiency, on and on. Those proposals, just mechanically, would need to move through various House committees, like the Energy and Commerce Committee, on its way to becoming law, committees that are chaired by Democrats who you have questioned or criticized because they take, for example, energy money. Frank Pallone of the Energy and Commerce Committee comes to mind. Do you have confidence in your fellow, more senior, Democrats that they would move the legislation that is necessary to do what you think needs to be done?
Critics argue the administration's single-minded focus on hard power is short-sighted, and could ultimately be detrimental to national security. They point to past comments from Defense Secretary James Mattis, a retired Marine general, who once told lawmakers, If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition, ultimately.
He said his campaign sought to cut through the noise of the culture wars and instead focused on the concerns of ordinary people.
We want to put the brakes on globalization a little bit and reassert control over our country, our borders, our economic policy, our tax policy, with the recognition that the distinction of citizenship means something and citizens are in it together fundamentally in a way that the world community is not, Anton says.

Yet it seems a fair guess that most people remain hazy on what the Green Climate Fund actually is — not the least because the GCF is so green in the other sense of that word: It's only just getting off the ground.
GROSS: Now, you met your partner almost on a blind date, so to speak (laughter).
The goals stem from the state's draft Climate Action Plan, released in November by the Department of Environmental Protection. The draft states that if every state and nation met comparable goals, global temperature rise could be kept below the 2-degree Celsius threshold that experts say is necessary to mitigate the catastrophic consequences of climate change.

That tendency in Newsom was not always appreciated. After his first marriage fell apart, he had an affair with a top aide's wife. Some felt he often seemed bored being mayor; spending too much time thinking about his political future including a run for governor a decade ago.
The EPA's new administrator, Scott Pruitt, is a longtime critic of what he sees as the agency's activist agenda. He and the president have both promised to scale back environmental regulation, including efforts to curb carbon pollution and promote alternative energy. Last week, Pruitt reiterated his doubts that carbon emissions are a primary contributor to climate change. That puts him at odds with the overwhelming scientific consensus.
SHAPIRO: You know, you and I spoke at the Paris climate summit more than three years ago when you were energy secretary. And back then, this is what you told me.

That work was critical to convincing the Obama administration that there was a real path to get the legislation through, said Maurice Mitchell, the national director of of the Working Families Party. So we plan on using that strategy. Sometimes, the best way to influence a president is indirectly by doing the work on the ground and shoring up members of Congress to inspire in the administration the belief that there actually is a legislative path.
But there are some signs of progress: This year, a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years. And the world is more prepared to deal with Ebola than at any time in history: Two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use, all developed after the 2014 West Africa outbreak. The current Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world's ability to battle this virus. If there's an Ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020, it would likely be contained and crushed quickly. — Jason Beaubien
KANDER: I don't know exactly how to answer that. I really don't want to sound phony on this. Most of the fun of writing is the fun of writing and rehearsing and hearing people sing it and working with that. What happens later, that includes going through to a complete Broadway production or whatever, is kind of secondary. I don't think I'm - I don't think I'm lying here. It's great when it happens. But the real fun is writing it and - or having Linda sing it. I think it would probably upset Fred more than me. I'm sad about it and a little bitter, but not overwhelmed because you just keep on writing.
Pressed on whether cutting back or eliminating altogether programs that help the poor was not being compassionate toward people who needed help the most, Mulvaney said that passing this budget was one of the most compassionate things we can do because it was being compassionate toward taxpayers who are funding those programs.
Prior to tightening water measures, the city attempted to shame residents into using less water by posting an online map tracking water consumption across the city.

As NPR's Christopher Joyce recently reported, emissions in the U.S. have declined by about 12 percent since 2005.
What I've heard is not so much because he capitulated, not so much because they won't get the wall - because, after all, immigration restrictionists don't put the wall as their No. 1 priority. But they're angry because he seemed weak and feckless and in over his head. And what we learned this week, also, is Democrats, at least for now, do not have an Herbal Tea Party problem. In other words, Pelosi was able to control her left flank a lot better than John Boehner or Paul Ryan ever did with the Freedom Caucus. So far, the Democrats are hanging together more than the White House thought they would.

Potter says during this great migration, either before or after they crossed the land bridge, this group (which the researchers call the founding population for all Native Americans) split again, into two populations. Scientists had suspected this and surmised that one group stayed put in and around Beringia. They call them Ancient Beringians.
Scientists, by training, have little exposure to the humanities. Given that a major in the sciences requires a lot of technical work, we spend precious little time dealing with what happened culturally and historically around the science we are trying to understand. We don't learn much about Galileo and his bouts with the Roman Inquisition, or about Newton's religious motivation for his work or his research in alchemy, or Kepler's Pythagorean mysticism, or Darwin's struggles with his wife's (and his own) faith, or Einstein's work as a pacifist. In the classroom, at least, we learn about their technical ideas, but not about who they were or why they were thinking what they were at the time.

I think everybody, both old and young, brought such sensitivity and empathetic playing. Most of it was done live. A bunch of stuff on the record, musically, you'll hear happen on the two [beat]: Like, one, boom. That's because you have people who are listening first and reacting, letting other people set the tone and doing what needs to be done in response. I think that's the working dynamic at Easy Eye, Dan Auerbach's studio — everybody working together to make things happen. It's like a barn raising.

2) The GCF is pretty new. But it's older than the Paris Agreement.
Epic Climate Cartoon Goes Viral, But It Has One Key Problem
But the Trump Administration seems headed in the other direction. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is preparing a five-year plan expected to greatly increase offshore drilling in federally controlled waters, including those off the coast of Santa Barbara.
Meanwhile, there's little chance of a Green New Deal getting a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.
President Trump has announced that the U.S. will be withdrawing from the Paris accord — the historic global agreement reached by 195 countries in 2015 to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in average global temperatures.
After November's general election, Georgia became the center of the U.S. political universe and the scene of a bitter battle within the GOP over the results of the 2020 presidential election, with President Trump falsely claiming that the state was stolen from him. The state's result is likely to be challenged Wednesday as Congress counts the Electoral College vote. That challenge is expected to fail.
The move — to hold a rally in a battleground state and miss the annual dinner known for glitzy elbow-rubbing between Washington journalists and Hollywood celebrities — seemed designed to thumb the presidential nose at the Washington press corps, with whom Trump continues to have a tense relationship, while also highlighting Trump's accomplishments on his 100th day in the Oval Office.
Martinez-Diaz notes that the GCF was never meant to be the only channel for mobilizing the $100 billion per year that rich countries promised would flow annually to poor countries by 2020. Not even as an intermediary or pass-through, he says. It was meant to be one of several financing mechanisms. Other examples include multilateral development banks like the World Bank.
MONIZ: None. There were members from each party, and the entire hearing was about everybody buying in, if you like, to the idea that we are going to low carbon. How do we get there in ways that are economic and also that do not cause unnecessary, at least, disruptions in a variety of communities?
The administration is proposing cutting the EPA's budget by 31 percent, from $8.3 billion in fiscal year 2017 to $5.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. That's the largest cut among all Cabinet departments and major agencies.

GROSS: So was Linda Emond in the role that was originated by Lotte Lenya in Cabaret as Fraulein Schneider. And Lotte Lenya was such a great singer. And she was also, of course, the widow of Kurt Weill. And some of the songs sound to me very influenced by Kurt Weill, who, I would imagine, you, you know, listened to a lot while writing the songs since he's the composer we most associate with that period. He's the songwriter we most associate with that period. He's a German songwriter who fled the Nazis.
Instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development, Konyndyk says there's a growing mentality in the U.S. that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line. Examples include Trump's freezing and reinstatement of aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies; his threats to cut off countries that don't vote with the U.S. at the United Nations; and his withdrawal of aid to Palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan.
The agency responded on Twitter, Mr. President, coal is an important part of TVA's power generation mix and we will give serious consideration to all factors as we make this decision.

Among the most prominent, the deal calls for meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources. The ultimate goal is to stop using fossil fuels entirely, Ocasio-Cortez's office told NPR, as well as to transition away from nuclear energy.
Last year Trump ordered Perry to take steps to help struggling coal and nuclear power plants, which have trouble competing against cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. No such plan has been carried out so far. Meanwhile, coal plants have continued to close during Trump's time in office, and coal consumption in the U.S. has hit its lowest point in nearly four decades.

Similarly, removing combustible engines from the roads or expanding high-speed rail to largely eliminate air travel would require nothing short of revolutionizing transportation.
This story is part of a series of conversations on Morning Edition with politicians, writers, scientists, theologians, tech innovators and others.

Bradley thinks it's ridiculous that Sarmento has to check in with his federal counterparts, and believes that state biologists — free of federal oversight — would be better able to respond to problem bears.
In 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared success, removing endangered species protections for Yellowstone-area grizzlies.

ROTT: Well, so the issue is that this is the time of year where forest managers and firefighters usually do a lot of the administrative duties and preparatory work they need to for the upcoming season. And because so many - so much of the federal workforce is furloughed right now, those things aren't happening. So that's hiring for seasonal positions, contracts for aircraft that aren't getting done, contracts for heavy equipment.

This split, of course, is not new. In 1959, the British physicist and novelist C.P. Snow, in his Rede Lecture at Cambridge University, called our attention to the Two Cultures divide — the growing gap between the sciences and the humanities that, he believed, threatened the health of academia:

That's a big question we're posing at NPR. We can't easily report on the future, but we can ask smart people how they think we got to this point in history, and where they think we're going.
Noyer was once head of the Banque de France and vice president of the European Central Bank. Right after the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit vote to leave the European Union, the French government under then-President Francois Hollande put Noyer in charge of convincing multinationals that were planning to leave London to relocate their operations to Paris. The competition includes cities like Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg.

It was Servheen's job to bring the bears back to the point where those federal protections weren't needed.
Trump's decision not to provide the remaining $2 billion effectively cuts the GCF's total expected funding by about 20 percent — hardly peanuts. And various analysts say the loss of U.S. engagement in the day-to-day running of the fund could have less tangible but no less impactful downsides because the U.S. government has particular expertise when it comes to keeping multinational organizations accountable and effective.
Which is to say: the Green New Deal framework combines big climate-change-related ideas with a wish list of progressive economic proposals that, taken together, would touch nearly every American and overhaul the economy.
In an interview Tuesday evening with NPR, Doug Ericksen, the head of communications for the Trump administration's EPA transition team, said that during the transition period, he expects scientists will undergo an unspecified internal vetting process before sharing their work outside the agency.

INSKEEP: You can find the Green New Deal resolution on our website today. NPR is the first to publish this call to transform the economy. It's a resolution calling for massive increases in renewable energy production, like wind and solar. It would have the United States set a goal to become carbon neutral in 10 years, which is a very ambitious timeline. This resolution says what should be done but offers few specifics on how to do it. That would have to come in later legislation. Instead, the congresswoman aims to promote big goals.
Like any White House budget, Trump's blueprint is more of a political document than an accurate predictor of government spending. Congress controls the purse strings and lawmakers may have very different priorities. As a statement of presidential intention, though, the blueprint is crystal clear.
First the board will hold a public hearing on Wednesday, at which environmental groups say they will show up in force to ask the board to close down the coal plant.

They said, we got this, we can do this, the forces of the market are going to force us to innovate. Except for the fact that there's a little thing in economics called externalities, and what that means is that a corporation can dump pollution in the river and they don't have to pay for it, and taxpayers have to pay for cleaning up our air, cleaning up our water and saving the planet.
But it's not going over well with Republican lawmakers.
The source of her frustration is a feeling that her opinion doesn't matter and that the landmark law that brought grizzly bears back is being misused.

The approach is being studied around the world in different ecosystems, including near coral reefs, and using bigger marine plants, like kelp.
On the y-axis, we've got time. The whole cartoon, which starts at the end of the last ice age, represents about 22,000 years. People have been around for about 200,000 years.

It's going to be tied up in the courts. The Republicans in Congress are split on this. Some Republicans say it would usurp Congress's power of the purse. Others say it's a terrible precedent because a future Democratic president could declare a state of emergency around gun safety or health care or climate change.

We know from polling, including NPR's polling, that his approval rating was starting to slip with white, working-class voters who are the core of his base. And we know that in every shutdown - shutdowns end because one side reaches their pain threshold first. In this case, it was the Republicans and Donald Trump. Maybe it was the long lines at the airport, that angry video statement from the FBI director or all those Senate Republicans who were starting to jump ship. But he had a weak hand and played it poorly. And his base is angry at him.

Water taps continue to run dry
Democratic leaders of the California Legislature signaled their intention Wednesday to fight any challenges to state policies by the incoming administration of Donald Trump by hiring as outside legal counsel former Attorney General Eric Holder.
The previous Administration refused to recognize that private innovation and American natural gas have achieved more than government mandates and misguided international agreements — and that naiveté led President Obama to sign a climate deal that will impose great costs with little gain. President Trump made the right call in leaving a deal that would have put an unnecessary burden on the United States.
Trump Unveils 'Hard Power' Budget That Boosts Military Spending
While the Green New Deal has in the last year or so grown central to progressive Democrats' policy conversations, the idea of a Green New Deal itself is well over a decade old. Environmentalists were talking about it as far back as 2003, when the term popped up in a San Francisco Chronicle article about an environmentalist conference.

Control of the Senate significantly changes what President-elect Joe Biden could do, but most importantly, his party will now be able to set the legislative agenda. Democrats failed to make the kind of gains in Senate races in November that many had forecast, with GOP incumbents staving off strong challenges in several states. But with narrow control, they will wield the gavels for Senate committees, call hearings and decide which items get top priority.
Ultimately Biden may be on the path to the nomination, but he still needs a really strong performance. His performance on the trail has not always been really solid. At times, it's been uneven. He has to start demonstrating that he's steady, that he's in command, that he's ready to be the nominee.

Gov. Tom Wolf has set a new goal for the state to combat climate change: reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent by 2025.
The music of Aaron Frazer feels a bit like stepping into a time machine: It's got touches of Curtis Mayfield and Carole King, but it's also very much of this moment. The Baltimore native, who's best known for playing drums and singing in the band Durand Jones & the Indications, says he was in the middle of making dinner one day when he got a call from Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, asking if they could make a record together. That solo album, Introducing..., was released Friday, and Frazer joined NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro to talk about it. Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read on for an edited transcript.

The narrative that Ashe is referring to — that the Endangered Species Act is flawed because animals don't come off it — is a popular one with Congressional Republicans and others opposed to the law.
The rule is based on the concept of fair access to credit, which traditionally had to do with preventing racial discrimination.
While people were still partying on the dance floor, Steyer left to attend a town hall of a very different vibe: one hosted by Mi Familia Vota at a union hall for plumbers and welders. Before taking questions from the smaller, primarily Latino crowd, he focused on immigration and what he called a humanitarian crisis at the border. The night ended with the crowd chanting, Sí se puede (roughly translating to: Yes, we can or Yes, it can be done).
A federal judge restored endangered species protections to Yellowstone-area grizzlies last fall, just hours before a highly-controversial hunt of the bears was scheduled to start in Wyoming and Idaho. An effort to delist grizzlies in northwest Montana was paused as well.
Lynn Arce says that kind of diversity meshes with Steyer's messaging.
The company could end up having to pay billions from legal action stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons.
LIASSON: I do. As it was described to me, unless he got the full amount of funding for the wall that he was demanding, he would do this because this is a way for him to keep faith with his base, to say that he did everything possible to build the wall, even if it's stopped in the courts. His advisers really believe - he really believes that the wall is absolutely key to his re-election. Now, of course, now he has to convince the courts that a national emergency is whatever a president says it is. And he really undercut himself in that speech in the Rose Garden, where he said, I didn't need to do this. In other words, he's doing this for expedience not necessity. He said, I just wanted to build the wall faster. He's also said at various times that the wall is already being built. So if it's already being built, why do you need to declare a national emergency to build it?
In June, the state's fire agency, Cal Fire, determined that PG&E power equipment was responsible for sparking at least a dozen major fires across Northern California in 2017. And now, regulators are investigating whether PG&E equipment sparked November's Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in state history.
And Court says the rule is so broadly written that it would apply to mundane business decisions as well as broader ones based on what the management of the bank thinks is good or bad for society — whether that involves climate change, assault rifles, payday lending, or anything else.

But on the other issues, Sanders is asking Biden to show at the debate on Sunday that he simply gets the message. And it was telling that Sanders was offering this detailed warning to the Democratic establishment for the future, beyond 2020.
Increased bird feeding has something to do with it, but certainly the temperature changes and other changes associated with climate change seem to have a big impact on that, Brown said.
The GCF was created as a vehicle to carry out one of the major commitments made by developed countries at the 2010 Cancun meeting: By 2020, they promised to mobilize $100 billion every year for climate change efforts in developing countries.
Some scientists are concerned the influx of freshwater could cause the current to shut down altogether. This was the premise of the 2004 film, The Day After Tomorrow, but Thornalley says the impact of the slowdown likely won't be as catastrophic as depicted in the film.
A coalition of progressive groups say they are organizing a sweeping network to mobilize around climate change, racial and environmental justice, making a new unified push as President-elect Joe Biden is days away from taking office with Democrats set to control both the House and the Senate.
Jon Stearns is one of the few avocado farmers in the Central Valley. He grows 25 acres of mainly Hass avocados on a hill outside of Visalia and says the incline actually helps keep the trees warmer in winter.
The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has reached its carrying capacity for bears. It's exporting bears, says Dan Ashe, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under President Barack Obama. The question this point around, about whether they should be delisted, is more of a values-based question.
He later added: Our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of American workers' sovereignty.
In Texas, he and his wife will see an increase of about $40,000 a year. We're starting at numbers that we will never ever see in this state as educators.
President Trump's tough talk on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada has raised many questions — including how such a move might negatively affect the flow of beloved produce to the U.S.
I think the people that are litigating this, for the conservation groups, it's about what recovery means and what your vision of that is going to be in the future, says Jeremy Bruskotter, a professor at the School of Environment & Natural Resources at Ohio State University. Is it curating populations in isolated wilderness areas, or restoring them to wide areas of their historic range?
SHAUGHNESSY NAUGHTON: Three, one, four are the first three digits of pi which is used throughout the sciences, and part of why I founded this organization was one of my observations from when I ran for Congress, I was really surprised at the lack of people with scientific or technical backgrounds. And I think we all benefit by having diversity of experience in government. And so I founded 314 Action to unite the scientific community and to encourage them to go beyond the traditional role of advocacy and actually get involved in electoral politics.
Grizzly bears are slow to reproduce. They require massive amounts of habitat. And they kill people, Servheen says, in the matter-of-fact tone that earned him admirers and enemies during a 35-year career.
We fill a vacuum, says Gaddam. With our help, citizens can hold the government accountable.
In that vein, the proposal stresses that it aims to meet its ambitious goals while paying special attention to groups like the poor, disabled and minority communities that might be disproportionately affected by massive economic transitions like those the Green New Deal calls for.
Some Republicans in Congress, including several representing districts particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, also rebuked reports of Trump's decision. Climate change is a serious issue, tweeted Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida — with a photo of development near a Florida beach.
KANDER: I think internally, it sort of validated us. I don't know if that's true or not. Looking back on it, I think so. Suddenly, there was a song out there that lots and lots of people were singing. And it sort of puts you in a - or at least it did for me - a slightly different place in your head. It's good and bad.
JONES: In fact, every time I stepped - I stood up and walked away from our set chairs, where we're - you know, where we rest between takes, if I was in a scene with Octavia Spencer, she would sit there and watch me walk away and just say one thing.
This is the latest in a string of controversial decisions the EPA has made in the final stretch of President Trump's administration. In December, the agency decided not to strengthen air quality standards for ozone and soot, and it enacted a new rule that requires future clean air regulations to weigh economic costs of curbing pollution while ignoring benefits, such as the deaths that could be avoided.

Jennifer Lentfer, a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades, says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development. There are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject. In the coming weeks, Lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question Western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative. And in January, graduate students at Duke University are organizing a conference called Decolonizing Global Health 2020.
Scientists across the country are planning to go to Washington — and take office. Shaughnessy Naughton is the founder of 314 Action a non profit that helps scientists run for office.
ROTT: Yeah. You know, and look, President Trump is not wrong there. Bad or misguided forest management, let's say, is one of the big reasons that we do have these big fires, you know, as well as climate change. The irony here though is that in a place like California, where I am now, the president keeps berating our forest management, threatening to withhold emergency funds. But more than 50 percent of California's forests are managed by the federal government. And right now, due to the shutdown, federal management isn't happening on those lands.
Now it's clear there are problems on both sides of the business, says Steve Fleishman, an analyst with Wolfe Research, referring to the gas and electric divisions.
But sometimes it can be hard to grasp what all the numbers and stats mean. For instance, when scientists say Earth's average surface temperature has gone up about 1 degree Celsius over the past 150 years or so, what does that really mean? Besides, hasn't Earth's temperature always fluctuated?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what is that potential long-term impact?
Wolf sets goal for Pa. to cut greenhouse gas emissions
Coal is a bad choice for the people of the Tennessee Valley. Not only because it's uneconomical but because it's a dirty way to generate energy, says Jonathan Levenshus with the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign.
Many federal agencies employ scientists to help conduct research. Those findings are crucial in ensuring that regulations and government policy are based on the best information available. Data collected by federal scientists is also used by state and local governments as well as private industry.
Despite warnings since 2004, local government officials are criticizing South Africa's national government for its slow response to the crisis. As The Los Angeles Times notes:
As the system weakens, scientists are observing a kind of surprising response to global warming, where you can actually get regional cooling in parts of the globe, climate scientist Max Holmes told NPR in 2006.
I believe the intellectual life of the whole of modern Western society is increasingly being split into two polar groups...at one pole we have the literary intellectuals, who incidentally while no one was looking took to referring to themselves as 'intellectuals' as though there were no others...at the other scientists, and as the most representative, the physical scientists. Between the two a gulf of mutual incomprehension — sometimes (particularly among the young) hostility and dislike, but most of all lack of understanding.

A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called Trump's decision a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.
EDMUNDS: Well, storms bring massive waves that - 20, 25 feet in height to the surface. And those waves bring tremendous forces underwater that drag things across the bottom and break things off the bottom and cause a tremendous amount of scarring. And so in the Virgin Islands, we're accustomed to calm, sheltered waters, sunny days and spectacular underwater visibility. And then after a storm, everything has changed. And it's a remarkable game trying to imagine what it was like on that night of the storm.
Manchin has said he hopes that model can translate into efforts in 2021.

Mercer received a Ph.D.in computer science at the University of Illinois, and then went to work at IBM Research, where he did early work in artificial intelligence and voice recognition.
Reprising familiar themes from his campaign and his tweets, Trump declared that CNN and MSNBC were both fake news. He also once again referred to the New York Times as failing. Turning one of the traditions of the 100th-day milestone on its head, Trump suggested to the crowd that they rate the media's 100 days, adding, because, you know, they are a disgrace. After rattling through a litany of what he saw as the Times' bad business decisions over the years, the real estate mogul and former reality TV star declared that the national newspaper of record was incompetent and dishonest people.
PG&E has demonstrated a pattern of poor management and illegal conduct that has shattered lives across California, Dodd said in an emailed statement. He called for systemic change, which must include change on the board of directors and in the executive suite.
The president ran [his campaign] saying he would spend less money overseas and more money back home, Mulvaney said Wednesday. When you go to implement that policy, you go to things like foreign aid, and those get reduced.

The Indian subcontinent is a prime candidate, he says. But on the plus side, climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for El Niño and La Niña, the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others. The absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity.
We've got to push back vigorously on the demonization of fossil fuels, he said in his speech. They're not demons at all. They're enormous servants to us.
The other study examined the pattern of ocean temperatures, which researchers concluded has contributed to pockets of record warm and record cold right next to one another.

The two Republican Hill leaders were supportive of the blueprint but both signaled a long process lay ahead. I welcome the president's blueprint for next year's budget, which turns the page from the last eight years, House Speaker Paul Ryan, of Wisconsin, said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to reviewing this with the Appropriations Committee and our entire conference. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said he pleased to see an increased focus on our national security and veterans budgets, calling them positive steps in the right direction, according to the Washington Examiner. But McConnell added he looked forward to reviewing this and the full budget when it is released later this spring.
It has no merits from the standpoint of science or transparency, and it will make it vastly harder for the agency to do its job of protecting public health and the environment, Andrew Rosenberg of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a national science advocacy group, wrote in an email after the final rule was announced. The damage will fall hardest on Black, Latinx and Indigenous communities who already bear disproportionate harms from environmental hazards in the air, water and soil.
STOPULOUS: Since I've lived here, we've only had one really big flood. And it was when I was a young girl. I don't remember it. So historically, the chances are not very high.

Whether it's a deadly cold snap or a hole under an Antarctic glacier or a terrifying new report, there seem to be constant reminders now of the dangers that climate change poses to humanity.
MONIZ: Well, actually, first of all, let me say I stand by that Paris statement. I believe it's true, and the recent polls show that there is increasing understanding and acceptance in the public both about the realities of climate change and about the need to address it. Now, in reality, you're absolutely right. But I think the trend remains and will remain going towards lower carbon. The problem is that we were not then and we are not now working on a sufficiently accelerated path to low carbon to meet the 2 degrees, let alone the substantially less-than-2-degree, goal.
That leaves a lot of room for interpretation.

But other experts say city planners failed to anticipate that the city's six dams, which are sourced by rainfall, would run out of water as drought worsened and the population grew, Fihlani says. Dam levels have dropped to 15.2 percent capacity of usable water, down from 77 percent in Sept. 2015, according to The Los Angeles Times.

GROSS: Let me pick up on what you just said, even if the work is bad. Now, when do you decide that you don't like a song if you're going to tear it up? Do you know that right away? Or is it, like, three days later that you realize, God, that was a bad song?
MONIZ: Exactly. And of course we are already about 1 degree on the path to that 2 degrees. So there's no doubt we have to pick up the pace. And there are some elements of optimism here. First is that the states which have been the leaders in driving low carbon continue to do so - and in fact cities as well. Secondly, starting right after President Trump's announcement on the Paris Agreement, the reality is an enormous part of the business community came forward and said, we're staying the course. And we've seen, if anything, a pickup in that commitment in the last years. We are seeing the oil companies, the big utilities all going in this direction.
Former Energy Secretary Weighs In On Green New Deal Legislation
JONES: Good instincts I had there.
It's a very poorly constructed rule, says John Court, the head of regulatory affairs at the Bank Policy Institute, which represents the biggest banks in the country. He says the rule is clearly hastily conceived and hastily constructed.
She added: It could be part of a larger solution, but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. And so that's really what we're trying to accomplish with the Green New Deal.
Given the rigor of the modern scientific review process, the EPA's own internal board of scientific advisers raised questions about the new rule. When the board reviewed an earlier draft of the new rule last year, they noted that there is already a trend among scientists toward making data publicly available when it's possible to do so without compromising confidentiality. The EPA advisers said that the new rule could decrease efficiency and reduce scientific integrity.
One thing that has happened in the polling is that the border wall has gotten a little bit more popular. It's still net unpopular right now. Forty-two percent of people say they support a wall. That's up from 34 percent a year ago. But 54 percent oppose the idea, down from 63 percent a year ago.

When a new Congress convenes every two years, the majority party must approve a resolution outlining House rules, the intricate parliamentary procedures that govern the chamber. Two notable changes in the Democrats' package are aimed at avoiding certain confrontations that became commonplace during the Republican majority from 2011 through 2019, after the rout of the party in the 2018 midterms.
Five years older, to be precise. The GCF was formally created at the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico. That said, setting up an international organization of the GCF's scope and size takes time. So it wasn't until 2013 that the GCF was in a position to hold its first round of fundraising.
Though in his announcement Trump referred to himself as someone who cares deeply about the environment, he has signaled, more broadly, that fighting climate change is not a priority for his administration. He has denied the existence of climate change and appointed as the head of the EPA a man who doesn't accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And he has already overturned several Obama-era efforts to reduce emissions.

Democrats plan to tweak the rules so that a motion to vacate can only be offered on the House floor if a majority of either the House Republican Conference or the House Democratic Caucus agrees to do so.

Much of the early criticism revolves around the scope of the plan, which backers say is big to match the challenge of the climate change problem.
At the same time, Happer acquired a reputation as a contrarian, quick to challenge conclusions that struck him as unproven — especially when it came to environmental science.

GONYEA: After the rally, the cleanup crew stacks the folding chairs. Music still pipes through the sound system. And with Senator Sanders tied up with the impeachment trial in these days before Iowa and New Hampshire, he'll need the people who show up at events like these to reach out to potential backers and to show that the grassroots can turn out the vote, even if the candidate is around a lot less.
GONYEA: Yeah. I mean, where do I begin? The rallies are done for now at least. And when will people feel comfortable coming back to a rally? So that's an open question. Joe Biden held a virtual event on Friday. Sanders did a virtual fireside chat but so much of a campaign is about human contact. I mean, they're all about bringing people together and creating community and energy. How do you canvas? How do you knock on doors? I mean, the answer is you don't. We have seen both Biden and Sanders give speeches trying to show how they would handle a crisis. So that kind of thing is going on. One other thing about tonight though, Lulu, not only is there no audience but also one of the moderators. Jorge Ramos has withdrawn from the debate. He's self-quarantining because he may have had secondhand exposure.
The wildlife officials gathered at the front of the room know her. She speaks at nearly every grizzly bear planning and committee meeting in the state, pressing lawmakers and federal and state biologists about their plans with the bears.
An Atlantic Ocean current that helps regulate the global climate has reached an 1,000-year low, according to two new studies in the journal Nature.
Amy Sisk Bio Recent Stories Amy Sisk reports for StateImpact Pennsylvania and WESA, Pittsburgh's NPR member station. She comes to Pennsylvania from another energy-rich state, North Dakota, where she told stories from coal mines, wind farms and the Bakken oil patch for Inside Energy and Prairie Public Broadcasting. Amy's stories often air on NPR, including those from the eight months she spent following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. A reporting trip to the Bakken during its boom years sparked her interest in energy. Ever since, she's covered the industry -- from the way it is regulated to its influence on policy to its impact on people and the environment.

All of these riders and all of these standalone bills keep failing and I think that's because public support for the Endangered Species Act is actually very, very high, says Bethany Cotton, wildlife program director for WildEarth Guardians, an environmental group that sued to keep grizzly bears listed.
Anton spoke just as Trump was nearing his first 100 days in office — and as the president was discovering some of the limits on what he could achieve.
Leading Democrats on Capitol Hill slammed Trump's budget blueprint as wrongheaded. President Trump is not making anyone more secure with a budget that hollows out our economy and endangers working families, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, of California, said in a statement, adding, The budget is a statement of values, and President Trump has shown he does not value the future of children and working families. The Senate's top Democrat was more direct: Democrats in Congress will emphatically oppose these cuts & urge our Republican colleagues to reject them as well, Sen. Charles Schumer, of New York, said on Twitter.
Trump wants lawmakers to boost military spending in the coming fiscal year by 10 percent, or $54 billion. Rather than raise taxes or increase the deficit, the president is calling for equivalent cuts in other areas. Foreign aid would be especially hard hit, with the State Department's budget cut by about 28 percent.

A, Her Majesty did not appreciate being represented by a sculpture titled Ice Queen; B, after Boris Johnson refused to participate in a debate on climate change, they had a melting ice sculpture take his place; or, C, to counterprogram a Theresa May speech on the BBC, they showed an ice sculpture of her for an hour with the caption - which seems more human?
Wyoming and Idaho had issued permits to hunt 23 grizzlies last fall, before the federal judge's decision restored federal protections for the bears. Montana held off on granting a hunting season, but few doubt that the state would soon do the same.

Unimpeded, oil and gas under tremendous pressure opened five separate gashes in the soft sandstone seabed. So much gas bubbled to the surface near Platform A that the water appeared to boiling. And oil from the underwater fissures began to form a slick that would eventually cover an area nearly the size of Chicago.
There were just a few hundred of the mammoth mammals left in the lower 48 U.S. states, holed up in the confines of Yellowstone National Park and a few wilderness areas along the Canadian border.

The No. 1 issue for Democratic voters in this presidential election season is health care. But trailing a close second is climate change. Morning Edition host Rachel Martin has been reporting in Iowa this past week ahead of the caucuses. And she spent some time in the city of Davenport, right along the Mississippi River. The city was the site of record-breaking floods last spring. How does the rising river and the threat from climate change affect how people there vote? Here's what she found out.

Rounding the bend in the dirt path that leads to Prospect Park's bird feeders, Cyrus Baty, a volunteer at the Brooklyn Bird Club, heard a peculiar sound for February: two sharp clicks ending in a throaty trill.
For her part, Ocasio-Cortez says that a policy like the Green New Deal could get voters excited enough to pressure their Congress members to support it.
MONIZ: Well, let me first preface my response by saying that a Green New Deal, which to me means both pursuing very low carbon and social equity, is exactly what we have to do. Now, when we come to the Green New Deal, I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in the 10-year timeframe. It's just impractical. And if we start putting out impractical targets, we may lose a lot of key constituencies who we need to bring along to have a real low-carbon solution on the most rapid timeframe that we can achieve.
Here are 11 trend lines we'll be watching in 2020. First we'll give you the bad news — then the hopeful predictions.
Basically, we call ourselves a startup campus because we actually have 28 different incubators, but also a ton of services, Vanier says.

In fact, if you take the modeling method used to create the dotted line and extend it all the way out to the present, the recent spike in Earth's temperature would be partly smoothed. Kevin Anchukaitis, a paleoclimatogist at the University of Arizona, ran that exact experiment Tuesday and showed his results on Twitter.
The Vermont senator — who remains a registered independent, and who is often accused of wanting to burn the Democratic Party down — was instead offering advice. Sanders seemed to indicate that as he sees the presidential nomination slipping away, he wants the party to thrive by addressing the issues he cares about the most.
But the GCF has a lot more flexibility in how it can spend its money, notes Jessica Brown of the Climate Policy Initiative, a research center that advises policymakers on green strategies. The World Bank, for example, mainly gives out loans, which, by definition, must be paid back by recipient countries. The bank can only give outright grants to a small subset of extremely poor nations. And it can't generally be a direct co-investor in a for-profit enterprise. The GCF faces no such constraints.

One reason for this mindset, says Renzo Guinto, a Filipino physician and a member of The Lancet Planetary Health's editorial board, is the colonial roots of tropical medicine.

These conversations began with the social scientist Francis Fukuyama, who famously proclaimed the end of history just as the Cold War was coming to an end. What Fukuyama meant was that a single form of government — liberal democracy — was on its way to triumph over competing models like communism. A quarter century later, the forms of democracy remain in place around the world. But many are becoming less liberal. Russia has an elected president and parliament but has cracked down on dissent and the press. Turkey has also cracked down on the press, and in a recent democratic vote chose to concentrate power in the hands of one man.
Steve Fleishman, senior utilities analyst and a managing director at Wolfe Research, said PG&E's plan for dealing with fires in the future is unclear. They clearly seem to be more at risk for that, Fleishman said. This kind of risk profile is not sustainable.

In the last Congress, lawmakers proposed to delist a species of jumping mouse, Mexican wolves, the American burying beetle, freshwater mussels and grizzly bears.
Trump claimed throughout the campaign that he would get Mexico to pay for the wall, but Mulvaney said Thursday afternoon that, as to the source of funds, that's up to the president, the Treasury and the State Department and wouldn't commit to getting the funds from Mexico.
Conducting a breakout session during World Water Week in Stockholm last year, Akvo's Bjelkeman-Pettersson demonstrated the mobile-phone-enabled water-quality tests that their lab in Bengaluru uses. One kit contains a simple strip test, say for pH or phosphates. Another consists of a collection jar and a reactant chemical that can test for fluoride — a big problem in India and Bangladesh. There, too much fluoride in the drinking water has led to mass fluorosis, a condition that leads to calcification of ligaments.
A wide chorus of voices had called for Trump to recommit to the Paris agreement: other world leaders and hundreds of scientists, of course, but also CEOs of major energy companies and other big U.S. corporations. Even many of Trump's own advisers support the deal, according to The New York Times.
Sometimes, needed information goes beyond simple observations on water levels or color; it can require doing a quick lab test on the go.

Other times, he's said he's not in any rush. But that endgame of declaring a national emergency has been described to me by Trump's advisers as the only plausible way out of this for him politically, a way for him to keep faith with his base, show him - show them he's fighting, even if he's stymied in the courts.

But in a profile of Mercer in the New Yorker, writer Jane Mayer quoted former Democratic operative Pat Caddell saying Mercer despises the Republican establishment.
How Will Members Of Congress Respond To The Green New Deal?
The orders that we were getting – if we were getting them at all, they wouldn't necessarily happen at the time or the size that we could take them, he says.
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2016 Mercer gave some $25 million to conservative groups and candidates, including President Trump. Last year, he was also one of the 10 biggest political donors in the country, alongside better-known figures such as George Soros, Sheldon Adelson and Mike Bloomberg.
And again, all of this is hypothetical — it would be tough to implement and potentially extremely expensive ... if it passed.
Before scrolling through it, check out those axes.
I haven't seen any reasonable improvement, he says. So I think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a Day Zero this year.
Rendon and Newsom haven't always seen eye to eye. Asked about Newsom's ambitious agenda, Rendon says that compared to Brown — who focused on climate change, fiscal stability and criminal justice reform — the new governor has a wider range of policy interests.
Andrew Williams, director of legislative and regulatory affairs for EDF, said Wolf's efforts to cut methane emissions are a good step. To achieve major reductions, he said he would like to see even more action.
LIASSON: ...Gave him something but not very much and, certainly, not as much as he wanted. And he is kind of all over the place. He won but he's not happy. The wall's being built, but he has to declare a national emergency to build it. You know, the interesting thing is this is often put into the context of he is keeping a campaign promise. But what people forget is during the 2016 campaign, he signed something called the Contract with the American Voter, where he pledged that he would obtain reimbursement from Mexico for the full cost of the wall. So he's actually breaking a campaign promise.
On a sunny morning, a team of scientists is scuba-diving in a shallow part of the bay, surrounded by thick, green seagrass, waving in the current.
MARTIN: Yeah. A year after the flood, Annie and Kayla are looking to the future, like so many others we talked with here. And after tomorrow's caucuses, they'll have a better idea of what that future might look like. Rachel Martin, NPR News, Davenport, Iowa.
We've spent a lot of money on housing and urban development over the last decades without a lot to show for it, Mulvaney said Wednesday. He added that Trump prefers to invest in cities' infrastructure and school choice.
In part, because there's some truth to the argument.
The only thing we really can do is obviously try and prevent global warming because that's the root cause of why we think it's weakening now with increasing temperatures, he says.
Environmental groups generally support the resolution.
The state's incoming attorney general has spent decades in Washington working on federal policies, said Assemblyman Chad Mayes, R-Yucca Valley, in a statement quoted by the Sacramento Bee. It's not clear why legislative Democrats needed to hire a D.C. insider to litigate the exact same issues.
Back when world leaders agreed to the $100 billion goal, it wasn't actually clear how much the developed world was currently spending. The only really good data we have is starting in 2014, says Martinez-Diaz. That's from a 2015 analysis by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and Climate Policy Initiative. And it's not very promising: It finds that the public and private sectors combined spent about $62 billion.
One of them made it possible to capture much better images of people's lungs; the other allows astronomers to see the stars more clearly.
DAN BUSH: Yeah. It's right over there.
For people that are used to the luxury that Cape Town promises, this has come across as a rather drastic measure, she says. People are reusing some of the water that they've used in other areas and finding other uses for it around the household. This means limiting the amount of water you drink, limiting the showers that you take.
In fact, Renaissance became one of the most successful hedge fund companies in the world. Its Medallion fund, which is mainly a tax-free employee retirement fund, racked up annual gains of more than 70 percent between 1994 and 2014, according to Bloomberg.
2. Creating a bipartisan select committee tasked with coming up with proposals to modernize and improve the way Congress operates.
When the far-right movement built a ground swell and pushed back on things like Waxman-Markey, there was no countervailing movement force to challenge that, said Mitchell. We plan on having a 50-state strategy that is rooted outside, in order to shore up Congress because we know that every single member is going to need to be held accountable.
Climate research at NASA could also take a hit under Trump's budget. The plan would reduce overall spending at NASA by around 1 percent, Mulvaney said, but would increase spending on space exploration, which Trump supports.
This is the America First budget, said Mulvaney Wednesday. In fact, we wrote it using the president's own words. We went through his speeches. We went through articles that have been written about his policies ... and we turned those policies into numbers.
And I think because the juices of rage were coursing through our bodies, we wrote another song very fast, probably 45 minutes, called New York, New York and took it back. and that was the song that was used in the movie and became the song which is now pretty well known.
It also sends a clear message domestically: This administration is willing to make drastic, controversial cuts to fund that strong-power message. That includes slashing spending on foreign aid and the environment, as well as long-standing programs aimed at boosting the arts and humanities, as well as the fortunes of the most vulnerable Americans. The question now is how much the Republican-controlled Congress will go along with that vision.
I think of that as being the most insidious, the worst thing the oil industry has done to our community, McCauley says.
SAGAL: I know this is a very weird question to ask you. But can you think of, like, the weirdest thing you were asked to play? And I say this to somebody who has literally played the Angel of death.
Like most ranchers, Bradley and her husband have been largely accommodating of grizzly bears as their population has rebounded and they've spread from the mountains into the more-populated plains. They've started storing food for their cattle in a raised, bear-proof container. Neighbors have lined entire pastures with electric fencing. Bradley's daughter now knows not to leave the yard.
One reason the 1969 oil spill had such an impact was that Santa Barbara was home to a lot of wealthy Republicans who had helped elect Nixon, Alagona says.
Bernie Sanders and the other senators running for president are trapped in the president's impeachment trial. But later today, they will zip out back onto the campaign trail using every precious hour to try to make their final pitch to voters. For Mr. Sanders, that's often at sizable rallies, a hallmark of his campaign. NPR's Don Gonyea takes us to New Hampshire to see how the Vermont senator has been rallying his loyal base.
For more than 20 years, researcher Mary Lu Arpaia has been on a mission to find an avocado tree that can withstand the Central Valley's frosty winters and hot summers. At a test field east of the Central Valley city of Visalia, Arpaia thinks she's found three varieties that can do just that.
EDMUNDS: In some of the places where we were, by August of 2017, when we were last there before the hurricane, one-tenth of the sea floor or less was covered by live coral. And now 3 or 4 percent of that has been killed. And the rate of recovery will be slow. Corals grow very slowly. So probably by next summer, we'll start to see baby corals settling on the reef. And some of those will survive and produce the reefs of tomorrow. But whether they do that or not will depend on these progressive changes in the environmental conditions and whether or not there are further Category 5 storms in 2018 or 2019 or 2020.
Epidemiological studies that examine the relationship between pollution and health sometimes rely on massive amounts of medical data that is anonymized or kept confidential in order to protect the privacy of study participants. However, rigorous scientific studies are reviewed by multiple experts in the field before publication and that peer-review process includes an examination of how the underlying data was analyzed.
increased efforts to fight terrorism (We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.);
They need to do a whole lot more homework
6) Trump's decision to end further U.S. funding deals the organization a blow — but doesn't necessarily kneecap it.
Aaron Frazer: Yeah, that's right. We wrote the record over the course of four days. I think we came out with like 16 vocal tracks and four more instrumentals. It was a sprint, but I've never had a writing session so fruitful.
MERRIAM: No, I won't. I will not.
The frustration built to the point that he and some of his neighbors don't even call bear biologists anymore when they need to, Bradley says. They don't see the point.
It gained traction with a 2007 New York Times column from Thomas Friedman, where he used the phrase to describe the scope of energy investments he thought would be necessary to slow climate change on a large scale.
You know, nothing was rote, nothing was linear. I had to work around things, work differently, see the world differently, Newsom told KQED. It allowed me to think outside the box. I've always been willing to take risks because you have to because you're never going to thrive in the more traditional sense.
City officials are blaming residents for ignoring previous water restrictions. Mayor Patricia de Lille said last week that more than 60 percent of residents are using too much water and threatened them with fines.
Over the past couple of years, he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change. They aim to give medical professionals in low-income countries real leadership roles. At the university level, students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field's colonial history in global health curriculum. And communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media. Many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags #ShiftThePower and #DecolonizeGlobalHealth.
Trump EPA Erects New Barriers To Crucial Science
Among all the proposed spending hikes and cuts, some areas would see spending cuts of 100 percent. The administration wants to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Together, the two groups receive about $300 million annually.
To more liberal Democrats, the prospect of such an ambitious economic and environmental package at the center of the 2020 campaign may be particularly energizing.
Bloomberg's plan calls for his foundation to work with other groups, from governments to philanthropies, that want to support the U.N.'s climate change agency.
President Trump singled it out for scorn in his Rose Garden remarks last week announcing his decision to pull the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. Along with that move, Trump noted, he is ending further U.S. contributions to the so-called Green Climate Fund — nice name.
GROSS: I like it a lot too. And I remember when it was a hit by Sandy Stewart in - was it the '50s or the '60s?
At the time, he and about 40 other educators were running for office in the state, wanting to make a change because, as Sheehan puts it, lawmakers weren't prioritizing education. Funding for schools in the state has been cut tremendously over the past decade and teachers in Oklahoma are some of the lowest paid in the country.
I'm really excited about bringing people's faces and experiences into a conversation where folks from the south, Black folks, Black women, people of color and in some low wealth communities have not been at the table. Harper said. They have not been a part of the fabric. They have not been in an opportunity to lead and to contribute. I think that Georgia spoke very loudly in the last election, so it's very clear that we are an integral point of moving what needs to be moved forward.
In 2011, following a years' long, highly-contentious back-and-forth on the delisting of grey wolves — similar to what's happening now with grizzlies — Congress took an unprecedented step.
Ornstein is among the Sunrise Movement organizers who plan three weeks of activism, including lobbying members of Congress to sign onto the Green New Deal.
SANDERS: Thank you all very much.
MARTIN: How are you preparing for the inevitability of it...
Sanders continues to say that he likes Biden and that defeating Trump is the most important thing this year. Sanders has pledged unequivocally to support his opponent if he himself loses the nomination, something he has done more vigorously and more often than he did in 2016. Despite disparaging the party, and though some of his supporters often get into vitriolic arguments, particularly online, Sanders is clear that he does not want to hand the election to Republicans.

In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States and ships them to foreign countries, he added. This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.
NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Ernest Moniz, president and CEO of Energy Futures Initiative, about the Green New Deal, and his goal of limiting global temperature increases to two degrees Celsius.
The EPA's policy, like those of other technical agencies within the government, is designed to encourage its scientists to participate in the scientific process. To that end, the agency's official policy is to encourage publication and presentation of research findings in peer-reviewed, professional, or scholarly journals and at professional meetings.

I took this as an indication that one of the most important goals of government-financed research is not so much to get answers as it is to consume the computer budget, which has left me ever since with a jaundiced view of government-financed research.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: NPR's Don Gonyea thank you so much.
The impacts of climate change aren't a far-off possibility for the Pacific shellfish industry. Acidifying seawater is already causing problems for oyster farms along the West Coast and it's only expected to get worse.
Koonin thinks Happer was doing what a scientist should, demanding better evidence. I think it sensitized him to the squishiness, if you will, of a lot of the environmental science, he says.
Since the 1980s, income inequality has been on the rise, says Lucas Chancel, co-director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics. In the U.S., for example, Chancel says the richest 1% owned about 40% of the nation's wealth in 2016 — up from 20% in the 1980s — and Trump's 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality, with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of American households.
The first Earth Day took place just over a year later in April of 1970. The Environmental Protection Agency was created in December of that year. Environmental laws passed or strengthened during this period included the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts.
At age 51, Gavin Newsom is 30 years younger than the outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown and totally different in style and temperament.

It's got to happen, happen sometime. Maybe this time I'll win 'cause everybody, oh, they love a winner, so nobody love me. Lady Peaceful...
Some wildlife groups and grizzly advocates question those numbers and the federal government's population counting methodology. Others believe the initial recovery goals were set too low.
We don't have a crystal ball, but as journalists covering global health and development, we have a pretty good nose for emerging trends (with some help from our favorite expert sources).
Newsom's penchant for taking risks may have its roots in his childhood. He was not a particularly good student and was eventually diagnosed with dyslexia. Figuring out how to compensate for that learning disability was a gift, he says.
Warnock said the coronavirus pandemic has brought those issues into sharper focus, and that he supports passing the $2,000 stimulus payments for qualifying Americans.
Four of the nine members of TVA's board of directors were appointed by Trump. Two other posts are currently unfilled. The board could vote on whether to close the plants at its quarterly business meeting Thursday in Chattanooga, or the agency could choose to delay the decision.
Pullen says even a few years ago he would've never imagined London in such difficulty, with Paris enjoying a business renaissance.
Additionally, Democrats are changing the rules regarding motions to vacate the chair, a procedural tool that could be used to force out a sitting House speaker. It is the procedural weapon that conservatives led by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., were planning to use to try to oust Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in 2015 before he made the decision to step down.
ROTT: So fuel mitigation projects, thinning operations to reduce vegetation in federal forests and prescribed fires. So prescribed fires are widely viewed as the best tool forest managers have to avoid the types of big, catastrophic wildfires that have, you know, become all too common each year. But because of the shutdown, those aren't happening on federal land right now.
When data is collected in India, it is not only about water and sanitation but also demographics, says Das of Water Integrity Network. The information can also be used to see if a lower caste doesn't have the same access to water and sanitation as high castes do.
By one measure, the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century. The most current estimate by the World Economic Forum — which publishes an annual report to track country-by-country progress across economic, educational, health and political dimensions — is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99.5 years at the current rate.

Top Democrats announced late Sunday a series of changes to House rules that could eliminate causes of major instability during the previous eight years of Republican rule in Congress.
Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will debate tonight, one-on-one for the first time. The debate comes as Biden racks up a lead in delegates, and there will be no audience due to coronavirus precautions.
Don't have a backyard? No problem. The Great Backyard Bird Count can be done anywhere, whether that's standing on a street outside an apartment, looking out a window at the office, or wandering around a park.

Trump recently mused in an interview on Sirius XM that had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the Civil War. The president was returning to one the most studied eras of American history: the Antebellum Period, the decades leading up to the Civil War. The causes of the conflict can be traced back to the beginnings of the country. It is poignant and instructive to read the accounts of people who lived in the 80 years before the calamity. Many knew that something was going grievously wrong, that the political system was beginning to seize up, caught in its own contradictions. Some desperately warned against disaster. Yet no one truly foresaw what history had in store for them.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Energy Secretary Rick Perry also took to Twitter to echo the president's message.

Bloomberg Promises $15 Million To Help Make Up For U.S. Withdrawal From Climate Deal
INSKEEP: Which allowed her staff a bit more space. So you're, like, effectively living in the suburbs to get a bigger house?
The letter calls for a number of steps that the coalition argues that Biden could take unilaterally, including an executive order upgrading public buildings, transportation and energy in a transition to a clean energy economy; an executive order that requires federal agencies to secure informed tribal consent from Indigenous nations; declaring a national climate emergency; and banning new fossil fuel projects on federal and tribal lands and waters, as well as in environmental justice communities.
NAUGHTON: Well, our number-one criteria is that you have a scientific or technical background. At this point, we are only supporting Democratic candidates, and although we want to see more Republicans take action on mitigating the effects of climate change, currently the difference in the two party platforms made us feel we had to pick a team.
KANDER: Yes, and - but a piece of history and something that you're writing are two different things. Once you write - start writing - you're not thinking extracurricularly - or at least for me. We're thinking about the moment in the theater. So if I went to see Cabaret and had not written it, I would have a reaction to it that would be somehow or other colored by being a Jew. But maybe it's some defect on my part. But I did not think about that when we were writing.

Change and accountability are, of course, the Holy Grail. Elsewhere, in Costa Rica, citizens measured the levels of herbicides and pesticides in their drinking water. While these groups are still awaiting recourse, documentation has helped them take their fight to the courts.

While previous administrations have restricted government scientists' communications to the public, controlling their scientific conclusions is far more rare.
Still, it fell short of what some parties had hoped for. Island nations — which face an existent threat from rising seawaters — had pushed hard for a target of 1.5 degrees Celsius. (Why not even lower? Well, as of 2015, the global average temperature had already risen by 1 degree Celsius, and even with robust efforts to cut emissions, some further increase is essentially inevitable.)
When a conflict arises, Sarmento is the person who responds, but he doesn't always get final say.
Specifically, its mandate is to help developing countries reduce their emissions — so as to prevent further climate change — and adapt to the effects of climate change already occurring as a result of worldwide emissions. This includes supporting projects to build sea walls on the island nation of Tuvalu, create an early warning network to alert farmers in Malawi to floods and other disasters, launch energy companies that will provide rural people in East Africa with solar power, and encourage investment in renewal energy companies in Argentina.
It's got to the point that there's so many spills that for animals there's a highly organized system in place, Barnes says.
MARTIN: So I understand that you called 314 Action an Emily's List for scientists, and for people who don't know, Emily's List is a group that's been around for - what? - a couple of decades now that raises money for promising democratic women candidates at all levels who favor abortion rights. Are there similar baseline positions that must be adhered to for your group to support these candidates?
These are common sights in India.
JONES: Oh, to get it - (laughter).
But given the big losses this week, the question for Sanders had been: What is he going to do? Now he may have put the ball back in Biden's court: If he's running away with the nomination, what is the front-runner going to do if he wants to bring Sanders along and unify the party more quickly?
One to 2 degrees Celsius sounds really small when you hear scientists talk about it, she says. But it's a big deal when it comes to the climate of the Earth. And it means really enormous changes for coastlines around the world.
1. Creating a committee to address climate change. The panel will not have subpoena power or the ability to introduce legislation so it will not be as powerful as a similar committee created by Pelosi during the previous Democratic majority from 2007 to 2011, but the issue is expected to be a major priority for the party's progressive wing.

Mayors, governors, and business leaders from both political parties are signing [on to] a statement of support that we will submit to the U.N., Bloomberg said, and together, we will reach the emission reduction goals the U.S. made in Paris in 2015.
The city of Paris does not exactly have a business-friendly reputation. Strikes, red tape and a rigid labor market have seen to that. But things are changing. France now has a young, pro-business president. And across the city there's a growing climate of capitalist optimism.

Humanitarian law isn't being upheld in some of the countries where we're working, says Scribner. And we don't see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did.
INSKEEP: As you know, Congresswoman, one reason that people who are politically conservative are skeptical of efforts to combat climate change is that it sounds to them like it requires massive government intervention, which they just don't like. Are you prepared to put on the table that, yes, actually, they're right, what this requires is massive government intervention?
He added: I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.
Given the strong numbers Biden put up with African American voters and white, non-college men in Michigan — much stronger than Hillary Clinton four years ago — he would perhaps not need Sanders' movement to overcome the small margins Trump won by in the Midwest.
MONTANARO: Right. There aren't a whole lot of specifics of how to get there, and it's certainly not something that Democratic leadership is going to want to try to put on the floor to try to put moderates in a potentially precarious position because, remember, Democrats did win the House on the backs of moderates because of a lot of those suburban districts that were held by Republicans previously.
This comes on the heels of a $1.6 billion fine from regulators — the largest in state history — and six felony convictions related to 2010 San Bruno explosion.

Unlike the firm's founder, James Simons, Mercer isn't named on the lists of the wealthiest Americans compiled by Forbes magazine and Bloomberg, and it's not clear how much money he actually has. But by all appearances, he is very wealthy indeed, living in a Long Island mansion known as Owl's Nest and owning a series of yachts.
SAGAL: Although the melting ice sculpture of the planet did hold its own in many fine points of debate. All right, last chance - if you get this, you win it. A local news reporter in California went viral when he knocked over the carving of the ice sculptor he was interviewing on live TV at the state fair. But there was another twist to the story. What was it - A, the reporter had faked the accident because he was bored of doing stupid human interest stories all the time; B, he was carried away by rage when he realized the ice sculpture was of his ex; or, C, the ice sculpture was his childhood enemy, and he had planned this vengeance for decades.
GROSS: Right. How frustrating is it for you when a song as beautiful as that doesn't make it to Broadway and doesn't have a life?
KANDER: It's a hard - hard thing to answer. We had been together for so long that it seemed - sometimes, things like somebody's death seems unlikely because for years and years or years, that person has been alive and part of your life. One of the main things I think that helped me out was that we had three shows which were incomplete. One was Scottsboro. One was The Visit and one was Curtains. And so for the next few years, finishing those shows felt like working with Fred so that it wasn't that kind of sudden break-off of a - of an artistic relationship.
Wara added, What California urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. And it's hard to see that going on.

It would also threaten the $100 billion a year pledged to help developing countries achieve emissions cuts, as Bloomberg has reported.
The Trump administration's new budget blueprint aims to quantify the president's nationalistic agenda in dollars and cents. The plan, released Thursday morning, calls for significant increases in military and border-security spending, along with corresponding cuts in many other parts of the government.
KANDER: He literally said, I think you two guys should meet each other. I think you'd like each other. And so since we always followed his advice, separately at the time, we did meet each other. We did like each other. And we started writing almost immediately. I don't know, we were just pregnant with song all the time, it seemed to me. And from then on, we've been one of those marriages in which you're pretty faithful to each other. Fred has done some material with someone else and I do an occasional movie score, as I am at the moment. But when it comes down to the hardcore of what we've written, we write together.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Just showing how widespread this is. Joe Biden has been building a lot of momentum, though, as well as a pretty solid delegate lead. Is this debate Bernie Sanders' last stand to stop Biden from running away with the nomination?
