However, the Clinton campaign also said early on it wouldn't unilaterally disarm, with conservative superPACs lined up against her. Clinton is also doing something Sanders is not. She has raised nearly $30 million for the Democratic Party and state party committees. That money will be used to help elect candidates further down on the ballot as well as the Democratic presidential nominee - whether that's Clinton or Sanders.
Still, there are many people who stand by the so-called abstinence route — recovery without the use of medications. Their views are informed by personal experiences and deeply held beliefs about what constitutes true recovery.
And Democrats have been using those initial numbers to score rhetorical points, even if they lack the votes in either the House or the Senate to stop the bill or change it.
President Trump is responding to another tough foreign policy crisis with gunboat diplomacy, but the second deployment is likely to look very different from the first.
DOUGLAS NICHOLLS: I'm Douglas Nicholls. I'm the mayor of City of Yuma. We have had a long history dealing with immigration. And we're in a better position now that we have a barrier that was constructed in 2006. I believe it's - would be effective in most places, although I'm not completely convinced it's for every installation. A physical barrier is a very kind of first-step deterrent. Immigration reform would be the primary (laughter) wish list item and then just more facilities, family shelters.
Tad Devine, a senior adviser to Sanders' campaign, was actually involved in the creation of superdelegates, as a way to get party officials more involved in selecting the Democratic nominee.
Democrats have made clear they will unanimously oppose the bill. Trumpcare is just a breathtakingly irresponsible piece of legislation that would endanger the health of tens of millions of Americans and break the bank for millions more, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
And before that, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that all options are on the table as the Trump administration calculates how to deal with the threats North Korea poses to its neighbors and, potentially, the United States.
Brazilian President Bolsonaro Withdraws From U.N. Compact On Migration
Internet memes are basically nonsensical inside jokes that spiral off through the Web. For example, you might have been sent a link to see a video of, say, Nancy Pelosi's cats. And right in the middle, the whole video might change to a 1987 video of Rick Astley singing Never Gonna Give You Up. That's the classic online prank known as Rickrolling –- tricking the user into watching something they didn't mean to see.
Bus service was canceled in Detroit on Tuesday, after many drivers refused to work out of concern for the coronavirus. Their complaints range from the capacity of buses to carry far more than the 10 people federal health experts currently recommend as a maximum for public gatherings to insufficient cleaning and sanitizing measures.
GOLDMAN: Oh, because tennis is a tradition-bound sport - and tradition says tennis is a one-on-one contest. And players should be able to figure things out and make decisions on their own without coaches helping. Twelve years ago, the women's tour did start allowing coaches to visit players on court once every set. But now, as you mention, this new rule change will allow for the small moments of coaching from the stands, hand signals, etc. And a lot of people say this is good. It'll make matches more interesting for fans to be able to watch the - you know, the subtle player-coach interactions. For traditionalists who don't like this, the great Billie Jean King, who supports the rule changes, says, you know, players don't have to listen to the coach. They're still in control and make their own decisions. So it won't be cataclysmic what happens out there.
From the moment a Carnegie Mellon researcher figured out that a colon and a parenthesis could make a face, the Internet has provided its own unique additions to popular culture. Lolcats, Rickrolling and Star Wars kid are just a few examples of an entirely new form of culture that came into its own over the past decade: the Internet meme.
BROWN: I think the race is about ideas. And I think Democrats understand that.
Local school officials and the mayor have assured residents that the newcomers won't be a burden or cost local taxpayers more, but many are still not convinced.
The remaining portion of the settlement is expected to be divvied up among other Flint residents who fell ill from the contaminated water or suffered property damage, Michigan Public Radio reports.
Frank, who died on Monday, created the radio drama series Work in Progress and was known for his intimate on-air monologues, sketches and interviews. Originally broadcast in 1989.
GREENGRASS: Well, I don't think I could imagine being in the Battle of Midway. But, you know, when I was a young man, when I was in my 20s, that was my job. I mean, I went to conflict zones, many of them - Middle East, Central America, apartheid South Africa, Philippines during the revolution, after - as Marcos fell. You know, that was what I did for the best part of 10 years.
A friend told Ramirez about a doctor in Baltimore who prescribed Suboxone, a brand of buprenorphine. He liked the way Suboxone made him feel, so he would often exceed the dosage, buying pills from other patients so he wouldn't run out. He stopped using other narcotics and, overall, he felt more functional. Still, after three years of seeing the doctor, he never felt like he'd achieved full recovery. I was still an addict, he says. It was just legal.
About J. Marshall Shepherd's TED Talk
For example, a couple of years ago, the Tax Justice Network worked with the Australian Taxation Office to challenge deals that multinational corporations had set up through Singapore. Oil and gas giant Chevron ended up with a $1 billion tax bill.
According to Alex Cobham, chief executive of the Tax Justice Network, many governments have repeatedly expressed a willingness to address this problem, and some have introduced measures as well.
KHALID: Brown is far less known than some of his colleagues in the Senate who've already declared their presidential ambitions. It's not clear how he would compensate for low name recognition. But he has something few other Democratic candidates have - Midwest credibility.

But while cutting funding for Planned Parenthood is overwhelmingly popular in the House, there are a handful of GOP senators, including Collins and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who have said they are likely to oppose a bill carrying this provision.
Switzer finished anyway, and came back eight more times. In her later races, no subterfuge was necessary. And in 2017 Switzer, now 70, was cheered, not met with rage.
And I chose a number of characters who had to respond to that, one of whom was the then-Norwegian prime minister, now secretary general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg. Another was the lawyer who represented - who became the state-appointed lawyer for Breivik and had to ensure that he had a fair trial as best he could - and then, obviously, the principal character, the family who were caught up in it, the young man who had been grievously wounded by him. And it was about their journeys to face him down. That was what the film was about. And what did that look like and feel like?
How Scientists Trace New Coronavirus Variants
For some, it's because Amazon is familiar. Robbie Stout of Ritual Chocolate in Utah uses Amazon to buy parts for his factory. Bebe Goodrich of Icebox Coffee in Alabama said Amazon is a tremendous part of her life as an entrepreneur and mom of two kids. And Hubschman says, I have a box with that little smiley face on my door four times a week. I love Amazon.
KELLY: What's her reaction to that song when you play it for her?
Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. Hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the GOP's tax cuts. Should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, American manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. Such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books, Hatch said in a weekend statement.
JONES: Well, you know, I can't speak for other voters. I think people that know Joe for a long time are looking at his record. They're not looking at things like that, especially when we've got folks in the White House, in the administration today, who have no compunction whatsoever about saying things that are either blown out of proportion, hyper hyped or either just outright false. So I think...
We really ought to be grateful as hell that we're in this industry he picks back up after a beat. Our problems are good problems. Our jobs aren't threatened, at least not yet.

SPRIGMAN: The comedic community can start bad-mouthing that person, and then, if that doesn't work, shunning them and refusing to work on a bill with them.
This settlement amounts to a slap on the wrist and is an insult to the 346 victims who died as a result of corporate greed, DeFazio added. I hope the DOJ can explain its rationale for this weak settlement to the families, because from where I sit this attempt to change corporate behavior is pathetic and will do little to deter criminal behavior going forward.

Nuclear weapons are very good for self-defense, and for preserving the existing status quo, argues Texas A&M University political scientist Matt Fuhrmann. But he says they're not especially useful for forcing changes to the status quo, as in using nuclear threats to blackmail your adversaries.
The fate of McConnell's initial proposed rules represented a very rare defeat at the hands of his own allies and underscored the desire, at least by Collins and a few others, for the Senate not to appear as a partisan rubber stamp.
One-third of globally reported cases are in the European region, the WHO's Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge said, reiterating his agency's recent acknowledgement that the COVID-19 pandemic's epicenter lies not in China, where this coronavirus was discovered in December, but in Europe.
But that was the moment, truly, when I - because I remember I walked into the office and said, I'm going to make - I had thought about making what it finally became, which was really about - the air traffic control system is really what that film's about, which - 93 is one part of it. And it's really, ultimately, about the incredibly beautiful but highly vulnerable latticework that is a modern democracy and how easy it is to break it and what that looks and feels like, you know, what that's got to tell us. That was when I walked in and said, I'm going to make that film. And I did it. That must've been - that was July. And we were shooting it by October, November. I wrote it very quickly - in a couple of weeks, really.
That brought a strong rebuke from the powerful AARP, which was an outspoken ACA supporter. Although no one believes the current health care system is perfect, this harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable, said a statement from the group.
A new Pew Research Center poll, published in the report, suggests that Germans believe Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping handle world affairs better than Trump does.
Turns out, it is against Vermont law for a town to elect its own dogcatcher. After our story aired, someone from Duxbury got in touch with the Vermont League of Cities and Towns. A lawyer there pointed out the bad news: dogcatcher is not an official elected position in the state. For now, dogcatchers can only be appointed.
There's also no telling how North Korea's youthful strongman, Kim Jong Un, might respond to a serious military crisis, or how brittle his regime might prove. If Kim and his top aides were killed in a U.S. attempt to decapitate North Korea before it could order a ballistic attack, that might cause the whole government to collapse.

More than 2,500 people have died of COVID-19 in Italy, the heart of the outbreak in Europe, the country's health ministry announced Tuesday afternoon. Italy is now reporting 31,506 total cases, including nearly 13,000 people who are hospitalized.
It was based on a graphic novel which was like sort of Cold War noir, very like The Third Man dark noir. ... As I opened up the script and as I read about Berlin and the city — and having done six movies there — I thought about: This is nothing like '60s noir; this is '89 Berlin. There's rock 'n' roll; there's graffiti. If you were a spy there, you'd be living in this crazy underworld of clubs. And then music started to jump off the page at me that I wanted to infuse into the movie.
CASTRO: That's right. I hope that he doesn't mean military action. In fact, I'm on the foreign affairs committee. We just had Elliott Abrams, who's a special representative for Venezuela, testify about a week-and-a-half ago. And he didn't give any indication that military action was imminent. That said, I think we've got to get with the Lima Group, with OAS, with the United Nations to make sure that that aid gets in and that elections are held as soon as possible.
And that's certainly a pressing issue. Even though the number of people living in extreme poverty (under $1.90 a day) has declined dramatically over the past few decades from 2 billion in 1990 to 705 million in 2015, the World Bank has warned that progress is slowing. What's more worrying, according to Oxfam, is that while the fortunes of billionaires grew by 12 percent last year according to Forbes (or about $2.5 billion a day), 3.4 billion people who were living on less than $5.50 a day saw their wealth shrink by 11 percent.

Her character in I Feel Pretty, Renee Bennett, stares forlornly into the mirror and attempts to compensate for not looking like a fashion model - the kind of women who walk around in micro-miniskirts at the corporate office in which she wants to work, an Estee Lauder-like makeup company overseen by Michelle Williams' blonde and beauteous Avery LeClaire. Renee rewatches the movie Big, in which a kid who longs to be a grown-up is magically transformed. And then she goes and wishes at a fountain to be, quote, undeniably pretty. It doesn't happen then. But the next day, she goes flying off the bike in spin class, bangs her head and thinks her wish came true. Believing she's a guy magnet, Renee banters at her dry cleaners with an unassuming bearded man played by Rory Scovel.
New Hampshire Republicans have a track record of picking presidential candidates who often go on to win their party's nomination. Usually, that means bolstering establishment candidates. But this year, billionaire Donald Trump is polling far ahead of the rest of the pack. That leaves his rivals fighting amongst themselves in the hope that one of them can take down Trump in the state that holds the first primary.

He worries it could lead to missed opportunities for people like Charles Testerman, who came to Lidz's group home after several months in drug treatment. Testerman describes his years of drug use as doing everything to excess. He drank, smoked marijuana, and got hooked on prescription painkillers and later heroin. When he couldn't afford heroin, he bought Suboxone on the street, hoping it would help him stop using other drugs. It didn't work.
Ex-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has been charged in the Flint water crisis. NPR's Rachel Martin talks to Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who nearly seven years ago, noticed something was wrong.

When you say, ok, well, why did you spend all this money to save this theater — yes, you're saving the theater, and maybe you're saving the 500 jobs that the theater provides for the local community, but you're also then saving the restaurants that people go to the night of the show, he says. You're saving the hotels that the visiting artists stay at. You're saving, you know, the the parking facility. And it may sound like very little, but when you when you start to multiply that by the numbers of businesses like this that exist around the country, you can see why investing in in the arts really makes economic sense.

The Congressional Budget Office's initial estimate that the bill could lead to 24 million more Americans without health insurance within a decade spooked many Senate lawmakers. You can't sugarcoat it, Cassidy told Fox News when explaining that it's an awful score.

The rebels were always doomed in the city, but the governor of New York, William Tryon, and New York City Mayor David Mathews, both Tories, didn't want to take any chances. Tryon hatched a plot to either kidnap or assassinate (the goal, Meltzer and Mensch acknowledge, was vague) Washington, thereby demoralizing the already disheartened Americans. It was, the authors, write, a clandestine plan to strike a knife into the heart of the rebellion.

JONES: Look, I think that Senator Sanders has a great number of supporters that are raising issues about poverty, about health care. But the way that they want to do things with Medicare for All I just don't think is a viable option. And I'm not sure how Senator Sanders right now will try to bring people around to accomplish what we all want to accomplish, and that is health care for everyone in one form or another. That's just one issue. I think his issues on climate change are farther than they need to be at this point because we've got to make sure we do things to keep people employed and we do it smart. But my concern is whether or not there will be an ability to pull people together to try to get things accomplished as opposed to it's got to be this way or that way.

He's the first president to never crack 50 [percent approval] in his first two years, said Bruce Mehlman, a Republican strategist and attorney who worked as an assistant secretary in the Commerce Department for technology policy. The resistance is really energized, and that's part of why you saw the highest midterm turnout since 1914 last November. The economy has been really strong, but it's showing some worrisome signs. Mr. Mueller's report and/or Democratic oversight will likely make the waters choppier. And voters want change.

JONES: You know, look, I disagree with Senator Sanders on many, many things. I think he's got to kind of try to pull people together. You know, one of the things that I'm looking for is whether or not that he can pull and make sure that all voices in the Democratic Party are heard. Right now, I'm having a hard time seeing that with Senator Sanders. But that's not to say he can't do it. We have got such a long way to go. I still believe this race is far from over. Instead of playing a speculation game, I think we need to let this matter play out. I think we need to let all the elections.

If there's one thing that doesn't quite succeed, it's Meltzer and Mensch's prose, which at times tends toward the breathless. Writing about Tryon, for example, the authors declare, He has money. He knows the city as well as anyone. He has friends in high places ... and low places. And on the Declaration of Independence, they write, In a few days, the Congress will vote whether to ratify this document — and potentially change the war ... and the world ... forever. These kind of sentences, which always come at the end of their chapters, sound like a narrator of a television series dramatically teasing the next segment of the show right before a commercial break.

The denunciation of socialism and the attempt to tie the philosophy to Democrats is Trump's and his campaign's attempt to invert the argument that he is an extremist. The president's sluggish approval rating means he is going to have to try and pull Democrats down with him — and given that surveys also show he would lose at this point to a generic Democrat, Trump also needs to show their candidates to be unelectable and out of step with the rest of America.

Every target that's being reviewed, every effort that's being made, will always be conducted inside the international laws of war, Pompeo said.
Then Amit called with some pressing news. He moved apartments and his new landlord didn't want pets. Shawareb had to go. I begged for more time.
CASTRO: That's right. We have Justin Amash of Michigan. And our appeal has been very bipartisan. We've made it an issue about the fact that the president is trying to usurp the power of Congress. The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. And the president asked Mexico to pay for this wall; they wouldn't. Congress wouldn't pay for the wall. And now he's trying to unilaterally take the money, billions of it, from military construction funds. And so in communities like mine of San Antonio, which is Military City, USA, that's a big problem. But you asked the question about the Senate. I think that we can get three more votes that we need to pass it in the Senate and then send it to the president's desk. Obviously, that's going to take a lot of work.
As our new neighbors were fleeing for their lives, coming to a new home a half a world away to rebuild those lives, they needed to understand that they were welcome, he said.

But, you know, it's hard to be a gatherer of material when you find yourself periodically tuning out to what's going on, when you lose track of the conversation, when you suddenly find yourself on Dream Street. You don't have the faintest notion of what anybody is saying - of what's being discussed. You're thousands of miles away. It's like the other people there are on television. They're characters in a sitcom with the volume turned off. And you can see them gesturing and talking and laughing, but you can't hear anything. And you're thinking of nothing. Your mind is in brownout.

But using nuclear threats to extract concessions from the U.S., such as security guarantees or the sanctions relief Pyongyang seeks, would be far more difficult. This is because actually using the nukes would all but ensure the regime's extinction, Fuhrmann says, even if they continue to build their arsenal.
One reason is the limited availability of the treatment. But it's also the case that stigma around the addiction drugs has inhibited their use.

It's a fascinating story, and Meltzer and Mensch do an excellent job explaining it.

And it runs through part of downtown and on the west side of our city - hasn't been so much a stop for illegal immigration as it's been for, basically, criminal activity, where we used to have folks from Mexico coming over and stealing vehicles.

This apology tour, as you call it, on the first day of spring training two days ago - you know, it just made a lot of people angrier. The players and officials did say sorry. But they really didn't seem to have their heart in it. For the most part, players didn't talk details of what they did, why they did it, why they didn't do anything to stop it, even though they knew it was wrong. And there was no real acknowledgement of the other teams and players they hurt by doing this.

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Many years ago, when FRESH AIR was a three-hour local show with plenty of time to fill, Terry was always happy when some new material was available from Joe Frank, a masterful storyteller whose syndicated radio show Work In Progress was a one-of-a-kind production that defies easy description. Frank died Monday in Beverly Hills at the age of 79. Frank's shows combined interviews, personal monologues, dramas with radio actors - even tapes Frank had surreptitiously recorded of friends, family and strangers.

On the other hand, Christensen says, innovative types of businesses can solve social problems while creating local and global jobs — like a chain of one-stop-shop privately run diabetes clinics in Mexico that are much cheaper than the public option for treatment.

I recently hunched over my desk lunch and typed: How to get a cat from Israel to Pakistan.
After last year's attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket, an Israeli journalist secretly filmed himself walking through some of Paris' rougher immigrant and Muslim neighborhoods while wearing a kippah. Broadcast on French TV, the clip shows him drawing some unsavory comments. One group of young men wearing hoodies can be heard comparing him to a dog.
Then I moved to Ramallah. It's a fun place, with hipster bars and country outings, but I had few friends. I was lonely. My old childhood yearning for a friendly cat welled up inside. My roommate lost interest in the kitten and soon I was letting him sit on my desk as I wrote. I took two or three antihistamines a day to breathe. He slept curled into a ball near my shoulder. I took more pills. I took to calling him Shawareb for his funny kitten mustache.

She called a press conference in September of 2015 and warned residents, especially kids, to stop drinking the water. More than five years later, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha is now the director of Flint's pediatric public health initiative, and she joins us this morning. Thanks for being here.

GOP lawmakers also have objections to the scope of the paid family leave benefits. Eligible workers, including people who would not be paid if they miss a day of work, would receive the benefit if they have to miss 14 or more days in a month because of the virus.

You know, America still hasn't reckoned with the ongoing racism and racial injustice resulting from slavery, and we haven't fully recovered from the divisions of the Civil War. I mean, one of the images of the insurrection is a man inside the Capitol building holding a very large Confederate flag on a long pole.

So you know, you talked about how you wanted to make a movie with a happy ending, which you don't typically do, but you did with your new movie, News Of The World.

LaVoy was killed, I can't turn my back on that, said militant David Fry. Everybody's on alert for obvious reasons.
It also wasn't a particularly good one. Despite recruiting some of Washington's Life Guards — soldiers who were responsible for personally protecting the general — it was foiled thanks to its participants' inability to keep a secret. Two of the guards, jailed for possessing counterfeit money, spilled the plot to a cellmate, who had been arrested in a separate counterfeiting scheme. And an iron mill foreman, sent by his boss to track down some AWOL workers who were also in on the conspiracy, uncovered more details about the plan after pretending to be a British loyalist.

The fact that their sales have not been great affects every single product that is in Whole Foods, and their reputation affects everything that is on the shelf, says the Colorado businesswoman, who has been selling to Whole Foods since 2005.
O'Brien agrees that it would take an enormous amount of political will among the world's leaders. But he is optimistic about the odds. Major agencies like the International Monetary Fund are discussing the need for it, whereas less than 10 years ago, he was told at the World Economic Forum that it would never even become the subject of public conversation.
Then during my visit to Washington last June, I began thinking: Could I find a way to move Shawareb to Islamabad?
Janosky said those voters could easily defeat Trump — if they could just settle on one candidate they could all support.
Pyongyang has said it has no intention of handing President Trump any victories on denuclearization, but officials see Trump's eagerness to tout achievements to his domestic audience as a source of leverage.

However, the deal taking shape would include free coverage for coronavirus testing, extended unemployment insurance, paid sick leave and expanded food assistance as the pandemic takes a larger toll on the U.S. and global economies.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, HOLD OUT YOUR HAND)
Now the bill — and the multitude of questions surrounding it — moves across the Capitol to the Senate. And the job doesn't get any easier. With only a two-vote Republican majority and likely no Democratic support, it would take only three GOP no votes to sink the bill.
MAYEDA: Well, we talked to a company that makes weather stations. So these are stations that people set up in their backyard. And this company is trying to decide how it can get around these tariffs. They can't just move their supply chain around Asia. This CEO that we talked to is actually considering potentially moving production to Mexico. So that's the exact opposite thing that President Trump wants.
GOLDMAN: Yeah, because pitchers have been talking about that. You know, I don't think he was anticipating what he's going to get tomorrow, but - because things certainly have turned since Thursday. He's heard the weak apologies. He's heard Houston owner Jim Crane dig himself a hole with this comment that he didn't think the sign-stealing had an impact and then, a minute later, saying, he didn't say that. Now, Manfred will be asked about all this, whether he'll consider imposing any sanctions on Houston players who he absolved in last month's report on the scandal. And yes. What will he say to convince fans they can trust what they're seeing on ball fields? And what will he say about this threat of opposing pitchers seeking retribution? - tough word there - retribution...

The sweeping family leave benefits would extend for one year after the date the bill becomes law — meaning it would expire in the early months of the next presidential term. Whoever wins the 2020 election would be responsible for allowing the benefit to lapse or finding a way to extend it.
Adhering to daylight saving time is a federal mandate, but states can opt out as long as they pass legislation and receive federal approval, according to the Transportation Department.

Another study, published in 2007 in the journal Current Biology, followed the sleep of 50 subjects for eight weeks across clock changes. It found that though human circadian rhythms — which control sleep patterns — generally adapt to the fall back change, they struggle to adjust to the spring ahead.
But it's also, you know, just a thing. Because murders? There are a LOT of them. And very quickly this completely unexplained phenomenon becomes a simple fact of daily existence. Die of natural causes, you're done. Lights out and goodbye. But if you're murdered? 999 times out of 1,000, you vanish with a pop and show up back at home in your birthday suit, reset to a few hours before your untimely demise.

Unlike many states, Ohio's governor and secretary of state don't have the power to delay the election on their own. Instead, with the approval of both political parties, they supported a lawsuit filed by people who believe they're vulnerable to the virus and did not plan to contest the suit.
And that means, he argued, that the Senate must bring in former national security adviser John Bolton, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and others who Schiff said would shed more light on the underlying events of the Ukraine affair.
In a joint statement, DeWine and LaRose said Monday that the public health warnings to limit gatherings means it simply isn't possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans.
Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown hasn't decided to run for president yet. He's on a tour of early primary states, like New Hampshire, testing out a message focused on the working class.
There have been some concerns about quality. In Britain's Guardian newspaper, some readers complained in 2019 about soles and stitching coming off, and suggested the problems were the result of offshoring manufacturing to China. But Permira insists quality standards have not changed since the original owner, R. Griggs Group, moved production of the boot from England to China more than a decade and a half ago.

In fact, little about Amazon is local, save for the boxes arriving at your door. Their mission is to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online. Whole Foods, on the other hand, built a regional purchasing model that gave stores considerable autonomy in finding local products. At least, that was the case until early 2016, when Whole Foods shifted all its nonperishable buying to its Austin, Texas, headquarters.
But Clinton has also raised money in a more traditional way than Sanders — with a mix of small online donations and big-dollar fundraisers in the homes of the rich and famous. She also has a superPAC backing her. Even so, Clinton has, since the very first day of her campaign, criticized the system.

So I'm lucky. As are the 17 people lined up before me when the center opens at 10 a.m. — opens being a relative term, since we're still lined up outside on this brisk January morning. Until your appointment time is just a couple of minutes away, you stay outside.
A couple of people could not have made this killer plane, said Stumo. It took large organizational conduct.
All the same, and notwithstanding calls within Iraq for American forces to leave and vows by Iran for revenge, Trump and administration leaders made clear they're standing by their decision to kill Soleimani.
JULIAN CASTRO: And I'm proud to call myself a son of San Antonio.
The Congressional Budget Office initially estimated that the House bill would mean the loss of coverage for 24 million people. Many analysts say this number is now likely higher. TAX CREDITS: Some GOP senators are already on record opposing the bill's age-based tax credits, charging that they will make coverage unaffordable for older constituents. Others, however, describe these credits as Obamacare Lite.
Why Whole Foods' Small Suppliers Think Amazon Will Be Good For Them

It was the final state without any reports of infection by the highly contagious coronavirus, but on Tuesday evening Gov. Jim Justice announced officials have confirmed the state's first case.
It centralizes, in the positive sense of the word, all of the leverage of the United States government. Remember, you have arts pockets throughout the Department of State, Department of Defense. Even Transportation and Agriculture has a taste of that, of arts programs that they help support.

But I'm beginning to find this approach too parasitic and not that personally satisfying. So I'm going to go out and begin to live as a normal human being or maybe an abnormal human being in order to gather my own material and sort of create experiences for my radio program out of my own life as opposed to drawing from other people's lives.
Instagram Account Hit With Shame Campaign After It Steals Jokes
GOLDMAN: I know. It doesn't seem that way. That's the consensus right now. You know, this was intended to mollify the baseball world, including those fans and opposing players, which is still very angry about Houston's illegal scheme to steal the signs of opposing catchers using trashcan bangs just like you and me, Scott. This scheme was in full bloom during the Astros championship winning season in 2017.
HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And Sprigman says that's what's happening on Instagram right now. In the weeks since the first tweet calling out [expletive]jerry, the account has lost some 300,000 followers. And Comedy Central announced it would no longer advertise with them.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Arthur) It's absurd.
Understand that all the rhetoric that's being generated about this is being generated by the lobbyists on K Street and the politicians who are fundamentally opposed to what the president wants to do on behalf of the American worker and on behalf of the country, Navarro said. This is a very well-informed decision.
Republicans were frustrated and taken by surprise by the timing of the president's announcement last week that steel and aluminum tariffs were imminent. Republicans generally support a more targeted approach to pushing back on cheap foreign imports — a message they delivered directly to Trump in several recent meetings. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, one of the top Republicans in the Senate, was among those who were caught off guard last week when Trump made the announcement.
Trump also sought to square what he calls his careerlong opposition to American operations in the Middle East with his current orders to deepen the U.S. military presence in the region — and his threats to sanction Iraq if it tries to eject American forces.

But because Each Peach partners with individual farmers rather than larger suppliers, it can't order more product at the drop of a hat.

There - we have no ICE family shelter here in Arizona, so those individuals need to be moved to Texas. So we need those kind of facilities here. And then immigration judges are on my wish list. If we had immigration judges that were available at the border, processing could happen quicker. And we could relieve some of the flow that's coming through.
Such easy access to the cameras could have a chilling effect on civil liberties, Schwartz says. There are people who — if they are invited to go to a demonstration and they see one of these blue cameras is up — they might decide they don't want to show up.

While suppliers remain optimistic, more information is still needed before the crystal ball of kombucha and asparagus water clears. The deal will be subject to regulatory approval before it is finalized, and neither Amazon nor Whole Foods has said what will change once the two companies are married.
So I put together a song list and I put together a series of images that were really sort of based in, like, the street art and the graffiti movement and punk rock. And I said, I want to take this sort of stuffy noir and make it a punk rock spy thriller. And I think that's what sold her.
Michael Stumo, whose 24-year-old daughter Samya Rose Stumo died in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, also sharply criticizes the deferred prosecution agreement.
JOYCE: In effect, Larsen says, what happens over the next few years has already been set in motion. The picture beyond 2020, though, gets cloudy. By then, whatever the Trump administration does to dismantle climate regulations would have kicked in. Economist Marc Hafstead says that if the economy grows faster as well, the downward emissions trend could stall by 2025.
As long as we continue to have the immigration court within the Justice Department, we continue to have the problems that we have seen plague the court - the backlog, the compromise to the integrity of the court through the quotas that have been placed on the judges, the lack of adequate funding for interpreters or support staff, hiring a hundred judges and not having enough courtrooms or support staff for it. So we think it's really important to focus on fixing the court.

So yes, The Dispatcher is thin. A quick romp to a strange zip code. The audiobook-first timing means that, as a book-book, it reads a little bit like a play — first-person, light on the scene-setting and long on dialog — but seeing Scalzi work under these restrictions is kinda fun. The voice doesn't sound like exactly what you expect if you're a fan, but the brain running the show is obviously the same. And while the bench of characters is shallow and the main story feels a little bit rushed (because, you know, novella), it's the odd detours that make the book worthwhile. It's imagining a world where murder can be life-saving, where certain kinds of death get you a pass from the reaper, and how a little thing like that might change ... everything.

The White House is also highlighting success stories. At the National Prescription Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit held in Atlanta in March, Obama appeared on stage with Crystal Oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from Ohio. Oertle spoke of her spiral into addiction, which began with prescription painkillers and progressed to heroin. She tried unsuccessfully to quit on her own several times, before being prescribed buprenorphine a year ago. I personally couldn't get through the withdrawal symptoms, Oertle said in Atlanta. I couldn't tough it out. I know some people can. I couldn't do it. This last time has been the most successful recovery for me.

And the bottom line is that's not going to change until they change our immigration policies in Washington. And that's the responsibility of both sides of the aisle. And they haven't had the fortitude to deal with it for over 30 years.
GROSS: What was your eureka moment when you decided to make the movie about - United 93 - Flight 93 on 9/11, where the passengers fought back against the hijackers. But everybody on that plane died as a result because the plane crashed in Pennsylvania. I'm going to be really honest with you. I made a decision not to see that movie because, I thought, I know how the story turns out. I've read about it. I don't want to experience the horror of being on that plane. I'm going to spare myself from that. So what was your eureka moment in thinking, like, I want to reenact that in a movie?
BIANCULLI: David Edelstein is film critic for New York Magazine. On Monday's show, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Gregory Pardlo. His new memoir is called Air Traffic: A Memoir Of Ambition And Manhood In America. Some of the things that figure into his story - his father losing his job when Reagan broke the Air Traffic Controllers Union, joining the Marine Reserves and then wanting out, and being on a reality TV show with his family.

Kreiner said he could fly my cat from Israel to a third country. They would change his papers and then fly him to Pakistan. I dutifully paid $350 to start the process.
SHARON PEACOCK: Thank you very much.
And in the end, they find a way. And that's, you know, what I wanted. I wanted to make a film I could show my kids, you know, a family film. I've never made a family film. I wanted to do a Western and I wanted to do a family film. But I wanted to have the world as I see it in it. But I wanted it to have a happy ending. That's actually, honestly, the truth of it. I wanted to make a film with a happy ending.
MARTIN: Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha - she's a pediatrician, the one who first called attention to the water crisis in Flint, Mich., all those years ago. She's the author of the book What The Eyes Don't See: A Story Of Crisis, Resistance, And Hope In An American City.
The intent of the branding was to parody the famous Clinton Hit List, this was a tongue–in–cheek attempt at parody which I thought would encourage resharing, Thayer said. The branding began to detract from the campaign's purpose, so it wasn't a hard decision to make the change once it was clear it wasn't working.
MAYEDA: Yes, that's right, yeah. That would not be a good scenario, and I would expect stocks to sell off quite sharply from that.

CARLILE: He did, yeah. He called me for days and days afterwards begging for my forgiveness and said that he just struggled with it for so long that he just ran out of time and that he thought he was going to do it right up until the time but that he just couldn't. And it took me a long time to forgive him. And it threatened my faith and my self-worth. So I was like, well, if I'm asking other people to do it, I'm going to do it (laughter). So I did it, and it feels weird, and it feels weird right now.
The assassination never happened, of course, and one of Washington's guards, Thomas Hickey, ended up being hanged for his role in the conspiracy. It left a legacy of a different kind, however; as Meltzer and Mensch write:
We have tons of experience with patients who remain in treatment for months and years, who do very well on relapse-prevention medicines, says Dr. Marc Fishman, medical director at Maryland Treatment Centers in Baltimore. He says among his patients, primarily young people, about half remain with the program six months into treatment. Studies have shown far worse outcomes for patients who detox without follow-up medications, with relapse rates topping 90 percent.

I got in touch with an old friend, Amit. He lived on a communal farm known as a kibbutz on the Israel-Lebanon border. He promised to care for Shawareb until I could take him.
GREENGRASS: I honestly don't know. I enormously enjoyed making this film. It was a dream come true, actually, honestly and truly. You know, to make a Western, you know, you stand out in the desert. You know, you can feel, when you look out in the distance, the ghost of Papa Ford out there somewhere. You know what I mean? And you know you're going to scramble inadequately upon the shoulders of the giant and try and take a shot at a Western. You know, it was a wonderful, wonderful experience. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do next. It'll pretty interesting to see. As I say, I'm already asking myself the question, you know, what is the question? And I think the question is, I heard somebody on television as that event was going on last week in D.C., say he was a very thoughtful person, some political commentator. He said the question is, is this the end of something or the beginning of something? And I thought, yep, that's absolutely right. That's going to be the question, I think, that will govern probably the next two or three years of our lives.
JONES: Always a pleasure, David. Thanks so much for having me.

I want to remind the people of Flint that justice delayed is not always justice denied and a fearless and dedicated team of career prosecutors and investigators are hard at work to ensure those who harmed you are held accountable, Nessel said in a statement at the time.
We turn now to Alabama, one of the 14 states that will host its primary contest today. Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders by more than 55 points in that state back in 2016. That suggests that it is Joe Biden's to lose. David Greene talked with Alabama's Democratic senator, Doug Jones, who has endorsed the former vice president.
GROSS: A central part of the plot is that the man who he sees hanging from a tree at the beginning of the movie, he was transporting a 10-year-old girl to her aunt and uncle. The girl had been kidnapped six years earlier, kidnapped and raised by Kiowa Indians after they killed her parents. And now her Kiowa family has been killed by white people, so she has been twice orphaned. And the Black man who we see hanging from a tree, he was tasked with taking her to her only remaining white family and aunt and uncle. So now with that man dead, she has nothing and no means of getting anywhere on her own.
ESEQUIEL SALAS: I'm Mayor Esequiel Salas for the village of Columbus, N.M. There are many crises. But I don't see it as a crisis as it has been described. The crisis is further south in Honduras, Guatemala because of their economy, because of countries interfering with their country, upsetting their political systems in order to benefit from them. It causes chaos. It causes gang wars. And some of these people are fleeing - of course, all that violence. And they're coming up here. And we're just getting the waves of the whole thing. And it won't be resolved by putting up a wall. I'll tell you that.

And it's strange because it's Scalzi walking around in a sub-genre that's not his usual neighborhood. He does space opera, mostly. Military spec-fic. Dabbles in the near-future. But The Dispatcher is, for lack of a more artful term, hard urban fantasy (hurfancy?) and, just to tweak it a little further, it's got secondary sub-sub-genre genes as well, with the outward characteristics (rain, crisp dialog, a missing person, cop-and-consultant dialectics) of a gumshoe detective story.

It's likely that most callers are actually polite. If a few people contacting superdelegates are being obscene they'll of course drown out reasonable voices and harden opinions. However, it's useful to look at what's causing some of the anger and outrage we're seeing. Voters know they are being disenfranchised by superdelegate influence and these privileged voters are a reasonable target for frustration. And, let's be honest, if superdelegates aren't prepared to deal with the public, they shouldn't be party officials.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, throughout our modern history, has always played a leadership role on issues of the moment, Durbin said. It really was the focal point of a national conversation on issues of justice. It unfortunately, in the last few years abandoned that role.

That to me just looks like heroin, Lidz says.

Exactly how much is not currently public, though. The conservative group Judicial Watch, which has been tracking the cost of presidential travel for several years, estimates that President Trump's frequent visits to his Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago probably cost the government around $1 million each.
GREENGRASS: Well, you have to go back to my roots, as - you know, in Britain, there wasn't - there isn't - wasn't then, anyway, certainly, a film industry. There was the television industry. That's where you went if you - you know, to work and cut your teeth and pay your dues and learn your craft. And what I was at a very young age was sent out into the world - you were sent out into the world with a crew, and you had to bring back a story from the world in action. And that meant going to places where, if it wasn't armed conflict, it was political conflict. And so that, I suppose, verite sense, that documentary eye, that instinct to capture images rather than to create them, you know, in a sort of curated way - which is really what drama shooting is - has never left me. That's my instinct.

It sounds like the plot of a mildly implausible historical thriller, but it actually happened and it's one of the more remarkable stories to come out of the American Revolution, even if it's not one you learned in history class.

At the end of the day, politics and elections are typically binary choices, said Andy Surabian, who worked in the 2016 Trump campaign war room, was political director for Tea Party Express and is now a political adviser to Donald Trump Jr. The biggest gift to Trump is for Democrats to nominate what I call a 'kneeler,' someone who supports kneeling for the national anthem.

But it's going to be a generational struggle, this - just as it is against, you know, violent Islamist extremism. And it's part of the morbid symptoms of the failure of centrist politics.

I want to get back to Anders Breivik because you did a dramatized version of him in your film 22 July.

In practical terms, however, Trump and his aides may be able to do less than they did in Syria. In that case, Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from two Navy destroyers destroyed Syrian warplanes, air defense systems, fuel and other supplies. But nothing similar is likely from the Carl Vinson or its escorts — in fact, if any shots are fired it could be the start of a serious major conflict.

Why? You see it again and again, actually. I've seen it - I mean, all terrorist attacks, acts of political violence, are different, of course. But there are some common themes you see. One of the most common I have seen is that when these events happen, there is a deep desire on the part of those of us who survive, those of us who are bystanders, to want - after a necessary period of shock and mourning, we want to get on with our lives. We want normality to return.
HANNA-ATTISHA: Oh, I remember the exact moment. It was the summer of 2015. I was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. And she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that, Mona, the water isn't being treated properly in Flint. And because of that, there's probably lead in the water. And that's the moment that my life changed. When I heard the word lead, it was a call to action. I respect the science of what lead does. I understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. And I also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. It's the last thing our kids in Flint needed. That's the moment I stopped sleeping. I stopped eating. I lost about 30 pounds. And I began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.

SIMON: Will it be that the Astros went on? Is it enough for the fans or other players whose careers they might have harmed?
MAYEDA: If you actually look at the big-picture forecasts of the impact - for example, the IMF says that if we have a worst-case trade scenario, the global economy is going to be less than 1 percent smaller than what it otherwise would've been. That is not catastrophic. I think what people are concerned about is that there's some type of confidence shock. That is to say that, you know, businesses start investing less. Consumers start spending less. And it gets into this negative feedback loop where reducing confidence leads to slower growth.
North Korea says that it would respond to any military action by ordering a full retaliation, putting millions of lives in immediate danger.

Several of the recent terrorist attacks in France have specifically targeted Jews.

HANNA-ATTISHA: Yeah, and that has been my work since day one. From the moment of recognizing kind of this widespread lead contamination, this population-level trauma and this broken trust, our work has been in a very holistic way to mitigate the impact of the crisis and bring forth healing and recovery. You can think of what happened in Flint as a case of science denial and our science helps speak truth to power. And we're leaning on that incredible science of child development and what kids and families need to bring forth healing and recovery. So what that looks like right now are these long-term interventions to support Flint families, like child care, like Medicaid expansion, like literacy support, like nutrition access - all of these critical ingredients to keep families healthy, including things like behavioral health services and trauma-informed care. Because what Flint was, by and large, was this population-level trauma. And people to this day are stressed and angry, and they feel guilt and they feel betrayed by the folks that were out there to protect them.

And then, you know, serendipity - six months later, you read this. And you go, that's it. That's it. And, of course, it's a Western. I've never made a Western before. That's fantastic, you know? Oh, and it's John Ford. It starts in reverse. And I did the John Ford thing. You know, when you make films, you always have to have a eureka moment, I think, when you go, oh, it's that. This is it. This is the film. I know what to do with this. This is great. It's - all those threads that have been unconnected that I've been turning over in my mind for six months or whatever it is, suddenly, this is the way I can tie them together and get a film, you know? The film will answer that question.
Boeing's employees chose the path of profit over candor by concealing material information from the FAA concerning the operation of its 737 MAX airplane and engaging in an effort to cover up their deception, Burns added.

One week after the government put the country in lockdown, health officials stress that they do not expect to see a substantial decline in the number of positive cases until the end of next week, NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports from Rome. After consultations with unions and business leaders, the government has announced a large economic aid package dubbed 'Heal Italy' to help families, workers and industries. It includes suspended tax payments, workers' compensation and export credits.

So she entered the marathon, following all the proper procedures and just, well, neglecting to mention she was female.
GREENGRASS: Well, the reason I made that film, 22 July, was because it was not about Breivik. I mean, he was a central, important character in it. The film was about Norway, as an exemplar, of how a democratic society faced with this menace of white supremacy, how they reacted to this immense threat. You know, I mean, he was a double attack. You know, he blew up the center of government. And then he went and killed the next generation of government leaders when he attacked the youth camp, you know? And it was deliberate. It was an attempt to decapitate the state. That was the whole idea behind it.

Trump's choice to launch that missile strike was a surprise about-face after administration officials appeared to take the heat off Syria's president, Bashar Assad, saying the U.S. would scrap its previous position that Assad could no longer govern. As the world continues watching to see whether Trump's attack was a one-time outing designed to send a message — or the first shot in a new war against Assad's regime — North Korea's regime has new reason for pause.

The lives of millions of people in our region are undergoing radical change. There is quite simply a new reality, Kluge said in a briefing that was held in a U.N. building that has been nearly completely abandoned as workers stay home to practice social distancing. As Kluge spoke, a large bottle of hand sanitizer sat on the table in front of him.
LENZ: Well, that's the conversation that we're having nationally - that people are really coming to terms with how limiting this caucus is, how inaccessible it is for older Americans, Americans with children, Americans with disabilities, Americans who work multiple jobs who can't get time off. And so a lot of Iowans are saying, why can't we just have a primary? But the answer to that is New Hampshire. They would not be happy if we moved from our first-in-the-nation caucuses to a first-in-the-nation primary, which they are. So it's a small, local issue. But it also is reflective of the issues facing the Democratic Party nationwide.
SCHUMER: (As Renee Bennett) Give me your phone. I'm going to give you my number.
There is a huge generational divide: A majority of young people, those aged 18 to 29, see socialism positively and have a dimmer view of capitalism. Older Americans have a more sharply negative view of the term — 41 percent of those aged 30 to 49, 30 percent of those aged 50 to 64 and just 28 percent of those 65 and older view it positively.
SCHUMER: (As Renee Bennett) And this guy just calls out, like, the number completely out of sequence.

Reducing the wealth gap would be a boon to poverty eradication, Oxfam argues.
KELLY: And how old were you?
Cash transfers have also been gaining momentum as a mechanism to reduce poverty. The idea is that recipients know best how to spend the money — whether on meals, school fees, health care or whatever else they need most — to lift themselves out of poverty or keep themselves from falling into it. India, Kenya, Finland and other countries have also been exploring the idea of providing cash stipends for all citizens (or a universal basic income) as a social safety net to reduce inequality. The stipends are usually not enough to live on, but a couple of hundred dollars a month, while pocket change for a millionaire, could mean never missing rent for someone living paycheck to paycheck.

Superdelegates have been hearing from Sanders supporters for months — and it's not always pleasant. Akilah Ross Ensley is with the Young Democrats of America, and she's a superdelegate who plans to support Clinton.

This younger generation, after all, are not Cold War kids. Someone who is 29 was born the year before the fall of the Iron Curtain. The word socialism just doesn't have the same meaning for them as for those who lived through the nearly 50-year, post-World War II arms race with the Soviet Union and the underlying debate over the ideal society.
The Justice Department has announced that it has reached a deferred prosecution agreement with Boeing to resolve a charge of criminal conspiracy to defraud the FAA.
CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Pope Francis told President Trump to stick with the Paris agreement, so did France's newly elected president, Emmanuel Macron. The agreement they're so passionate about sets in motion a global effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that warm the planet. Trump says it's a bad deal for the U.S. economy. Nearly 200 other nations say it's a good deal for the planet. But climate experts point out that emissions in the U.S. are already going down without the Paris deal.
GROSS: You are getting into performing in person now - I mean performing in performance spaces, instead of just on the radio, where you're invisible. And I wonder what it's been like for you to actually, you know, have a body in front of the people who you're talking to. I found myself - that I frequently feel when I meet listeners - that I'm disappointing them, you know, that they've imagined somebody in their mind and that there you are, the real person, and that you're not necessarily going to measure up to who they imagined you were, you know? Do you ever feel that way?

And you had to go. And this is the part of your program No Show in which you talked about that dinner party, which prevented you from producing your program that week.
And you're right. We are in about the 10th year of a global expansion. We're nearing the end of the economic cycle. Investors are on edge. I mean, the music will end at some point, and we will have a recession. And if we have a serious, bruising trade war, that will not be good for the global economy.
Some in the crowd worry about the vetting process for refugees — is it strong enough? Others are more concerned about the cost of refugee resettlement and how it will affect city and school budgets.
It's going to be interesting to see how Democrats walk and define the line when it comes to socialism. The word makes many Americans — and some Democrats, especially older ones — uncomfortable.

Pelosi Vows To Bring Coronavirus Bill To House Floor As Republicans Push For Changes
The Union of European Football Associations is postponing its biggest tournament, Euro 2020, for 12 months because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The competition, which pits national teams against one another, was to have been played in June and July.
But I hate to tell you, America's only elected dogcatcher did not get that same happy ending.
The majority leader also ignored predictable calls from Democrats such as Schumer to allow more than two days for the impeachment managers to make their case.
PEACOCK: I think it's very likely that we'll see new variants emerge. And what we're really watching for are variants that actually are transmissible, but that actually have the ability to escape immunity. So that's either the immunity that's acquired naturally if you have COVID-19 once or immunity that's developed through vaccination. So in particular, looking for combinations of mutations that could allow a virus to be very fit and spread amongst the population, but that could also threaten the efficacy of vaccines.
Under the plan, UEFA playoffs and international friendly matches that had been scheduled for the end of this month will now be played in early June, the league says, although it acknowledged that the dates are subject to further scrutiny.

I had a lot of time to focus on this task, since my wife had moved across the country to Washington, and I was still looking for a job out there. After day two or three, she gently suggested that perhaps the Otis mission had just a little bit to do with the stress of a job search, and I conceded she may have been onto something.
And my name eventually would come up at some point. And they'd say something like he seemed so intelligent, so outgoing on the air. But really he's rather disappointing, don't you think? George was so much funnier. George was so much cleverer. He was so much faster on his feet than Joe Frank was. I mean, did the man say one arresting thing all evening? No, he just sat there listening, laughing at what other people said - trying to avoid the limelight for all he was worth. He's obviously typical of so many performers - shy, neurotically withdrawn.
KELLY DITTMAR: Getting to 50 percent in any one place is something significant. At the same point, this is one legislature out of 50. So we still have a lot of progress left to make across the country.
The federal government executed 10 prisoners last year, more civilian prisoners than all the states combined over the same period. And more executions are scheduled for the final days of the Trump administration before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
No real news there. I've said that I'm going to stay serving as secretary of state so long as President Trump shall have me, Pompeo said.
SABETI: Yeah. I think that the guidelines that we have in place are very good. And they work for most viruses - you know, washing hands and social distancing, wearing masks. The more contagious a virus, the more it means we have to be really regimented about that. And any breaches at all, and you could have mass containment failure. And so it just makes us have to really ante up on those.
I grew up with countless cats in the yard of my parent's home in Canberra, Australia. In the late 1980s, my father, a postman, went broke and the cats became a luxury. Instead of cat food, we gave them scraps of meat from the sheep that Dad slaughtered for halal meat.

I've seen people with opioid-use disorders go through inpatient treatment without medications time and time and time again, without ever being offered alternatives, says Michael Botticelli, director of National Drug Control Policy at the White House. We wouldn't do that with any other disease. If one treatment failed for you, we'd say, let's look at other possible treatment options.
Mehlman added: If the Dems are able to nominate a presidential nominee that appeals to the middle of the country, that's going to be very powerful. But if they go hard left, there is a path for Donald Trump to get re-elected.

The budget process Republicans are using to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate, called reconciliation, has very strict rules that require every piece of the bill to be directly related to the federal budget. It will be up to the Senate parliamentarian, a Republican appointee, to make those determinations.
In fact, several states and territories have chosen to be exempt from daylight saving time, opting instead to follow standard time year-round. Among them are Arizona, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands.
PEACOCK: This virus is actually strikingly different, and it has 23 different mutations. And what concerns us is that some of those mutations are in part of the virus called the spike protein, which is the protein that interacts with humans and attaches to human cells and is part of the entry process into the body. And so this is actually very unusual. But in particular, it has mutations that could change the biology - the way that the virus interacts with humans.

Trump's decision is the starkest break from traditional GOP economic philosophy on trade since taking office. The president has found few GOP allies on Capitol Hill, but Rust Belt Democrats up for re-election this year cheered the administration's decision.

At about a mile and a half into the race, the press truck went by us, and they saw that I was a woman in the race wearing numbers and they began taking pictures. And alongside of the photographer's truck came the officials' press truck. And the race director [Jock Semple] was on the truck and the guys were teasing him. And he got so angry that there was a girl in the race that he stopped the bus and jumped off it and ran after me and attacked me in the race and tried to pull off my bib numbers, screaming at me, 'Get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers.' And I was just blindsided by this. I was terrified. I was scared. And my boyfriend came along with a full streak and gave the official a cross-body block and sent him out of the race instead.

GROSS: The director of News Of The World, Paul Greengrass, started his career as a journalist and documentary filmmaker. He went on to make films based on real events, including terrorist attacks. Captain Phillips was based on the American cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. 22 July was about the terrorist attack in Norway in 2011 by a far-right extremist. United 93 was about the airplane passengers who fought back against the hijackers on 9/11 and died, crashing near Shanksville, Pa. Greengrass also directed three of the blockbuster Jason Bourne movies. News Of The World is in theaters now and will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow.

And U.K. scientists first alerted the world about it in December. In the meantime, we have heard reports of other additional variants found in South Africa and in Japan. So what does this say about the coronavirus' ability to evolve and our ability to fight it?
We've resolved most of our differences and those we haven't, we'll continue the conversation because there will be other bills, she said.
HOROWITZ-GHAZI: A big joke-theft shame campaign like this was relatively new to Instagram, but not to comedy. Chris Sprigman of NYU Law School says that in stand-up comedy, public shaming often works better than a lawsuit for two main reasons. The first is the way that copyright works. It can protect the specific expression or wording of a joke, but not the idea behind it.

Newark Police Camera System Relies On Residents, Stirring Privacy Concerns
Private equity owner Permira is expected to sell at least 25% of the business. The brand, which evolved into a symbol of rebellious youth culture, has continued to thrive during the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Martens sells more than 11 million pairs a year in more than 60 countries.
Back in April, when Louras announced plans to bring in the refugee families, many were surprised. Rutland has never taken in refugees before. The mayor emphasized that helping Syrians was the right thing to do. But he also believes refugees can help solve a problem: Rutland's shrinking population.

Like many other states, West Virginia's public lab is now being bolstered by the testing efforts of commercial laboratories and some hospitals.
In an email, state senators were asked to remain in their offices until they could be tested, Rachel Hubbard of member station KOSU reports from Oklahoma City. That email came one hour after Oklahoma health officials issued an update saying that the number of tests for the public remains limited to the point of rationing and that health care providers are being asked to test for other illnesses such as the flu before requesting a COVID-19 test. These tests are being coordinated with a private lab.
On the other hand, some conservatives in the Senate are ideologically opposed to offering any tax credits. Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Mike Lee, R-Utah; and Rand Paul, R-Ky., have all expressed concerns about the bill being too much like the ACA, with Paul referring to it as Obamacare Lite. They worry that the tax credits amount to a new entitlement.
A woman with low self-esteem hits her head and suddenly sees herself as madly attractive. Critic David Edelstein says I Feel Pretty suggests the notion of what's pretty should be elasticized.
She really wanted to bring the physicality to it, and she really challenged us to challenge her. And so it was a great collaboration. I mean she showed up every day committed to train hard and to put the body mechanics behind it and not just make it sort of window dressing for a fight scene. It's like she's selling every single punch. And I have to say that that's rare. I mean, people come in and there's a little lack of confidence. You're intimidated standing in a room full of stunt people who do it for a living. And she would, you know, get over that and just go to work and has an aptitude for it.
CHANG: So as this pandemic continues to drag on, what else will you be watching for? Like, are you going to be expecting more strains to emerge?
The Obama administration was reluctant to answer questions about travel costs, forcing Judicial Watch to file Freedom of Information requests to get an answer (Secret Service documents show $11,648.17 in security expenses for that trip). So far, the Trump White House hasn't been much more transparent, Fitton says.
Since then, volunteers in town have been active for months, gathering donations and furniture for the new families, taking free Arabic classes and attending seminars on Middle Eastern history and Syrian culture. The local high school is planning a Syrian dinner to help introduce the refugee families to their new community.
President Trump downplayed congressional GOP concerns. I don't think you're going to have a trade war, he said Monday at the White House, where he defended his decision to crack down on imports. People have to understand, our country on trade, has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world whether it's friend or enemy. Everybody.
Esper, for his part, said, I'm fully confident ... the commander-in-chief is not going to give us an illegal order.
MARTIN: What is - what could that possibly look like now? I mean, even as you nod to the positive effect of these charges, where do you begin that larger level of healing and reconciliation to try to address some of those huge issues?
Last February, I drove six hours across the country to deliver Shawareb to Amit in Kibbutz Misgav-Am. Shawareb settled into Amit's tiny apartment. I thought about my life that had taken me across these enemy lands — for me a patchwork region of the Middle East that I loved deeply. Covering its conflict and suffering left me tired and broken hearted. The sun set into a gorgeous sky of pink and orange, and I said goodbye. I left Jerusalem in March.
So he made a decision: He wouldn't accept anyone on it.
DAVID EDELSTEIN, BYLINE: The Internet backlash against the Amy Schumer comedy I Feel Pretty began early, based on the trailer. And it rested on the idea that the movie is about how an ugly woman becomes beautiful. That's an understandable mistake but a mistake nonetheless. It's a funny, deft, in some ways conventional rom-com about a woman with painfully low self-esteem who hits her head and suddenly sees herself as madly attractive. Behaving as if she's the most gorgeous creature on earth might make her an object of hilarity. But her stratospheric sense of self-worth disarms everyone she meets.
Mayor Baraka says Newark is installing signs to let the public and the criminals know they're being watched. And he says that's not so unusual these days, when cameras are in stores and on people's homes.
But he couldn't ignore Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who was among a group of Senate Republicans who insisted that the time be extended.
In fact, I've always thought that of all the elected positions out there, dogcatcher was the one I was best-suited to run for. My campaign platform would center around my proven track record of catching multiple neighborhood dogs.
Finally, through the company Animal Airways, I reached Eytan Kreiner, an Israeli veterinarian. I explained the pickle I was in.
There are several online petitions. One calls for the elimination of superdelegates altogether. Another asks superdelegates to align their choice with regular voters, not party elites, and it has more than 200,000 signatures.
It's true that no one will likely have the 2,383 delegates needed for the nomination strictly out of the pledged delegates. But that's also because that number is a majority of all the voting delegates, which includes superdelegates.

Much of the expense stems from Air Force One 747, which costs around $140,000 per flying hour right now, says Judicial Watch's president, Tom Fitton. The trips typically incur other expenses as well, such as lodging and travel expenses for the Secret Service, and reimbursements for local police.
The House-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. Some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions. UNINSURED RATES: The Congressional Budget Office initially estimated that the House bill would mean the loss of coverage for 24 million people. Many analysts say this number is now likely higher.
GREENE: But there are voters who have said that some of these types of missteps in the campaign have caused them to question. I mean, what do you tell voters who say what's going on here?

LARSEN: With current policy, including everything that states have committed to do and what President Trump has indicated he is likely to roll back, we are on a path to reduce emissions below 2005 levels by about 15 to 17 percent in 2020.
Pak isn't too worried about running out of steam. He sees this as a short-term situation rather than a boom that will change his small business forever.

I Feel Pretty is by leagues Schumer's best film. Her motormouth delivery has a high-wire quality, as if she's babbling for her life. And her pratfalls have a ballerina's precision, probably enhanced by the editor, Tia Nolan. When Renee spontaneously enters a Coney Island bikini contest, the scene could be squirm-inducing. But instead, it's exhilarating because Renee is at home in her body. As the shellacked and baby-voiced mogul Avery LeClaire, Michelle Williams has a lyrical melancholy. She's a smart, educated woman who feels as trapped in her body as Schumer's Renee does in hers and stuck with a voice she's unable to change.
SABETI: It can. And, you know, I think it's very important to do - as the U.K. did - is to be able to scan at high resolution in real time, or near real time. Because if you do identify something like the B117 mutation, and you notice, hey, there's something going on in this part of the country and oh, there's this new variant to pay attention to, we can scan for where that variant is occurring and try to then move our public health resources, which are inherently limited, but to take all the resources we can to stop that variant from going anywhere.
FADEL: Nevada has been leading when it comes to electing women. They are now the majority in the state Supreme Court. The lieutenant governor is a woman. On the federal level, both U.S. senators are women. And half of the state's U.S. representatives are women. Nevada isn't the rule, though. Kelly Dittmar is a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.
Debate continued until nearly 2 a.m. ET Wednesday as Schumer continually offered amendments seeking testimony or material for the trial — and McConnell and Republicans continued to bat them down. The proceedings resume at 1 p.m. ET Wednesday.
The story follows Tony Valdez, a Dispatcher who works operating rooms and ERs murdering patients who are beyond medical help. Because if they die on the operating table, they're just dead, right? But if Tony is there to put a bullet in their brain just before they die, bingo! Second chance. He saves lives by murdering the very-nearly-dead, resetting them to give the doctors a second chance.
French officials on the left and right have denounced the proposal for Jews to remove their yarmulkes. Parliamentarian Xavier Bertrand spoke about it on a popular radio show.
Senator Collins and others raised concerns about the 24 hours of opening statements in 2 days and the admission of the House transcript in the record, her office said in a statement. Her position has been that the trial should follow the [Bill] Clinton model as much as possible. She thinks these changes are a significant improvement.
In 2015, I lived in the Palestinian city of Ramallah in the West Bank. There, one of my roommates brought him home: a stray, mewing, gray-striped fur ball with enormous green eyes. I liked him but I wanted nothing to do with him.

Both of the ride-hailing companies announced the temporary change on Tuesday.
Last month, Araújo tweeted that Brazil would continue to welcome Venezuelan asylum-seekers even when it withdrew from the compact, though it would also focus on the restoration of democracy in Venezuela.
GREENGRASS: (Laughter) Loved it. I used to ride a little bit when I was young, but not now. But Tom was really good on a horse. He was fantastic. But it was - it was thrilling, just what I mean (ph). You know, you go out in the desert, and you see the horses and the wagons and, you know, the way people dressed. And you're in the West. And it's mythic, and it's part of your boyish imagination, you know?
It could be argued that any budgetary effects of the waiver are 'merely incidental,'  said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget in a blog post.

Trump has so far appeared to set a record for weekend travel, regularly shuttling back and forth between Washington and Florida.
Congress technically has legislative options to counter Trump's tariffs if he moves ahead with them despite opposition, but it would require a somewhat extraordinary move on the part of Republicans to craft legislation cracking down on their own president in an election year. Republicans would also likely need vetoproof majorities in both chambers to have any effect. And any legislative move would also upend orthodoxy on trade policy, which is generally enacted with the view that the president should be given latitude to manage international trade.
FRANK: Oh, yeah. As a matter of fact, by using those experiences for radio programs, you transcend them. You almost look for bad experiences or painful experiences. Whatever tragedies might befall you, you can always, right away, think, well, that would make a great story for radio. And so that whatever happens, even if it has a great negative content, even if it's painful - because you can then tell it on the radio and share it with many listeners and move people or entertain people, it then takes on a positive value.
CASTRO: Well, I think that it's an approach from different angles. Right? It's an approach in Congress, trying to pass legislation. And then you Xavier Becerra and 16 other attorneys general in other states who have filed suit. So yeah, I mean, we fundamentally disagree with a president doing something that no president has ever done before, which is to call a national emergency to try to deliver on a campaign promise that he said another country was going to pay for it. Nobody's ever done that before. So yes, we're going to do everything that we can in Congress and in the courts. And I hope that the American people continue to speak up.
 'You'll never have children,' they said. 'You're going to get big legs. You're going to grow hair on your chest.' It was hilarious, the myths.
Hopefully, we won't have to talk next year, he told me, because we'll have solved global extreme inequality!
What did I think when I watched it? The last film I made was 22 July about Anders Breivik, who's a right-wing terrorist in Norway who attacked the government and the young Labour group as well. You know, it was an attempt to decapitate the state. The reason I made that film was because Breivik, Anders Breivik, is a very important figure in the growth of the far-right, both in America and in the U.K. and across Europe, because he's seen as a standard-bearer. If you look at Charlottesville, all that trouble, a lot of the language that was being used by the white supremacists was Breivik's words from Breivik's manifesto - same in some of the other right-wing attacks across Europe. You know, he's a profoundly important figure.

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview I recorded Tuesday with film director Paul Greengrass. His new film News Of The World stars Tom Hanks. It's a Western set in Texas in 1870, five years after the end of the Civil War.

He also directed three Jason Bourne films.
GROSS: I don't doubt it. So you can tell us.
TORRES: When you think about Nevada, we think about the Wild West. And I think in a lot of ways, Nevada still is the Wild West.

First, in Warsaw, Poland, the U.S. organized a conference seeking to marshal international outrage over Iran, and Vice President Pence urged France, Germany and the U.K. to abandon the Iran nuclear deal, accusing them of concocting a scheme to continue to business with Iran.

The book takes place in 1776, during the first months of the Revolutionary War. Independence from Great Britain was far from a fait accompli in those days; indeed, it was considered the longest of shots — the British armed forces were some of the most powerful in the world, while the American army, populated by untrained neophytes, hayseeds, and former criminals, was very much not.

There's no question that that is happening. Some companies are actually engaged in what's called tariff engineering. So if I have a certain good that is hit by tariffs, as it stands now, I could slightly change the way that the good is manufactured so it is actually not covered by tariffs. And there's no question, as the president is actually hoping for, that some companies are reshoring to the United States.

The movie suggests almost no one has the appropriate level of self-esteem. I Feel Pretty can be criticized as too rosy on the grounds that the power of positive thinking can only get us so far. Indeed, it can even reinforce the repressive social norms it claims to challenge. But Renee's positive thinking has such a dizzy, life-affirming charge that she makes you believe if she's not quote, pretty, it's because the definition of pretty is inadequate. It needs to be elasticized or maybe blown to smithereens.

Scientists and doctors say the case is clear: The best way to tackle the country's opioid epidemic is to get more people on medications that have been proven in studies to reduce relapses and, ultimately, overdoses.
GREENGRASS: I think Anders Breivik is a dreadful - dreadful - contemptible human being guilty of the most heinous acts. That said, you mustn't ever misunderstand these people. It was not that they thought - that he felt that the people that he killed were not human. He actually understood - he's a pretty intelligent man, Anders Breivik. What he was - and this is relevant today - was someone who believed that you needed to have a fight, that the battle needed to be waged with violence.
And that, to me, felt inspiring and also was ultimately the reason why I made the film. You know, I wanted to make it because in lots of ways, it's a film about the journey to hope, and that's something that's very important, I think. As the world looks ever more dark, we have to keep our minds fixed, I think, on where the hope is.

He's also become the store's tech guy, figuring out how to fix glitches in the checkout machine software because he doesn't have time to call for support. Meanwhile, his wife is jumping on a cash register to help with the growing lines between a failed bank run (the bank was closed) and a product delivery.

JOYCE: A 10 percent drop in emissions. President Obama promised to cut emissions well over twice that under the Paris agreement. In the end, though, the decision about staying in or leaving the Paris agreement is not just about hitting numerical targets. Hafstead, who's with Resources for the Future, says what the U.S. does sends a message to the rest of the world.

Pressley said she believes there was a very significant flashpoint in the debate over capital punishment when the Justice Department proceeded last month with the execution of Brandon Bernard. Bernard spent more than half of his life on death row for a crime committed when he was 18. In the final days of his life, he pleaded with President Trump to grant him clemency, and his case drew high-profile attention.
Today, that stance is threatening the group home and his business. Now we've been told by clinical settings that we're essentially blacklisted, that they can't even mention our program if we won't take people on opiates, on Suboxone, Lidz says.

Still, Kim said Pyongyang had unilaterally halted nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests in order to build confidence with the U.S. And he appeared to leave the door open for concessions and further talks.
Kim Jong Un will have to stage some anger at the U.S. and chastise them for ignoring his year end deadline, Park predicts, but could be willing to return to the negotiating table by summer if the U.S. shows signs of accommodating Pyongyang.
Methadone and buprenorphine have been tested in scores of clinical trials. Researchers have found that when combined with counseling, they significantly reduce opioid use and keep people in treatment longer.
In the new film Atomic Blonde, British agent Lorraine Broughton (Charlize Theron) shows up in 1989 Berlin and gets a very violent reception. The film shows Lorraine punching, stabbing and shooting her way through the murky world of Cold War espionage — not exactly surprising considering Atomic Blonde was directed by former stuntman David Leitch.
The cats were a burden. Dad abandoned a few at the local dump, but let two or three stay. I think he saw how much they meant to me. I didn't have many friends, and I spent my school lunchtimes in the library reading books. At home, the cats were reliable company.
But his shoulders sag as he admits that he worries if the U.S. scales back its refugee programs, Rutland's first two Syrian families could be the last.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: And then there's Sherrod Brown, the populist Democratic senator from Ohio. Even though he's still mulling a run for the presidency, Brown's essentially in campaign mode, visiting key early voting states. He's seen by some as the antidote to Donald Trump's popularity in the Midwest. NPR's Asma Khalid reports from his latest stop in New Hampshire.

And that is common now. That is - the genie is out of the bottle, if I can use that expression. Do you know what I mean? It's like, that is out there in chatrooms, in the dark Web, in the meetings all across the West. And it's a big problem. And if you talk to anybody in law enforcement - FBI, you know, police, MI5 over here on the - you know, in Europe - the growth of the far-right and their desire to give battle is a real - it's a reality. It's a reality, and it has to be dealt with.
I'm traveling across town to a location that's dispensing COVID-19 shots two-trains-and-a-bus-ride away from my home: The Washington Senior Wellness Center. When I logged onto the District's vaccination website to make my appointment in the first hour that doing so was possible, the two dozen closer locations already had no reservations left. This is the first time people over 65 are eligible, and by day's end, all available slots had been snapped up, all across the District.
But for actor Kal Penn, Trump's rhetoric has been damaging to the arts. Penn was appointed by President Obama to the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, an advisory group founded in 1982. He had planned to stay on, but after Trump's handling of the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, he and everyone else on the committee resigned.

Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and the panel's trade subcommittee chairman, David Reichert, R-Wash., have also drafted a letter to the president outlining concerns about new tariffs. They are seeking additional signatures from House Republicans. Aides said lawmakers were hoping to avoid a confrontation with the administration and instead work with the president to enact trade policies the broader GOP can get behind.
It is, in theory, an advantage a president has when he's up for re-election with a locked-down base and no primary opposition — yet. His potential Democratic opponents will have to outflank each other, and that often can mean being the most stridently progressive (or conservative, in GOP primaries).

After the initial thrill of spotting themselves on the phone screen, Carter expresses dread. I'm very, very concerned, she says. People are collecting information on us — who are they sharing it with and what is our power in the situation?
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has argued that a blanket tariff fails to directly punish countries like China for dumping low-cost steel in the American market. Graham said Sunday that Trump would let China off the hook while punishing U.S. companies that sell goods abroad by inviting retaliatory tariffs from other global trading partners. The reason our steel industry has been decimated is because of China dumping, Graham said in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. China produces more steel than the world consumes for several years in a row. China is your problem, Mr. President.
Bolsonaro's decision to leave the agreement follows guarantees the president-elect and his foreign minister made last month, after a polarizing election and runoff.

That line of thinking extends to some people whose mission is to help people in recovery, including David Lidz, a recovering alcoholic, who runs a group home in Hagerstown, Md. The home has 10 beds for men who are transitioning out of intensive drug treatment back into daily life. In addition to beds, Lidz offers the men work with his contracting business, refurbishing houses. The emphasis is on hard work, personal responsibility and purpose. It's what worked for Lidz in his recovery, but even he knows it doesn't work for everyone.

Let me just run through the ways (laughter) - calling up old girlfriends, waking them up because it's 2:30 their time, singing a song they don't know and asking them to sing along and then telling them - leading them to believe that they're the only one that you've called to sing I Remember You to (laughter).
At Tuesday's briefing, Pompeo was also asked about his decision to stay on as secretary of state instead of leaving his post, as he was widely expected to, in order to pursue an open Senate seat in Kansas.
GROSS: You say it shaped your aesthetic. Can you talk a little bit more about how it shaped your aesthetic? And I mean that in two ways. You know, in Five Came Back, you talk about how the war footage that John Ford shot, you can see the film, like, moving out of the sprockets because of all of the impact of the bombs. And you see the camera shaking. Some of the footage looks like it's singed from all the bombs exploding. Just on a film level, he kept that. You know, he - I think he wanted you to see, like, this is an example of even the damage it's doing to the film.
The Democratic proposal, shared first with NPR, comes as the party will have unified control of Congress after victories in two Georgia Senate races, a change in fortunes for Democratic legislative priorities.

GREENGRASS: I did. I did. There's quite an extensive literature, actually, for these children who were kidnapped. It wasn't that unusual. And they were lost children, of course. But, you know, part of a wider landscape of lost people, I think. Pretty much everybody in the movie has - lives in the shadow of the Civil War, lives in the shadow of loss. And their journey, Kidd and this little girl's journey, which begins wordlessly, is ultimately a journey towards finding a place to belong, I suppose, in this new landscape.
Some analysts have suggested that the House amendment sought by conservatives to allow states to waive some of the health law's regulations might run afoul of the Senate's Byrd Rule, which limits what can be included in a budget reconciliation measure.

Methadone and buprenorphine, two of the drugs used for treatment, are themselves opioids.

And then in the new movie, News Of The World, the longest, like, action sequence in it is - it's a shootout between Tom Hanks and three kind of twisted, lost souls who want to basically buy the young girl from Tom Hanks and probably sell her into sexual servitude. But that scene, it's just like a really lo-fi shootout, you know, with Tom Hanks trying to hide behind rocks and use whatever he can as bullets to shoot at these three guys. Can you talk a little bit about, like, the different kinds of action sequences that you've shot, after shooting real combat?

And this character of the lonely newsreader, a character who'd lost everything in the Civil War - all he has is a satchel with some old newspapers.

Despite all that, small suppliers persist in their hope, perhaps simply out of instinct. After all, they built their ideas and products from the ground up through optimism.

They're looking for people to be able to reach across the aisle but also bring people within their own party together to find the common ground to make sure this country goes forward in a positive way. And I think that's the main issue, and that's why you see the people of South Carolina - they know Joe Biden. They know his fallacies. They know his positives.

Sanders caught fire in the 2016 primary race and gave a surprisingly strong challenge to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Sanders didn't prevail, but the boldness of his ideas did.

And in a way, I think what he has is the healing power of storytelling. You know, by telling these stories - the local news, the news of the meningitis epidemics, the federal news, news from far, far away - he draws his audience into a relationship with him. And, you know, I think that telling stories is a healing activity. It draws the storyteller and the audience together.

Trump and some supporters don't only want American forces to defend, for example, an embassy against an attack. They also want the United States to respond to an attack on an embassy farther afield in the Middle East with a strike deep inside Iran, either against a culturally important target or infrastructure such as an oil refinery.

GREENGRASS: Well, that was something that I had decided after I'd done 22 July, you know? I said, I want to make a film that has a happy ending. I want to - you know, not a schmaltzy, sentimental film because I wouldn't - it's not in my sensibility to do that. You know, these things turn around in your mind. It's - I don't know how other filmmakers do it. I can never really sort of go, oh, I need to do a story about X. Or I need to do, you know, a science fiction movie, you know? To me, I sort of dwell on a question, a feeling. And one film, it's like a conversation you have with yourself. And you go, OK, well, I need to find a film with a happy ending. I need to find a film - but that feels earned from this world, you know? And, well, what's that going to be? I don't know. God knows.
I mean, this was the key to Ford in the Battle of Midway. He knew where to go, which is up high, to get those images. Extraordinary - at great risk to himself, of course.

I watched both my parents lose their mothers last year, and it was really interesting because throughout the process of growing up - my parents had me when they were real young, and I listened to all of their grievances and gripes about their mamas. And as soon as those women were gone, it was like all memory of any of that was immediately - had just evaporated. There are people that could criticize the way that we react towards our loved ones when they're gone and say that we make them inhuman or perfect, but then there is, you know, the argument to be made that suddenly we see things for real for the first time.

A third potentially problematic element of the original House bill would allow insurers to charge older adults five times more in premiums than younger adults — up from a ratio of 3 to 1 under the Affordable Care Act.

Former Attorney General William Barr announced in July 2019 that the Justice Department would resume federal executions, ending what had been a nearly two-decade hiatus.

I'm calling on him to use that full authority with the stroke of a pen to halt all federal executions and save lives, Pressley said.

FADEL: And while Nevada's milestone is remarkable, progress around the country has been slow. Right now less than 30 percent of state legislators across the U.S. are women. Less than 25 percent of Congress is female. And the data show the only way to reach gender parity is to nominate more women. The Democrats are doing that. About 70 percent of women state legislators are Democrats. And overall, Republican women lost seats in the last election. And that's because far fewer women were nominated from that party. Jill Tolles, a Republican Nevada Assembly member, says she's working within her party to make sure there's recruiting and mentorship.
Two counts of willful neglect of duty - those are the charges against former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and former Flint, Mich., public works director Howard Croft for their role in the Flint water crisis. The misdemeanor charges carry a punishment of up to $1,000 and up to one year in jail. They come almost seven years after the city of Flint began taking in water from the Flint River in an attempt to save money. The water wasn't properly treated. It corroded the city's aging pipes, causing lead to leach into the drinking water. More than 100,000 Flint residents were exposed to unsafe levels of lead. LaTricea Adams is a community activist in Flint. This was her reaction to the charges against Snyder and Croft.

Boeing admits to criminal misconduct for misleading regulators about the safety of the troubled jetliner, but the airplane manufacturer is not pleading guilty to the charge. If Boeing complies with the terms of the settlement, in three years the government will drop the criminal charge. That's important for Boeing, a huge federal defense contractor, because a criminal conviction would prohibit the company from getting future government contracts.
That diverges from the country overall, as only slightly more than a third (37 percent) of Americans have a positive view of socialism. Socialism also rates lowest when people are asked about it in a list that includes small business, entrepreneurs, free enterprise, capitalism, big business and even the federal government. Since Trump's election, however, socialism is the only one on that list to gain popularity.

But it is not a consensus position in the party. Some moderates support the current program, especially for children and people with disabilities. In addition, many GOP governors took the federal government's offer in the ACA of near-complete federal funding to expand Medicaid to nondisabled, working-age adults, and they are worried about the impact on their residents and their budgets if the expansion goes away and the program's funding is restricted.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Arthur) What you're suggesting is bizarre.
GREENGRASS: The newsreaders, really, have a gospel route. In my country, they would have been the Methodist preachers, the nonconformist preachers who weren't allowed to preach in the churches but went out into the town squares and brought the good news. And of course, that - later after the American Revolution, they were a feature of American life, too. And of course, what starts as bringing the good news becomes bringing the news, you know. And they would leaven their gospel stories with local news, and so it became, steadily, the news.

For me it was really to try to take the [spy movie] genre and give it a different spin. I feel it needed to be dusted off, or at least try to push the boundaries a little bit. I think the infusion of music, the infusion of the type of martial arts action took it in a different direction.
According to the Department of Transportation, which oversees the observance of daylight saving time, the Uniform Time Act of 1966 established the practice of switching clocks as we know it today. The DOT says moving the clock forward by an hour saves energy by providing an extra hour of sunlight in the evening, thus reducing the need to use household electricity for lighting. The agency says that it also prevents traffic injuries because more people are commuting during the daylight and that it helps cut crime because more people are out conducting their affairs during the daylight rather than at night, when more crime occurs.
We hear people say our children are leaving because there are no jobs here, Jepson says. But we need to change that narrative — because there are jobs here.
Schumer didn't conceive I Feel Pretty. It was written and directed by the team of Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein. But it fits into her TV show Inside Amy Schumer's history of challenging men on their caveman aesthetic and those women who feel they have no choice but to accept male definitions of beauty. Along with Lena Dunham, Schumer has been on the front lines, as Twitter jackasses have argued that a woman who looks like her shouldn't even have her own show, a criticism she transformed into an ingenious parody of 12 Angry Men in which a jury of overentitled male dweebs debated her hotness.

He's made several theatrical films based on real events, including terrorist attacks. His films include United 93 and Captain Phillips. His movie 22 July was based on the terrorist attack in Norway by the far-right extremist Anders Breivik. Greengrass also made three Jason Bourne movies. His new movie, News Of The World, stars Tom Hanks. It's a Western set five years after the Civil War.

And in that case, I don't feel that particular experience because I do a performance which is similar to the radio programs that I present. And the audience seems to enjoy it. But it's not how attractive you are. It's simply that people have a preconceived notion somehow of what you look like based on this voice that they've been listening to maybe for years. And whatever you look like, it's not going to be what they they've imagined.

HANNA-ATTISHA: Absolutely. So, you know, so many people ask me, like, who do you want in jail or who should go to jail? And there's not one villain. There's not 10 villains. There's many villains. And this is what I say in my book. I say there are lots of villains in this story. A disaster of this scale does not happen completely by accident. Many people stopped caring about Flint and Flint's kids. Many people looked the other way. People in power made tragic and terrible choices, then collectively and ineptly tried to cover up their mistakes. While charges have been brought against some of the individuals who are culpable, the real villains are harder to see because the real villains live underneath the behavior and drive it. The real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism and even laissez faire neoliberal capitalism. And these are the villains that we don't usually notice and don't want to, and these are the villains that poison Flint with policy. And I hope one day we can go after these systemic villains and bring forth justice.
And, by the way, I felt very strongly that that was a process, by the way that, necessarily, always would happen. And you see it in, you know, newspapers and in television and in documentaries and in books. What does this mean? But I felt that cinema has to be part of that conversation, too. The question is, how do you do it with discretion with dignity and in the right way?
The superdelegate system is rigged to protect establishment politicians and shut down populism, Thayer said. Superdelegates, by their very nature, diminish the value of the vote by giving an elite constituency of representatives, party leaders, and even lobbyists extra power. The Superdelegate List exists to help voters challenge this undemocratic system. Contacting our elected representatives and party leaders and holding them to account is an American tradition. This is the only way to keep the voter base from being patronized or ignored.
FRANK: No. I think I've been caught in a paradox, really, because in order to be able to create compelling radio programs, you have to have some experiences to base, you know, those programs on.

And so I decided since I had to go on the air, and there was no way of avoiding it, that I would simply explain to my listening audience why I had no show prepared.

SABETI: The U.S. is very equipped to detect these kinds of mutations, and they have been doing across the board. The difference between the U.K. and the U.S. in this instance is the U.K., on a national level, really put down a lot of funds and support and made this a priority whereas - I'll say that my colleagues and I here in the U.S., most of this work is done on our discretionary funds, on very limited budgets. And so we're very poised and doing a lot of great and exciting sequencing across the U.S., but not at the level and the scale that's needed. And so we've been calling for some time - for many, many years - to have national funding to scale this up. We're poised and able to do it. Literally, it's just about getting more sequences through the pipeline, which is more funding and support and prioritization of the need.

I was compulsively eating the crackers and the cheeses and drinking wine - wishing that I could wake up from this dream, be back alone in my hotel room. But I was also thinking, this is good for you. This is good for you. Get out. Meet people. You could learn something. This will be nourishing. Maybe you can get some good material out of it.
HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The other big reason is economic. It costs money to register the copyright for a given joke, and even more to hire a lawyer to enforce the copyright. It's rarely worth it.

Oh, yeah. I love people so much, you know? I love people that don't think the same way I think. And I do want to hold out my hand and be joined to other people that are different than me at the end of the day.

This is taking 'See something, say something' to a whole 'nother level, says Steve Surfaro, who visits Newark often for work. Surfaro is an official with the Security Industry Association, a trade group that represents companies that build security and surveillance systems.
The end of speech was greeted with short, muted applause.
Ohio's initial announcement came at roughly the same time that President Trump was laying out new guidelines for Americans that include avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people for the rest of the month.
STEVE SISOLAK: Tonight we are joined by the newly elected and appointed women who took a leap this past year and, together, made history.
You've studied the work of John Ford, who did a lot of Westerns, including The Searchers and My Darling Clementine, She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. You not only studied his work; you talked about him in the documentary series Five Came Back, which is adapted from a book by the same name. And it was about five directors, including Ford, who during World War II basically joined the military and did documentary films about battles as they were happening. For Ford, that included the Battle of Midway and D-Day. Like, he was there shooting footage from D-Day.
Trump tried to take a similar line with reporters at the White House but still make it clear that he is prepared to attack targets inside the Islamic Republic.
Despite all of that, LaCourt became a high school football star and Boston College offered him a full scholarship. But then he shot and wounded a man, ended up in jail and lost the chance to go to college. When he came out, he went back to selling drugs again, was arrested and sent back to prison for 3 1/2 more years. LaCourt says he felt trapped in a system that offered no way out.
The Munich Security Conference report said the Trump administration displays an irritating enthusiasm for strongmen across the globe and disdain for international institutions and agreements.
The governor ordered the closure of bars and restaurants, while still allowing carry-out and drive-through service to continue. He also mandated the closure of the state's casinos.

KHALID: Brown and his supporters will often point out that he's been talking about unfair trade deals and working class wages long before Donald Trump entered the political arena.
The boot, which became a counterculture style icon in the 1960s, was created in 1945 by a former German soldier, Dr. Klaus Maertens. According to the company's official history, he designed a prototype with an air-cushioned sole to help his broken foot heal. Larger-scale production began two years later, and, because of its comfort, the company says, the shoe was initially popular with older women.
Under the terms of the deal, Boeing will pay a criminal penalty of $243.6 million, which is less than 10% of the $2.5 billion settlement. Most of the rest, $1.7 billion, will go to airlines that purchased 737 Max planes to compensate them for lost revenue during a lengthy grounding of the aircraft type while the cause of the crashes was investigated. Another $500 million will be paid into a fund to help compensate the families of those who were killed in the crashes.
CASTRO: I think the administration has to be careful not to be too heavy-handed given the United States' involvement in Latin America in the past. Ultimately, the people of Venezuela have to be able to choose who their leader is. But I think there's two things that need to happen immediately. First, we need to make sure that that humanitarian aid gets into the country because there's so many people who are starving and suffering. The second thing is that the United States Congress should move right away and the president should move right away to offer temporary protected status to the people of Venezuela to be able to come here to the United States at least temporarily if they need to.
Now, they were under lockdown restrictions. And strangely, in other parts of the country, that same lockdown was controlling the disease very well. But in the south of England, it wasn't managing to control spread of the infection. And so at that point during the investigation - the outbreak investigation - it became very apparent this was associated with this new variant, which contained a large number of mutations, which we hadn't seen before. And that's what really set it off.
Sixty-two cameras are already in operation. By January, there will be 300 cameras — that anyone, anywhere can watch — like Adam Schwartz. He's a senior lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties nonprofit in California.

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded Tuesday with Paul Greengrass, who directed the new film News Of The World, starring Tom Hanks. It will be available on premium video on demand starting tomorrow. Greengrass started his career as a journalist and documentary filmmaker and went on to direct theatrical films based on real events. Captain Phillips, which also starred Tom Hanks, was based on the American cargo ship hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009. 22 July was about a 2011 terrorist attack by a far-right extremist in Norway. And United 93 was about the airplane passengers who fought back against the hijackers on 9/11 and died crashing near Shanksville, Pa. Greengrass has also directed three of the blockbuster Jason Bourne movies.
After Attack, An Uproar Over A Call For French Jews To Quit Wearing Yarmulkes
GROSS: So you had to study, like, who he was and, you know, what he believed, what the manifesto was. What are some of the things that you started to believe about how somebody comes to believe lies, how somebody comes to believe that certain people are less than human, that certain people are worthy of being killed and how, like, the truth, reality, is incapable of talking them out of it? Because that question is so relevant to right now.
At some point we want to get out, he said. But this isn't the right point. The other thing is, if we do get out, we've spent a tremendous amount of money on building airports and building one of the largest embassies we have in the world. And we want to be reimbursed to the various costs that we have had. They're very significant ... We don't want to be there forever.
Democratic Sen. Doug Jones Endorses Former Vice President Joe Biden
And I brought that to the Bourne movies, too, by the way. You know, I think one of the reasons why young people particularly liked the Bourne movies is because it was one of the first kind of movies that brought that kind - those kinds of images into the mainstream because that's what kids were used to. They were using - beginning to use their mobile phones and have all sorts of rough and raw and ready verite images, and that was their language. And Bourne, I think, just brought that language into the mainstream of Hollywood cinema. Now it's much more normal to see it.
DOUG JONES: Well, I've known Joe for a long time - I mean, 40 years. I first met him as a law student here in Birmingham about - gosh, it was in I think 1978. And I've just - he struck me then as someone who would make a great president. He's the kind of leader that I think the country needs, someone that has incredible domestic policy experience but also foreign policy experience and the kind of leader who brings people together to try to actually get things done.
Anybody here believe that? Pompeo asked sarcastically.
The Sanders campaign still has its focus on winning as many pledged delegates as possible in the states still yet to vote, like New York, Pennsylvania and California and the campaign is trying to direct supporters looking to help to volunteering or organizing in those states. In fact the campaign's website lists hundreds of organizing events, many posted by volunteers, but the campaign has moved to remove any events related to reaching out to superdelegates.
Zvi Ammar, head of Marseille's 60,000-strong Jewish community, suggested it might be better if Jews in Marseille stopped wearing the yarmulke, also known as a kippah.
But all this freelance lobbying may be unnecessary. It has been the tradition of superdelegates, even in contentious primaries, to ultimately vote at the convention for the candidate with the most popular votes and pledged delegates.

When Bernie Sanders took the stage Sunday night in Madison, Wis., the crowd of about 5,000 went wild. One of the biggest applause lines came when Sanders talked about his campaign taking on the establishment.
Under the plan he is proposing, absentee voting would be allowed to continue until June 2, and all votes that have already been cast would be counted as normal.
It's The Senate's Turn House passage of the American Health Care Act is just a first step. As this measure moves to the Senate, it will face a new set of political and policy challenges. Among them: MEDICAID: The House-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. Some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions.
Stumo dismisses the notion that only a couple of employees were responsible for misconduct in the rushed development of what was Boeing's most profitable commercial airliner in the history of the company.
And stars that fell... (Singing) And stars that fell...
We're dealing with Democrats in Congress, we'll see what can be done, Trump said during an exchange with reporters Thursday at the White House. He said Democrats had included goodies in their bill that have nothing to do with what we're talking about. He did not give details.
Staff are exhibiting signs of stress, says Eleanor Gease, Each Peach's general manager. They're interacting with hundreds of people a day.

Ai said pressure from his supporters had pressured Lego to change its policy on bulk orders, and he told The Associated Press that it was a good move:
Where are you? he asked. Ramallah, I answered. Oy vey, he responded.
The people are giving, again and again. In March, Sanders raised $44 million.
CARLILE: Oh, yes, just somehow you're just sticky. I don't know why.
KHALID: His wife is Connie Schultz, the spunky, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who introduced him at this event. She's got her own fan base among progressives. One of the things you hear from people who've supported Brown for a long time is that he is the real deal. And that's how Helms felt after hearing him.
I remember, too, what distant bells... (Singing) I remember, too, what distant bells...
GREENGRASS: The struggle to create and capture the image, the drama of the experience of the Battle of Midway. That's at the heart of it, and it's at the heart of all news reportage when you get down to it. What did we see last week? Some cameras followed that mob into the Capitol building, and you saw those men and women struggling to capture those images in order to bring them to us. Your job is to move towards the trouble. That's what you have to do. And the best of those, they have an instinct to where to go.
That back and forth continued on the campaign trail in New Hampshire on Friday. During a stop at a weapons factory in Newport, Rubio was presented with a hunting rifle before addressing a room full of plant workers.
UNIDENTIFIED ACTRESS #2: (As Eleanor) Arthur, I've been thinking.
We're trying to feed the world, and everyone else is trying to figure out how to survive, says Scott Nash, the owner of the Mom's Organic Market grocery stores that dot the Washington region.
What we're trying to do, is really compile and organize all of this to give us an opportunity to stay ahead of some the violence and crime in the city, Baraka says.
I don't know how to explain it because I've been in meetings with him on trade, Thune told reporters. Everybody's been very clear that we think some of the decisions that they're talking about making and policies they're talking about implementing would be very harmful to the economy at a time when it's really taking off.
Congress is not ruling out possible legislative action to counter Trump's actions, although party leaders have no immediate plans to act if the president moves forward this week as stated with imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.
And unfortunately, when we hear all these narrative of the importance of wall and sending out criminals and protecting us from crime and all these ugly people that are coming, I realize that they're failing to see a part of the immigration reality that we see on a daily basis - people who are just like us, who are suffering and hurting and in need of great help. I believe what our Holy Father speaks to us about - the importance of building bridges and not walls.
Voices From The Southern Border: Perspectives Of Those Who Live And Work There Every Day
Democrats push immediate aid; GOP says it will take too long
She's a former producer for WBUR/NPR's On Point and was a 2018 Environmental Reporting Fellow with The GroundTruth Project at WCAI in Cape Cod, covering the human impact on climate change. As a freelance audio and digital reporter, Huang's stories on the environment, arts and culture have been featured on NPR, the BBC and PRI's The World.
Ramachandran says she is not sure that just addressing inequality is the solution to poverty and that a lot of pieces have to work together for poverty to disappear, including a functioning government that uses tax revenue appropriately and institutions that deliver health care, education, water, electricity and services. The Oxfam report agrees that funding of public services — especially ones that protect and empower women and girls — is crucial to reducing inequality.
That's why the bill does not wipe away all the ACA's private insurance regulations, including the requirement that insurers not discriminate against customers who have pre-existing health conditions.
It's all very official in Scalzi's world. Tony went to school for this — he's a government employee, works with the insurance companies, does a lot of paperwork. But then one day a friend of his, another Dispatcher who may or may not be involved in some shady side-gigs, goes missing, and we're off to the races. There's a police officer, lots of conversations at hot dog stands and Greek diners, the questioning of a grieving spouse (with whom Tony has a history), and some dealings with rich men and mobsters. Like I said, hurfancy with a side of gumshoe. And that is amusing, at least for a bit.
Back at the farmers market, Josh Squire wraps up a sale at his vegetable stand. The 32-year-old farmer moved to Rutland from Delaware, which he describes as much more culturally diverse. Rutland, he says, would benefit from more diversity.
Trump's fate in this phase of impeachment — whether he's convicted or acquitted — will have greater value if Americans believe that the president truly underwent a full and fair trial, Schiff said.
AMY: Oh, well, glad I'm so sleepy.
CHANG: So Dr. Peacock, let's just start with you. You know, it was your team that helped track down this new COVID variant. Can you just explain - how did you first figure out that you found something new?
THERON FRANCISCO: My name is Theron Francisco. I am a Border Patrol agent here in San Diego. In San Diego, we're seeing a pretty big increase in the amount of family units we're apprehending and the amount of unaccompanied children. We are averaging about 154 arrests per day just in San Diego. We agree with needing a wall.
That means the Navy can't change the conversation by hitting North Korea with a few cruise missiles the way it did in Syria. North and South Korea have tens of thousands of troops and huge arsenals pointed at each other on each side of the demilitarized zone that separates them. Occasional flare-ups since the armistice in 1953 have claimed some lives, but the peninsula hasn't seen major combat.
For example, analysts have suggested that the GOP replacement for the much disliked individual mandate requiring most people to have insurance or pay a fine might not pass Byrd Rule scrutiny either. That's because the 30 percent premium penalty that people with a lapse in insurance would have to pay under the bill would go to the insurance company, not the federal government, so it would have no budget impact.
That's immoral, I thought. If I did it myself, it would be about half the cost.
We are convinced that Brazil has a much larger role to play in the world than the one we currently attribute to ourselves, Araújo wrote.
Lego Says It Is Changing Its Policy After Ai Weiwei Controversy
The small-donors movement has been going on for a while now, Azari says. Obama also talked a lot about that in 2008. I don't know that Sanders has caused that so much as he's coming in at a time where that narrative seems to be pretty popular.
SCHUMER: (As Renee Bennett) You don't hang out in a lot of dry cleaners and hit on perfect girls? That's - wow. All right. Give me your phone.
And it turned out he was fine. He'd just gone to a friend's. And he was blissfully unaware and had his phone off. But we were the lucky ones. Some people weren't lucky. And I remember when the shock of - I went to the office and said, I - I had thought about that I had wanted to address 9/11 in a film, but not really knowing quite how because it was the central event in our world. It was driving. It was clear - it was going to drive all our politics. Everything was going to change. And, you know, I wanted to find a way of addressing it.
NPR's Ailsa Chang talks with biologists Pardis Sabeti and Sharon Peacock about how genomic sequencing was used in the U.K. to trace a new coronavirus variant and what the U.S. can learn from it.
As the two chairmen have reinforced, the administration and Congress must work together on trade policies that build off the momentum of the president's tax cuts, which is why any tariffs should be narrow, targeted, and focused on addressing unfairly traded products, without disrupting the flow of fairly traded products for American businesses and consumers, Lauren Aronson, a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement.
The U.S.-led liberal world order is falling apart, according to the organizers of a gathering of world leaders and defense chiefs in Germany that has met annually since the Cold War.

The virus affected Capitol Hill directly as a staffer to Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., became the first known confirmed case of coronavirus on the campus. The aide has been in isolation since developing symptoms, and Cantwell closed her office for cleaning, according to a statement. The aide had no known contact with the senator or other members of Congress, the statement released Wednesday evening said.
And obviously, they weren't anything like in scale, you know, World War II. But the same principles apply if you see, you know, planes coming in - you get down and, you know, do the best you can. It was a young man's occupation. But it marked me, of course. Any exposure to reality in film profoundly shapes you. It's profoundly shaped my life. It's profoundly shaped my aesthetic. It's profoundly shaped what I'm interested in.
It stems from a decision billed as a way to save money and only supposed to be a temporary fix while officials built a pipeline to nearby Lake Huron. But it turned out to be costly, both in lives lost and in a settlement worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

JOE FRANK: Well, I agree with you entirely about radio drama. And I've never been able to listen to radio drama and believe in the credibility of the performances. And I'm always distanced from it, and it does seem artificial to me. And so the approach that I've taken in all the dramas that I've created is that in fact they're not written. It's not accurate to say it was written by Joe Frank because these are improvisations performed by actors, which are very carefully directed. And what this involves is a great deal of editing because you do a lot of - you create a lot of tape. You create a lot of - you do the telephone calls over and over again. And then I edit them in such a way that I hope creates a credible performance.
The airline had to be cat-friendly. The third-country airport had to process Shawareb quickly. We settled on Bangkok.
LENZ: Yeah. So because I am an opinion columnist, I am allowed to caucus. And I will be going to caucus. I do have two small children. But I'm also divorced. We have 50/50 custody. And my partner is a Republican, and they have a very polite primary. So he will be taking the kids for the night. And I'll be caucusing and then working all night. So it works out for us. But I would like it to work out for every woman in America.
Just about all of the trainers have done significant time in jail. They've shot people and been shot at. Dan Royal grew up in Boston and was 11 the first time he was arrested on a shooting charge.
KELLY: You write about the process of becoming a mother and how that changed you. It's another song called The Mother on here. Let me - I wonder if we can hear a little bit of that.
And as I say, I loved it. I loved the experience of making it. It was physically demanding as a film. You know, it was a lot of heat and dust and freezing cold at night and climbing. I mean, that shootout when we had to climb up that bluff, it was - took two hours to get the crew up there. And you had to go up on ropes. And then there were rattlesnakes around the place, you know, and we had to have wranglers. You know, it was - but the adventure of it, I think, really brought people together. I think people loved that about it, you know?
SCHUMER: (As Renee Bennett) Don't chicken out now.
Defense of national sovereignty was one of our campaign's banners and it will be a priority of our government, he wrote. The Brazilians and immigrants who live here will be safer under rules that we ourselves make, without external pressure.
Those five arrests came as the militants were traveling to a planned meeting with community members — a drive of more than an hour and a half, Sepulvado reports. They encountered a traffic stop at which Bundy and others were taken into custody.

But the defense secretary, his colleagues and the president all said they believed they had done their duty to protect Americans and now Iran has an opening to step back from violence and opt for a return to the negotiating table.
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who specializes in product liability law and who has reviewed the deferred prosecution agreement, said: There's some really damning language in there about sacrificing safety, you know, for profit, basically, and that's troubling.
Most Palestinian residents of the West Bank can only enter Jerusalem with hard-to-obtain Israeli military permits. Here I was, cavorting about with a cat, no less, for a follow-up at the vet. I felt silly. It wasn't lost on me that my Ramallah street cat may have more freedom of movement than the area's human residents.
In the wake of the arrests, police sharply boosted their presence around the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Ore. At least 10 people are still believed to be occupying federal property, John Sepulvado of Oregon Public Broadcasting tells NPR's Morning Edition.
HANNA-ATTISHA: It's a bit of disbelief. It's been so long. And for so many people in Flint, this justice delayed really felt like justice denied, that there was never going to be this level of accountability. And as a physician in Flint, I never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. There was these criminal cases and civil cases. And as I began to practice more in Flint and interact with the families of Flint, I began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. Because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never close, and it stays open and open and open. And it's been open for about seven years. And having some level of justice is like a salve. It helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.

JONES: Well, I think he overcomes it by continuing to move forward with the momentum that he's got. This is a delegate count number right now. This field is going to winnow down, and I think as Joe Biden goes forward, if you look at the states that are beyond Super Tuesday, those are also going to be very good delegate rich states for Joe Biden. This race is far from over. I think, unfortunately, folks in the media, with all due respect, have anointed four or five different people now as who is going to be the eventual Democratic nominee. We've had, like, four contests, but this race is still fluid. Yeah, Senator Sanders is going to probably have a delegate lead, but if you look at the totality of the circumstances and where the votes for the Democrats have been throughout this season, I think that they're going to all coalesce in my opinion - and it is strictly that, my opinion - around Joe Biden ultimately.

When we went for a follow-up, demonstrations had broken out through the West Bank. The main Israeli military checkpoint was closed as soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at masked youths hurling rocks and flaming bottles. I tried to leave through another checkpoint. Masked young men burning tires on the road stopped me.
As Republicans have been vowing for years, the House-passed bill would defund Planned Parenthood, although only for a year. That's likely because a permanent defunding would actually cost the federal government more money, according to the CBO, as some women who lose access to birth control would become pregnant, have babies and qualify for Medicaid. Birth control is vastly cheaper than health care for mothers and babies.
Business has doubled at all Mom's locations over the past five days. Nash says the increase is due to restaurants in D.C., Maryland, and other states shutting down to slow the spread of coronavirus, and chain grocery stores' struggles with empty shelves and massive lines.
TOLLES: We were able to come together over the areas where we share common ground and be able to advance some access to women's health care, like breast cancer screenings and access to birth control.
It began with a simple idea: provide a safe place in Boston where ex-cons and former gang members can work out, find support and maybe even get a job.

We're going to see, I think, probably the stock market take a hit. I think that if there is a total collapse of talks, if we were to see Liu He walk out of the White House today in a storm...
Instead, the customers will be asked to make it clear — if they intend to display their LEGO creations in public — that the LEGO Group does not support or endorse the specific projects.
On one hand, even with the additional $85 billion added by House leaders to help older people pay for their insurance premiums, many moderates feel the age-based tax credits in the bill replacing those in the Affordable Care Act are too small, particularly for people in their 50s and early 60s. The CBO estimated that under the original version of the House bill, premiums for a 64-year-old with an income of $26,000 a year could rise from $1,700 currently to more than $14,000.
FRANK: Oh, absolutely. But I feel that way when listeners come by the radio station - those avid, slavering, salivating fans with their eyes brightly shining. And they're looking for you.
